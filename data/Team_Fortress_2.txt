review: One of the best free-to-play game out there and one of the best multiplayer experiences! Incredibly well balanced and very fun, especially when exploring the abilities of each class. Both the co-op and the versus modes are incredibly fun and unique in their one way. I highly recommend it! Edit: I disagree with those saying the game is pay to win: all weapons can be found in game through playing. The only items that cannot be found with a free to play account are cosmetics such as hats and accessories

review: You can role-play an obese russian hat hoarder who has mental issue from his psychopathic war experiences. He has a speach impairment and can't prenounce sandwich and calls it "sandvich" whenever he eat 1 of his 12 a day. Also a crazy nazi scientist who is still mad about WW2 follows you around with a gun-thing that I'm sure gives you testicular cancer. 10/10 would recommend.

review: This is a well made, stylized, team based first person shooter. Teamwork is needed to win at higher levels of play, though lone wolfing is fine on lower skill levels such as on most public servers. There are 9 classes to choose from. Each class has unique weapons and abilities that allow each to fulfill a unique roll as part of a larger team. This provides for a challenging and rewarding experience when faced against opponents of similar or better skill levels. The game has an active dev team that continues to release updates to the game that add new content such as weapons or game modes. At the time of this review, there are two official modes of play: player versus player and 'Mann Versus Machine'. Player versus player is a mode where one team of players battles against another team of players. Within this mode, there are different types of maps. Each type of map has it's own objective or objectives for each team to achieve. 'Mann Versus Machine' is a mode where a team of up to 6 players battles against waves of bots. Players collect money from destroyed bots. The money is divided equally among players in the team and can be used to purchase upgrades and abilities for the next wave of bots. The pay to play sub-mode, "Mann Up", gives rewards upon completing a "tour". In addition to the official modes of play, there are several player made mods that introduce other modes of play such as 'Versus Saxton Hale', where a team of players battles against a player playing as a character named Saxton Hale; 'Dodge Ball', where two teams of players playing as Pyros must airblast rockets and other projectiles back and forth in order to stay alive; 'Zombie Mod', where a team of players must make it to the end of the map without dying to zombies that are played by other players; to name just a few of the many player made mods available. In addition to game play, players will randomly receive free items from the game. Some of the free items given out are weapons, hats and crates. Hats can be worn by a class to change the appearance of that class. Crates can be opened with a key. Keys can be purchased from the Mann Co Store or from the Steam Community Market or traded for from another player. Most crates will list which items can be found within them. The game has several communities for a player to choose from if a community is what you are looking for. The game is easy to pick up and play, either alone or with friends, yet has a depth of play that will keep you from becoming bored too quickly. The dynamics between the different classes, weapons, play styles, skill levels, modes and maps provides content for many hours of play. I have been playing since November 2007 and I still return to the game on a regular basis.

review: Uh Not too sure what to write here so heres a recipe for Pancakes instead Ingredients: 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 3 tablespoons sugar 1 tablespoon baking powder 1/4 teaspoon salt 1/8 teaspoon freshly ground nutmeg 2 large eggs, at room temperature 1 1/4 cups milk, at room temperature 1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, plus more as needed Now to make it 1. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and nutmeg. 2. In another bowl, beat the eggs and then whisk in the milk and vanilla. 3. Melt the butter in a large cast iron skillet or griddle over medium heat. 4. Whisk the butter into the milk mixture. Add the wet ingredients to the flour mixture, and whisk until a thick batter is just formed 5. Keeping the skillet at medium heat, ladle about 1/4 cup of the batter onto the skillet, to make a pancake. Make 1 or 2 more pancakes, taking care to keep them evenly spaced apart. Cook, until bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, and the undersides are golden brown, about 2 minutes. Flip with a spatula and cook about 1 minute more on the second side. Serve immediately or transfer to a platter and cover loosely with foil to keep warm. Repeat with the remaining batter, adding more butter to the skillet as needed. 6. Procedure for adding fruit to pancakes: Once the bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, scatter the surface with sliced or diced fruit, or chocolate chips, nuts, etc. Flip with a spatula and cook for 1 minute more, being careful not to burn toppings.

review: I was only 10 years old. I loved TF2 so much, I had almost all the weapons I wanted. I would leave my computer on for hours, Just to get a few drops. Then I got my first hat, The gibus. Suddenly everything changed. I no longer cared about playing for fun, I only cared about the 'hats' I "borrowed" my mommys credit card and bought more hats. I had so many hats, I loved them all. But then someone traded me, I accepted. They offered an Unusual for all my hats. It was so sexy looking, I put up all my hats and traded. But no Unusual, He scammed me. I lost it all. I was so sad I cried for hours. Later that night I prayed to Gaben for my hats back. I went to bed after praying. I felt warm. I looked behind me, It was Gaben! He said "This is Gabe Newell" and handed me a Burning Team Captain. Then I woke up, I was wearing my Burning Team Captain and I was naked. I saw Gabe leave through the window, he looked back at me and winked. Hats are love. Hats are life

review: There's a point where I can write a review that can be both amazing yet bias at the same time; I hope I don't try to influence anyone by this review alone. When I first got Team Fortress 2, it was an experience that can't be beat. This first-person shooter can't go to say that this is probably the greatest in gaming history. From trading to crafting, this game will keep you on th edge of your seat until you know it's ready to stop playing. There are 9 classes, each that is unique and makes the game fairly balanced, making th game experience even more fun. With all the updates, there are some positive and negative effects than can affect the Team Fortress 2 trading community as a whole, but the whole aspect is to game, have fun, and enjoy your time on this game. It's your decision to buy from the store. It's your decision to craft metal and hats. It's your decision to play, idle, or even be a teammate and balance the rosters. The community is just like this game: random. So if you wish to stop playing other FPS titles and take a break from imbalanced games, then your choice is this: you won't be dissapointed.

review: I was so excited to load up Team Fortress 2, a cool wacky FPS that was team based and had many variations! Awesome! I said to myself. This must be way better than Call of Duty! As the download was running I sat on my chair eager to play the game, I started searching up some videos on the game and basic gameplay mechanics so I could get the edge on the competition, I learned many things that I could apply in battle! Before I knew it the download was complete! Awesome! I sat there as the game loaded up, eager to get into a server! I saw a map called "ctf_2fort" "That map sounds fun!" I exclaimed, I joined the server and was greeted with a class selection screen. I figured I should play the sniper since my experience in other FPS would help me through. My first ever spawn! I promptly walked forward out of the doorway and was greeted by a demoman camping spawn with his stickybomb launcher. I died. 10/10

review: I should have probably written a recommendation for this game a long time ago, as it is literally the most fun Ive ever had in an online game. Playing with, or without a team of friends, competitive or casual, this game delivers consistent fun that never really gets old. The dynamics and balance of class-based shooter gameplay that exists in this game is unparalleled anywhere else that Ive seen, with no one way to play being superior. The pay-to-advance mechanics in other freemium games aren't present here, as aside from a few utility unlocks and different play styles, the stock weapons are largely the best for every character, with the microtransation and trading economies being largely cosmetic and for non gameplay-affecting in nature. The support for competitive play is amazing, with all levels of skill supported, and many servers dedicated to skill improvement, in addition to casual gaming. The community is also amazing, with no shortage of community content, media, artwork, and a plethora of gaming networks that bring the TF2niverse to life outside the game, and into the rest of the world. (Still waiting for the civilian bobblehead from Meet the Sniper) There is also a virtual macro economy, with Valve's random item distribution system leading to a diverse market for all things TF2, within TF2; hats, specialty weapons, memorabilia items, that can all be used in-game to customize your character and add depth to your actions in-game and within the steam community. The bugs due to lack of optimization, and occasional grief caused by players abusing vote-related moderation systems are the only two things that I can complain about with this game, as it's good, wholesome fun regardless if you're just starting, or are a competitive pro. Even though this game is nearly 7 years old, the community that plays it really brings it to life once you get into it and with the nonstop fun that it provides, Its one of the genuinely few online games that I can wholeheartedly give my seal of approval to. Do i reccomend this game? Of course. There's no boring tedium of waiting around for your opponent to act, and hard-set roles and proceedures that needs to be adhered to, lest your team's fun gets ruined thanks to one person slipping up like in many of the other games these days. (heck, you can charge at a rocket launcher-wielding enemy with a claymore sword, and kill him if you pull it off correctly) I think it allows for more personal expression and playstyles than i think exist in a lot of games. 9.5/10 for doing everything right that can be done in an online shooter, and actually listening to the concerns of the community. Also for providing not just something fun to play, but a universe to be part of.

review: The vicious cycle of Team fortress 2 First when you'll arrive in the game, you'll want Weapons, tons of them. Then you'll see that everyone has hats, and you'll want these, a tons of them. Then you'll realize that hats doesn't matter, only skill count, so you'll want a lot of skills, tons of them. Then new weapons will be added, and you'll want them, all of them. Then a new hat will be added and you'll want it, cause it'll be fancy on your main class. Then you'll realize again, that you don't give a damn about hats, all is about is skill. Then when you have waited for 3 years, new weapons will be added, and you'll want them. And then you realize that you spent like 2000 hours of your life for this, met great friends, and you'll have a server where's you feeling like home, and you discovered so much things via the community, it learnt you so much. Then the rude reality of life, bring you on earth, and this game is here, Waiting for you to play 1,2,3... hours, and you'll be happy to see that all your good friend are still here.

review: Team Fortress 2 is a really stupendously addictive and fun FPS game. The game revolves around a set of 9 classes, each of which have strengths and weaknesses and counters, whose duty it is to conquer the opposition. The thing about TF2, at least for me, is the artstyle. The comic cartoonyness of the characters and world is incredibly fun and light. It's the perfect game to blow off some steam and relax after a long day. The players, at least in my experience, are all generally really nice. I feel this is because being "bad" at TF2 is not really a factor. Regardless of your skill level, how much time you've spent on TF2, or how much money, everyone can contribute and everyone can have a great time. One of the strongest parts of the game is that losing, dying or being killed doesn't lead to hate or anger or frustration. A game in TF2 can last from 3 to 10 minutes, and these short rounds contribute to a lack of concern if you lose. Not in a bad way, not in a way which results in you not caring about the game in general, but in a way where if you lose you don't blame yourself, or your team mates, for the loss. It's refreshing and fantastic. Hugely recommended from myself. I've spent about 550+ hours in the game, am in no way a master, half-decent maybe, and I have no reason to stop playing. The game is consistently updated with new maps, items, lore and content and I look forward to many more hundreds of hours of gameplay. Nilesy

review: I was only 13 years old. I loved TF2 so much. I was always at the bottom of servers. I pray to Gaben every night, hoping I would get a hat someday. "Gaben is love," I said. "Gaben is life." My dad overhears me and calls me a wm1. I know he's just jealous that I got recruited into FaZe clan. I call him a bodyshotter. My dad airshots me and sends me to my room. As I feel my numb face, I turn on my PC and log into Steam. My hands are shivering as I click on the "PLAY" button to open up TF2. "I'll show that airshotter," I said. I open up the Steam Market Place, and purchase 20 Half Life 3 Cases and Keys. 10 minutes have passed by, and I've unboxed 19 Strange Neon Annihilators As I move my cursor over to the final case, I click and select "OPEN". My cursor moves even slower as I move it towards the giant, green "USE KEY" button. I click the button. "I can't look," I said to myself. "My dad will noscope me when he see's that I've spent six grand on super exclusive and rare Half Life 3 Cases and Keys. I close my eyes and listen as I hear Gaben laughing over me, as if I am almost certain that I did not get a hat. I open my eyes. A large clump of feces leaves my  very quick, as my eyes look at the item I have just been given by the Holy Gaben himself. Another clump starts sliding out as I stand up to run to my dad to tell him that I've just unboxed a Ghastly Gibus. My dad cries as he suddenly gets his Steam account hacked by OpTic. I wear my new hat and noscopes his face. I then walk into my room, take my pants off, and thrust my pelvic region into the air, imagining Gaben with me. "Gaben is love, Gaben is life."

review: This game started as a class-based combat simulator, capturing the control points, stealing the intelligence from the enemy, moving a bomb-holding cart. Then, it moved onto a hat simulator game, only hats mattered, it was a competition to see who had the best hat. Recently, Team Fortress 2 transformed into a Bread simulator, you could spawn bread with a teleporter, bread was amazing, even bread weapons were released... But now, it is a conga simulator, one conga is enough to ruin a server. 10/10 must conga harder.

review: There is pretty much a reason for anyone, and I mean anyone to play Team Fortress 2. Let's review. If you like to play with fire, and not have to seek professional counseling. Team Fortress 2 is a game for you. If you like to stab people in the back while smoking a cigarette and speaking in an outrageous French accent. Team Fortress 2 is a game for you. If you like to run around and hit people with a bat, while talking like a cast member from "Jersey Shore". Team Fortress 2 is a game for you. If you've ever said to yourself: "I want to build guns, but I also have a life long dream to beat another man to death with a wrench,". Team Fortress 2 is a game for you. If you've ever wanted to pretend you're an obese Vladmir Putin while simultaniously firing an ridiculous machine gun. Team Fortress 2 is a game for you. If you've ever wanted to behead people while in a drunken Scottish rage, Team Fortress 2 is a game for you. If you've ever wanted to sound like that one kid's dad who told war stories and never shuts up about America, and shoot people with a rocket launcher, Team Fortress 2 is a game for you. If you want to prove that the plural of the word "Sniper" is "Too damned many", Team Fortress 2 is a game for you. If you've ever wanted to pretend you're a Doctor that barely escaped trial at Nuremberg, Team Fortress 2 is a game for you. Finally, if you like hats...be they fancy, or shabby...Team Fortress 2 is a game for you.

review: Team Fortress 2 is the BEST FPS that I EVER PLAYED IN MY LIFE!!!!! This game is a MUST-PLAY!!! The cartoon feeling combined with the combat makes this game a different one from the other FPS games. What also makes TF2 also a unique FPS is that it is a Multiplayer only video game. TF2 is one of the games that you don't have a pro to enjoy the game. For other FPS games, such as COD , you would have to be a pro at the game in order to get the other weapons. For TF2, you just have to play a certain amount of time and then later you will acquire some new items! If you're lucky, you could get a misc or even a hat. There are many different qualities for items and weapons in the game. They are Normal, Unique, Strange, Vintage, Genuine, Unusual, Haunted, Collector, Community and Self-Made. There are 9 classes which are the Scout, Soldier, Pyro, Demoman, Heavy, Engineer, Medic, Sniper and Spy. These classes are divided into 3 categories. They are Offensive, Defense and Support. Each class specalise in a particular area. The Scout can double jump and is the fastest out of all class which means he can escape from danger with no diffculty. The Soldier can rocket jump to get into higher areas. Pyro can burn enemies and can do compression blast which blasts projectiles away such as rockets and grenades. The Demoman is able to make traps for enemies. Heavy is able to take a lot of damage and has the most health. Engineers are able to construct buildings such as a Sentry Gun to defend points and support the rest of the team. Medics can heal fellow teammates so they are able to survive in battle longer. Sniper can do a significant amount of damage with sniper rifle. Spy can disguise as the enemy team and can sap Engineers' buildings to disable them. As you start Team Fortress 2, there are detailed tutorials that teaches you how to play the particular class efficently. When you finished these tutorials, there is a "Training" Mode which enables you to sharpen your skills on bots. Training Mode also has several diffculties. TF2 has many gamemodes. Some examples are Capture the Flag, King of the Hill and Payload. Each gamemode has a certain objective and requires everyone in the team to contribute. Team Fortress 2 is one of those games that requires a lot of teamwork. If there is no teamwork, the team is unable to advance to the next point. A unique gamemode called Mann Vs Machine is when 6 players work as a team to prevent waves of invading robots deploying a bomb at a certain point. As you advance through, the waves of robots begin to get increasingly more diffcult. There is also a "Mann Up" version. This is the official version of Mann Vs Machine played on offical Valve Mann Up servers. In order to get into these servers, you would need to purchase a "Tour Of Duty Ticket". After you complete a mission , you earn a pile of loot which you get at the end when it is "Victory" Time. When you complete a Tour Of Duty, you would get normal weapons, Botkiller weapons, Killstreak Kit, an Australium Weapon and many more. TF2 has also many custom mod servers which consist of unoffical gamemodes. Some of these mods are TF2ware and Versus Saxton Hale. The best feature of Team Fortress 2 is that there is always update which contain new items, weapons,weapons changes, maps, gamemodes and THEY ARE ALL FREE OF CHARGE!!! This says when you go on Team Fortress 2, there is always new content to enjoy. TF2 also celebrates special events such as Halloween and particular maps change their looks to match the event. In these events, they are special event only items that you can acquire. Team Fortress 2 are just those games that get very hard to bored of. They can get so addicting that you would just play them all day. NOT TO FORGET, IT'S ALSO ABOUT THE HATS. TF2 is an absolute MASTERPIECE!!!!! I give this game overall 1,000,000,000/10!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

review: This game......... I've lost family and friends to this game, its taken over my life, it's not just a game to me, its more than a obsession, its a drug, a way of life to me. I sold 1 of my kidneys, my body to science, shoes, clothes, worldy posessions just to feed my addiction to buy hats and weapons, ive gone so far as to morgage my house, not feed my children, miss countless days of work, FOR THIS GAME "father, we're hungry, these year old saltines hurt our tummies" "Sorry, but i really need this hat" The time i spend playing this game, i could be using to better my self, not just for me, but for the loved ones around me, but i keep getting pulled back into the same habits. Do i recommend this game? yes, i do. Do i recommend you neglect your family and friends, just to play this game? of couse I do. Do i recommend you give up your life like i have, down to my last 100$ and pack of top ramen, using newspapers as diapers, feeding off compliments that i get for my hats? I think you know the answer to that question. GET.THIS.GAME  Jk about all of that, its a pretty good game, i highly recommend it, get it "I dont want to spend the money" ITS FREE! or is that still to expensive for you?

review: This game is PC gamer's essential. The art style is unique and appealing. The gameplay varies dramatically from map to map, requiring the player to create new strategies and work with their team in order to succeed. The community is also a nice bunch of people. The game has it's own charm, that keeps a big, goofy smile on your face the whole time you play it, maybe it's the art style, or the personalities of each classes, and maybe it's how the game sort of make fun of itself and takes itself so un-seriously. There are frequent updates that keep adding new items and features that get the whole community excited for a good reason, these new items can throw a real curve ball in the right situation. Lastly, it's F2P! So what are you waiting for, go and fire up steam and download it now, you will not regret it.

review: October 2007, Valve gives birth to their newest child, a young boy by the name of TF2. Old friends of his father, Team Fortress classic, as well as a newer bunch flock over to see the new child. They love him, he's unlike any child they've ever seen before. Beautiful for his time, with the mechanics that they knew and loved and then some, he becomes one of Valve's most popular children fairly quickly. But Valve thinks, "let's add something new to the mix- a new hat and a new gun." They do just that, and even more people are attracted. Everyone loves him just that much more. Valve notices the attention this child is getting. This child is a happy one, a thriving one with a lot of friends. "How can we make him happier?" Valve asks themself. More hats. TF2's 3rd birthday is almost a week away, but Valve wants to surprise their child with his 3rd birthday gift a bit early. A new pile of hats and guns. TF2 looks at his gift, awestruck, his mouth hanging wide open. It was unlike anything he had ever seen! And then, without warning, Valve chucks the child in to this new pile of hats and weapons. Initially stunned, he eventually feels the great pain of the impact against the metal and wood weaponry that he had landed in. He cries loudly, and for months. "What do we do now, how can we make our child happier?" Valve ponders this. All of TF2's friends are still around, happy as ever without noticing his pain and suffering. Valve knows what they must do. May 2011 comes by. Valve carries with them boxes of WW1-era helmets. More hats should definitely make TF2 happier. More hats will always make him happier. Valve approaches TF2 with the boxes full of helmets. TF2 looks up to her and stops crying, he looks up to her with a hopeful look upon his face. You can see his smile slowly return. And then valve pulls out a cold hard helmet and throws it at TF2, hitting him in the head. He's stunned, only this time he doesn't wake up quite as quickly. "Why. Won't. You. Be. Happy?" Valve asks, chucking a helmet at the child between each word. TF2 sits there like a ragdoll. All of TF2's friends are now yelling at Valve. They notice the abuse, they beg Valve to stop, and they finally back off. But then, TF2 wakes up. He doesn't cry, he doesn't weep, he doesn't know quite what's happening. A new group flocks around him, Valve sees this as a victory and returns to her spot upon the sofa to take a powernap, she's quite exhausted. In reality it's quite the opposite. TF2's old friends and new friends now fight over him, and he suffers heavily from brain damage causing a wide variety of problems. Valve wakes up and notices. His netcode is very severely damaged. Valve responds by throwing more hats and weapons at him. His best friends are turning invisible completely at random. Valve throws more hats at him. His friends' clothes colors are changing for no reason at all. Valve throws more hats at him. It always seems to make his friends happy, but at this point hardly anybody realizes that TF2 is dying of abuse and neglect. 2012 - TF2 turns 5 years old and his friends are poking at him doing the same exact thing they've been doing for the past 5 years. Valve gives birth to two new  children, CS:GO and Dota 2. Many flock over to them, but most of his friends still stick around. TF2 looks longingly at the two new children. They both are already more popular than he ever was, and their parents take better care of them. Maybe someday, he hopes, Valve will realize what the real problem is and take proper care of him. Day by day, more of his friends begin to leave him. Word goes around of a new upcoming medical procedure that could fix all of his problems, "Source 2" is what they call it. It's a long way off, but maybe- just maybe, he hopes- Valve will let him have it and he'll be as happy as he was as a child. But for now, it's merely a dream. A tear rolls down TF2's sunken-in cheek, and he shuts his eyes for yet another night.

review: Oh TF2, oh TF2.. We've come a long way, but everything will end eventually, no matter how fun it was. If you are looking for the game's details, read the positive reviews, I will have a little rant here. A few years ago I found this game through the famous "meet the series", after I started playing I was instantly hooked by the amazing variety of gameplay, even though I do not play anymore do to the reason I will give below I am still active in the community, some of you might know as Gilgamesh from OpenGriefing. The game: With the nine classes and huge amount of weapons that come with it TF2 is a game which you can play for days, even months! Each class has their own individual role which is completely unique to it, you can play in all sort of ways, and there is so much to do it rarely feels repeditive. The community is nice, and although most do not appreciate the sight of a new player, there is still a huge amount of nice people. I my self have taught 4 players on how to play TF2 whom I personally don't even know, and I had great fun in doing so, and there more people out there that do the same. The game has a series of cosmedic items which add a lot of life and color into it. You can dress the big muscle guy called the heavy with his huge machine gun up with a fairy custom, or you can turn the German doctor called the Medic into a WW2 German infantryman of the battle of Stalingrad, these are two examples of thousands of possibilities. There are many game modes and dozens of maps for each, which let you play the game for an unbelievable amount of time with out getting bored once. These are just the official maps. There are tens-of-thousands of community maps which also enhance the gaming experience. The community: TF2 is a very old game, yet it is one of the most played multiplayer games even today. The community is very committed and it was the community that made the game what it is today. Valve kept the game fresh by releasing updates that always added more content with which you could play with your friends and have loads of fun. With that being said, here comes the problem: As I said, TF2 has a very committed and loyal community even though the game is from today's standards as old as the bread crumbs that are left in a toaster that one day have the fortune of being vaporized, leaving the toaster as dust. Now, valve always showed their appreciation for this through out the year by adding fresh content. This however, has changed. Valve, like other companies, has noticed the potential of modern competitive games, one genre of which is MOBAs. It is also very obvious that they have grown old of TF2 and want to work on different things. Their plan to keep the game alive, while slowly leaving it was to let their loyal community take over, which I have to say is quite an honorable thing to do. However, they have completely failed at it. The problem is, the community may be able to handle parts of the game, but not the entire game it self. It is impossible do to many factors. By this I mean, the community might be able to add content like hats and taunts to the game, but they can not expand the gaming experience, the expanding the gaming experience is exactly what made TF2 a special game, every year there was always something new to try out and after doing that, the normal game was appealing again, and the loop continued. But instead of fixing the issue, they just want to pull it through till the end, like dragging a bleeding body to the hospital but knowing that it won't make it. Warning Rant: They also treat the community wrong, they have gotten to used to the community of TF2 treating them like some kind of divine council. They think anything will satisfy it. An example of this is the ing ducks. Some people complained that the "End of the Line" not including snowplow, with Valves' response being 'It is too complicated for new players", from what I have heard though, the did not include the map due to it not reaching their standards, which is fine by me. Also the lack of weapons that were promised by the creator of the animation did not appear, which was upsetting, but still bearable. What really shoved the middle finger up my  though, was the ducks. The ing ducks that cost 5 ING EUROS. FOR ING DUCKS! Is this some sort of joke? Was Valve thinking,"Ayy Lmao, ducks are funny right?" from Valve and the End of the Line team. Without the ducks, I would have nothing to complain about, but if they seriously think that DUCKS will satisfy their loyal community after they miss out on the promised weapons and a new game mode, then must have ing plumbum in their water supply, They tried making up to it by rushing 3 new weapons which are all useless and uncreative. The creativity is what counts, not the effectiveness of the weapon. Pre-access, now for TF2 also! Another issue is BETA maps, they adapted the method of their platform into TF2. They release unfinished , act like it is finished but still needs "fixing" and let the community do all the work, instead of actually using already made maps by the community OR getting of their asses and finishing them. The beta map Cactus has a ing holes everywhere! It is also so monotone, I cringe when thinking valve could even put it in the game. What they appear to think of the community: They take us for a bunch of clowns, juggling around in the circus with a red nose and wacky hair, riding on a one-wheel making "toot toot sounds". They put disclaimers on their ! "For expert players only" they write in captions under their new Pre-Access game mode. Who ever complained to them, that some game modes for too complicated? Someone with 0 neurons in their skull, succeeding at surpassing the stupidity of a pigeon?!? The game mode is just as "complicated" as the other game modes, there is nothing that could irritate new players, if you exclude all the unnecessary glitches. Hats: As it worked in the past, adding more cosmetic items usually was endorsed with a lot of positive responses from the community, this was because they added fun cosmetics, while adding more content for gameplay. It was a balance of a innovation and fun, always the right mix. But now, they just try to make us suffocated in cosmetics. This can be do to 2 reasons: 1. They just want to add more cosmetics to.. recreate Barbie simulator. 2. They realized that the game is dying and wana milk as much  out of it as they can before it goes downhill (same thing goes for ducks) Servers: I will try to keep this short. Most Valve servers, the servers I personally enjoy playing on the most. Have  BETA maps on them. Most TF2 servers went from TF2 to DOTA 2 and CS:GO. I remember always finding at least 3 full servers of a single map, for each map a year or two ago. Now I have luck if I find a single full server of a map. To end this: As I mentioned before; "They realized that the game is dying and wanna milk as much  out of it as they can before it goes downhill", the game IS in fact actually going down the . Look at all the TF2 youtubers! STAR_ and Jerma have stopped playing the game! Why? Because there is nothing new, and they have a bitter taste because of the recent decisions of Valve regarding TF2. "So what if two youtubers quit playing the game, it happens all the time." When a pretty much TF2 only channel with at least 90% of its subscribers being TF2 related, quits the game because the company is ing up, then it is very obvious that there is something wrong! This is not just YouTube, it is also on my steam friends list, I used to see at least 10 people playing the game at any given time. Now it is rare to see anyone at all play it, and look at the size of that list! With the majority being hardcore TF2 Players. This game is dying and Valve needs to seriously step in before it bleeds out for good.

review: Good afternoon, dear gentlemen and gentlewomen It is a pleasure to perceive that one such as yourself would partake in my review of this most splendorous game. I say this for it is the most honest and veritable truth. Quite close to the objective Idea of Truth, to estimate it properly. At first I held the opinion that Collective Fortification II was merely another dull, boring and uninteresting ludum of the general significance and craftsmanship as Summoning of Obligation. However, this was in advance of the actual attempt at undergoing the experience of Collective Fortification II, which is, in hindsight, presumptuous and bold. Contrary to whatever estimation I conferred to Collective Fortification II in the past before, mind you, partaking in the adventure that is Collective Fortification II, I must declare with due expertise that this ludum is marvelous! In this ludum one will find a most engaging experience worthy of eternal estimation in the irrefutable and absolute realm of Do Desire. Certainly, anyone who would claim that this ludum is not worthy of said realm would be a scoundrel, a fraud and a lout. Yes, the sheer dilly-dallying that is facilitated in this ludum is thus charming that one such as I, one who could be described as paresseux comme baise, would scribe a true pinnacle of summitous apexity in the latitudes of criticisms. And thus, at the decisive terminal of this criticism I would implore you, my venerable gentleman or gentlewoman, to amuse yourself with this ludum of exceptional excellence. Now, my treasured asinine, experience the wonder that is Collective Fortification II with your personal senses by embarking on the quest that is this ludum! Godspeed and have a good evening by now. Best regards, MLAnonymous

review: TF2 Is that unique type of FPS that rarely comes around, more of like a one of a kind, it's a extremely different type of FPS, instead of rehashing content like certain other series, TF2 mostly gets updated with brand new content a few times a month, or even hints to upcoming updates, which makes it ALOT more mysterious/fun, TF2 at it's core is a very balanced/simple several-gamemode game, with all the classes ranging from Scout all the way to Spy. They all show ALOT of personality, almost all of them unique, from the Insane Medic, all the way to the Baby Yelling heavy, It's modding community is VERY well known aswell. Sick of the default gamemodes?, Try some community ones such as Parkour Fortress, Zombie Fortress, Dodgeball, Prophunt, Hidden, Freak Fortress and so much more, "But what's the catch?" i hear you say?, None really, but there are some downsides such as some of it's community and some if not most competitive players that scream at you for bodyshotting them, or mocking you because you are a F2P, all in all TF2 is a one of a kind gem by Valve Go play it. It's good.

review: Ah, tf2. Best game I've ever seen in my life. When I started playing tf2, I only played it for the gameplay. It was (and still is) real fun to play. But after some months, I discovered trading. The wonderful trading. After months of trading, I learned a lot about it. And now, I do it almost every day! It will always be my hobby. c: It's even a great way to earn money! :D I have to say, there aren't that much weapons. There are more cosmetics then weapons. I'm not really a fan of cosmetics, I prefer have weapons (that's why I almost have them all, except 5). And when there comes new items during an update, then that are only cosmetics/reskins of weapons/weapons in an other quality. For now the qualities that are coming more of: Strange and Collector's. Collector's is a new, and pretty expensive quality, but not really diffirent then the 'unique' quality. And Strange is a quality that counts kills/points/etc that you made with the weapon/misc that's in this quality. I'm a truly fan of Strange weapons, and I own 41 out of 120 (this is except Australiums, Botkillers and Festives, because that are 'just' reskins) Someday I'll buy the rest of them too :D Alright, I told pretty much I guess, and I hope this review was useful for you. Thanks for reading and enjoy playing tf2! - Wario_16, 2014.

review: Once upon a time, in a server far away There was a blue Scout that shouted "Bonk!" when he hurt people. This Scout was facing a dilemma. The Scout shouted, I need a dispensah over ere! However, the Engineer was facing problems of his own. A Spy is sappin my sentry! The Engineer shouted back. The Scout could see no red spy. Unfortunately, this lead to his downfall as the Scout was then backstabbed by the Spy. Before the Scout completely died, the Spy whispered into his ear, I did your mother. As the Spy walked out of the room, he disguised himself as the recently fallen Scout. Until he got hit by the Sniper's Jarate. This drew the attention of a red Soldier "I think his mate saw me." The Sniper whispered to himself. A rocket to the face only proved that fact.

review: Team Fortress 2 is a weird game, and it is not only a FPS game anymore. I would describe it more as a social hub for people to hang out. This game have two teams that are supposed to fight each other, but only in Team Fortress 2 with two people of the opposite team giving each other high fives, stop fighting during the game and walk around crouching, or dance together! There are nine classes divided into three groups; offense, defense and support. But Team Fortress 2 have changed so much since release that it does not really mean anything anymore. Pretty much every class can function as any of the three groups with the right loadout, but they are still very different from each other. You got a fast Scout with little health, and a slow Heavy with a lot of health, and anything inbetween that! There is no way you will not find a class you prefer sticking to. Valve never added a new class, but they added tons of weapons! Some of them are really silly (punch an enemy in the back to make him stop and laugh, a great way to get silly taunt kills!), while others generally are a big improvement over the stock weapons (like the Degreaser). However most of the weapons are very situational and I prefer the stock weapons. There are many game modes to play. Capture the point, capture the flag. Payload where you push a cart through the map while the other team try preventing you from doing it, and if you're a fan of tower defense, you will enjoy Mann Vs. Machine! You're a team of up to six people who are supposed to kill a huge army of robots before they move their bomb to your base. Some of them are small, others are big and really hurts, and others are big and runs fast. But what really makes this game mode different from the more traditional Team Fortress 2, is you can upgrade your weapons. Fire speed, damage, reload speed, damage resistances, running speed, jump speed and so on. It is really fun, and if you are lucky you can win a huge prize for completing a Tour! Cosmetic items are a huge deal for many people. Hats! There are so many hats in this game, and they are all so different. There is no way you are not going to find one you like and will wear and be proud to wear every time you play. Many of the cosmetics can also be painted into your favourite colour! Team Fortress 2 is free to play. Is it pay to win? No. All the weapons you see in the store, are weapons you can get simply by playing, or you can use items to craft the weapon you want. If you buy premium you will receive weapons faster, your backpack will be larger so you can keep more items, and you can trade with others. Trading is a good way to get the weapon you're looking for. It is a lot of fun! It is fun to play the actual game, or just hanging out with people ingame like you can not do in any other game. This is the game where you make friends! ^____^

review: The Second Fortress of Team is a roleplaying rpg. If you can see around this game's high price, I'm sure you'll be able to enjoy the stunning, photorealistic and colourful graphics this game gives. Based heavily on realism, Second Team Fortress is a very tough game to learn with all of the realistic gun mechanics. It improves on its strick mechanics by allowing the player get killstreaks after a certain number of kills. I give Call of Fortress 2 a Treyarch of an Activision.

review: In this game helping your team (collect hats) is vital to ensure victory in the (tryhard) battle field full of (F2Ps) death and dispair (hats). With all 9 classes (9001 hats) to choose from, the gameplay (hat choice) will most definitely be different from the first time you played (wore a Gibus) as your skill (backpack value) goes up in the ranks of battle (unusuals) in this Free to Play (Free2Troll) funfest (Gabefest). I give it a dan outa dan.

review: I actually like this game alot. Most people think of TF2 as a shooter game where all the players eventually get sucked into the world of hats and unusuals and strange weapons. That is very true. I've been addicted to collecting them since I started. Still don't have an unusual, but I just got my first professional killstreak weapon and I'm going to use only it for the rest of my life. :D

review: This review is very lengthy, as I have a lot to say about this game. So sit tight, you are in for a long ride. Let's get the verdict out of the way before getting to the real talk: I recommend this game. I have spent hundreds of hours and thousands of dollars on it. Is it worth playing? Yes. Is it worth investing your time for a deeper experience? Probably not. I already predict a lot of hate for this review, but I need to get it off my chest and explain the issues I have with this game. Once again those are my own opinions that a lot of people happen to share. It is completely fine if you want to argue against it, I will just ask you to be honest and less defensive because TF2 is in a critical state. First of all, I'd like to point out that I've spent 1780 hours, which might be low for some, high for others. I started playing in late 2009-early 2010 in intervals of several months between late 2010 and early 2012. I enjoyed this game a lot since it was a fresh change from the FPS games I used to play back in the days (CoD 2/4 or CS). It was extremely fun, and trust me, I do not regret a single minute I've spent on this game, before early 2014 at least. I'm not really the Shakespeare of game reviews, and English doesn't happen to be my first language, but I'll do my best to explain my points clearly. I'm going to spend some time explaining each major part (IMO) of TF2: Competitive, Trading, Community, and Updates. I - Competitive: Why do I want to list this subject first? Simply because this will be a quick talk: Competitive TF2 is basically the best place where you can fully enjoy TF2. The competitive community is mostly made of good and helpful people. You will play the game the way it should've been played, whether it's a lobby, pug or a UGC match. For my part, I didn't really want to get into UGC because unfortunately I was already getting into CS:GO and couldn't get the time to look for a team, even though I played pugs with and against silver/gold teams. II - Trading: We had the good part, now the not so good-decent part. Barely spent anytime there. I never got interested in it mainly because I'm not patient, and I can get the thing I need directly without spending 3 years working for a bigger backpack. Most of TF2 is usually into trading, whether they spend 1 hour a month or 23 hours a day in a trading website/server. The trading community is really mixed. It has good people in it, but it also has scammers and some self-centered losers. Yet, this is where I got to meet a lot of good friends, and where I've been amazed by a lot of idiots thinking they have the networth of the 1% in their inventory. At the current state of the game, according to many professional traders, unless you have some insane item, you won't make any profit. With all the useless hats added, the supply of cosmetics is insanely high, the demand is scattered and the value the currency holds keeps dropping, dragging everything down with it. In short, trade if you want, but watch out for scammers and sharks and stick with the good people. There aren't many, but they are out there. Trading would've been one of the strengths of TF2 if Valve and the heads of some communities didn't ruin it. III - Community: It's really mixed. You can find good people if you go to the right pubs, as well as s who will instantly kick you if you aren't a "friendly heavy" or "ruin the conga" or w/e. I wasn't lucky with Valve servers as well. Most of the times I played in those servers I was left with autistic meme spouters, 300 ping brazilians or  who will call you a tryhard if you simply try to play the game as intended. Some people also blame bronies or furries for making it worse. I honestly don't care about both, I had to witness a lot of pubs with regulars I've enjoyed playing with dying, and if there is something to blame it is not one of the game's communities such as the ones cited above, but rather the direction the game is currently taking. IV - Updates: The game is making a terrible turn. It went from a game that could've been a success in eSports to a casual cash-grabber made to attract more people into Steam. They keep on adding useless lore-breaking cosmetics aswell as useless weapons that keep on making the game worse. Many want Valve to add more weapons to the game - I don't. You have to understand that the point of unlocks are, or were to be very situational items and could also act as a costly alternative such as the Gunboats. Some weapons now are either completely useless such as the new grenade launcher or the Back Scatter or completely random such as the Base Jumper or the Tide Turner. Many people are complaining about EoTL for being one of the worst updates possible to the game. It was overhyped by you guys because you couldn't understand that this was the way Valve wants the game to be. Don't blame those who made EoTL, the ones to blame are those in charge of TF2. They had then to throw in a broken  game mode that seemed to be coded within a day, as well as a couple of useless weapons or taunts to calm the community down after the disaster.The sad part is that it worked. The game is now 8 years old and still a success for the wrong reasons; but how long is it going to last before more and more people get tired by the way Valve handles the game? Once again, most of these are based on my opinions as well as the opinions of others. I hope this might be useful for some. I had to write it to unleash the anger I had against the incompetent team supposed to replace the original developers. So go ahead, enjoy the game, play it as its fullest. If you've never played this game you are missing something, so do it now while it lasts. Thank you for your time.

review: Probably the worst FPS of all time, where your chance of winning is decided by the amount of headwear one can use. And as the heavy's head is the biggest, he is obviously the most op class. Scout is a manifestation of post-marxism homosexual propaganda masked with a Boston accent to calm the Italians. Soldier does not only suffer from heavy mental retardation he is also a extremely nationalistic American, basically male Sarah Palin. The Demoman is a anti-stereotypical to the point that it becomes offensive, trying to detract from his african american origin as much as possible. The pyro is the gimp from Pulp fiction with a flamethrower, not only is that copyright infringement but also damaging the image of latex fetishists all around the world. The sniper is the most incorrect character since 1. He is not a kangaroo and 2. He isn't upside down. The Medic is a nazi. The heavy is a false display of an incredibly overweight Putin with an insuffurable amount of brain cells. The spy is a meek attempt at poking at the french which fails by him not actually being offensive at all. 10/10 best game ever.

Want to use your ammunition to propel yourself across the map at incredibly high speeds and shoot a barrage of high powered rockets in the faces of your enemies? Want to burn down the homes of those you hate and simultaneously think about unicorns and rainbows? Want to operate highly explosive bombs and grenades while shouting like a drunk scottish man wielding a medieval sword? Want to eat sandviches? Want to carry your team by sticking a life saving device up other people's butts and become the center of attention because everyone either loves or hates your very soul? Want to build aimbot guns that do all of the work for you while you sit in a chair and drink beer? Want to be an MLG 360 noscope champion who throws piss at people? Want to use invisible hacks and kill other players in just one hit by pretending you're one of their friends? Then play TF2. 10/10 would wear a hat again.

review: I have to say. VALVE YOU ARE SO AWESOME YOU DID A WONDERFUL JOB!!! This game has to be one of the best games I've ever played. It's just one of those games you don't play once and then give up forever. It's one of those games where you play it the first time and it just gets so addicting. I have to say this is one of Valve's greatest creations. From all the different classes, to the 9ish different game modes this game is a work of art that everyone deserves to see. I also am a fan of the gamemode, mann vs machine. It's something unique that I have seen in some other games, but all the other stuff added makes of for it. I guess the only downside of the game, is that the game is rated M and I'm not really a fan of blood. I did find a youtube video that lets you put in the code to turn off the blood however. I give this game a 99/100 for a new unique game that everyone deserves to play.

Most likely that is not important enough in the game is the appearance of caps and other items I think the game was given a second life, which she lives and sow the day. It is not strange but in the game there are also disadvantages, the most important and perhaps the only time that has passed since the inception of the game, namely, today people want to play next-generation games, the game is losing popularity faster and faster, can not withstand competition.

It's not all self based like Call Of Duty, you work with your team to win. Team Fortress 2 also has unique weapons that help you in combat. On the other hand, I HAD to talk about HATS. Some people play just for the hats, I play for usually both of them. If you're looking for a great F2P game, this is the game for you. Hope you have fun!

review: This game is free and yet it is one of the most popular games on Steam. That says something. I definitely recommend playing TF2 or at least trying it out. However, i believe that to fully enjoy this game you cannot play for a short period of time. The reason for this belief is that when i first started playing TF2, i played for around an hour and didn't really like it. However, i decided to try playing again a month after my first try and i slowly began to enjoy it. Over time i began to understand how to play as each of the characters and i unlocked many game changing items. TF2 is fairly easy to play once you get used to it, but when you first start playing, it's like entering a whole new world. TF2 is unlike any other game and it will take a bit of time to fully understand it, but once you do, it becomes one amazingly fun multiplayer game.

review: This shooting game where cosmetics are more important than weapons introduces the player to a world where two teams of mercenaries fight each other in various modes like King of the Hill, Payload Race and Capture the Flag. There is also the Mann vs Machine mode where a small team fights giant hordes of robots. Play as the 9 different mercenaries, each with their own abilities and personality quirks. No matter your skill or playing style, there's a class that suits it! You'll surely enjoy this game that never gets old thanks to the frequent updates that bring new content such as hats, maps, weapons and gamemodes. And the best part is that it's NOT pay to win, since the game is well balanced and you can get weapons for free fairly easily. Your only concern will be getting more cosmetics! Team Fortress 2 is pure multiplayer fun, and one of the best games I've ever played.

review: I bought the game when it was still $20. It was the first game I had ever bought on Steam, and around that time in fall of 2008 there were only three characters updated with achievement weapons. Trading and hats weren't in existence yet, and the game truly was a "teamwork required" type of game. Every class felt balanced and fair, with each one having their own respective strengths and weaknesses. Even the achievement weapons brought a nice change of pace from the normal minigun and bonesaw. You actually felt accomplished when you did the achievements because you were rewarded. The community was surprisingly welcoming, and a majority of my Steam friends came from TF2. At the time, we had thought that Valve was going to update the rest of the characters with their own achievements and that would be all; and for awhile, we were right. One by one the rest of the classes got their own weapons and achievements, and by July 8th 2010 (Happy Birthday to me!), the Engineer was the last character updated. The game felt complete, three years in the making. Now... I think everyone knows what's coming next. Before I get into detail on the update that changed (or in my opinion, ruined) everything, let me just say that Valve had already put hats into the game months before, way back in August 2009. I was perfectly fine with the hats, they added a sense of personality to your classes and all you had to do in order to get them was play the game (a novel concept, I know). Hats were the only thing given to you as a random drop back then. I should probably point out that I took about a year break away from gaming at this point in time due to "real life." While I was away, the Mann-Conomy update happened. This update wasn't like any of the others, this update added tons of brand new weapons and hats, along with the addition of an in-game store and trading system to get them. When I eventually returned to TF2, the game wasn't about the objectives, or teamwork, or even being the best player anymore. All the game was about now was collecting the most hats and weapons you could get your hands on. The achievements didn't matter anymore because you could just buy whatever you wanted, or just find it as a random drop (since they updated it to more than just hats). The game that I fell in love with, spending sleepless nights for years, was all for nothing at the drop of a hat (quite literally). I'm not mad at Valve for what they did, from a business standpoint this is the smartest thing they've ever done. But whenever I see the game in my Steam library, I just get a deep feeling of nostalgia and longing for something that could have been. I hope that one day, I'll be able to relive those fond memories I have with Team Fortress 2.

review: Team Fortress 2 is a first-person shooter game from Valve. The gameplay is somewhat similar to Counter-Strike but with more variety of game modes, class based player, and unlike Counter-Strike, in terms of gameplay this game is more casual rather than competitive, at least for me. Everyone can play it, from kids, teens to parents, everyone can play. The game is very well balanced, each class has more than one unique abilities you can explore. You can get item drops as you play, and the more play, the more you can get. Items can be crafted for another better items too, or trade them for other items. And the best thing about his game is hats! Yes, hats. Most every damn people here on Steam loves them. You can show off your hats, craft it or even sell them! Many people make profit from it, many people collect it. Team Fortress 2 graphics is 3D but with cartoon style. Even though the graphics is cartoon, Team Fortress 2 still feature blood and gore effects. All effect from explosion, weapons fire, rockets, everything are cartoonized. This is great free to play game for me, I highly recommend it. Play it now! Rating 9/10

review: 9/10 - Need I say more? TF2 is one of the best multiplayer experiences steam has to offer. The purpose is in the name, Team Fortress 2 focuses on the use of teamwork to achieve various goals and it does so very well with 9 different and well balanced classes. The major flaw with TF2 is that of the younger crowd, I'd recommend finding some good servers and more mature people to play with before judging TF2's community.

review: Ah, TF2, one of the most well-known and popular FPS games out there on Steam, especially since it became Free To Play on the Steam Store. Ever since a friend got me into this game, I've been playing it non-stop for more than 200 play hours in total, and I would like to take the time to give my own thoughts on the game as a whole and some tips for newcomers to help them on their way to enjoy the game and not ragequit within the first 20 minutes of jumping right into it. First off, gameplay-wise the game is a typical multiplayer-based FPS game where the core goal is very simplistic: Hop on either the red or blue team and kill the opposing team and secure victory, however, the methods of accomplishing this range per match type, and usually good teamwork and class diversity are required to win the match. As for said class diversity, the game offers you 9 different playable class characters to choose from, all with their unique advantages and disadvantages, and it's a key requirement for any player to learn the limits and strengths of those classes in order to play the class effectively and to be of benefit to your team as a whole. Thankfully the game has a alright tutorial on a few classes, specifically the Demoman, Spy, Engineer and Soldier, but there are many tricks for a class that the game doesn't often directly tell you, but rather clues you in through the in-game loading screen tips section when you go to a match. Picking a class that suits your playstyle is often the first thing many new players struggle with, but the classes all range from fairly easy to pick up and play decently with, to far more tricky and fragile ones that require the player to be familiar with the mechanics and overall gameplay before they can effectively use them in combat. Such examples are the Heavy, Soldier and Pyro which in my opinion are some of the more easily accessable classes for new players to experiment around with, and Engineer, Sniper and Spy for the more experienced players when they feel confident enough. It has something for every kind of FPS gamer regardless of skill level, which is what I really like about this game. Atmosphere-wise, the game is very visually pleasing with alot of intricate map design accomodating the various matchtypes, and is designed so that players who are unfamiliar with the map and it's pathways are given visual cues on where to go, like if they're on the red team, a red arrow sign will point in the general direction where they need to head to, as well as various signs detailing a mission's objective and locations, like 'Intelligence' for the intel briefcase on capture the flag, 'Battlements' for the general middle area where most of the combat will take place, etc. The classes all have dynamic personalities that make them a blast to play as and you'll often chuckle at their lines regarding the situation, which really gives this game alot of personality. I personally really enjoy the Pyro because the character itself wears a gas mask which makes most of his lines almost inaudiable, but if you listen carefully you can make out a few key lines that he screams out. Besides the game's addictive core gameplay, there's alot of side content to it like customizable loadouts to your class' arsenal, cosmetic clothing and different taunts which you usually have to acquire through specific unlocking methods, crafting from metal which you get from turning additional weapons into metal which you obtain from random weapon drops during gameplay or trading with other players. Trading is one of the key mechanics of interacting with other players, and interacting with other players is oftentimes a good way of getting to meet a nice friend on Steam wether it's someone on your team, or someone you encounter while on a specific trade server, and who might be able to trade or even gift you some stuff if you're friendly to the player and and he/she is friendly to you in return. Just be careful of annoying or pushy players who are out for your items and will offer either nothing or nearly worthless items in return, though, if you happen to encounter those, just ignore them. There is also a Mann vs. Machine co-op game mode in where you get to work together with 5 other players being the limit against a horde of powerful robots trying to defend your area from a bomb they will attempt to deliver at all costs. This game mode is much more intense than regular multiplayer TF2 and you can earn nice cosmetic item rewards for your weapons in the Mann Up mode, but the Bootcamp mode is free to play and a good way for practice, but Mann vs. Machine is very tough and is not recommended for newcomers of TF2 to try out immediately. With that all out of the way, here are a few tips I would recommend everybody who's going to try this game out to follow if they want to have a pleasant experience playing this game in the long run: - Always stay friendly to other players and don't act obnoxious or self-righteous to others. The name of the game is TEAM Fortress 2, meaning that in order to win, you need to work together as a team, and not go out there, thinking you can take the entire team on yourself, which will oftentimes lead to you getting killed over and over again. Communicate with your fellow team members over the situation and what you're planning to do, or regarding plans or tactics that the enemy team is using through the default Y normal in-game chat and U team members-only chat window buttons. Your team members will appreciate it if you're friendly, and will be much more likely to co-operate alongside with you towards completing the objective if you do so. Sure the game can get very hectic and is easy to get annoyed over a supposed 'cheap kill' from a enemy player, but overall try to maintain a friendly atmosphere in the game. - If nessecary, do offline training on maps that you're unfamiliar with, and explore the maps so you'll know the shortcuts and side routes into enemy territory. This is a key factor into becoming a more skilled player over time, as there are many side routes that are often easy to miss or not pay attention to that the developers of the maps implemented in order to balance the game and make it possible for a team to overcome the other if they're being pressured or having difficulty breaking through chokepoints. If the enemy team is spawncamping, try to take a different spawn exit and flank them from behind. If the main route into their base is heavily guarded, look for a alternate pathway to take and inform your teammates about it. - Play classes that suit the current situation. This is a common mistake that I see occuring alot on many servers I play on, as quite alot of players seem to not grasp the limits of a class and oftentimes like to stick to one class only just because they like playing as that certain class and refuse to play anything else that the team might benefit more at that specific point during the match. Players need to observe the situation and pick classes whose advantages are required at the time. To give a good example, payload is a match type in where the red team needs to defend the bomb from being delivered by the blue team, and as such will be spawn-camping right off the bat during the start of the match. Yet alot of times there tend to be about 2 or 3 Spy and/or Sniper players in a team of roughly 9 to 12 players on blue. Those 2 classes can only take out 1 enemy at a time normally, and will be killed easily. You'll need a strong offensive class like Heavy or Soldier to pressure and kill the enemy team, and if your team doesn't have a Medic, be one. Medic isn't a easy class, but your team members will benefit from the healing so they won't have to retreat to the supply closet often. Class diversity and good communication about class choices mid-game can go a long way in winning the match. Thanks for reading this, and hope it was insightful. I definetely recommend this game!

Fo srs Pros: Lots of variety for classes if you dont like playing a color swap military man with a different gun. One half of the community is nice and sees you with open arms(no homo) Art style is very good, Lots of community content for more variety with game modes isnt neccesarily pay to win, moreover its a "pay to get that medic to uber you and your fancy hat" MvM is good if you want to kill capitalist robits Cons: Other half of the community is a cesspool of rich s that will make fun of you for not spending 400,000 dollars on a hat with an orbiting benis spinning around it. Very demanding for a constant framerate. usually needs a config to get one. Pyros are F@ggots 4/5 Kill all the m2 pyros

review: Team Fortress 2 was one of the best games I had ever had the privilege to experience, a few years ago, of course. TF2 is no longer the unique, team-based game it used to be. It has been narrowed down to an unfair, unbalanced mess of "who has the shiniest pink hats on trade_minecraft," "how fast can you get kicked from every valve server because some stupid kids think it's their private achievement server." and "how to get outskilled by someone using a more broken, overpowered weapon/class." Team Fortress 2 also hosts one of the nastiest communities to date, right below Garry's Mod and DayZ. I guarentee you, every server you join, you will be greeted by several bronies and furries spamming lenny faces, stupid Shrek memes, and pootis. If you like getting penalized for simply playing the game, this is the one for you. If you're 10 and still think memes are funny, this is the one for you. If you like having an overall bad time, this is the one for you. Team Fortress 2 also suffers from a severe lack of content updates. Every few months that go by, they will add more cosmetics and taunts to ruin the game and community even further. They DO NOT add balanced maps or weapons. They DO NOT balance the current game mechanics such as pellet/damage spread and random crits. They DO NOT Penalize those who are literally unable to play the game at an acceptable level. For example, if you get a team full of idiots who installed Steam the previous day, they get to stay with their 300-700 ping, slimeball community avatars, and inability to speak English in English servers. They will also vote kick you. Usually selecting the "No reason given" option, for they cannot speak English. Overall, if you are really looking forward to making your day a bad one, play the steaming pile of  that is Team Fortress 2.

review: It's a war-based first-person shooter that ISN'T a bloody Modern Military Shooter (henceforth referred to as MMS). What's not to like? Granted, the game has become overtaken with hats. But I'd say that's one of the reasons Valve decided to make the game free-to-play. They've received enough money from it thus far, and they don't need to rely on the money from every purchase to keep the game going. Unlike most MMS games, this one isn't re-released every single year with 1 or 2 minor changes and with a new name slapped on it. This game undergoes, just like other Valve games (and a lot of other Steam games for that matter), perpetual evolution without the need to be re-released. Sure, it has no single-player campaign. But there's the Portal and Half-Life series of games for that. It's a varied game with plenty of game modes that all run on the same sort of infrastructure but are different in varying ways. It's a good game. I'd recommend it.

review: Team Fortress 2 is the best free-to-play first person shooter in the world today. It's pure free-to-play, which means that everything is available at the beginning. You don't have to spend money on this game, except when you want to trade or buy cosmetic items. So what is this game all about? Well, you play in team of 1 to 12 (or even more) players and you try to beat the other team. TF2 features several gamemodes, Capture Point and Payload for example, and 9 'classes'. Each class has it's own pros and cons, and can be used for specific tasks. For example, the Engineer is a great defender and the Scout is very effective in capture-based gamemodes. TF2 is very n00b-friendly, since the game features Offline Training against bots and tutorials, as well as the cop tower-defense gamemode Mann vs. Machine. TF2 is a relatively simple game, you don't require a lot of knowledge to be good at it. The game also has a large economy of items, which you get by playing or trading. These are pure cosmetic, except most weapons, and don't give you an advantage towards other players. Verdict -------- This game is very enjoyable and funny, it's very different compared to other FPS games. It features several awesome gamemodes and funny classes. Some of the cosmetics are really funny, you can hit people with a mackerel and candy for example. An awesome free-to-play shooter you should play today. Your friends will not see you outside for at least 100 hours. If you become a "TF2 Trader" you will spend at least 400 hours on this game. Score: 89/100

review: Best thing since sliced bread.. No, seriously. Fun in pubs and all, but once you start playing with others, talking, communicating, laying strats, executing them in the heat of battle, risking friendships ove petty discussions, Team Fortress 2 turns into more than just a cartoon shooter. I don't even see the cartoon any more, all I see is "overextended heavy, engineer is spy!, chokepoints and bombing soldiers"

review: A game that will not only get you addicted to hats, but also hyped up about bread. Team fortress is the king of free-to-play games. In this multiplayer video game filled with humor you can choose a team (RED/BLU). The goal in this first-person shooter is to beat the other team in 8 different official game modes (king of the hill, capture-the-flag, push-little-cart). While in a team you can select one of nine classes with each class having its strength and weakness making sure therell be a game style that will fit you. You can also play co-op where you team up with 6 people to kill robots. Besides these official game types there are many others created by the community(such as a medieval, prophunt, etc.). But even if you ever get bored with playing you can always hang out and start collecting hats by trading, reason why its often referred to as the number one hat-simulator. Before this game I myself wouldnt even have considered playing any cartoon-like games. Im glad someone converted me. Its a game that will not get you bored easily. But more importantly, its free, why shouldnt you give it a try at least? Even if this game has been out there for a while, its still being updated on a regular basis. New game modes and hats created by the developers and community are regularly being pushed forward and major events are happening at Halloween, Christmas and Easter. There is only one downside I can think of: its quite large in size. So make sure you have enough disk space.

review: Have you ever had the craving to buy a strange weapon then spend all day leveling it up so your friends think you are cool? Then this is the best game for you! First job, get a strange either by wasting your money on uncrating, crafting all your hard found weapons to buy a strange from the overpriced scumbags on Tf2.Outpost, or better yet be a scumbag yourself and scam a newcomer who has just had this misfortune to uncrate and give him/her a scrap for his/her recently unboxed strange. Step two, locate a strange level up sever don't worry they are very easy to find due to the sheer amount of people wanting to level up their stranges so badly. And final step go and kill some idle people on the strange level up sever. Now all your friends/eniemes will think next time you kill them WOW they got 16854972 kills in one day? Defiently didn't go on a strange level up sever. 10/10 Best game

I recommend any new person coming into tf2 to NOT focus on hats or the economy, most of you will and you WILL REGRET it. Just trust me, there is way to much price manipulation going on. And if you do get into hats DO NOT get into unusuals. They will make you question everything you've ever done. Just dont do it. Dont go to the hat side. Anyways, just based on the game (not hats) i'll give this game a 10/10 will swag again.

review: English Review Interesting free game for entertainment and fun. You might tell yourselves, it 's the same as the other actions games (shooting games), where you can play through servers with different players, by the choice of a hero etc. But TF2 has something very interesting (some improvements and special stuff). Selection of 9 heroes, while every of them is somehow specialized and has different inventory to choose. And every chosen unit has it 's own statistics. Unbelievable 500 achievements will get you and surprise you, meanwhile for comparing with other games it 's a big shot. Chance of gaining equipments to inventory of your warrior or any bonuses which are going to be very useful in the game. It 's important to point out that there is a possibility of playing as single player or cooperation or any other methods, but it's useless and needless. And about graphics  it can't be compared with current class, but if you're searching for relaxing and getting crazy, then TF2 is made for you. Fory ou, it will not lose its attraction. Rating: 8/10 Slovak Review Zaujmav free hra pre pobavenie a zbavu. Mono si poviete, e je to to ist ako in akn hry (strieaky), kde mte hra cez servery s inmi hrmi, vberom hera a podobne.

review: Team Fortress 2 is a fantastic multi-player online first person shooter with 9 classes that all have unique personalities. Each class uses a primary, secondary and melee weapon. The Heavy has the most health, takes a while to fire, but can do the most damage per second with no reloading, but he moves slowly. The soldier shoots rockets, has the 2nd most health and and is the 2nd slowest, but experienced players can rocket jump. The demoman is a defender, using stickybombs to lay traps and grenades to roll forward, he can sticky jump with some practice and can also be a proficient melee class. The Pyro is a defender, lighting enemies on fire, causing damage for an amount of time, air blasting projectiles away and bringing good cheer and derpiness to any team. Engineers build teleporters, sentry guns and dispensers to defend the team and keep them healthy and supplied with ammo. The spy is elusive and backstabs people while invisible cloaking or disguising himself. His sapper can also disable and destroy the engineer's buildings. The scout runs fast with a double jump and shotguns people, he also captures at twice the speed of anyone else. Snipers snipe from far away. Medics heal and make people invincible at times. As for the modes, there are traditional capture the flag, king of the hill and less traditional payload, where blue team will push a moving cart, while red team defends it. The more blue players next to the cart, the faster it will go. If a red player is next to the cart, it stops moving. It is a great dynamic that makes the game really stand out above the rest. There is also payload race, where two teams push their carts, and control points where the goal is to capture all of the points (3 or 5 points instead of just 1 like King of the Hill). Teams for both modes are mostly 12 vs 12. Each mode has quite a few maps and maps are continually added over time. The newest mode is Mann vs Machine, where six players take on wave after wave of robots. There is a free version of Mann vs Machine called Boot Camp and a non free version called Mann Up that costs a Tour of Duty Ticket ($1 in the store). The ticket gets used if you complete a MVM mission. If you don't complete a mission, or if you complete a mission you've already completed, then you keep the ticket. A Mann vs Machine tour is composed of several missions across a few maps. What do you get for completing a tour? A random strange weapon and a notch in your belt! The maps in Team Fortress 2 stand out for their paths, there isn't just one path through each map, but there are usually several routes to get around a herd of foes. There is a lot of joy and satisfaction flanking opponents and killing an entire team from behind. Sure this game is free to play, but there are a lot of things to buy for real money! Hats for $5, keys for $2.50. Keys are like legalized gambling, you buy a key to open a crate, if you don't get what you want, you can always use Steam trade to trade the item for something you do want or just use another key! There is a whole micro economy in the game with trading. The game will drop you weapons as you play, then you can craft two weapons together to make metal. 18 weapons will make you a refined metal. That's the basic free currency of the game. When you have three refine, you can craft them together for a random hat. Most people prefer to trade their refined for keys, but well refined metal will always generate from dropped weapons, keys will always cost $2.50. You can also buy and sell keys in the Steam market for Steam wallet money to buy Steam games. The items you pay for are cosmetic if not strange weapons that count your kills. So it is not pay to win, even though you can buy in game weapons, but every weapon is a side-grade, not an upgrade, with pros and cons to each weapon. Since this is a multi-player game, nothing will overpower you. It is all rock-paper-scissors. Heavy can kill anything, but a spy or sniper can take out a heavy. A pyro can easily take out a spy. Stuff like that. Team Fortress 2 is updated regularly and has implemented a lot of community created items, maps and Halloween events. The Halloween events feel pretty special, but for the most part, they're just Halloween versions of normal maps. The community items, while cool, seem to be mostly cosmetic items with a few new weapons. There have been community maps made and maps are always free to play on. It is an exceptional game. Diverse weapons, maps and it is buckets of fun and free to play!!!! FREE!!! You get weapons dropped to you over time or you can trade them. It is such a good game even if you're like me and hate multiplayer this is fun multiplayer! Or single player against bots! It is a must play for any fan of first person shooters. The game is smooth, the 9 characters and weapons are very balanced and very different. There is a diverse array of modes.

Maybe some people don't like animation-style graphics but apart from this questionable part, it is perfect multiplayer FPS game I ever played or heard about, highly recommended for all CS nerds tired of "The bomb has been planted"

review: Team Fortress 2 is quite a game with a history. Originally a pay-to-play game, Tf2 became free! Upon so the number of players skyrocketed. Team Fortress 2 is a game where Reliable Excavation Demolitions (RED) usually defends from onslaughts of Builders Leauge United (BLU). You, the player, are given the choice of 9 merchanaries. The fast, cocky and furious scout, the patriotic brawler soldier, the mysterious hellborn that is the pyro, the scumpy-drinking, one-eyed black cyclops demoman, the comical and brutually large heavy, the whimsical engineer, the funny german medic, the cool, calm and collected sniper and lastly the man who perfers brains over brawn, the spy. What makes this game so entertaining is that each of the 9 mercanaries that you can play as all have such a distinct personality, looks and playstyle. If you're a player who likes run-and-gun, Scout is for you. If you like big guns, Heavy calls your name. Stealth? Spy is already right behind you, waiting for you to play as him. Who can forget the loveable pyro who sets everything ablaze. This game is also very rewarding to both new and experienced player alike, as item drops are given not for getting a certain amount of kills, but for just playing the game! However if you want to truely experience the full greatness that is Tf2 I reccomend paying anywhere from 50 cents to $90 in the Mann Co. Store to get prenium so you can truely have a great feel for the game. However if money is tight or if you're not sure you'll enjoy this amazing game, you are not truely penalized for being a Free-to-Play, unlike most other games of this kind. Overall Team Fortress 2 is a great game that doesn't require a supercomputer, and I'd honestly reccomend this game to anybody who asks so.

review: TF2 has changed...It's no longer about skill, stealing intelligence, capture control points, fun or even hats. It's an endless series of taunting and dancing of conga, performed by players and bots. TF2 and its consumption of life, has become a well-feeding machine...TF2 has changed...Strange people carry strange weapons, use strange hats and mics. Servers control. Trading control. Statistic control. Everything is monitored and kept under control. The age of deterrence has become the age of control. TF2 has changed... When everything is under control, "fun"...becomes routine.

review: I can not recommend this game enough! I've played it for a really long time, and it has never even once become boring. There may not be many updates to it, and it's glitchy as hell, AND the developers don't care about it as much anymore than they used to, it still is an incredibly fun game that you can just jump in any time you want. It might be a bit hard to get in due to all of the different weapons, classes, stats and what not (tons of stuff to remember), but once you got into it, oh man. The community isn't that bad, either. Had worse experiences in Dota 2... *shivers*

review: After all these years, TF2 is still one of the most balanced and dynamic shooter games out there. The art style is a refreshing break from the usual quasi-realistic-grim-tactical asthtic of most other popular shooter games. The action is fast paced, there are always new stratagies to try, and this game is great with friends. Whats not to love?

review: TF2 has been out for over 6 years and it still hasn't gotten old. You know why? Because Valve will never keep it the same thanks to frequent game changing updates. If you like shooting people, you'll like it. If you like blowing people up, you'll like it. If you like hats, YOU WILL LOVE IT. Just get this game. There's no reason not to.

review: This review/rating can be divided into two sections pre/post F2P(June 23, 2011). It is very important to distinguish between these two because they are really two different games. Pre-F2P TF2 (10/10) - For the first few years of TF2's existence, the game managed to have an absolute killer dynamic with a great playerbase that relied heavily on teamwork and a great community fostered by Valve's friendliness to the modding community. Valve really worked with the community to create new scenarios, maps, and weapons these first few years that helped vastly improve the game. Post-F2P TF2 (5/10) - The easiest way to describe the state of the game today would be a male dress-up Barbie simulator. I don't fault Valve for trying to capitalize on a game that is at the time of this writing over 7 years old, but the best times for this game are now well past. There's just too many new hats and new weapons to choose from, from which the majority are useless. Sure there are still plenty of servers to play in, but the majority of the servers are devoid of players with skill, microphones, and teamwork. There's still a few fun servers (see the No-Heroes servers) but donating is about the only way you will be able to see the inside of one of these servers when its full. The only bright side is that Valve is still adding new content with multiple updates a year.

Then a rich bourbon sauce is poured over them before serving. This is a fabulous recipe that my Mother gave me from a upscale restaurant in New York. It is to die for. ENJOY!! 1/2 cup finely chopped pecans 1/2 cup dry bread crumbs 8 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves 1/4 cup clarified butter, melted 1/4 cup Dijon mustard 1/4 cup dark brown sugar 2 2/3 tablespoons bourbon whiskey 2 tablespoons soy sauce 1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce 3/4 cup unsalted butter, chilled and cut into small cubes 1/2 cup sliced green onions Stir together the pecans, bread crumbs, and 2 tablespoons of clarified butter. Spread the mixture out on a plate. Press the chicken breasts into the mixture to coat on both sides. Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons of clarified butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Place the coated chicken breasts in the pan, and fry on both sides until nicely browned and chicken meat is cooked through, about 10 minutes per side. In a small saucepan, whisk together the Dijon mustard, brown sugar, bourbon, soy sauce, and Worcestershire sauce until smooth. Bring to a simmer over medium-low heat, then remove from the burner, and whisk in the 3/4 cup of unsalted butter one piece at a time. Do not return to the heat. Arrange the chicken breasts on a large serving plate. Pour the sauce over the chicken, and sprinkle with green onion.

review: Ever since I bought this game, I have never put thought into doing a completly honest review. If you want to take a few minutes from your time, you can listen to my storyThe first time I played this, was around late december 2007 on my brothers old windows vista computer. It didnt have much on it; weapons, hats, unusauls, etc...I'd played it a few times over at friend's houses and watched it change. New gamemodes, servers, weapons, etc...and how that all Changed the gameplay balance. I didn't get my own steam till about 3 years ago, and I was only going to use it for garry's mod. Then I decided oh what the hell, I guess I'll download tf2 since it's free. I'd been playing it on the xbox 360 for about a year then (by the way it sucks on that.) And I remember my first game, feeling sweetness as I got an insane killstreak on 2fort...like 50 something kills in less than 7 minutes. I hadn't been using steam much at the time, but around late August 2012, I'd really started to get into things. I found out about trading, and the tf2 economy, and getting cool hats for your characters, and the new mvm update which I mainly play right now. Then, when my friend told me about unusuals in tf2, everything ing changed. In late december 2012, i was doing everything I could to get one of these so claimed unusuals. They had these like cool particle effect thingys coming out of them. Finally, from the help of a steam buddy of mine, I was able to get one. The very first unusual I owned was a steaming handyman's handle. Now I know you're thinking, "haha a 10 key hat? So what?" But at the time, I didn't care if it was worth jack squat. It just felt so good to have that thingy with steam emmitting out of it. Then soon after that I got earbuds, and a bills hat, and some strange festives. And then, around my sprnig break in 2013, I got scammed out of my unusual. My only unusual...And the guy who did it, I wanted to ing rip his head off I hated him so much. I will give his name out: balestorm1, although he's been offline for over a year now. He's a really interesting guy, Did a scamming spree of like 6 unusual hats. Back to my story now. After that I traded my earbuds for a second unusual hat. A stormy pith helm for solly. It looked pretty cool as well, I then started trading up to make profit, and by early summer 2013, I already had about $1000 worth of items. A whole summer went by dedicated towards making profit and spending more of my money on unusuals/stranges, etc...but after reaching what seemed like my full mental capacity for trading, I started to feel sad, and lonely, and withdrawn from the everthing else (I'm not kidding.) I decided I should probably cash out of tf2 to get money and such for it all. I did end up getting around 500 u.s. dollars via paypal, but I still had a whole bunch of . After doing that...I traded towards an awesome burning Dapper's for soldier of which i favorited, then i traded and traded till in finally decided to spycrab what was primarily left of my backpack. Not alot, but something. ~4 buds worth of  I lost in multiple spycrabs on the MCT/Pink Taco's trading server. During all that, I was also taking a long break from tf2 as well going into several gmod communities, I even made my own server with a buddy of mine. That is a different story though. All the trading has put aside a focus for the core gameplay. I feel like this is how it is for many others who play this game as well. Several updates ago, I was getting really pissed at the game, and with this new Love and War, or Bread and Conga (lol not) update, It really pissed me off for multiple reasons. And for like the 6th time, I said "I'M DONE WITH TF2. I'M NEVER PLAYING THIS  OF A GAME AGAIN." But here I am, amidst all this chaos...Standing strong I prevail through all of this. I know, no matter what, this game, with it's mystery will be my all time favorite video game.

review: TF2 is a casual free to play first person shooter. On its own, that doesn't really translate to much, but with a wide variety of game modes, incredibly high skill-cap, and diverse classes with a variety of weapons to cater to a large amount of playstyles, TF2 does stand out as being a cut above the rest. Balancing unfortunately, isn't as strong as it could be and there are a few legitimately overpowered weapons, and not all classes are equal in usefulness. However, with the lack of cash shop based game stats, and the default weapons generally being the most versatile and reliable in the game, on top of the skill-caps of the classes; Keeping in mind the casual nature of the game, any issue with balance is minor enough that it can be worked around through player skill and team-coordination. Their business model only requires a single item to be purchased from the in-game store--or to be gifted a premium upgrade package--at which point, any cosmetic weapon, or upgrade can be found through playing the game, crafted, or purchased through in-game resources. It's a very fair game, with one of the best free to play models in the market. The primary difficulty you'll find with the game is starting it. With a lackluster tutorial, un-cordinated public games, and little assistance in the relatively deep tactics and game mechanics for the various classes, it can be hard to become skilled enough to coordinate in solo-play. Playing with friends, and doing some research into the game is highly recommended, as TF2 won't do it for you. TF2, on it's own is highly mod-friendly, and has a variety of community made servers running custom game modes. With a bit of searching, you can find hangouts, mini-games, training servers, custom maps, unofficial weapons, and the like. On top of the official game, and fairly friendly community, it's not especially difficult to get hundreds of hours of enjoyment out of the game without any issues, or requirements to invest money. It has its problems, but ultimately they are minor. What TF2 offers is a rich FPS experience, with enough community support to satisfy a variety of tastes. So I have no issues recommending this game to any FPS fan looking for a team-focused, objective based shooter.

review: This game used to be fun. Team Fortress 2 used to have the friendliest community, where people would help eachother learn how to rocket jump and give an Engineer tips on Sentry placement. Now its got hordes of lime green and pink Scouts running in, killing everything that moves, and putting "git gud scrub" in chat with a keybind. This game used to be fun. For some it may still be fun to play, for others its a way to pass the time, and some people only still play because it has become routine to do so. And for many the in-game economy has actually become a job, a business, even if they don't work for Valve or any other software developer. If Valve were to remove metal and cosmetics entirely, many people would lose hundreds or thousands of dollars. This isn't even a game anymore. People who play TF2 say that many aspects of this game need fixing. "Why would you nerf the Heavy and not the Demman?" I would say that the whole thing needs fixing. Specifically the community. This game used to be fun. The community used to be fun to be a part of. A few months ago it has become just as bad as the Call of Duty fanbase and community. You may still find it fun to play this game. You may somehow find the patience to deal with another toxic community. My patience is shot, I can deal with no more. If any of you need me, I'll be playing a single player game. I can actually play those without being told "git gud, noob" or "get rekt, scrub" after every death. The NPCs of a Singleplayer game like Fallout or Metro are certainly friendlier than the real people who play Team Fortress 2. EDIT: After about two months to think, I believe I've put too much into this game to simply give it up entirely. I believe I've found a little sub-community that's still got the kindness I missed. My opinion still stands, as there are a multitude of sub-communities that promote behavior like this in exchange for donations. Looking at you, Saigns and NighTeam and your pay to win admin slots. I've also found a way to make sure that I don't get hit by phisher and scam bots. Play with the community that I trust, and stay away from quickplay. Every friend request I get now, I also tell them to prove to me that they aren't a bot.

review: Hat Simulator 2: Hat harder, what can I say about it that hasn't been said already? It's fun, it's free, it's got cool stuff that is seriously underplayed, and the classes and asthetic are nearly timeless. But, you've heard that a thousand times. What of the meat and bones? The mechanics that everything is built on? Gotta say, hella good. The interplay of a lot of slightly different weapons and the drastically different classes combines well with the objective focus, but more importantly it makes you ask yourself silly questions. Like, "what if I ran a melee medic?" "or a melee heavy?" "What could make this more fun to play?" It is a great game, with great appeal, but most importantly the mechanics are fun. Plus who could argue with the price? Now if they would just do more with the magic spells, and medieval mode, and the bosses, then I would have no complaints.

review: A great first person shooter with comic look and interesting weapons and a creative and big community. In the first hundred hours you learn to play the game on regular servers, find new weapons you will test (and recognize that not always more damge = better) Enough of these matches? How about a bit coop mann vs. machine? You can upgrade the weapons you learned to love and kill waves of robots with some friends or other TF2 players you can make bonds with. I still have a lot of the players I met as friends on my friendlist. Done more than enough of these two? But wait, there is more. Have fun with community made mods like Zombie Fortress, Versus Saxton Hale, Parcour Fortress, Death Run...there is so more to find. You got that good that the public servers are starting to bore you? Get into competetive and meet highly skilled players along your way. Build a team and learn how strong the team aspect of Team Fortress really can be. Want some special items? There is a whole big community based on trading in TF2. Look around and you'll find players trading the stuff you want to have. (Please inform yourself about what items are worth before starting to trade; many items you find may not be as valuable as some items you want; AND DON'T TRADE AWAY UNUSUALS FOR ANY WEAPONS, EVERY UNUSUAL IS WORTH MORE THAN 1000 WEAPONS, NO MATTER WHICH WEAPONS; I warned you) All in all, great game, many possibilities and a lot the community has to offer.

review: The best hat simulator to date - this game features a large assortment of headgear and other wearables in a variety of styles and colours. With the ability to trade, purchase and stash away pixels in a virtual backpack, you can finally feel comfortable knowing that you've wasted your life. And once you have completed your worthless collection of wearable items, you can show them off to other pathetic losers in-game. You can also express your poor creativity by naming, describing and painting your items with a large array of bland, depresssing colours. Become a true jew by repeatedly attempting to make miniscule profit off of hour-long trades! Oh, and you can also shoot stuff. A must-buy for all basement dwellers and fat losers; 10/10.

review: I doubt anybody really needs to be told why to try Team Fortress 2, especially with its reputation and lack of a price tag, but I suppose I should throw my 2 cents in anyway. Team Fortress 2 is a fun game that gives you fun options in how you want to play. You get 9 classes to toy with, each having an interesting personality and a unique playstyle. Then, as you play, you'll come across weapons that let you experiment within each class's playstyle. The more you play, the more stuff you amass, and the more options you'll have at your disposal. If you haven't already, take a dip into the world of Team Fortress 2. You're almost guaranteed to find something you like!

I can't enjoy the sounds of my character's pained screams because of the squeakers constantly violating my ears.

review: Hat fortress 2, oh sorry Team Fortress 2, is a multiplayer fps focusing on cooperating with your allies to complete objectives or stop the other team from completing theirs. At your arsenal you have 9 unique classes with hundreds of weapons of your choosing. You find "random drops" in form of weapons as you play, allowing you to try out new weapons and eventually finding your favourite combos. Unlike other popular fps games, TF2 focus on advancing with your team and fill in for your allied classes weaknesses. While a heavy class have great damage output, his slowness makes him a sitting duck. A medic class can keep him alive and together advance into enemy territory to do damage. In another example, an engineer class can setup a small base for allies to heal, refill ammo and have a few seconds of not being fired upon. Against a demolition class like soldier or demoman, he can just watch as his buildings are wrecked, however with the support of a pyro, their explosives can be turned against them. Some weapons are even specifically made to support another class in battle. The real gem of TF2 is however it's crazy customization. You can equip all kinds of hats, clothes and other miscs, making your classes stand out. And not only that, TF2 even got a huge economy, with thousands of other players involved into. Trade a weapon or a hat with a friend, profit on selling your rare misc or simply hoard it all! It's all up to you Pros: Crazy fun gameplay, badass costimization, hilarious voice acting, huge economy and one of the longest surviving fpses on the market. oh and FREE Cons: To avoid having to play for tons of hours to try out all weapons, the in-game store sells extremly overpriced items. Trading however enables you to get everything cheaper but new players will have trouble with this. To make your items tradable, you are required to buy a premium upgrade (which you can by buying the cheapest item in the store so not too expensive)

review: Team Fortress 2 is really fun multyplayer game. There are 9 classes and all of them have balance, like heavy has a lot of health but he is really slow and really big target on the battlefield, sniper is verry good at long range but he is verry weak in close range, pyro is verry good at close range but weak at long range, ect. In tf2 there are weapons that you can get by random drop, buy them from mann co. store, craft them or trade them. All weapons have balance, no weapons are OP,if there is a op weapon it's going to get a nerf, they have good sides and bad sides, like frontier justice: you gain revenge crits but you have no random critical hits and smaller clip size, tomislav (minigun) has faster spin up time but has slower fireing speed. In tf2 there is so mutch teamwork, one team is probably going to lose if they have only one class on a team or if they don't have a medic or if they have 6 snipers and no engineers to defend. Overall this game is great and it's free, so if you are reading this on computer that you own, why don't you download the game. BTW sorry for my English ;)

review: You can't go wrong with this title. Not only is it fun, but it is ridiculously varied. Valve has worked on this game with additions and fixes since its launch, so it has undergone a lot of changes, and it barely resembles what it was when it first launched. If you get into it now, sadly you're probably going to have a hard time understanding what's going on under all that cluster of weapons, hats and whatnot, but even though it became such a chaotic mess, Team Fortress 2 remains my favorite Team-based FPS of all time. You have lots of options with every class thanks to the sheer number of weapons available to them. Each one is balanced and focused on a specific role, so you're bound to find one that fits your gameplay preferences like a glove. Don't like being an useless sniper who stands way back, away from the action? Fine, get up close and go with a bow. Your team needs a strong offense in order to fend off enemy attacks, and you're playing as a Medic? Switch from the normal Medigun which confers limited invincibility to a Kritzkrieg for guaranteed crits, no problem. Are you so pro with your aim that you feel disgusted using the stock Rocket Launcher as a Soldier or Grenade Launcher as a Demoman? No problemo, use the Direct Hit or Loch'n'Load to show off your mad skillz and deal more damage as a result of your prowess. Do you love being a soldier, but feel a glorious desire to help your team with temporary buffs? Okay, give up your shotgun and go with a Buff Banner, Concheror or Battalion's Backup so you can help everyone push with increased damage, increased speed or increased defense, depending on your equipment of choice. There are a lot of options available to you. It's simply amazing what this game offers. Plus, since it became F2P, there is no reason not to try it. Get it now!

review: you want a review? well even if you didn't I'm giving you one anyways. TF2 is not like most FPS games, let alone one that is free to play. TF2 is the sequel to a game known as team fortress classic, a mod using the unreal tournament engine. blah blah blah historical stuff I prolly got wrong. ANYWAYS: TF2 is quite simply an amazing game, with 9 different classes, each with their own unique roles in a successful match. 1. scout: he runs fast, capping intel, capping control points, and pushing the bomb cart with the power of 2 people! warning, since he runs so fast and has a double jump, allowing for high evasiveness, hes also pretty squishy, having a measly 125 base health. 2. soldier: soldier is a powerhouse, holding 200 base health and a rocket launcher that deals splash damage to multiple enemies. his rocket jumping ability (though this takes a LOT of practice to fully master) can get him to the point even faster than a scout! 3. pyro: the most controversial class, having 175 base health, medium-paced walking speed, and a short-ranged based primary (the flamethrower), pyro can be seen as the weakest class. while most newbies would complain to him being an overpowered fire demon here to eat your babies, they really just don't know how easy it is to counter her. (ONE SECOND THOUGH: PYRO CAN AIRBLAST PROJECTILES AND EXTINGUISH BURNING TEAMMATES BY USING M2, OR MOUSE 2). 4. demoman: arguably the most powerful class in the game, demoman is here to bring diversity to the game. (y'know, because hes scottish). anyways, demoman, while having the same 175 health as pyro, has one distinct advantage: the stickybomb launcher. this bad boy does 60 damage per sticky, meaning that spamming it on a public game makes you a bad player that should go back to playing minecraft and the hundredth jumpscare game pewdiepie just played. 5. heavy: also considered one of the weakest in the game (especially without a medic latched onto him 24/7) heavy is the mascot for TF2. this bald, bear wrestling, russian giant shows none of his ruthlessness in the game, but rather the comics (which even then he realy kind of doesn't). heavy has 300 health! "wow!" you must think, until you learn his disadvantages. he is the slowest and has the largest hitbox in the game, making him easy to pick off from afar. 6. medic: oh boy. medic is the second fastest class in the game, just after scout. he also has 150 base health.your CoD-washed mind might think "hey wheres his souper smg ding?" well thats because TF2's medic is actually here for healing. sure, he has a syringe gun (which is basically a flamethrower without afterburn) but no sane medic would rush into a fight like that, as he'd die near instantly. (each class has their own way of dealing 100+ damage in one shot, though this is mostly up to crits/ actual skill). instead, medic uses his medigun, a long, black, healing device that can patch up your teammate's wounds in seconds! plus, when you have full "ubercharge" you can either have increased healing, full invincibility, 100% chance of everything your teammate does being a critical hit, or a tiny uber that increases your resistance to a certain type of attack, and gives you health for the damage the person you're healing recieves. 7. engineer: engineer builds sentries, dispencers, and teleporters. sentries will guard an area, sitting in place waiting for some unsuspecting scout to run in and get blasted away by tons of bullets (and rockets when your sentry reaches max level). dispencers health and provide ammo for you and your teammates. teleporters are capable of sending your teammates from one side of the map to the other, however, all these buildings require a lot of care, as they are susceptable to many attacks, and will do no damage to stock ubers (the kind that grants full invincibility). and since you'll probably be taking care of your buildings and aimbot, engineer only has 125 health. 8. sniper: sniper, if played right, can outdamage demoman! even though sniper only has 125 health, he has the longest range out of every class, what with a sniper rifle and all. sniper is the one of the only classes that can kill a fully overhealed heavy in less than 3 seconds. the sniper rifle isn't like most sniper rifles in other games. having good aim is essential to playing sniper, as his main source of damage is getting headshots, otherwise he'll normally do only 50 damage. 9. spy: spy is a real sneaky rat. he can diguise as any class, sap buildings (turning them off and eventually destroying them unless the engineer hits and breaks the sapper), his main "deal" is that he can "backstab" enemies. backstabbing someone is always an instant kill, with only for a few exceptions. TF2 is a great game, and I suggest you look into it.

Despite unpaid efforts from the community creators for a year. A new gamemode with grappling hooks and 9 modifiers is okay though, because Valve. Fundamental changes to classes that have existed in a thriving game for 7 years, because apparently they were the reason this game went downhill. Also, gimmick weapons that seek to support the handicapped players. Danger Shield still in. Minisentry is still broken.  you, Valve.

review: Short Review: Go And ing Download It Long Review: Team Fortress 2 is definantly the best Free to Play game out there. There are so many different game types in TF2 from CTF,Mann vs Machine and even the Hidden. You can get any weapon by crafting,trading or finding, without using real money. Although you are limited to a short backpack space as you start off, you can easily purchase a 10c item to upgrade to premium and get heaps more spaces. Even though being released 7 years ago there is always an update around the corner. One of the best things about TF2 is that if you get an item which is festive,vintage, strange,genuine, collectors and more you can sell it on the steam market and get real steam credit. I know I have got a a lot of moeny from selling my items, some people even get 500 of steam credit, by selling a rare/awesome item. I can`t possibly list all the things you can do in TF2, but overall Team Fortress 2 is the best game ever, it even beats all my paid games. :)

review: First off, I want to start by saying that I have had quite a lot of experience with this game, and all the different mechanics in it, which make it very interesting. TF2 really isn't just your ordinary shoot-and-run game, it has much more to it than just aiming a gun and pressing M1. The classes are what really make the game stand out of the crowd. Classes are divided in to three different types, offensive classes, defensive classes and support classes. I'm going to go through all of the different classes and their purposes in the game. OFFENSIVE CLASSES: The Scout: He's fast and effective at doing objectives. Double jumps and speed make him move quite unexpectedly. He might be fast and do good damage, but he is quite weak. Equipped with a scattergun, a pistol, and a baseball bat. The Soldier: He's slow, but deals quite a big splash damage with his rockets. He has quite a lot of health so he can take quite big hits as well. Equipped with a rocket launcher, a shotgun, and a shovel. The Pyro: It's quite self explanatory with the name. Pyro does a lot of damage with it's close range flame thrower, and can also airblast enemy projectiles (rockets, grenades, sticky bombs). Equipped with a flame thrower, a shotgun and a fire axe (ironically) DEFENSIVE CLASSES: The Demoman: He is a drunk black scottish man with one eye. Demoman is the class who uses explosives, much like the Soldier. He can also take a big hit, but not as well as the Soldier. Equipped with a grenade launcher, a stickybomb launcher (the bombs stick to walls, and are detonatable) and a bottle. The Heavy: A big man, with a big gun and a big Russian accent. He's the most tanky class in the game, and has a freaking minigun. Be wary though, he is very slow, and usually depends on having a Medic. Equipped with a freakin' minigun, a shotgun and his bare freakin' fists. You really wouldn't want to mess with him. The Engineer: He's one of the more unique classes in the game, he can build an automatic sentry gun that shoots at enemies, a dispenser which gives him and teammates health and ammo and a teleporter to get your comrades faster to the frontlines. When an engineer is good, it is a game changer definitely. Equipped with a shotgun, a pistol, a wrench and a construction- and destruction PDA. SUPPORT CLASSES: The Medic: He's the one who is responsible of keeping the whole team alive, and you should definitely protect him. He's a german doctor, who might be a bit on the crazy side... Equipped with syringe gun (ouch), a medi gun (a gun that is used to put a healing beam on your teammates) and a bonesaw. The Sniper: He can quite easily pin down key enemy targets like heavies from a long distance, but is also quite weak, and vulnerable to Spies. This Australian man is effective in long range, but starts to get less effective when in close range combat, since the Sniper doesn't have much health. Equipped with a sniper rifle, an SMG, and a kukri. The Spy: A lady killer (figuratively) and a man killer (literally). The spy is a stealth class who can get behind enemies, turn invisible, disguise as other players, disable and destroy Engineer buildings and effectively kill unaware enemies with one stab in the back. Definitely one of the more interesting classes. Equipped with a revolver, a butterfly knife, a disguise kit, an invisibility watch and a sapper. I would also like to point out that this game has had an unusually long lifespan! It's been over 7 years since the release of the game, and people still play this actively! Although the economy has went down the shitter. I was thinking of typing about the different types of unlockable weapons in the game, but this is already a really long review in itself, so I'll let you guys look into them yourselves. If you want to play an FPS-shooter that's out of the norm, TF2 would definitely be something I would recommend. It's free and fun. Phewh. It's been quite a job writing all this. Lastly I would like to state that this is my favourite game of all time, and I hope you guys found this review interesting and or helpful! Go out and play this awesome game (for free). Peace.

review: Though my actual in-game hours is closer to 600 hours, Team Fortress 2 (TF2) is one of the best first-person shooters of all time. Feeling the need to just fool around? TF2 is hilariously comical. Feeling the need to play competitively? TF2 has a very high skill cap. Feel the need for variety? TF2 has mounds of variety. Verdict: Team Fortress 2 is a game where just when you think you have had enough of it, it lures you back in and leaves you thinking, "man, I totally love this game."

review: Team Fortress 2 is a unique game in many respects, first and foremost being just how much (and for how long) it's been updated. While it's only recently gone Free, Valve has been supporting the title for years with rather significant content additions, and game-breaking bugs tend to get squashed within hours or days, rather then the months that some other companies take with even their flagship titles. It's also interesting in the fact that you don't actually have to be a living god at first-person shooters to do well or support your team. The Engineer and Medic help their allies out with their buildings and healing abilities, and the hundreds of items available can change any of the classes' capabilities significantly. And, of course, the game is infamous for it's cosmetic items, such as the hats, which don't typically provide any real bonus but do allow you to customize your character further. You have to play this game. And if you're on Steam, you already own it!

review: THE GOOD Team Fortress 2 is not your ordinary game. Focusing on its cartoony graphics, offbeat humor and wide variety of game modes and player classes, but it will definitely put some people off. If you're a person who likes team-based multiplayer first-person-shooter video games, I think this game is for you. The sound in the game is exciting overall together with the visuals. It's a perfect game. You are always updated with new incredible releases. Last but not very least, a very fun and unique shooter with cool mechanics and great teamplay is totally free to play. THE GREAT The game can be addictive and challenging if you let it. The game is very fun, with different characters and balanced. One of the best Games of all time for sure. People who call this game or boring don't know much about shooters to be honest. Each class is a really funny, cool and interesting character with an unique and awesome personality. You're not running around with an AK47 or M16, but with Syringe Guns and Sticky Bombs, it's quite hilarious. Not to mention its great item-drop system, an amazing fanbase and the community, they are the perks which keep the players from all over the world to play this game. THE UGLY There is no serious gameplay whatsoever. If the developers wanted players to have a real serious gameplay, they would have made an in-game system where players get penalized for quitting the game before the match ends. Face the facts: You can disconnect the current game any time you like even in MVM matches. Perhaps for dynamic joining and disconnecting of players of the current match, but it can be frustrating when you spend the whole damn match without stable players. Gameplay Most Team Fortress 2 game modes have 2 opposing teams, the Reliable Excavation & Demolition (RED) and the Builders League United (BLU), that compete against each other in various maps to complete certain objectives. Some game modes include: Capture the Flag: Each team attempts to steal the opposing teams intelligence briefcase from their headquarters and secure it back at their own base.

review: This is supposed to be a review for Counter-Strike: Global Offensive Dedicated Server. Apparently that's not a game. I should have known. Not only can I not play the dedicated server like it is a game, I can't review it like one either. Let me save you some time. Do not try to play Counter-Strike: Global Offensive Dedicated Server! It is not a game! If you want a comparable non-game, open the command prompt. That will save you so much downloading. It's like you have to download all the Counter-Strike: Global Offensive content, but only get to access it through command prompt. Why? Sure sure, other people can play the game on your computer because you're running a "Server" but all I get is words in a black box. Who needs that? Certainly not me! Getting shot repeatedly in Team Fortress 2 is much better. I would encourage you to play Team Fortress 2 over something like Command Prompt Simulator for Counter-Strike: Global Offensive.

review: I have to thank Team Fortress 2 for leading me for several thousand hours of gaming throughout the years. I love all the friends I made along the way aswell, but something changed in tf2. The community has nearly been abandoned by all the "old" players leaving behind a community that comes off as toxic. TF2 used to be my favorite game while update and update have many asking what's the deal with all these let downs, VALVe has started giving TF2 the short end of the stick as CS:GO and DOTA 2 take the spotlight. As TF2 and the community is right now I don't recommend getting into it anymore, both the game and the community are now a drag.

review: I'm playing TF2 since 2010 and still enjoy it. First of all one most important thing about it: it's 10x more fun when you play with friends. Here's my top 10 reasons why I love that game: 1 You don't need to be great at multiplayer FPS games (CS, Quake 3, UT etc.) to be good at TF2, of course skill, reaction and good aim helps, but as long as you know your role and if you're playing it smart you're gonna be just fine and there's always something you can figure out or learn to turn things to your advantage. 2 It has one of the best and most hilarious characters with hundreds of lines and a lot of space for random accidents that make me lol really hard even after playing it for three years. The humor in this game is great and it never gets old. 3 A well crafted balance between teams and classes and really great maps. Unlike most games with good balance this one doesn't make you feel underpowered and pressured to be a real pro or die as a noob in shame (I'm looking at you Starcraft), when you start to do things right you start to feel how powerful your class is, that feel that by doing simple things you're supposed to do is bringing the glorious victory of your team closer every passing second is priceless. 4 Complexity in simplicity: each class has a simple purpose and just few simple tools to accomplish it. The complex gameplay of TF2 is made of very simple concepts, like "rocket launchers hurt people", "if you get an ubercharge you can use it and make yourself and the guy you're healing invulnerable and push through heavy resistance", "airblast - alternate fire of your flame thrower, is pushing things away, players, rockets and even arrows, also it extinguishes allies and saves them from burning to death", "spies may look like one of your teammates, but act suspiciously, smack their face with your wrench" and one more simple thing most new players are having a hard time to figur out for some reason: "engies can actually help other engies to build and defend!" 5 there are no weak or powerful weapons, most weapons are the same as your default weapons except they are slightly better in something and a bit worse in other thing. You don't need to know the entire arsenal of the game, you just need to find the weapons that are most appealing to your playstile. Also there are a few weapons change the way you play, like engie's gunslinger, you can't build big fat and mean sentries, you build a small mini-sentry, however equipping that thing gives you HP boost, and makes you a mobile obnoxious prick who runs around and builds and instantly deploys those annoying mini sentries whenever he feels like. 6 Most items are cosmetic, that means you don't need to have any hats, high level or money spent in game's store to be effective, some weapons that will amplify your strong traits would be a good addition though and those are very easy to get. Also despite those cosmetic items thanks to the good character design all classes are very distinguishable, you always know what to expect from a fat guy with a minigun and you always know you should kill the dude in white coat because he heals others. Still you can get some cosmetic items and look badass or funny. 7 The game is constantly updated, every now and then you get new maps, modes, bug fixes, balance fixes, weapons and cosmetics. Sadly Valve gets more lazy and greedy with each new major update and makes more hats rather than real content. 8 They got it right with graphics. I remember playing other modern FPS games and that was terrible! All those "eye candy" effects, strong contrasts, "cinematic" camera movement, "realistic shaders/lighting/effects, poor character design and "spectacular" explosions were very distracting and were making it really hard to tell what's going on before it would be too late. 9 It's all about teamplay and mission goal rather than killcount and skill. A team of average players who help each other will always be stronger than a team of disorganized show-offs with mad skillz who play their favorite class even when the team needs a medic and engie and don't care about anything but their killcount. 10 Valve puts a lot of effort each year to make the Haloween event in TF2 very VERY awesome. However there are things I don't like in TF2: 1 Community. LOTS of obnoxious kids, trolls, pretentious jerks and total s. 2 Trading. I hate it, I really-really hate it. 3 Painfully stupid people. This game introduced me levels of stupidity I couldn't even imagine. 4 Bugs. There are some really annoying gameplay and performance issues with the game and Valve pretends really hard that everything is cool. 5 Cheaters. Sometimes there will be some  who will ruin everyone's game by flying through walls and spawncamping with 100% accuracy and 100% crits. However there are some guys who use not so obvious hacks and claim they knew where you were and hit you from an impossible angle and distance for ten times in a row just because they are so good at this game and you're a stupid butthurt noob. 6 Server customization. Finding a server that has good ping, vote menu enabled, good map list and doesn't have custom music, idiotic settings like instant respawn, ads or other  are very hard to come by. Hope this was helpful.

review: TF2 is a good game, it is fun in many aspects like characters, voices, hats, maps, etc Nowadays i just play this game to jump around everything and have some fun in community gamemodes like Deathrun, surf, parkour and fun servers. Over the years the gameplay of the game has changed, valve keeps doing small changes everytime, combining those changes the gameplay experience is not the same in my opinion, i think was more fun and attractive when i played the game for the 1st time, small changes like not being able to take your buildings in you hand to the spawn, the distinction between the rocket launcher and the rocket jumper, small changes to weapons... made me abandon most of the competitive gamemodes from valve. The only valve gamemode that sometimes i play is MvM and it is getting more bugged whenever a big update is released and its matching system sucks. Valve added so many hats that i don't even care about them anymore, i'm fine with my old hats. I still recommend this game but not as much as i did before.

review: Team Fortress 2 is one of the best free to play games out there with thousands, maybe millions of players on right now playing. it is really fun and 7 different classes to keep you ocuppied. there is scout class: fast and can double jump, has a very powerful shotgun that can kill an enemy with almost 2 shots. there is a soldier class, has a RPG, very power for taking out large groups of people or destroying sentry guns from long distances. there is a pyro class, has a flamethrower, good for burning large groups of people together and good for taking out surpport classes, spies, snipers and medics are easy to kill unless they have backup. there is a heavy. good for leading the way and taking out lots and lots of enemies at once, even harder to kill with a medic assisting them and healing them, unstoppable when the ubercharger is ready and activates and thats when the heavy is at its best, has a big gun and loves it like his own son. there is a demoman, has a grenade launcher and sticky bomb launcher, lays sticky grenades near doors and waits for a enemy to come through and blows them up which pisses some people off sometimes, their grenade launcher is good for corners and hitting the enemies beside the corner and taking them out, unlocks a sword and can charge at enemies and can kill them with one shot unless its a heavy. there is a engineer which its main weapon is the shotgun and of course its mechanical tools to help kill the enemies, the engineer can make teleporters; entrance and exit point, a dispencer, heals him and friends, and a sentry gun which kills and protects a certain area placed in, has a limited sight and cannot shoot from far distances, all the things can be upgraded to level 3 which is the last and best levels. there is a spy, has a pistol and knife to backstab enemies quickly and quietly, the spy is a quiet and sneaky basterd that pisses off the enemies so they rage quit the game so the friends get a better advantege in life and make their job easier. the spy can go invisable and hide from enemies to help make them live longer and hide from enemies who caught them backstabbing their friends and want payback. the spy can sap the engineers teleporters; both, dispencer and the sentry. the medic has a needle gun and a ubercharger that heals friends. the medic is very important in helping the offensive time. if medic and heavy combine and the ubercharger is ready they are invincible and not a force to be reckened with. the medic and shoot needles at enemies and when the needles hit the enemies the medic gets 2 health back for every hit. the medic gets 2 hp per second as a medic and which no class can do that. special ability is to ubercharge and be unstoppable for a short amount of time. and finally the sniper. the snipers main gun is the sniper rifle, its his best weapon and takes out enemies from a far and safe distance one at a time. he a sub-machine gun and is his secondary weapon for medium range combat. his machette is for close combat situations if a spy tries to take him out or tries to run away or a enemy comes and it becomes a close combat round. the sniper gains focus whenever he keeps his scope in for along time and deals more damage. his machette is a powerful weapon and can kill a spy and a scout in 2 hits, other classes 3 to 5 hits at least. thats all the classes ive covered. the maps are amazing and highly detailed, and new maps coming in from the community every month. new guns being made, skins and character customization to personalise your own class to make u unique and one of a kind. new abilities for classes and more to come, stuff to buy at the tf2 store (man.co) is what its called, i think its highly over priced but if u dont have a thing and u want it bad, go to the store and buy it (dont recommend that when u could just keep playing and wait to unlock it the hard way i better most of the time) ok thats covers tf2, hope u like my review and please rate it. i give Team Fortress 2 9/10 from: arcade

review: Team Fortress 2 is a fun, quite addicting FPS multiplayer game. You can play as 9 different classes, including Demoman, Medic, Heavy, Soldier, Pyro, Engineer, Spy, Sniper, and my favorite, Scout. Each class has their different strengths and weaknesses, and their colorful personalities will keep you laughing while you play. With its fun characters, cool unlockable items, detailed maps, and the fact that its FREE, I would definitely give it a 10/10.

review: Team Fortress 2 is a very decent racing game. First of, the vehicles in this game are somewhat strange. Instead of licensed vehicles we get stuff like Heavy, Soldier, and Scout. The vehicles are all different in their own rights, for example: the Heavy is the slowest, the Scout is the fastest, and the Medic is normal speed. Classes in this game seem to be slightly broken, however. The Medic class vehicle is near useless on its own, and only serves a purpose when teamed up with a second vehicle. This will either serve to slow him down immensely, such as when healing a heavy, or let the teammate he is healing get away from him because the teammate, such as the Solider, is faster than the medic. The level design is beautiful, but Take Two, in an attempt to create an immerse and beautiful world, forgot that these types of tracks aren't really suitable for racing, taking place in such areas as underwater, in long corridors, and intelligence rooms. But some of the levels seem to be made for racing, such as 2fort, but there is no finish line, The fun thing is that each vehicle has a weapon to take out the other players. Of course, you can only take players that aren't wearing your vehicle colors. For example, the Heavy has a weapon that literally takes out everything in sight except that it slows him down to a halt, the Pyro has a weapon that sets fire to anyone and anything, and so on and so fourth. It seems similar to Mario Kart, with the various courses and powerups. However, it fails to capture the fun of Mario Kart, and instead going in an ultra-realistic direction that often looks quite boring and bland The major flaw in TF2 is that there really is no direction as to where you should be going. There are no checkpoints and no wrong way markers. Valve did include a "map" that changes between tracks but it is very confusing and really, isn't beneficial. These maps are nearly identical anyways, so changing the maps seemingly randomly only serves to aggravate the players more. While the tracks and graphics are fun and creative, this racing game is lacking in many ways. I wouldn't recommend this game to game owners if they had access to a console, as this PC-only racer doesn't seem to try hard enough to stand out from the crowd.

review: This game is one of the best free to play games I have ever played and would possibly say that it is the best overall game I have played. I do not recommend this game to any Call of Duty player who thinks they are amazing at games just by playing COD. This game will make you angry if you go in hopefull that all of your hours of COD will pay off. They wont. This game is for the adventurous people who enjoy a community based game. What I enjoy about this game is the fact that you can find weapons from enough gameplay time, the fact you can craft weapons, the achievements, the taunts, how you can install huds and change in game visuals, the range of characters and of course, the taunt kills. The taunt kills give you a sense of achievement when done on an opposing player because they are very hard to do (apart from against lazy snipers). Overall this game is highly recommended by me and others that I know. I would encourage you to download this game. - [YT] Zyaxitron Ed

review: Once upon a time, an Engineer built a sentry near some train tracks. This sentry was the bane of Red Team, killing every pedestrian that strolled by. A pyro and a Medic thought that was quite rude of the Engineer, so they spend the next 30 or 45 seconds training (And by training, I mean we were sitting in a corner building Ubercharge). We then launched an assault on the Engineer and his sentry, with our shiny puffed chests deflecting the measly bullets that the Sentry could muster. We showed the engineer why it is quite rude to fire at pedestrians. Once we were finished, the Pyro turned to thank the medic and promptly gave him a thumbs-up, but tragedy struck as the Pyro was immediately hit by the train, disappearing completely off the map. Once upon a time, Red and Blu decided to duke it out at a train station, but this wasn't an ordinary duke session. It was a "No second chances" duke that punishes dearly for the simplest mistakes. Both teams exit the spawn and commence the duking, turning into a savage mosh pit covered in blood and hats, until Red Spy and a Blu Medic remained. The medic offers a truce to the spy, promising to slap hands together and possibly sing and dance. The spy slowly stepped closer to the medic, giving the medic hope of peace, but tragedy struck as the Spy immediately stepped away and watched the medic get hit by the train, disappearing completely off the map. Once upon a time, a Blu Medic and a Blu Heavy was preparing for an ubercharge upon the Red team. The Blu Medic grinned as he heard the final spark signifying that he is ready to ubercharge. The heavy roared a blood-curdling battle cry as the medic activated the ubercharge on him, both rushing at the Reds. He turned the corner, spinning up his minigun to see a single Red medic, horrified by the sudden appearence. The heavy was about to fire, but tragedy struck as the Red Medic watched the sudden train appear and hit the Blu Heavy and Medic, disappearing completely off the map. What have I learned? Accept the train. Worship the train. Wear hats and sacrifice for the train. The hats are pretty important. Train MVP. 10/10 would train again.

review: I have never seen a game more like Call of Duty in my life. They might as well call this game "Call of Duty: Noobs n' Dudes" Now grant it, there are loads of hot dudes in this game. That is not enough to make me want to play this game over and over. I feel like it is a childish version of Call of Duty. It definitely is nowhere close to as good. This game has awful graphics, unlike Call of Duty, alright characters, and way too many weapons. A video game should not have so much customization. I want restrictions. I think I am just going to stick with Call of Duty. If you like Call of Duty, but can't afford it. I recommend getting this game. It is pretty much the same exact thing.

review: This a very entertaining game that allows you to battle with friends, or just anyone, by choosing one of nine classes that each has their own pros and cons. You will either be on team blue or team red. Obviously, the teams are against eachother and you want to battle the opposing colour. There are a variety of game modes to choose from where you must beat the other team. You can trade items, and there is even a whole currency for this game that is used in trading, or when identifying the price of your specified item. Overall I think this game is great. I highly recommend it for people who love action filled games, and who love to learn new skills. I recommend helping your team out if you would like to win, and don't leave them behind. Team Fortress 2 is a great game, but is better accomplished as a team rather than a singular person. If you've never tried the game, I recommend you give it a shot, it's loaded with entertainment, and you might just like it.

review: I played this for over 2 years and haven't reviewed it yet? Even after getting 100% achievements?! WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME?!?!?!?! Anywho, your one-stop shop for all your multi-player needs. A team-based game that turns into a free-for-all 3 minutes into the match. After months of playing and getting bad drops, you'll want better hats. You'll go to trade servers..... a lot..... Then it'll be a game about Hats, Trading, Rocket Jumping, Backstabs, Sniped Headshots, and Lazy Engineers. Well recommended.

review: Take two at a review of this game. I'll make it quick since it's early 2015 now and TF2 has been out for nearly eight years. That said, it's balanced. They keep adding things while still keeping it balanced, with a few notable exceptions. (google Short Circuit, heh) It has lots of game modes, and they keep adding more as well...with Mannpower and its grappling hooks currently in beta. There are tons of communities...many are mature, many are not. There's surely at least one for you and you'll make friends, spend thousands of hours playing. The best part is, it's not an MMO...it's a real competitive and cooperative FPS that you can pick up and put down at any time. Getting bored of the standard game modes? Try mod servers. Versus Saxton Hale/Freak Fortress 2 are the undisputed kings of the modding scene, but there's Deathrun, Prop Hunt, Dodgeball, FortWars, Jailbreak (not my thing, but meh), Slender, Hidden, TF2 Ware, TF2 karts, and so much more. The TF2 dev team has done plenty to rope people in, but it's the modders that fill in the gaps. With the absurd gameplay variety stemming from nine distinct classes, and a Player vs Player foundation, it's impossible to get bored of this game. Also, you might see a hat or two. And some ducks eating bread.

review: Team Fortress 2 is one of the most fun games I have ever owned. It's face-paced comedic FPS that has a very addicting way of making one want to play more. The nine classes (Scout, Soldier, Pyro, Demoman, Heavy, Engineer, Medic, Sniper, and Spy) have their own traits and balances that make the game fun, such as backstabbing (Spy), running faster than the other classes (Scout), and being able to rocket jump (Soldier). With tons of different weapons and a random number of classes of the other team, each round is never the same, so it never gets boring (unless one is playing Deathrun). Team Fortress 2 is also been known as a "Hat Simulator", which it basically is, considering the amount of cosmetics that each class can wear one the battlefield. Their are many different kinds of combinations of hats and miscellanious cosmetics that you never know which kind of combination you can obtain. The game has it's own humor that the characters create and sometime the game itself will cause something that will make one laugh. If one is Free to Play, then one has the choice of being Free to Play forever, or buying something from the TF2 Store and becoming Premium. The game does not force the player to buy something from the store, although the downfall to being Free to Play is that one can not trade with other people and some servers make "[F2P]" appear at the front of your name. But these are just minor things that a player can bypass if all the player wants to do is play the game without the hats and such. I fully recomend this game to anyone who wants a fast-paced FPS that likes to laugh at the often switch between comedy and intense battle. I recommend it even more if you like cosmetics that make your classes look awesome in your own way and the different varieties and stats of weapons that can change one classes health or vulnerability or even strength in damage. To me, Team Fortress 2 is my favorite game I have bought on Steam today.

review: If you're looking for a challenging FPS, that'll give you hours of competitive gameplay, aswell as an unique community, and amazingly fun weapons allowing you to get creative, look no further! Team Fortress 2 is one of the most fun, amazing, one-of-a-kind games that i've played. Not alone does the 9 different classes grow on you, the game itself is amazing! Featuring unique, fun gamemodes as Payload, or atk/def. If you're not conviced just yet, the game allows you to customize your classes with hats and miscs, community created, aswelll as valve's own! All in all, Team Fortress is by the community, for the community. Now i understand if you find looking at people, and clicking hard, or cook that grenade just right, but in Team Fortress 2 you dont nessecarily have to. There's much more to the game, than just being the first to draw fire. Heck, there aint even that many guns! To top it all off, it's free! you might think "Ah, then its a pay-to-win..", and you'd be absolutely wrong. With the unique Drop System you'll be sure to aquire new firearms by the end of the day (If not a hat or two!)

review: Ah, classic ol' Team Fortress 2. There really just is nothing like it. It has team-based combat, unlockable weapons, and most important of all... HATS! But forget about that for just a second, what makes this game so good? The humour of this game is just amazing. Every class has something nasty to say about each other, and you would know what I'm talking about if you played the game or watched the "Meet The ..." trailer/teaser series. It just makes me smile when I hear a line I've never heard before. Secondly, the team-based combat. As with most modern day FPS's (With the exclusion of the Battlefield series, somewhat.), you don't see a lot of team oriented gameplay. Take for example, Call of Duty. It's really just a run and gun experience, and that's not what teamwork really is about. In TF2 though, it really requires a good deck of cards for you to win. You need to work together to capture the control point, get the intelligence, push the cart, and etc. It can get rather intense, with either your team or the other team trying to do a push. That is one aspect that I love about TF2. Next, the unlock/drop system. With games such as Call of Duty, you need to level up in order to gain new weapons and attachments for your current weapons. But with TF2... No need. They drop randomly. Every weapon has its advantages and disadvantages, making them virtually balanced either way. But do note that these are only SIDE-GRADES, not overall upgrades from your stock weapons. Your stock weapons are just as effective as your new weapons, but droppable weapons do have stat bonuses and stat drops that your stock weapons do not have. Every unlockable weapon is suituational to some degree. So it is important to plot out which weapon you will use. The thing you've been waiting for... HATS! While not all that important, hats do add some flair to the game. They give you customization options to your class, which can often result in a rather spectacular looking player to not only look at, but play as. But, how do you get hats? It's somewhat complicated, really. Standard "Unique" quality hats drop rather rarely, but you can get them from unlocking crates or trading. You can get "Genuine" hats by ordering a game that has a special compaign that gives you the hat for free if you buy that game. Then there's the real meat of this whole "hat" thing... The holy unusual hat... Yes, they're rare and expensive to obtain. But they give you a feeling of satisfaction and achievement once you do get one for the first time. ESPECIALLY IF you unbox one, that is rather hard to do on the first try. But hats don't add anything special to the game, really. Same with stranges and killstreak weapons, they only track your kills. (Obvious difference is that Stranges track your lifetime kills, while killstreak weapons count how many kills you got in one life.) But yes, I do recommend this game. It is a nice game to play for a few hours and hopefully find something new to do that you never did before.

review: Let's start with the fact, that I have never write any review, so don't be too harash with mine, please. Team Fortress 2. What can be said about this game? Some people might just look at it and say: "Regular FPS. You play with maybe even 100+ people a day, and shoot to win." Or is it? What I like mostly about TF2, is the fact that everything there is build on the TEAMWORK. After all, this is called "TEAM Fortress 2", not "Deathmatch Fortress 2". Playing as a lone wolf will lead you to no where, and even eventually make you rage quit from playing this game. For good. It's not about your high score, or how many kills you get at the end of the round. (altough it still motivate you to fight more and shows that you are the experienced player to others) It's all about doing the objective together with your team, to win the game. And every new game there is completely different than previous one, so working together as a team is really important with every challenge that comes with every new game mode, team members and map the game is going on of course. So we already know, this game is all about team work, and doing current game objective. Got it? Good, and keep it that way! Let's go with the next thing - weapons! Even though there's not many of them, as the cosmetic items (that would be something) there's still a lot of them, to pick and choose from. And most of the weapons usually change to way of playing your current class, so it makes the game even more interesting and challenging. We have weapons that heal or overheal you on killing your opponent, slow down enemies who are shot, gives you speed boost, hurt enemy after attacking him... the list is long, every weapon have it's pros and cons, so everyone can choose, try out every weapon and stick with it, as this style of fighting with it fits him most. Thus makes your gameplay completely different everytime you join on a random server, with new random people. More guns = more fun. Check them out, and find your style. That's our conclusion here. One tip though - every time you will get a new weapon, don't think you have advanced to a next level or something and this new weapon is way better than the previous one! Carry on... Classes you're playing! There are 9 playable classes in game, avalible from the beggining, so there's no any "This class avalible after reaching that level." No. You can play as who do you want, from the beggining. So you can try out every game style and see which one fits you most, as with every class you're playing completely diffrently than with previous one. So, the classes are: Scout, Soldier, Pyro, Demoman, Heavy, Engineer, Medic, Sniper and (my favourite) Spy. Every class have it's pros and cons, just like the weapons you can get so the choice of your favourite one are a little easier. For example - Scout is the fastest one of all the classes, can make double jumps and even capture points 2 times faster than anyone else. But he is really easy to kill in battle, unless you're good at dodging incomming spam of bullets and rockets. Much better for a frontal attack are classes like Soldier, armed with his rocket launcher and the possibility to do a "Rocket Jump" to help him reach bigger distances in a short time, due to the fact he's really slow. But that's just a short example of everything that each class is avalible of. And honestly? Too lazy to write down all of them, that's all... meh. Worth to mention, that every class have it's own personality, which makes them a bit more cooler and interesting to play with. Another example? Fine. Scout is pretty much kind of a cocky guy, who likes to annoy others, and think that every girl wants him, and every guy wish to be like him. Soldier is a stereotypical example of an American patriot, who most likely lost all his brain cells durning WW2. Heavy is a very calm and serious guy, until his minigun starts to spin and the battle starts. Then he's like a wild, angry bear, that hates people. And so it goes as well, with the other 6 classes. So, 9 different mercs for a usually 12-24 teams. Sounds cool? Because it is... that is, until most of them are only Spies or Snipers. Exactly, most of the players think that this game is like CoD - thus they go full sniper force, believing they have nailed everything. No, no, NO! This game is nothing like CoD! A team full of snipers, will never win. I was once in a team where out of 10 players we had 8 snipers, one spy and a soldier which was me. So, I think you can say how that round went? (inb4 MLG jokes) So, what I mean is - teamwork is important, we know that. But, when there's not enough classes that will provide enough firepower for the team, the teamwork won't help you much, or does not exist there at all. Okay, time to move on to... HATS! This is something completely random, that makes this game unique. In this game, you can wear on every class a nice and fancy hat, or other cosmetic, that will make you look diffrent from the others. Here's my question - can you wear a hat in every other FPS, than Team Fortress 2? No. Or dance Conga? Of course not. Or being a total annoying brat and taunting after every kill, no matter how much skill you put into your kill? Of course not! Another reason why TF2 is so unique, and why we love it so much. Okay, slowly getting tired of thinking what to poot here. So, conclusion time! Team Fortress 2 is an awesome game, unique in her own beautiful way and great to play. I recommend playing it, together with your friends! "But they have no money..." This game's free! Just download, learn how to play and get good! The only thing that makes me really angry about this game are most of the time unbalanced teams, the autobalance curse in the worst possible moment of the round, or the fact the prices are getting higer in its shop...

I don't think I'm the only one who thinks this game is not only helping Steam, but Valve as a whole. They make money off of hats and the market, and we have Awesome looking hats/weapons that are fairly balanced, and have fun. It is truly the Win-Win situation at hand. Keep Making great games Valve!

That is one aspect that I love about TF2. Next, the unlock/drop system. With games such as Call of Duty, you need to level up in order to gain new weapons and attachments for your current weapons. But with TF2... No need. They drop randomly. Every weapon has its advantages and disadvantages, making them virtually balanced either way. But do note that these are only SIDE-GRADES, not overall upgrades from your stock weapons. Your stock weapons are just as effective as your new weapons, but droppable weapons do have stat bonuses and stat drops that your stock weapons do not have. Every unlockable weapon is suituational to some degree. So it is important to plot out which weapon you will use. The thing you've been waiting for... HATS! While not all that important, hats do add some flair to the game. They give you customization options to your class, which can often result in a rather spectacular looking player to not only look at, but play as. But, how do you get hats? It's somewhat complicated, really. Standard "Unique" quality hats drop rather rarely, but you can get them from unlocking crates or trading. You can get "Genuine" hats by ordering a game that has a special compaign that gives you the hat for free if you buy that game. Then there's the real meat of this whole "hat" thing... The holy unusual hat... Yes, they're rare and expensive to obtain. But they give you a feeling of satisfaction and achievement once you do get one for the first time. ESPECIALLY IF you unbox one, that is rather hard to do on the first try. But hats don't add anything special to the game, really. Same with stranges and killstreak weapons, they only track your kills. (Obvious difference is that Stranges track your lifetime kills, while killstreak weapons count how many kills you got in one life.) But yes, I do recommend this game. It is a nice game to play for a few hours and hopefully find something new to do that you never did before.

review: Team Fortress 2 is a popular F2P FPS over the country. This game is actually one of the best game Valve ever made, I'm not saying that this game is the best one among all the games that Valve made. The only thing players love about this game are hats, yes, hats, the economy of Team Fortress 2 will be hats ans cosmectics. Why not weapons you said, well, it is very difficult to have a new weapon because of the weapon's stats and when a weapon goes wrong, the game will not be balanced making this "unfair". So, I know some of the players in Team Fortress 2 just focus on weapons and not focusing on hats and they just quit Team Fortress 2, I know a lot of players did this because who doesn't want new weapons? Now... Valve are now looking into the Steam Workshop of Team Fortress 2 to find new weapons for the game and even hats, every damn time. Yes, you're actually playing the future Hat Simulator. When I first played Team Fortress 2, around 2008, I forgot where I started playing it, but nevermind, just stick to around 2008. This game is well optimized, but it sucks up a lot of your CPU Usage though. This game is well optimized, I said again, I mean, most maps are smooth making you having a good FPS. Well, Valve is actually a big company due to popular, fun, optimized game and etc... The graphics in this game looks "cartoonish" and when the Graphic settings are all "Low" the game will still run the graphic to "pretty". I know that graphics doesn't make a game better, only story does. Oh and I forgot to mention that this game has a story, just check their wiki and read the comics, the story won't show up in-game. And let's get back to the graphic I last said, the graphic looks "cartoonish", I mean, who doesn't like cartoonish graphics? Trust me, it's beautiful, just like the Borderlands series, it's cartoonish. There are 9 classes in this game: Scout, Soldier, Pyro, Demoman, Heavy, Engineer, Medic, Sniper, Spy. The Scout focus on speed and agility and Scout captures Control Point x2 faster. The Soldier focus on DPS by using his Rocket Launcher, very useful on a pocket Medic. The Pyro will uses "his" or "her" Flamethrower to start a fire to the enemy for afterburn damage. Demoman will focus on defense and offense with his Stickybomb Launcher due to the DPS or he can focus on Melee or Demoknight for short. The Heavy is the tank, he's also good at being a pocket and also wield a Minigun but the damage isn't high. The Engineer focuses on defending and uses his Sentry Gun to defend points, he can also equip the Gunslinger to build Mini-Sentry and also becoming Offensive Engineer, the Engineer can use his Shotgun or Pistol to deal with enemies instead of his Sentry doing it. The Medic focuses on Support, the medic is a MUST on all team due to healing and ubercharge. The Sniper also a support class, the sniper stays back front of the battlefield to support his team-mates. And lastly, the Spy, he is very mysterious, you won't know he is behind you or not you better watch out his backstabbing skills and also watch out for your "fake" team-mates, the spy can disguise as your team-mate and act like them so watch out! After a lot of hours playing this game, I should like to rate: 10/10 Amazing

review: It does hurt not to recommend this game after I've spent so much time on it, but I just can't recommend it anymore. The last updates prove that the TF2 development team is just not in touch with the game anymore, the awful optimization issues make this game unplayable, sometimes even for people who have great computers, and the community is slowly dying. People are moving on to CS:GO and DotA 2, just like me. I really do feel like TF2 is dying. Hopefully a Source 2 port and a competitive matchmaking update can fix these problems.

review: Probably one of the greatest time and money sinks that Valve has ever come up with -- Other than Steam itself -- Team Fortress still holds up years after its original release, regardless of what anyone is telling you. Yes, the hats start to get annoying and sometimes just a bit too flashy, but it still retains a brand of humor that is wholly unique in what it does. For those unfamiliar, TF2 is a Class Based Shooter, based on the Team Fortress mod for Quake and Team Fortress Classic, which was a mod for the original Source Engine. A CBS is commonly a First-Person shooter, such as Enemy Territory, Battlefield, and Battlefront, although some CBS titles, like Battle of Heros, is a Third-Person shooter. TF2 is the former. Unlike the example titles, however, both teams are exactly the same, and neither side has any kind of special unit or weapon that's only available for that side (Unlike Battlefront giving each of the four factions a Unique Unit with Unique weapons). There are nine classes in total: Scout, Pyro, Soldier, Demoman, Heavy, Engineer, Medic, Sniper, and Spy. This is also quite a few more classes than some other game have had (Again as an example: Battlefront had only six classes per team, and some Battlefield titles, such as Hardline, only have four classes). Although it is a lot of classes, each one carries a bit of weight, and can be very important to a team (Although in general play, teams will have multiple members of each class, and some cases one class will not even exist during a game). The Scout is a fast moving class that can get in close with a shotgun and blast enemies at close range, and then quickly pull out to evade a counter-attack. The soldier, while slow moving, is armed with a very powerful rocket launcher. The Pyro moves fairly quickly, and needs to get close to make use of his flamethrower. These are considered to be the offensive classes, and are meant to push for an objective. The Demoman can create explosive traps with sticky bombs, and has excellent melee capabilities. The Heavy wields a minigun and has a very high amount of health, which makes up for his slow walk. The Engineer can build ammunition dispensers and automated turrets which will shoot any nearby enemies. These are the defensive classes, and are used to hold a position (Although Heavies, when paired with a medic, can also turn into a menacing offensive force). The Medic, as the name suggests, heals team-mates in the thick of battle. Snipers, again as the name suggests, use a sniper rifle to pick off enemies from a safe distance. Spies can cloak themselves and get behind enemy lines to take out deadly players with a swift one-hit-kill backstab with a knife. These are the support classes, and are meant to help the rest of the team succeed. As mentioned this game has objective based gameplay, such as capturing points, stealing intelligence (Capture the Flag), King of the Hill, and several kinds of demolition based missions. So, probably not as advanced as an Enemy Territory game, but probably a bit more mission related flesh than a Battlefront game. So if you like team based class shooters, give TF2 a try. The base game is free, and the cosmetics are optional. There are a lot of extra weapons available to all players, and new content is added semi regularly, though mostly in the form of cosmetics. Sometimes new weapons are added too. Also, the community is still quite large, and community servers host a barrage of custom maps and content that can enhance the experience.

review: I like this game but it WILL ruin your life let me tell you now First it starts out simple... you don't want to be that scrubby f2p who achivement farmed for the dumb f2p hats... you spend your first 5 dollars on the mann co store... clearly not understanding the market much at this point you uncrate the keys you already feel you've wasted your money on you get absolute rubbage you cry you unbox more (repeat for at least a month) You now realise you've begged your parents multiple times to just spend "5 dollars..." You've wasted it all on overpriced mann co store items or cheap genuine cosmetics every other p2p player has You have succesfully spent more money on everything besides the nice items "unusuals for example" you wish you had one you cry you realise if the amount of steam funds you have wasted on the game was your backpack value you wouold have atleast 30 dollars more in inventory items. you learn about tf outpost you think its magical you either get lowballed a/o phised more then once your desperate attempt to profit has failed you go full  you loose your cool you take your (at max 20 dollar value) inventory and spam the first person you find on outpost who has an unusual with trade offers giving them your whole backpack you get lowballed an unusual you dont care its got a purple font and crappy special effects... you must be rich now right? You realise i've used the word "you" 30+ times already you keep reading the review you now decide to sell your unusual on the market wait... 30 bucks oh my god sells for 20 in rage to get quick money wastes on overpiced games he could of got cheaper on r/gametrades cry's even more you wish you were dead you decide to take the 4 ref value backpack you somehow scraped up in the time you suffered from your lowball depression endurance stage, You go full  again and give it away you quit tf2 to play counter strike you miss tf2 you come back and get depressed again (repeat) Note: this actually happened to me Another note: I have 600+ hours of gametime and still can't decide wether i like tf2 or not

review: This is a well made, stylized, team based first person shooter. Teamwork is needed to win at higher levels of play, though lone wolfing is fine on lower skill levels such as on most public servers. There are 9 classes to choose from. Each class has unique weapons and abilities that allow each to fulfill a unique roll as part of a larger team. This provides for a challenging and rewarding experience when faced against opponents of similar or better skill levels. The game has an active dev team that continues to release updates to the game that add new content such as weapons or game modes. At the time of this review, there are two official modes of play: player versus player and 'Mann Versus Machine'. Player versus player is a mode where one team of players battles against another team of players. Within this mode, there are different types of maps. Each type of map has it's own objective or objectives for each team to achieve. 'Mann Versus Machine' is a mode where a team of up to 6 players battles against waves of bots. Players collect money from destroyed bots. The money is divided equally among players in the team and can be used to purchase upgrades and abilities for the next wave of bots. The pay to play sub-mode, "Mann Up", gives rewards upon completing a "tour". In addition to the official modes of play, there are several player made mods that introduce other modes of play such as 'Versus Saxton Hale', where a team of players battles against a player playing as a character named Saxton Hale; 'Dodge Ball', where two teams of players playing as Pyros must airblast rockets and other projectiles back and forth in order to stay alive; 'Zombie Mod', where a team of players must make it to the end of the map without dying to zombies that are played by other players; to name just a few of the many player made mods available. In addition to game play, players will randomly receive free items from the game. Some of the free items given out are weapons, hats and crates. Hats can be worn by a class to change the appearance of that class. Crates can be opened with a key. Keys can be purchased from the Mann Co Store or from the Steam Community Market or traded for from another player. Most crates will list which items can be found within them. The game has several communities for a player to choose from if a community is what you are looking for. The game is easy to pick up and play, either alone or with friends, yet has a depth of play that will keep you from becoming bored too quickly. The dynamics between the different classes, weapons, play styles, skill levels, modes and maps provides content for many hours of play. I have been playing since November 2007 and I still return to the game on a regular basis.

review: Always on the first favorite game on my library, First time trying pyro class and got stuck on it! Awesome game for try our Teamwork to win on battle, And have been returned and got bored on pyro class ,head over my pointer to try scout class with killstreak gun and and its my favorite class till now. You can't just go soloing on the arenas, you need a great Teamwork to get in the good place like in the game title. Highly recommended this game at all first person shooter sequel, would try and should try this game! The first thing that you must know from this game is, This game was fully for free to play, doesn't valuable player can win at once you can just start with item drop to be the great one at battle but i'm not. Let me tell some deep thing about this game, the grapich and texture on the game already at the top points and depend on how far you can handle it. There are two team you can join that is Red and Blu or Blue(mostly called it Blu). Many class that you can wanna be like Sniper, a burner, a medic, an heavy man, a spy class, or as a scout bring deadly itself small shotgun and more class that make you into the core. Many awesome map made by community and official creator, a Crowded server by player and official server make this game more enjoyable for in random gamer community. An stats detail about your gameplay to beat in some records, as much as achievement to unlock beat the average players and meet stranger and be a good team, all is about shoot and some teamwork require to win i need to say again. Few fun mode that you can play, the game always updated, so don't be minded is this game was old and bored, like in other day i check up on SteamCharts, almost got 70K player everyday! An active player every hours! don't think you're lonely, you can start your own story and friendship by just playing this game and be a good person, all will accepting you well. Grab your favorite class and combined item and start chillin with your friend for more fun!

review: Don't take it as a negative review, steam lacks a mixed button, some stuff in this game I like, some I hate, but I keep on playing, but first let's talk about the bad stuff. 1. F2P. Sure it boosted the game's lifespan for a few years, but all we get is idiots who kill themselves, and steal healthkits from dieing teammates when they have 1 hp missing from their total amount of hp. We were all noobs at one point in a game, however I was never this  when I joined TF2 back in 2010, HECK nobody was this stupid, how come all these F2P act like the biggest idiots on planet earth, while all the noobs back in 2010 were actually pretty good? Answer COD. Also if you say, well play on 6v6 or highlander if your serious about TF2, no, I played them multiple times and it was the worse experience I have had in any game, nothing but sticky spammer demoman, "Pro" scouts all in your face, Snipers camping and having a seizure when you go near them, and the Soldier who is the biggest  you will ever meet. Highlander is awful and 6v6 is ing dreadful, I will never play these again. 2.Hitboxes. All multiplayer source games suffer this, basiclly shoot at wall = Kill 5 enemies, and shooting AT THEM = Nothing, is it an actual glitch to even hit people in this game? *Update. FOR F*CK SAKE THE HITBOXES ARE STARTING TO GET WORSE, A SNIPER HEADSHOTS ME ( I COUNTED) 16 TIMES IN A ROW WITHOUT AIMING AT ME AT ALL AND THROUGH WALLS AND TEAMMATES! (no machina) WHAT THE SH*T?!?!? WHY DO I HAVE TO HIT SOMEONE 63 TIMES WITH A WEAPON UNTIL THE GAME DECIDES ONE OF THE ATTACKS COUNT? AND HOW COME THEY CAN INSTA KILL ME WITH WEAPONS OUT OF RANGE AND THROUGH WALLS? DO I HAVE TO SINK MORE MONEY INTO YOUR WALLET VALVE TO MAKE YOU GIVE ME BETTER HIT DETECTION? INSTEAD OF FORCE FEEDING US WITH UNCREATIVE SH*TTY HATS, HOW ABOUT YOU FIX YOUR POOR EXUSE OF HITBOXES, THIS IS THE BIGGEST REASON I LEFT THIS GAME, HOW COME EVERYONE GETS MAGIC TINY HITBOXES WHILE I GET HITBOXES THE SIZE OF THE F*CKING MOON? Thanks valve you made me look like a hothead, if you actually cared about actual fun gameplay instead of filling your wallet, we wouldn't ever had this issue. I'm sorry for that massive rant, it's the largest reason why I left, to be honest I hate most source engine games because of it, PVK2 is decent, TF2 is bad, CS:GO is awful and DINO D-DAY IS HORRENDOUS, to me the source engine is good at visuals, but it's the worst engine for multiplayer gaming of all time, I'M DEAD F*CKING SEROIUS, I PERFER RIDE TO HELL'S GAME ENGINE THEN THE SOURCE ENGINE, I hope to god that Source 2 has better hit detection. 3.Slow rate of updates. Valve is slowly leaving this game, during the 1st part of the year since 2012, we get no major updates until May-Juneish time, while we do get small updates inbetween, nothing MAJOR changes, except for the start of this year we got the strongbox pack, which gives me hope that this game comes back. 4.No weapons for a long time. I'm sick to death of seeing the same old weapons, I'm aware we are getting the EOTL update soon, but its not soon enough. The Love war weapons are all sh*t except for the shield, it makes the other shields worthless. *Update* Well EOTL is here, no new weapons and no new maps, are you f*cking kidding me, Valve just gave us the middle finger because F*ck you have some hats! The weapons from what I heard from the wiki that they have been moved to the Love&War update a few months back (for no reason) but for the map we have a  reason, "It's too hard for new players" THIS IS THE BIGGEST *T I HAVE EVER HEARD, CP_STEEL, RD_ASTROID AND TC_HYDRO OR ALL FINE, EXCEPT FOR A NEW MAP WHICH IS JUST AN EDITED CP MAP.... Valve, I know EA is your wafiu and your idol and all, but stop this, I want to enjoy an update without using my wallet, plus after 500 hats, IT'S GETTING OLD. And the EOTL movie was amazing, a review is going to be made and uploaded on my channel, let's just say it's going to be very positive. 5. The mess of balance in most weapons. Some weapons are fine, like the Buff Banner and Krizkerg, and there's  weapons that never get touched, like the Warrior's Spirit and Sharpened Volcano fragment, there are weapons that are nerfed for no reason, the Axtinguisher and Fists of Steel, there are weapons that are gimmicky and are useless without a certain weapon, like the Flying Guillotine and Air strike, and lastly there are weapons that need to be nerfed but people keep defending them because killing people hasn't been easier, like the Gunslinger and Degreaser. Valve, stop r*ping the weapons that are fun and balanced while the actual overpowered weapons get away scot free, I'm sick of seeing Gunslinger engies and Degreaser crit wh*res after 4 years of dominating, nerf them please! 6.Too much character development in one character and none in the others. Soldier is way too ing devloped, we know so much about him I'm sick of it, why don't we learn about Heavy or Medic? They have a intresting backstory, I want to know what happened to Heavy's family! Not soldier having a Raccoon Sanctuary, honestly I really don't care and all I want is some good backstory for some of the other characters. The Expiration Date movie while good has some flaws, go look on my video on my youtube channel (Channel on my profile) 7. Price of hats,miscs,taunts and weapons. 5 for a hat? F*ck that I can get 3 new games at that price, honestly its too dam high of a price, if it was like 1 per hat then that would be ok, also weapons are stupidly overpriced the most, 7 for a phlog? Yet I can find one buy drops or buy one for a scrap.... u srs vavle? *Update, all the prices have been increased..... 8.19 for a coat for Soldier? Yeah if 7.99 wasn't high enough. 8. The Community. TF2 Originally had one of the best communities ever back in 2010 and early 2011, if you were new to the game and asked for help, instead of LOL NO F2P NOOB or F*CK OFF SCUM, you get a positive response, but since the Uber update and TF2 became F2P the community became salter and salter, eventually becoming worse then the COD community and over the past few years it's getting worse, here is the best example of this "Amazing community" BP.TF is a popular website where people get the prices of items, however due to the admins being bullied or some sh*t like that, they are rising the price of keys to destroy the economy this game created, that's just sad that no one is stopping them at all, and all because of profits, if your a trader who sells keys a lot, you don't give a  until all your keys are gone or until the economy collapses which will be around June 2015 (Just a guess for now) I admit I'm a bit salty around free players, however those are mostly the ones who beg for items and act like s and act so stupid like I described on my first complaint, I have met free players who are very intelligent, but for every smart F2P, theres a million  F2P. Despite all of this I still keep playing TF2, why you ask? For one reason... Halloween. Halloween has added lots of things into TF2, spells, bosses, awesome maps and bumper cars, honestly if you find me playing TF2 I'll possibly on the following maps. Event maps Custom bumper car maps. Halloween also introduces some of the best cosmetics the game has ever seen and some of my favourites like the Cadaver's Capper for Soldier, it did introduce some crap though like the brony hat, but it's better then most hats in the game like the overrated piece of sh*t which is the Team Captain. Thank's to halloween 2014, I'm back into TF2, however I'm still very mixed about it, the awful hitboxes, terrible commuinty and awful balance make me pissed everyday, but let's be honest, what other game can you use a Bow and arrow along with some crocodile skin and a Frying pan in your pocket?

review: It was fun. It was enjoyable. Then it was free, with purchasable items. And it all went horribly wrong. Full of suspicious players, full of....STUPID items, and full of half-baked maps. It can be really fun for killing some time on a 20 player spammy server, but I'd rather stab my eyes out with spoons than try and play it competitively again. Recommended as a piss about with your mates. Trying to play it more competitively will make your brain implode.

Not since the Halloween update gave us no new bosses, infinite appearances of Merasmus and an event version of the worst map in the game. Not since the most hyped update EVER turned out to be, surprise surprise, just more hats. 10/10 scientists would confirm EotL is worse than Robotic Boogalo. Not since Smissmas gave us 7 festives instead of 9, and crappy festives at that. But before then 20/10 would spread my wallet wide for Gabe.

review: I got TF2 last year some time and have been playing ever since. You may not think 100 hours is much but it is seen as tho i play so much Minecraft. Anyway, I would reccomend TF2 to anyone because it is a really fun 'Free to play game'. I found the tutorials on how to play very easy to understand, the tutorials consist of being a certain character and going through what weapons they have and what they do. Once gone through the tutorial i went on to mulitiplayer, The multiplayer of TF2 is faultless with Countless amount of servers to choose from all having different aims like capture the point or team death match etc. You may be thinking to get better weapons you will have to buy them in the store like in other games, well thats not the case as you find items while playing, which you can use or trade with others. Making it ideal for all gamers no matter there budget. Graphics side TF2 has decent graphics with a low to zero lag experience. If you like third person shooters TF2 is for you! 10/10!

But the overall experience of this game is amazing. There are so many different game modes and so many people to play with. There are also many different ways to customize your characters. So if haven't already gotten TF2, get it. It's totally worth it.

review: Once upon a time, in a far away swamp, there lived an ornery game named Team Fortress 2 whose precious solitude is suddenly shattered by an invasion of annoying Free-to-players. There are blind mice in his food, a big, bad wolf in his bed, three little homeless pigs and more, all banished from their kingdom by the evil Squeakers. Determined to save their home--not to mention his own--Team Fortress 2 cuts a deal with Squeakers and sets out to rescue the beautiful hats to be the Squeakers' bride. Accompanying him on his mission is wisecracking Free-to-play, who will do anything for Unusuals... except shut up. Rescuing the hats from a new trader may prove the least of their problems when the deep, dark secret it has been keeping is revealed.

review: Team Fortress 2 is a popular first-person shooter, wherein you can choose to play as one of nine different classes to fit your play style. Thanks to the reliability of the community, it's usually not very difficult to find a good server. You can gain access to a diverse range of weapons and accessories to equip your character with (either by trading with other players or just playing the game on a regular basis) that further enhance your gaming experience. I always have a lot of fun when I play this game with my friends, and I would recommend it to anyone who is a fan of the genre.

The gameplay was way overwhelming for me at first. The good thing is that I wanted to join in, be more of a team player, so, I started playing more to gain more experience in how to basically, as some might say "Get good" at this game. Its really enjoyable, and with updates every now and then, it stays fresh, fun and the community are always welcome. I'd say that this game, is the one that everyone should have a go at, and if its your kinda cake, then pick up a slice, place it next to your sandvich, and get your lunchbox to the battle field and place a dispenser here! Its go time!

review: So, Team Fortress 2 is a game that is free to play and offers a fun user experience to people of a large age range. TF2 gives players the choice to play with friends and have a good laugh, or even take it to the next level with competitive gaming. One thing which I love about team fortress 2 is that almost everyone is happy to play with you and that some items in the game are created by our online community. This gives people the chance to display their own creations and hopefully bring them to life in game. TF2 is more of a relaxed game and does not require you to be good at first person shooters. This is because there is a class suited to every style of play. If you prefer to stealth and be hidden, then the spy is for you. However, if you having a bad day and you cant concentrate, why not throw out some flames with the pyro's flamethrower which requires no practice to use. There is also a large amount of different gamemodes on TF2 such as pushing a large bomb into the enemys base or even sending a rocket into space. If your a relaxed person looking for a bit of fun with a game that is not full of try harding people... then tf2 is definatly for you! I highly recomend it :) Happy gaming

review: For as long as I've been playing Team Fortress 2, I have never found myself being bored. The constant updates and additions keep the game fresh and fun. The game is starting to become more of a social experience, what with the conga lines and friendly players on opposing teams. My only concern, however, is that Team Fortress 2 may be rather intimidating to the newer players, maybe a bit overwhelming. With all of these new cosmetics, a vast arsenal of weapons, and the ability to turn any bloody battlefield into a parade has changed the face of shooters. I'm afraid that newer players may start playing and will be immediately turned off by either the vast personalities and items, or just the overall sillyness. Regardless, TF2 remains a great game over 7 years after its initial launch. Props to you, Valve!

review: Hey random, watch out, theres a super subjective review ahead! After over 3000 hours of playtime in this game I can surely say that it is one of the best games I have played (yet), the 9 classes, numerous maps, many gamemodes and huge number of weapons in the game just make this a super-diverse game and very enjoyable to play once you figured out HOW to play it. Looking at TF2 from an outsiders perspective: its free2play, first downside, it doesn't look too serious, theres are a ton of cosmetics and you can buy stuff from a store... seems pretty much like a pay2win game right? Well it isn't! Cosmetical items ALL only have visual effects on your character and don't matter, weapons however do all have diffrent, sometimes even completely classchanging stats, which may or may not be usefull, depending on the situation you are in. (Stockweapons being the most realiable ones in pretty much EVERY situation) You get weapons through item-drops, there are around 7 item-drops per week, the counter resetting on thursdays, so there you go, you can get all the items (except some special ones that have diffrent visuals but otherwise are just reskins of their "normal" counterparts) through just playing the game! It might take you some time of course, but I think that being overwhelmed by all the unlocks and not knowing what they do as a starter, could more easily lead to frustration than getting them after each other and checking out what they do, then deciding if they are usefull or not. (Psst, you can also find HATS!) Gameplaywise, its a pretty fun experience (occasionally annoying randomcrits and some unbalanced weapons aside) and you can actually have a BLAST playing it with your friends! TF2 has a class for every type of player, there's a stealth-guy, theres a sniper-dude, theres some big slow guy with a freaking minigun, theres some really fast dude, and so on, also it's, like I mentioned before, free2play, so whenever you are bored, why not jump into the game with some friends, have fun for an hour or 2 and quit the game without having spent any money! Actually, if you get further interested in the game, it also has a competitive side to it, the skill ceiling is incredibly high, I myself for example have only managed to be semi-good at ONE of the nine classes, and am not able to play in a competitive division higher than steel (one of the worst), even with my 3000 hours of playing the game! Yes there are people like me that take that game serious! And you know what? It's amazing to play in a team of nice people and try your heart out just to lose because of teams that actually know what they are doing wrecking you... (You can't blame it on unfair unlocks or randomcrits either, both aren't existent in comp...). SUMMARY! Good: -many maps, classes, gamemodes, weapons, for alot of variety -actually not pay2win, pay2lookgood instead -huge trading community, if you are good you can trade your way up and own virtual items with real world value! -enjoyable competitive formats (go to playcomp.tf to get more info) -playstyles for everyone -visually appealing artstyle -ALOT of mechanics -features amazing fun, hilarious moments and people falling off cliffs Bad: -some unbalanced weapons (though counterable with an ounce of coordination) -occasionally annoying randomcrits (random critical hits) -hard to get into all the diffrent mechanics at start -actually pretty badly optimized, all the updates made the game run slow on "casual" machines -as a free2play you only have 50 backpack slots, any kind of investment in the store however (which start at a few cents), increases your backpack size to 300 slots (defenitely enough) P.S.: Theres quite some stuff I haven't actually talked about like the actually challenging co-op missions in MVM and community created gamemodes and maps! Go ahead and boot up the game in order to have a nice time! :D

review: I recommend this game to anyone who has never heard of Steam before. I've been playing TF2 since 2009, and I wish I had instead been playing since the 2007 beta. This is a fun game to play, and the ability to use SourceMod to create custom plugins to add new features to the game is one of the greatest selling points in my opinion. Look at all the wonderful gamemodes we've received such as VS Saxton Hale, Slender Fortress and many others. As well, being a lover of beta/unused/cut content in games, and TF2 being jam-packed with beta/unused content....well it's just plain awesome.

review: In EA's new hit title, Team Fortress 2: Band of Brothers, you play as one of nine different characters through gritty war scenarios that tell the tale of two PMC companies embroiled in a privately funded war. On one side is the REDfor team, a band of experienced Veterans based in Europe. On the other is BLUfor, a ruthless mercenary group based primarily in Russia. From the minigun-toting cigar smoking character Ivan "Heavy Weapons" to the cocky, accented demolitions expert Tavish "Smokey" DeGroot, this game will provide a whole new level of immersion with characters you care for, realistic battlefields and vehicles, and over 100 real weapons including the P90, Mossberg, M16, and a fan favorite, the Gluon Gun. For only $79.99, this game is what is described by reviewers like IGN and Gamespot the "pinnacle of modern FPS's." Pre-order it now and you can get two tactical maps of Teufort and Coldfront, a limited edition Gamer's Guide, and the "End of the Line" DLC for free!

review: This game was the reason to join Steam. After all this years, they keep adding new content that can change the way the game is played or the way your character looks with a lot of HATS!!! All the characters are different and you can be entertained by their voice-lines. The gameplay can change a lot depending on the weapon you use. It can give you an advantage on the battlefield, but they will always find a way to balance that by using a different class or weapon to stop you. The maps are very diverse and you have a lot of game modes to play. Except Hydro. Nobody plays Hydro. This game was created with the whole purpose of having fun killing each other and, after all this time, it doesn't get old. Even if you think that you still have to spend money on the game to have a bigger backpack, think it better as an investment. Because this game will give you more than just hours and hours of fun. Mann vs Machine can be as cancerous as Dota 2. So you better play it with friends or else you'll be kicked because you didn't do what some  told you to do.

Now you can equip your weapon sent to you by the achievement gods and grab a small rock, place it on your W key to win! Don't forget to hang your massive scrotum over your microsoft mouse and flail it around madly while screaming in mumble until desired success is achieved. Yes I used to main pyro. It was a necessity.

Kanye West has proven to be the most Kanyeest Kanye you can ever Kanye because his cosmetics are so Kanye. I personally use the "Best in the Kanye West" and the "West Kanye" in my Kanye slot. Overall Kanye West has given me much Kanye in Kanye Fortress 2. Kanye/Kanye would Kanye again.

review: Team Fortress 2 is the perfect Steam introduction game; if you already haven't been pulled in by the fact that this game is no less than zero dollars then let me persuade you. TF2 is filled with clever humour, wacky hats and weapons and hundreds of hours of online play. Even without a premium account you can enjoy all of the weapons bar a few promotional items and have access to any server you choose. There is a class for everyone; whether you like capturing points and intel as the scout, building sentries and dispensers to aid your team as The Engineer or remaining disguised and unseen as the Spy, Team Fortress 2 can provide this along with much more. There are 8 gamemodes in total including Mann VS Machine; not including several spin-offs and countless community generated content. The community holds considerable power in TF2; almost all of the latest updates have been under a strong community influence; including items and maps. Get TF2. Now. You have nothing to lose and I can almost guarantee that you'll have a great time.

review: I haven't played much of the game yet, but Team Fortress 2 is an incredibly fun experience that shouldn't be passed up. The game follows 9 mercenaries on two teams battling each other to the death in order to complete a certain objective depending on what game mode they are on. What really makes the game unique is that each class doesn't seem too highly overpowered like in Call of Duty or Halo. Each one has their weaknesses and relies on other classes to help them stay alive. For example, the Medic class is designed to heal teammates and occasionally grant them invulnerability to bullets at the expense of a poor arsenal. He needs to be protected by the class he's healing because he can't defend for himself very well. The Engineer class relies on his Sentry turret which can be deployed to wreck havoc on enemies trying to invade his base. Along with this, he can deploy a dispenser which grants ammo/health to his team and two teleporters (good for helping them get out into battle quickly). Although he can't be with most of the others fighting on the front line, he still helps them immensely with these inventions. Along with uniquely designed classes, the art style of the game is gorgeous in its own way, as it's not too realistic with a fun cartoon art style. The voice actors for each class are hilariously over-the-top which adds to the enjoyability of playing as each of them, and even if you don't like what they seem to offer they're still worth a go. I'd defenitely recommend this game to anyone. The classes are fun, the gameplay is fun, and the visuals are even "fun", I'd say. This is probably one of the best multiplayer shooters you can come across - and it's free, too!

review: Team Fortress 2 is the best FPS Multiplayer Game I have ever played! 10/10 here's my review: Team Fortress 2 is one of Valve's games that you should have first once you made your steam account There are 9 classes you can play as so what are we waiting for? Let's meet them all! Scout: He is not as weak as you think, he has a scattergun, pistol and a bat, He is a offensive class and he can beat you up by bonking you on the head plus he's pretty fast too! Soldier: He is a pretty balance class but he is equiped with a Rocket Launcher, Shotgun and a shovel (yep, it's a shovel) He's also offensive too and also can rocket jump too as in jump very high with the help of his Rocket Launcher. Pyro: What's with the fire guys? Oh it's the pyro that makes the fire with his Flamethrower, Shotgun (Same old shotgun) and a Fireaxe, He's the last offensive class and he can burn you alive. WATCH OUT SPIES Demoman: Sure he's drunk but he's a defensive class and he has GRENADES well not really unlike tf1/tfc but he uses Grenade Launcher, Stickybomb Launcher and a bottle (cuz he drunk BURB!) He is a powerful class if you use melee :) Heavy: The Heavy is a heavy weapons guy that holds the Minigun, Shotgun (again) and he's own fist. He is a defensive class and he is heavy I mean he's slow so keep that in mind if you dont want to get SNIPED in other words: He's the face of TF2 Engineer: Our buddy likes to build stuff and these buildings are useful, He Builds Sentries, Dispensers (heals) and teleporters. he fights with Shotgun, Pistol, and a wrench which use for building as well. Look out of sappers [He is the last defensive class] Medic: MEDIC! we need healing and that's where medics comes in, He's a support class that heals his teammates and he wields with a Syringe Gun, Medigun (Heals teammates) and a bonesaw. MEEEEEDIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIICCCCCCC! Sniper: G'day mates, Let's headshot our victims with this supportive class. He shoots with the Sniper Rifle, SMG and a Kukri (well not for shooting with) Watch your head and avoid getting shot by snipers. Spy: Our last & Support class, The Spy, He is very sneaky but also weak. He's uses a Revolver, a Sapper (to sap the engineer's buildings but it takes time) and finally a knife which he backstabs people with. That's Spy a Spy.....wait what? That's all of the classes and now let's talk about gamemodes, there's CTF, Control Points, Payload, Payload Race, KOTH and Arena. Okay, I don't have to explain what this game is all about because this game is SO AWESOME, you'll have fun and download this game Play Team Fortress 2 a FPS Multiplayer Game that will keep you busy for hours and also get new weapons and last thing: There's hats for your classes to wear and also some Misc such as clothes now anyway DOWNLOAD THIS GAME AND HAVE SOME FUN!

review: Team Fortress 2, seems like such an understatement when I say I recommend this. It's probably my favorite game of all time with over 2000 hours logged on it. Even though people may not like the hats and new items, personally I think that's what keeps this game alive. Every time the game feels like it's getting boring or repetitive, they add something new that makes the game feel fresh and fun. This is the only game I think I'd ever give a perfect 10/10, because the game's always expanding. The community on the other hand, is quite a lot like the Sonic fanbase, and I'll just leave it at that. In conclusion, if you haven't played this game before, DO IT; I cannot stress that enough, download it and play it. It's free, but I highly recommend buying something in it at some point in time.

review: Basically a good first-time-game, if you want to play shooting games. Graphics are unique when you compare it to other team vs team games. A big shop with a lot of clothing and free weapons makes the game more interesting, in a way that the users can get creative and style their own characters. Nine classes, makes the game more challenging and less boring, as you can just switch class when you feel like it. The videos about the characters and their histories are absolutely terrific, and the medic is something you don't see in every game, as you heal with a medic-gun and shoots with this incredible "syringe shooting gun", where in other games it's often a character with a medic-back and often with normal (often normal) guns or in use of some type of magic. Also is the game always active with players and new products in store. In all is the game catchy and available for everyone. 5/5

review: Team Fortress 2. A great game believe it or not, and the best part...it's free. Now just because it's free don't think it'll be some crappy game that's insanely pay to win, because it's not. It uses a great F2P model (that was around 8 months before the game even went F2P). The model the game uses is that everything you buy is purely cosmetic, and the weapons you can buy from the mann co store, everyone else including you can find and craft ingame. The game has many things to offer, hell the game is 7 years old and has 7 years of great content in the game. Between the hundreds of hats and weapons in the game, you can literally customize your loadout to be completely different than other players. The game has 9 playable classes: Scout, Soldier, Pyro, Demoman, Heavy, Engineer, Medic, Sniper, and Spy. I know, the class names sound generic as hell, but anyways. The classes are broken down into three tiers. Offensive, Defensive, and Support. Scout, Soldier, and Pyro being offensive. Demo, Heavy, and Engineer being defensive, and Medic, Sniper, and Spy being support. Of course that doesn't mean that you can't play any of the classes differently. If you want to be an offensive sniper then you can do that, just use the huntsman. If you want to be a defensive demo then sit back and place sticky traps. Scout: Fast, agile, can double jump and get in and do serious damage and get away easily. Soldier: Slower, deals great damage with his rocket launcher and shotgun, can rocket jump to higher ground. Pyro: Pretty high health, can ambush with his flamethrowers and cause havoc. Demoman: Can place sticky traps, charge at you with huge f*cking swords, and simply p*ss you off. Heavy: Highest health count (300), slowest class, huge minigun to tear through people. Engineer: Same health as a scout, can build sentry guns to defend areas of the map, heal teammates and give ammo with dispensers and teleport teammates closer to battle with his teleporters. Medic: Very useful, can heal teammates and overheal them and upon full uber can make said person being healed including hisself invincible for a short period of time. Sniper: Can take out classes from long distances, same health as scout, pretty easy class. Spy: Same health as scout, can disguise as teammates AND enemy players, also can sap engineers buildings to destroy them, and can cloak to get away silently. I just described the classes in their vanilla form, there are literally thousands of ways to customize your classes to change their playstyles and it's amazing. Game Modes Team Fortress 2 has tons of gamemodes to play, and their are community made gamemodes and maps. Modes: Capture The Flag (ctf), Capture Point (cp), King Of The Hill (koth), Payload (pl), Payload Race (plr), territorial (basically cp, but slightly different), Special Delivery (SD), Mann Vs Machine (mvm), and Robot Destruction (map currently in beta, BUT you can play it) CTF and CP pretty much describe themselves for you, however the other modes are different and I will explain them. King Of The Hill: Hold a capture point for 3 minutes to win. Payload: Red has to stop Blu from pushing the cart to the objective and winning. Payload Race: Both teams have carts to push to an objective and have to stop the other team from capping at the same time. Territorial: Basically CP expect the map is divided into different sections. The map unlocks by whichever team caps first. Special Delivery: Basically like Capture The Flag, but you're delivering a package of Australium to a rocket. Mann Vs Machine: Horde mode, also Mann Up mode can give you awesome rare loot. Robot Destruction: Both teams work to get a certain amount of points by killng enemy teams robots or by stealing the others teams points from their vault and returning it to their own vault. Maps I'm not going into great detail with the maps, simply because there's way too many to just list off, but all the maps have a way different feel and are all pretty damn amazing besides Steel and Hydro. Team Fortress 2 in all honesty is a very good game, I've spent a lot of time on this game (over 2000 hours) in the past 4 going on 5 years I've owned it. Really you can't go wrong with this game. Just download it and give it a shot. It's pretty f*cking amazing. Rate: 9/10

review: Team Fortress 2 is a prime staple of a First-Person Shooter that balances "casual" and "competitive" gameplay very well. Since game sessions are fairly short, you can always drop into a game and play even if you only have a short amount of free time. If you like FPS games, different team roles, random item drops + crafting, and fun, action-packed gameplay, then you will really enjoy this game. As a Free to Play game, TF2 is one of the best of its kind available, and you can play without having to spend any money - it gets very tempting though, especially the more invested you get into the game. The aesthetics are fantastic, the character models are very well-done, and there is also a lot of detail in the environment. There are a multitude of different weapons and cosmetics (ex: hats, outfits, etc), allowing for huge character customization; however, most of these things must either be purchased with real money or traded (if you don't want to rely on the random item drops). The sound effects are good, and there really isn't any music, so I just play my own in the background. The character taunts and dialogue are great and comical. The controls are very straightforward and the learning curve is minimal to moderate depending on your experience with FPS games. There is a coaching option, where players can volunteer to train new players, and new players can be matched with any available coaches. This is a great option, considering that there is no real tutorial and playing against bots does not compare at all when playing against real opponents. Understanding the different character roles + equipment configuration (different loadouts can change your playstyle considerably) can take some time, but I personally find this part to be very fun. For example, you can equip the Demoman with a melee weapon (each character has a primary, secondary, and melee weapon), and give him a shield and special boots for his other weapon slots - this will effectively turn him into a whirlwind of melee death, so long as you are able to close the distance between yourself and your opponents (swords will give him a charge ability). This differs from his default loadout, where the Demoman can use his grenade launcher and also set up trigger-able mines. The gameplay is extremely fun, and there are a number of different game modes available - territory control, capture the flag (briefcase), and push the cart (get your cart to the other end of the level) to name a few. The different character types and equipment make for high replayability and can also make each match different in its own unique way. I strongly advise you to try out every character type at least a few times, as each class can be very fun (and complementing your team makeup is always helpful). The cosmetic items and weapons are fun to craft, and you may be very tempted to purchase a few things (basic items are very cheap on the market). If you don't want to spend money, there are frequent item drops that happen while you play, as well as achievement items that will be unlocked when you fulfill certain requirements. Overall, this is an excellent game that you should try if you are interested in multiplayer and/or FPS games, especially since it is F2P. If you aren't into those type of games, you should still try this out, since it is much easier for people to get into than say, Battlefield or Call of Duty (again, the perfect blend of casual and competitive elements makes this game very appealing for all types of gamers). Highly recommend! Cheers, DJSF

review: Team fortress 2, a game that removes all of my stress. Team fortress 2 is a game that is as great as the portress. You play on various maps, no matter what I always find it hilarious. You play as one of 9 mercenaries from different countries, on each map there is no gap, designed tactically so that every class can be able to kick some  equally. If you want you can go scout, to double jump about. With high speed, to fight hard with good dodging, and making them bleed! You can distract a sentry with a chug of bonk from another entry and with one konk from a mate that sentries fate is decided. Or grab the intel and run like hell has broken out in the area for fun. If scout is annoying and you want someone with a louder shout, you could go soldier the man who is as scary as a boulder, armed with a rocket launcher the results are grandly stauncher! You have multiple banners an trumpets, each with different manners of effect to protect your allies, or boost them to the enemies roost. Or if you're bored, get out a shovel and pulverize the enemy like they've been hiding in a hovel. But if you want to be a drunken scott, you certainly can and its as fun as being shocked by 1000 electrical watts! You fight with a grenade launcher and a bottle, or a blade if you want to add onto the throttle. Pull out the eyelander and charge'n'targe to pander to your sick barge. Fight your best to destroy whatever pest is attempting to melee fight, because clearly they weren't that bright to fight a drunken man who can stomp you like a tin can. Or if you want to dawn a gas mask for my favourite class, the pyro spewing fire to change enemy attire into ash, while you laugh and dash in to smash their heads with an axe. A psychopath who doesn't hesitate to unleash his wrath upon the map. Charred and scarred bodies in burning coal mines, which is probably costly in fines. But with flare in hand do you dare to land a critical strike, and extinguish your cohorts while they're burning like a shrike. Or to easily kill a tankier enemy just become a , with the sniper a foot blowing heads open from the root, of where you stand which I find very grand. The satisfaction from their reaction and watching the brain matter patter to the ground. You have a smg and a shield to help protect you in the field, but if thats not enough you got a machete for when things get tough. Or if you're normal you can be very formal, with jarate in a jar you chuck from far soaking the enemies in urine. Better yet do not fret, pick up a minigun and have a lot of fun. Mowing down the opposition with destructive suppression, enjoying a sandvich whenever you find yourself cornered in a ditch. Though it'd be wise to use it to help heal allies, cooperation is a major key to the enemies destruction. But if angry, break out a tangy steak, and go break an enemys face with your fist, each hit spilling so much blood like a huge mist. Or to become near immortal and quite vital to your teams survival, you could become the medic an interesting pick. You stay close to the group not wanting to stray, with a medigun in hand you run with your crew to ruin the enemy like a bad bowl of stew. With an ubercharge you make a huge barge. Critical strikes or ubercharges for real, which are very analytical when they deal true damage. If cornered don't get bothered get your ubersaw out and cut the enemy like a cat paw, use a crossbow when you need to allow for long range heal. A medical vow which Is very high brow, to do no harm but I laugh while making a human limb farm. If camping is what you prefer pardner, than look for farther. Be smarter and barter with sentries a lot of kills which fills my heart, watching so many die to my sentries like pennies on the sidewalk. You can help your cohorts with some teleports, teleporters ready to help steady the fight on the front which I'll be quite blunt, is wasted often because someone became somewhat too soften. Building them five steps away from spawn, a major thrive to a  swan. To aid the fight an supply the braid of the team, a dispenser can help condenser the teams health. But again it is wasted like a pasted chain, kept mostly beside the sentry to guard an entry instead of make a fight quite tight. But if its a bore grab a mini sentry and even the score, get in on the combat being as threatening as a gnat. But if you want to be subtle like a cuttle, pick up a watch and attempt to botch the enemys defenses, forcing them to hesitate their offenses. Disguise yourself and chastise the enemy for trusting you, before busting their spine with a fine knife to the back. Go through an odd entry, and sap the engies sentry. When he charges aim your ambassador, like a bally matador and headshot them right on the spot. Before cloaking away to enjoy more smoking while choking the tactics of the enemy. Gameplay is far from all but lets stray to a plot, which is quite an unexpected clot. It's very comedic like my relation to a Hasidic, in the form of comics on their website which are very great to some peoples plight, and I enjoy whatever they write, the fact the plot is good is an extra to be stacked on the many pact reasons to love it. The characters are just perfect like a group of barristers. And with trading that is never fading, you can get other material like games an such which I love a bunch, without it I don't doubt I'd have no bout with any other games to play. That aside I play it competitive as well I find it hard to get repetitive. To drop the rhyme for a moment, I have to be honest. Without this game, I'd of been bored so often. And I've met some of the greatest people, and my best friends through this game. No matter what I will love this game, I may have arrived late to the party only joining a few years ago, but I will always be happy to be a part of the team fortress 2 community. Otherwise can recommend.

review: This game is now 7 years old By rights this game should be relegated to the dark dank corners of the internet played by only a few die-hard geeks with fond memories of the days gone by Instead its now the internets premier hat collecting game, spawned a trading system only slightly less complex that a wall street derivatives trading unit, and added far more weapons, maps, and silly items than anyone can shake a stick at. Yes the game has its faults..... but I've never found any (except arena mode) and its cheered me up on more occasions when I've been down merely by enabling me to set fire to people without the risk of another long jail sentence

review: Want to play with a great community and skilled economy. Play TF2! The game where you could level up your stranges unbox unusuals and even yes even, taunt kill. Yes in this game you can die with style with the medic's ubersaw kill he literally impales you in no time at all. You thought i forgot about this but no i didn't Heavys finger blaster. PRepare to be fingered by the heavy and it will blow you away wit ha stunning killcam. Now i know what your thinkin. "Your crazy this game cant be that good." Oh but it can with the infinite number ofhats and taunt you can be the ultimate pokemon master..... wait wrong game. HAT MASTER!!! Also use backpack.tf when in trading cuz it could come in handy in trading. Team fortress 2 is the most updated with over 300+ updates and has been released since 2007 and is still on the top 3 list and is compatible with almost every computer (exept 98) Also the game has an abundance of classes to chose from to suit your playstyle. Scout the team postage stamp everywhere and anywhere, as long as you have aim and bonk atomic punch. Soldier (recomended for newbs) is a rocket launching General and was kicked out of the army for being "stupid" and has a rocket launcher a shottie and a shovel to dig your grave in. Now for a favourite, the pyro a flamewielding alien with no soul and has 3 weps (flamethrower, shottie, and axe) also the afterburn is op so use it when spies are around. Now for the Demoman an overpowered drunk scottish man with only one eye and can shoot grenade and sticky grenades. Also if your nice he would share a drink with you. with his beer bottle as his melee. Now for the Pootis.. i mean heavy with an abundance of humor and lack of chorus he will sing you to laughter and with his minigun if your mean, also he carries a shotgun and his fists as his melee to beat you down. Now for the engineer a texan who doesnt tell much about himself other than his close relationship with his machines (sentry, dispencer, and teleporters.) he likes to chill and drink beer while his sentry takes up the defendin the point/intel. MEDIC! MEDIC! MEDIC! here we go. this man lost his medical liscence and is a crazy doctor with his bonesaw, medigun, and his syringe gun to support his team. Everyone needs a medic support the team! Now for the sniper the hired assasin workin for the army (sort of) he takes out his sniper rifle and takes out enemies from across the map to sure his teammates safety. He carries a jar of "jarate" with him to reveal spies in the area so the team is aware or the sniper can take him out with his knife. Finally we have the Spy a man who knows secrets nobody knows he carries a knife and could make a costume party if he wanted to. He can be you or me, he can even be *BOOM*. The spy comes with a knife, pistol, disguise kit, and a sapper for enemy buildings to take out their defences. As a spy you need to stay low so the enemys are unaware of your presence. Just watch out for pyros. Anyway thats my review i love the game nearly put 1000 hours into it and one more thing. MANN VS MACHINE is the zombies mode for tf2. That is all that needs explaining for now i just wrote a book and if you read all this congrats. IF you thought my review was helpful or you want to meet me friend me we can talk about it Thanks for reading!

Use certain weapons/classes with a degree of teamwork against the enemy team with a decent plan of attack or tactics, and score a win for your team. That's what this game used to be. Now the game is all about the microtransactions for flashy weapons and useless cosmetics. It has been transformed into a virtual shopping mall for kids and autistic manchildren.

review: This game is a must have for 12 year olds with low self esteem. Seriously if you have the maturity of a 12 year old child and want the opportunity to make yourself feel better about your crummy life by belittling people on an online multiplayer fps game then download this game right now. I have experienced many times on this game absolutely disgusting behaviour from other players in the community. It is sad. It is sad knowing that there are so many children growing up in this world who show complete and utter ignorance, unprovoked to people they do not even know. For instance: A kid said this to a friend of mine while in a match. Hey liked how I wrecked you last round? (No reply from my friend) Oh what you got nothing to say? Must be too poor to buy a mic. (So poor yet he owns a computer right?) (I then attempt to kick this child from the game for his ignorance) Random other guy who must have been this childs friend starts. What the f#$% you trying to do? (My vote to kick the initial child fails) (They try and kick me) Shouts Kick this f@#$^% out of here he's trying to send me pictures of his d$%^ (I get kicked). Now I don't care about being kicked out of a game. There are many other lobbies I can join to play and try to have fun on. What I care about is how completely toxic the community is on this game. Yeah I get it, it is the internet you have to at some point accept the reality that there are many trolls and immature children out there. The problem for me is not ignoring it and moving on. The problem is when I, like many others, sit down to relax in their spare time and try to have fun playing a team based game get put into situations of unpleasant, abusive, conflict constantly it becomes something besides fun and enjoyment but rather stressful and disturbing. Literally every server will have people on that have nothing better to say besides overused insults. There is absolutely no need for it. There is not a single thing that requires someone to be a complete piece of trash in order to have fun or even be good at a video game. It ruins everything video games are meant to be about. Besides the absolutely toxic community in which you cannot really change in anyway there are other issues. The game is goofy with it's cartoon style which is a hint that you should not take it too seriously. If you find yourself taking tf2 seriously then that is the point in time that you should uninstall it. Trust me once you start taking the game seriously you will degrade yourself by involving yourself with the toxic players, you will lose money, you will lose friends and you will no longer enjoy something you once did. I realized this after seeing how much I spent on the game, the situation I explained above and when I started to become frustrated at people dancing around the spawn wasting time (which should be the fun of it yet it became annoying). Looking at the lucrative micro transaction style system involved, it is at least how I see it addicting. Who wants to use ugly stock weapons when they can open crates to get fancy shiny ones or simply buy them? Constantly buying more keys, to open more crates, in the hopes of getting something valuable to get your money back or make a profit (it hardly ever happens). It is exactly like gambling and the risk is greater than the reward. You may get an unusual hat but what does that actually do for you? Can you sell it and make a profit? Yes. Can you withdraw that money and buy yourself a bike, or a baseball bat, or pay the rent and bills? Nope. Every dime you spend on this game is forever invested into Steam. So you don't really make anything off of buying and trading these types of virtual items and they do not improve your skills in the game or increase your enjoyment. It gives you this false sense that you did but in the end it eats your money and that is it's only purpose. Spending money on games like this is okay if you really feel like it will bring you enjoyment but fair warning it can end up costing you a significant amount of money especially if you do not know what you are doing. I let myself became consumed in this system and have spent much more than I should ever have with next to nothing to show for in the end. I regret spending any money on this game on the virtual items especially now that I have lost my enjoyment of the game. Overall I had fun. 800 hours on a free to play game in my opinion made it worth it. What I realize now though is that games like this are only as fun as the people you play them with. I started seeing a significant amount of toxic players no matter what server I was on and that killed my enjoyment. Listening to people constantly insult each other over nothing gets tiring. I guess maybe I am just at an age where I have to move on to another saga of gaming to find more enjoyment. Will I miss playing tf2? Probably not now that I have expanded my game library. Will I play it again? Likely but only for an hour or two here and there just to have fun. I will never invest my time, like I used to, back into this game because it is really not worth it. I would recommend if you want to have some fun (100-500 hours) try Team Fortress 2 out, BUT my warning and the point of my review, DO NOT invest a significant amount of time and/or money into this game. It is really not worth it once you become tired of the toxic community. Everything you worked on getting will increase your disappointment when you make the decision to stop playing the game.

review: Team Fortress 2 Is One Of The Best Multiplayer Games I've Ever Played. It Does Take Time Out Of My Life But I'm Glad It Was Something Fun. With Unlockable Weapons + Wearable Costemics, TF2 Lets You Kill Others In Style. Each Class Has Their Own Personalty, As Shown In Meet The Team Series + The Great Music That Valve Made For The Series Too. The Teams, RED + BLU Have Very Nice Colors + With Names Tag, That Let You Rename, Hats + Weapons. Each Slot (Offense/Defence/Support) Have 3 Classes, Showing What They Do Best. I Would Highly Recommend This Game To Anyone.

It's hard to grasp the trading and crafting and other stuff when you're just a beginner at this, but the point of this game is pretty simple; just kill the enemy. There's different game types, Payload, Control Points, just to name a few. It's action-packed and and great fun with friends. I highly recommend it.

Blaming on teammates and your computer are also included as well in the package and you get to meet some rare species such as the vocal commands spamming dude, the guy calling everybody a noob and of course the 9 year old kid who needs to talk constantly. You will find very balanced skilled-classes like the mini sentry engineer and the sticky spamming demoman. Overall a pretty mediocre game, would definitely recommend.

review: Of all the 300 odd games I have, I've played this one more than all the others combined (as of 7/2013), which says a lot about this game's quality and replayability. In my opinion it's one of the best tycoon games ever, as you work your way up the ladder of hats and unusuals, but instead of earning money proportional to the quality and quantity of your hats, you have to play a cute FPS minigame to earn basic items, that you can use to trade your way up to more hats. This is an interesting take on the tycoon formula, but puts more focus on economy and trading, and obviously works well for this game. 10/10, would wear hats again.

A fast guy comin' to beat you up with a bat! that's a skull fracture for sure :P) Heavy (Fatty big man coming at you with a Machinegun! he is the Big and slow but powerful one.he has a MachineGun,Shotgun and beats you with his fists) Pyro (If you like flames / Burning people this is the one for you! He has a Flamethrower,Shotgun and a Fireaxe) Sniper (He is a long range only type of class,though he can fight melee also but is bad at it at the start,He has a Sniper rifle,SMG and a Kukri) Soldier (He is pretty good,he is fully derp and has a Rocket launcher.He can Rocketjump and other things,He has an Rocketlauncher,Shotgun and Shovel) and last but not least,The Engineer! (He can build sentries and dispenser that can give health and Teleporters.The spy can Sap enginners buildings with his Sapper which in many cases destroys them,But the engineer can destroy sappers by slapping it with his wrench.The engineer has a Shotgun,pistol,wrench,a build PDA and a destroy PDA) Have fun in the game of Team Fortress 2.Bye and good luck!

review: Team Fortress 2 is an awsome FPS (and TP) Game, it has some weapons from the future, some of them are historical, someof them are existing today... And there are cool gamemodes too! Like Control points (cp_) Payload (pl_) King of The Hill (koth_) and Sd_. Let me explain one of them: Control points is a Team Fortress gamemode, and the most popular C.P. maps are cp_gorge and cp_dustbowl. The gamemode is simple: the Re team is defending, and the Blu team is attacking. The Blu team's goal is to stand on the Control points for a time. The red team's job is to prevent the Blu team for "controlling" a point. Usually, control point maps have 2-3 Control points, but there are C.P. maps which have 4-5 points too! The other gamemodes are good too, so go and check them out for yourself, in the great world of Team Fortress 2! ~By: =[o.W.n.]= Kirito

Team work is what makes the game, hence the name "team" fortress 2, you have to learn that you can't just go kill a whole team by yourself, it ain't gonna work that way.

review: Hat Simulator 2014 is an interesting, engaging game where you trade hat for hat, hat for key, key for hat, hat for metal, metal for hat, and metal for key, and much more. Also has FPS elements but nobody cares about them. Get Hat Simulator 2014 today for a true hat experience like you never could in real life.

review: It's a First Person Shooter, and seems famous with all the players roaming around. Sometimes the community is good, and I like how this allows voice chat, even though I don't use it, and sometimes kids are annoying. Practically, I like it because it has 9 classes. Overall the 9 classes, some have a certain job and place to be. For example, Spy would hide in enemy lines while Sniper would hide behind team lines. I like how the gameplay is somewhat balanced, like how Heavy has alot of health, but is slow and sometimes an easy target for Spies, whil being a bullet magnet, and Medic can heal from a distance. But I like the different gameplay as there are Slender servers out there, and they're fun to play. Overall, I like it because it has 9 classes which are somewhat balanced, an FPS, and social gameplay.

review: Team Fortress 2 is, at heart, a gloriously simple game that's been created with style, panache and an undeniable love of gaming. It's the kind of game that you want to show to people who don't play games so that they understand and then either get involved or go away. There is life before Team Fortress 2, and there is life after. After is better.The action is fast-paced and furious, the game's presentation is hilarious and exciting and the gameplay is very easily approachable.Team Fortress 2 is a beautifully designed game with a visual style reminiscent of old Warner Brothers cartoons, and battles that combine strategy with frenetic action.

review: After playing this game for a while now, I would recommend this to anyone. It has a competitive side, casual minigames, the vanilla is extremely fun, and tons of hilarious moments. When you light someone on fire, and they try to give you a high five, it just adds to the overall fun and experience of the game. With constant updates and new items, Valve is ensuring players stay interested. As mentioned above, there are some funny group or solo taunts, that can be traded for in the games expansive trading economy. Also, hats. Hats are worth a lot, and valuable in trade. They are fun to collect and allow you to make your character look as ridiculous as possible. However, new players be warned, don't expect a shoot-em-up style game, as it takes numberous amounts of good meatshots to kill somebody, or a few rockets. Weapons are vastly different than other games nowadays, and take skill to learn to use effectively. So be prepared to have fun, wear hats, and hone your abilities with flamthrowers, rockets, miniguns, and even A FISH?!?!?!

review: In this game, you can: 1. Rocket Jumping 2. Extinguish teammates with a flammable gas 3. Double jump, and change direction in mid-air 4. Absorb 3 rocket strikes, and die by a single knife 5. Picks up a weapon made out of ice, and gets ammo for flamethrower 6. Immune to headshots when you wear hats 7. Fall down 100 feet without breaking anything 8. Heals rocket wounds with 1 tiny sandvich 9. Use a hammer to precisely remove a electronic jammer wired into a machine 10. So what are you waiting for? IT'S COWARD KILLING TIME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

review: Tf2 is a fast paced game with a crtoony look and will make you lagh so much on how stupide the custom made gamemodes are. But if you want to get serious you can buy hats and wepons to look good and get a head of the game. Finally if dont want to pay at all just keep playing and youll find tons of items whe you die.

review: A really dumb FPS focused around hats, sandviches and conga-lines. I highly recommend it. (In all seriousness though I had never played a FPS before TF2, they all seemed boring, dull and over-competitive. TF2 is not like that. All the classes are hilarious and full of character, it has a thriving and friendly community, and there are weapons suited to every play style. No class is better than another. Everyone should give it a go if you haven't already.)

review: As one of my most played games of all time, Team Fortress 2 is an incredidibly original and fun FPS. It not traditional, in a way. But I can honestly say no other game has come as close as being as fun as TF2. I mean, you know when a game is good when it has it's own economy. Anyway, play TF2. It's free, it's fun, and it doesn't pull too much out of your pockets like other "Free to Play Games".

review: Team Fortress 2 Is One Of The Best Multiplayer Games I've Ever Played. It Does Take Time Out Of My Life But I'm Glad It Was Something Fun. With Unlockable Weapons + Wearable Costemics, TF2 Lets You Kill Others In Style. Each Class Has Their Own Personalty, As Shown In Meet The Team Series + The Great Music That Valve Made For The Series Too. The Teams, RED + BLU Have Very Nice Colors + With Names Tag, That Let You Rename, Hats + Weapons. Each Slot (Offense/Defence/Support) Have 3 Classes, Showing What They Do Best. I Would Highly Recommend This Game To Anyone.

review: This game excells in being a great classic red VS blue game, with all of its customization and new features being released (which i love about games), it gives you a variety of playstyles from being a spy relying on your cloak, or a spy who relies on his disguise and backstabs. The main feature of this game is basically a TDM or Capture the flag style game, or even holiday events where red and blue will sometimes gang up to kill a boss. I don't actually have much to say about this game other than that it is a really good game that takes 2 teams fighting, to a whole new style of gaming. Overall i would rate this game a 9/10.

review: I predict this game will be alive for another 6-8 years. Dies both from from old blood AND outdated code. Also because it's not WoW. ... wait a minute... Anyway, when it dies, I also predict that in later years when talking about this game people will joke around about the fuc king hats (it's such a great platform for jokes, isn't it?) and not the great balance and fun possibilities this game had. The *TEAM* play, the impact it had on us, as experienced gamers, and the new ones - which started when the game was around, with the game. The money Gabe made with this game. Truly a successful game by all elements and terms. Don't talk about hats.

review: Well hello, my name is Esau (ryhmes with seesaw). Ive been playing games for a while, wether its been console or pc or handheld. But there was one game that stuck out for me. It was Team Fortress 2. This game literally made my life what it is today. I downloaded it and booted it up and immediately fell in love. So far ive put over 2k hours into this game and ive made such amazing friends that its hard to believe its a video game. Rayne, Jade, Fluffy, Krys, Reindeer, Walrus, ing noir, and Gawd. You guys in particular have made my life so god damn amazing. Thanks. But now i have to leave this game. Ive played it for many a good time and i think its time to pack it up and move on. What will i replace it with? I have no idea. Maybe ill fall in love with Overwatch. Maybe ill start playing Indie games, maybe ill go full time CS:GO. But whatever it is i want to thank this game. It literally morphed my life and i plan to take advantage of the things its given me. I now have a love for my friends and gaming. So yeah. Thanks. Bye.

review: After long hours of gameplay in Team Fortress 2, and after playing every single mode in the game (except a few mods), I guess it's time to do the review! :3 The game is very unique. In everything. It's not everyday you see a game which you have to choose between 9 different classes, with unique abilities for steal out some kills. It's not everyday you find a game with crazy guys hired to kill each other, just because silly brothers. It's not everyday you see the both silly brothers being killed by their lost brother and then starting a war for get the company. It's not everyday you find out a game where you have to kill a lot of hordes of robots made by the crazy lost brother. ...Seriously, TF2 has even story behind the mercenaries protecting briefcases, pushing giant bombs and capturing points. Also fighting not-so-smart robots. It's not only about the hats (actualy), it's the gameplay! It's not the same thing in comparison with others FPS's. Entering even more inside the game, you can discover more random stuff, like the in-game fads. That's what attract more players, in my opinion. And for being a F2P game, everyone can enjoy the randomness of Teufort! And don't think the F2Players will only noob: some Gibus guys will dance over your corpse in-game. I'm being serious. Curious now? :D Get the game. Doesn't have space in the computer? At least get some "culture" of the game. Don't know where to start? Watch all the "Meet the Team", pay a visit to the TF2 Official Wiki and check out the most famous TF2 fads. Two famous ones are Demopan and Painis Cupcake. ;D Meet ya around Teufort!

review: Team Fortress 2 is a simply phenomenal title if you're looking for a Free to Play First Person Shooter. It has nine classes which are distinctly different in how they look and play, and there are dozens upon dozens of weapons you can unlock either through simply playing the game and getting free drops, crafting them, earning certain items through achievements, or trading other players for them. These unlocks can further change the way you play a class allowing for even more variety. One class has the ability to be a bomb wielding maniac, or use a magic, head collecting sword and shield to slice off heads. There are 50 official maps, and 10 different game modes. Variety is the spice of life, and Team Fortress 2 certainly has variety. It can be daunting to get into considering just how much there is to learn, but it's worth the investment.

review: I've always historically been terrible at shooters of any kind, so why do I love TF2? The answer is very simple. This game is so non-sensical, so seditiously idiotic, and so unreliant on actual gun-play that I CAN be good at this, and still say "Im terrible at shooters" Basic gameplay boils down to strategiclly (or mindlessly) killing the opposing team with a selection of weapons that range from: fish, milk, soda, syringe guns, golf clubs, shoes, and stylish (or not so stylish) hats In fact, this game should just be called Hat Simulator

Since the game is Free to Play now you need to try it out.

review: This is an amazing game to play. I got it using the Orange Box Pack. I was planning on using it only for Half Life 2, but noticed that I enjoy the Team Fortress 2 game a bit more! It is an infinately addicting game, with easy multiplayer, and plenty of maps. I give them 6 stars, if possible. XD

review: This is by far the best Free to Play Game ever Made. TF2 Is More than just a Hat Simulator. Its a Hat Simulator with Guns! No Seriously, TF2 is Awesome. It Features 9 Classes which are All Needed to make a Perfect Team. (Except for Pyro. No one needs Pyros). It does have it Bad Sites because the Game is sometimes full of COD Kids who only Choose Pyro and also the Medic which is Highly Needed is Very Unpopular. Most People wont get that its TEAM Fortress 2 and not KILL EVERYONE ON THE FIELD Fortress 2. Also, The Trading is a VERY Big Part of TF2. So TF2 is VERY Different from Shooters like COD, Battlefield or Halo. I Recommend it. Highly.

review: Let me start off, with another review of a good awesome game. Team Fortress 2. The best game ever. Team Fortress 2 is an online game, basically about 2 groups of mercenary fighting for victory, or stuff. One team is called 'Red' and one is called 'Blu', yes, 'Blu', not Blue. (BUILDING LEAGUE UNITED) Or I think thats what it stands for. Team Fortress 2, is an online first person shooter games, with not only basic default weapons, but many, lots, and lots of different weapons! Some can be made, some can be recieved through boxes, which can be unlocked with keys. You can get keys by either buying them or getting them in-game. Also by playing in a server and simply PLAYING in that particular server, you might get random weapons! Some might be bad, some might be good, and some might be awesome. And thats how I got most of my cool weapons. Personally, the only downside I see of this game is that you need about 13 GB of RAM Space, which is quite big for my mac laptop, but, thats for me! And Team Fortress 2 has alot of player-made server in it, and theyre not made up of bots, but actual real players. It has 9 different classes, The Scout, Spy, Sniper, Medic, Heavy, Pyro, Engineer, Demoman and the Soldier. All of them has separate, and different weapons with different stats. I guess thats all I have to tell to you guys, and oh, also you can play this offline in 'Training mode'. Well thats all I have to say now! (THERE ARE ALSO EVENTS!!!!!) (AND YOU CAN BUY STUFF FOR REAL MONEY IN TF2!!!!)

review: An economical simulator which will make you want to pay to look cooler than everyone else and will make you want to spend more time to be better and make people rage. Blaming on teammates and your computer are also included as well in the package and you get to meet some rare species such as the vocal commands spamming dude, the guy calling everybody a noob and of course the 9 year old kid who needs to talk constantly. You will find very balanced skilled-classes like the mini sentry engineer and the sticky spamming demoman. Overall a pretty mediocre game, would definitely recommend.

review: Of all the 300 odd games I have, I've played this one more than all the others combined (as of 7/2013), which says a lot about this game's quality and replayability. In my opinion it's one of the best tycoon games ever, as you work your way up the ladder of hats and unusuals, but instead of earning money proportional to the quality and quantity of your hats, you have to play a cute FPS minigame to earn basic items, that you can use to trade your way up to more hats. This is an interesting take on the tycoon formula, but puts more focus on economy and trading, and obviously works well for this game. 10/10, would wear hats again.

review: "The most fun you can have online." True to the last word. Add to this the fact that TF2 is free - it makes for a great deal! :D I bought the game along with The Orange Box via retail, so I have a premium account; and boy, is it worth it. Though there isn't a lot of difference in free and premium, you should buy it (I recommend the orange box - it costs like USD15 when bought via retail in India, and just USD15 for 5 games is awesome!). The multiplayer game modes including King of the Hill, Payload, Control Points, are all great. The team behind this game releases new game modes as free updates at times (the Halloween game mode) - these "extra" game modes are epic! You aren't even restricted to one set of weapons, you can keep collecting weapons via random drops or craft them; almost every weapon in the game is obtainable in this way, excluding limited edition ones, etc. The new co-op mode (Mann vs Machine) has added a whole new dimension to the gameplay. THUMBS UP!

review: Team Fortress 2- Absolutely no words can express what I feel about this game. Main reason is I have mixed feelings about this game. Its a great First Person Shooter game, with many servers allowing you to customize your character. The downside to this game is the creator's will to continuosly aim the game towards a money-making process. So much of this game is money-oriented, its quite sad and ruins the cartoonish aspect the game provides. But besides that, this is one great game that would not disappoint. Through the hours I have logged, I have spent countless hours playing competitively, casually, and even just sitting there and helping coach other players. Its a fun game, and I really do love the time playing it. The cartoonish feeling and effect has a major voice in my opinion. Reason being is just that after coming home from a long day of work, the cartoonish characters, with all their personalities, is a real pleasure to see. Would recommend you get it. (Its free!)

My dad overheard me and calls me a n00b. I call him a console peasent. He slaps me and sends me to bed. It's cold now, and my face hurts. I feel a warmth come towards me.. It Gaben! I was so happy! He kneels down beside me and hands me a game called "Team Fortress 2" I begin to play it. I see that everyone is wearing hats. I buy some and Gaben lets out a mighty roar. My dad walks in and sees Gaben. 'Your wallet's empty now" He flies out of my window. Gaben is love, Gaben is life... 11/10 Supah MLG

review: What I think of the Game: Its alright I guess, I mean there are some flaws like hackers and such. But its not bad really. Its basically for anyone. To all the destructive people out there play as the Soldier or the Demoman or the Pyro. For all those people who love to help out to be the team player, play some Medic or Engineer. A little story I wrote for Team Fortress 2. Once upon a time, a little boy named Jimmy had finally got himself playing some "Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 2" and he said to himself. "Gee, I wish people aren't so mean and hateful of other people!" and so Gaben flew into little Jimmy's window on a unicorn with laser eyes with armor made of Chuck Norris Beard hair, and so Gaben took little Jimmy on an little adventure into the world, of Team Fortress 2. He showed him ctf_2fort a magical place to live (if you are a maniac who has a barn full of guns.) and he showed him the magical-ness of Team Fortress 2. Little Jimmy couln't believe what is going on so he fell asleep and the next morning he gathered all his lunch money and bought himself so many hats he became! A hat lord! Something truely amazing!(Not) So he went on and bought even more which made Gaben very happy. The End Basic Steps: Launch Team Fortress 2 Get on a server Buy hats Buy even more hats Rename Team Fortress 2: "Hat simulator" Give it the "Game of the Year award" fifty times Eat Sleep Play Anyways, to be mature about this. Team Fortress 2 is a wonderful game which players can interact with each other. Either by relentlessly murdering them or just giving each other high fives. It has many game modes like Capture the Flag(Briefcase) or Control Points. It really gives players control over many things. There has been other things like custom community content or Mann vs. Machine. It also has many abilities to make players smarter. Each class requires you to play differently everytime. I would recemend Team Fortress 2 to many people. But I don't have that kind of communication. Although you'll first end up as a Free To Play you'll soon invest some cash into the game. Word of advice: If you get the Ghostly Gibus, Throw it away. People will criticize you for it. All of all things enjoy the game don't just mess around, time will fly way past your head if you do. But you might find yourself addicted to it after a while. That has been my review hope it helped you!

review: It's almost hard to review this game. Most of what I say has been said many times before. This is an amazing game. Despite any glitches or bugs this game has, it is always fun. It has an incredibly unique multiplayer fps experience that is absolutely unrivaled. It doesn't even really compare to CoD, Battlefield, or Counter Strike. Valve never lets players down with new content and is always changing any sort of metagame or unused aspect. This is the shortest way I can describe how great this game is, and for free it is almost impossible to not at least try it. Give it a go if you haven't. It might not be for everyone, but you won't know unless you try.

review: Team Fortress 2, some people call it TF2, just in case you didn't know what they meant when they would say TF2. its massively multiplayer, first person, action, shooter, and just plain fun. You play as a character of 9 choices and fight the blue or red team to the death! Do I prefer this? Yes. It is a stunning massively multiplayer team selection game that anybody can get into. I don't know a single person who doesn't play this. If this isn't convincing enough for you to get it (it's probably not), then you should watch some of the trailers, they are hilarious. The best part about Team Fortress 2 is that it isn't $20, not $15, not $10, not $5, and not even $1. It is free. This amazing game that evrybody loves and is talking about is free. So go and get it! Nothing stopping you!

review: This is a well made, stylized, team based first person shooter. Teamwork is needed to win at higher levels of play, though lone wolfing is fine on lower skill levels such as on most public servers. There are 9 classes to choose from. Each class has unique weapons and abilities that allow each to fulfill a unique roll as part of a larger team. This provides for a challenging and rewarding experience when faced against opponents of similar or better skill levels. The game has an active dev team that continues to release updates to the game that add new content such as weapons or game modes. At the time of this review, there are two official modes of play: player versus player and 'Mann Versus Machine'. Player versus player is a mode where one team of players battles against another team of players. Within this mode, there are different types of maps. Each type of map has it's own objective or objectives for each team to achieve. 'Mann Versus Machine' is a mode where a team of up to 6 players battles against waves of bots. Players collect money from destroyed bots. The money is divided equally among players in the team and can be used to purchase upgrades and abilities for the next wave of bots. The pay to play sub-mode, "Mann Up", gives rewards upon completing a "tour". In addition to the official modes of play, there are several player made mods that introduce other modes of play such as 'Versus Saxton Hale', where a team of players battles against a player playing as a character named Saxton Hale; 'Dodge Ball', where two teams of players playing as Pyros must airblast rockets and other projectiles back and forth in order to stay alive; 'Zombie Mod', where a team of players must make it to the end of the map without dying to zombies that are played by other players; to name just a few of the many player made mods available. In addition to game play, players will randomly receive free items from the game. Some of the free items given out are weapons, hats and crates. Hats can be worn by a class to change the appearance of that class. Crates can be opened with a key. Keys can be purchased from the Mann Co Store or from the Steam Community Market or traded for from another player. Most crates will list which items can be found within them. The game has several communities for a player to choose from if a community is what you are looking for. The game is easy to pick up and play, either alone or with friends, yet has a depth of play that will keep you from becoming bored too quickly. The dynamics between the different classes, weapons, play styles, skill levels, modes and maps provides content for many hours of play. I have been playing since November 2007 and I still return to the game on a regular basis.

review: Ok lets start with the pros so team fortress 2 is all about team work even when you dont know that your working you are because you are doing the objective secoundly you can customize you charcter with cosmetics such as hats and clothing there are many hats and some can get pretty expensive unless you earn them in game they can go as high as 145 $ yay thats expensive and lastly for the pros each chacter has its ups in down i dont wanna get to deep in but they each are unique now lets head over to the cons now there can sometimes be bugs and glitchs but besides the point it kind of like a freemium game with u having to buy things if you want more but thats an option there are many game modes in tf2 incudeing the new mvm i think this is just a great game so if you have a chance check it out and im giving this game a 9 out of 10 check it out and thanks for reading this review

review: Fun addictive, great gameplay and just downright cool game. though i must say i wish it was easier to find weapons and other cosmetic items but once you become a premium member im sure thats no longer an issue. I personally hope that they add a new character to the game something like the engineer where he can place down support, but without the permanant effect but the trade off is his is stronger in some way.

review: Alright, there might be some people with some problems with my opinion. This game was good until updates just came by and stuffed TF2's er3ctum with hats. I mean, so far I've only seen hats then some more hats, but then maybe by a little chance. Some weapons. But also. Trading... it screwed my life over. I started with trading a bit later and it was fun. Til I actually got this massive drop from MvM and got scammed by someone. So I started with the real serious trading. I traded for a year to get one single worthless unusual and people trying to scam me all of the time and if I didn't accept someone offer they kept calling me for a scammer/sharker. In my opinion is... this game was a good game once, but it isn't anymore. I'm leaving this game forever, it have wasted so much of my life that there isn't a single chance that I will jump back into the hole of darkness. My last words will be.... SO LONG SUCKERS!!!

review: This game is a must for ANY fans of FPSs or shooters for that matter. I wish most FPSs were half as good as this game is. It's free-to-play. Got that? FREE... and guess what? NO IN-GAME PURCHASES THAT MAKE YOU BETTER. This game is in NO way a P2W (Pay-To-Win) game, it is in it's whole goodness a free game that's easy to pick up and play, easy to start off with and always fun to play. The game has 9 different balanced classes that are excellent both in design and in gameplay, with each one changing your team's options of beating the enemy. With tons of weapons that can be gotten freely without paying, and are completly balanced, the game keeps throwing options of changing your playstyle. This game is great no matter what kind of player you are. Like to take it easy? Go as a sniper. Want to rush in and out before anyone notices and get in the enemy's faces? Go scout. Or do you feel like punching somebody in the face? Well guess what, there's a class for you (It's the heavy). With plenty of character, plenty of options, plenty of weapons and plenty of hours of fun in it, this game will not disappoint when you play it. So have fun!

review: (IF PARENTS ARE READING TO SEE IF THIS GAME IS OK FOR YOUR CHILD SKIP TO THE BOTTOM) Since nobody has written a serious review and your probably biting your fingernails whether or not you should dowload this game I will. I may just have 67 hours but that is still a lot of experience. TF2 (Team Fortress 2) is a class based game. The Spy- He has the ability to disquise himself has one of the enemy team members. He also has the ability to cloak and get out of situations. There are also unlockables in the game. To name a few of Spy's he has a Your Eternal Reward. You lose your disquising kit but upon a succesful backstab you instantly disquise as them. Aslo dead ringer where you can fake your own death. The Medic- He is probably the most important class in competitive play. He has the abllity to heal teamates quickly, has an insanely awesome melee arsenal, and can build up a ubercharge while healing teamates to make both of you invincible at the same time. Medic also has unlockables. The Sniper- Just as he sounds. A headshot with his hlfway charged sniper will nearly gurantee an instant kill (unless it is a heavy) Sniper also has a good melee arsenal and his secondary isnt very good. Trade it out for a Razorback. Prevent spies from backstabbing you the first time while your scoping in, or jarate, throw pee at enemies to make them vulnerbal to mini crits with your sniper or melee weapon. The Demoman- He has a gernade launcher which can be powerful at some points, he also has a sticky launcher. It shoots sticky bombs at any surfac e and you can right click to make them explode. His melee arsenal is awesome too. (Actually nearly every class has an awesome melee) The eyelander. Chops enemy heads off and blood splattering everywhere. Also onee secondary is a shield which gives yiu the power to charge at enemies at a ridicoulousy (pardon my english) fast speed. You dont need to equip that in order to do that either so the charge and eyelander are a great mix. Oh and did I mention that he can stickky jump. shoot two stickies on the ground. Hover over and jump and blow them up at the same time to fly around the map. FLIPPING AWESOME. The Heavy- This class has the most health and firepower in the game and the slowest. You might be thinking well he is overpowered. Especially if he is paired with a medic. But he is not, It is not likely you can take him on your own. But maybe a soldier there and a sniper there perhaps and demoman and medic there can take him down. It requires teamwork. Note with that many people it will probably take 5-10 seconds to take him down unless he is paired with a medic then 15-20 seconds. The heavy's main is a minigun and all he has is miniguns for his primary and thats AWESOME. I love miniguns. The heavy's secondary is a shotgun (Looks awkard in his humongous hands) or a sandvich (Tasty loooking sandwich) Which can heal him if he is low on health and there are no medics nearby. Aslo his melee is his FISTS. You can equip him bare fisted or have a vairety of boxing gloves for him. The Engineer.- Perhaps his loadout is not the most important but his abilities are. The Engineer's main is a bunch of different shotguns (note when I say different weapons those weapons can be completely different with there different powers) some wrenches (for his awesome creations) and a pistol. Now he has a currency which is metal. If you pull out your contruction PDA you can build a sentry, dispensers, and a teleporter entrance and exit. First of you start with 200 metal (That is the max metal u can have) You should build a dispenser first. The dispenser can supply you with metal, health and ammo, it will aslo supply your teamates with health and ammo so thats cool. Then you can level your dispenser to a level 2 and 3 to supply you and your teamates faster. Now build your sentry (130 metal I think) It starts off as a small sentry but if you hit it with your wrench you can level it up to a ultra machine gun sentry. Level 3 includes rockets with your machine gunning sentry. But watch out for any suspicous teamates. They could be a spy and they could sap your sentry and destroy it. (I forgot to mention the spy could do that sorry) Same for your dispensers and teleporters. Now on to teleporters. when your playing a gamemode like Attack/Control when you respawn it can be a painful trip to walk to the frontlines. So you can build a teleporter! Build your entrance and exit. But dont forget to level them up to level 3 because there are charges between teleports (which can be dreadfully long) The good part is you dont need to level them up seperately. As you level up your exit your entrance levels up so thats cool. The Scout- He is the fastest class but has the least health. THE SPEED IS MUCH LIKE QUAKE. I like to think of Scouts primary as his speed because it is very lethal to other slow moving classes but his primary is a epic shotgun arsenal whether it has an insane knockback or a crazy mini crit in close quarters it is going to punish you for messing with you but if you manage to push him back he will just finish you off with his pistol. His melee is awesome like the sandman. If you charge it up you can hit a ball at an enemy and stun them (They cannot shoot and walk faster) for a moment. The scout is important for capturing points because he captures points twice as fast as other classes. The Soldier- His main weapon is a rocket launcher! Then a shotgun or buff banner which can momentarily grant you and nearby teamates mini crits with every shot that the enemies deal, but requires to be charged. There are other like the rocket boots too. His melee arsenal on the other hand is terrible. Just stick with the stock shovel they give you. Though the soldier doesnt sound like much he is very important and can go on sprees but his most important ability is rocket jumping. Go find a youtube video of it. Type in "TF2 Rocket Jumping and find a video. It's hard to explain. The Pyro- His primary is the flamethrower, a shotgun or different flare guns, and some good melee weapons. He is porbably one of the most feared classes on the field especially for spies. If they are disquised in accidentally walk into the crossfire of a pyro's flamethrower it can reveal his diquise. The meet the pyro video is self explanatory. Trading-Now this game has a very unique trading system. With metal being the currency. People trade hats for metal, key or buds. Trading servers are your best chance for selling something like a bills hat but sometimes you can just go on regular servers. Find some trading guides for more information Game Modes- There are games like Payload where you escort a bomb to a location where it will blow up Attack/Control where one team defends some points or attacks them Payload Race Just like Payload except there are two of them and you have to race each other King of the Hill It's just plain King of th Hill Capture The Flag You just capture each other's flag Special Delivery Deliver a pack of Australium to a rocket ship There are also special game modes like Halloween that come out every holdiday Let me know if I forgot one abd by the way I have no favorite I jump around to every game mode once in a while The Store- The sotre is where you can buy every item in the game. Hats are the most popular and people are obsessed with them. They basically dont play Team Fortress 2 but Hat Fortress 2 9/10 cuz of squeakers with mics and ocasional crashes PARENTS READ There are no cuss words in the game itself but the community does, People have mics and can cuss or use the chat system in game. But you can easily mute their mic or the chat. Look it up fi you want to know how. There is a LOT of gore and when I mean gore I mean body parts flying everywhere and blood splattering. There is no setting to censor this BUT there is this item called the Pyrovision Goggles. You can get this by buying them on the Mann Co- Store for like .99. Hope this helped!

The pyro lighting people on fire, and trying to talk to his teamates. The demoman planting stickybombs while being drunk. The heavy firing bullets everywhere and eating sandviches. The engineer making buildings to defend the intelligence. The medic healing teamates and shouting words in german. The sniper headshotting everyone who comes out of spawn. And finally the spy being a backstabbing heavies, medics, and snipers. That is what i like about Team Fortress 2.

review: This game has been a constant source of entertainment for me for a long time. It is a lot of fun for the competitive gamer, the casual player, or any junior economist. Not only is the shooter gameplay fun as all hell, the trading and the economy will keep you coming back to find that ONE GUY WHO WILL BUY YOUR SMOKING STATELY STEEL TOE UGHH This game has been around for a long time, and in my opinion, it is starting to die a little. The developers have choices, now. Should they keep satisfying dumb hype, or should they change the game entirely? Needs: New gamemodes New maps Better support for competitive All in all though, if you have not played this game yet, you need to. It's a game that, while kinda hard to understand at first, will definitely keep you coming back for more. Team Fortress 2 is an experience that all gamers need to try at least once... or twice... ...or forever... 9/10 would be 10/10, but devs are slacking

review: I strongly reccomend TeamFortress2 (TF2)! The game is perfect. It has many different playing styles, you can never get bored of it. Every class is well balanced and requires different skills. Some may say the graphics aren't that good, but that really isn't the most important thing in a game, is it? Anyway, TF2 is amazing, there's thousands of different ways to play! TF2 also has a really nice charm to it. It's not just a bland boring army game, the characters are colorful, and actually seem to be legit characters, which is hard to find nowadays. The whole P2P thing is kinda stupid about how f2p are treated differently than others, but some are not so bad. But I will reccomend being a P2P, I just like having fun with hats and stuff.. Anyway, TF2 is an amazing game! GET IT NOW, OR GABEN WILL RAIN ACID OVER YOU! Nah, I'm just kidding, or am I?....

review: Team Fortress 2 is one of my most favorite First Person Shooter Games that I have played so far. It offers a unique playstyle for all 9 classes. Each of them come in different shapes and sizes, along with a aresonal of weapons and personalities. The game is also incredible because with new updates and items like cosmetics coming in, it also offers a unique playstyle. Unlike most First Person Shooter games where everyone has pretty much the same weaponry, in this game, you don't. Each class has their strength and weaknesses, which makes this game more challenging and unique, thus making it more fun for players. If I had to rate this game, I would honestly give it a 9.4 out of 10.

review: *Skip this first part if you just want to read my review* Ah, I see you see my review. Well, not really, because it hasn't started yet, and I can't see you. Anyways, now that I've wasted a good thirty seconds (that's an aproximation, if it hasn't been thirty seconds, replace the word thirty with the time it is currently taking you to read (if you don't know, I encourage you to go back and read it again, with a timer)) Now, on to my review. TF2. Two letters, one number. These three characters have a meaning to all of us "gamers". To some, TF2 is merely the sequal to Team Fortress, or Team Fortress Classic. To others, this game brings meaning to Steam. Unsurprisingly, TF2 still remains one of the most popular Steam games. A while back, the game officially became F2P (free to play). Ever since the official release, as I said before, it has "touched the hearts of hundrends, if not thousands, of Steam users." The game cleverly mixes first person shooting with the cartoon graphics you see in Disney movies (except Valve makes it work). Though this brilliant combination attracts tons of people every day, it is very much a reason not to play for the harcore graphic obsessed Steam users. To combat the people who say things like, "The graphics of this game are horrible, I will not play it." and, "A cartoon first person shooter? No. Let me play Call of Duty and Halo.", I must say that you learn to love the commical blowing off of the head and watching your vital organs fall here and there as a handful of characters that could only be created from the mind of a serial killer run around shooting this and blowing up that. Overall, the game is very fun and entertaining.

The pyro lighting people on fire, and trying to talk to his teamates. The demoman planting stickybombs while being drunk. The heavy firing bullets everywhere and eating sandviches. The engineer making buildings to defend the intelligence. The medic healing teamates and shouting words in german. The sniper headshotting everyone who comes out of spawn. And finally the spy being a backstabbing heavies, medics, and snipers. That is what i like about Team Fortress 2.

review: This is a great game, An amazing game. The best first person shooter on steam, at least in my opinion. Colorful graphics, balanced classes, you can choose your own weapon, mods, classes, great gamemodes... This game pretty has everything you want in an FPS. Also, it has hats. I'd give this game an 11/10, but I can't. So I'll have to give it a 10, outta 10.

review: If "Free to Play" scares you away from this titile: don't let it. It is a great game! There is no need to pay anything, as all items are given though "drops", the more you play, the more stuff you get, Premium Player or not. Speaking of "Premium Player". you become one by spending ANY amount of money in the game, even under $1, and you will always be a Premium Player, no subscriptions. This basically lets you have more items, and sometimes get hats and rare (but only cosmetic) items through the drops. Players are not hindered by being Free to Play, or by not playing a lot. The default guns given are balanced, and unlocked guns provide benefits in some areas, but have negatives in others (ex. a larger clip, but no random critical hits). All in all, the only thing that will make you like or hate the game is the gameplay, not the pricetag. If you like FPS games, you will love it, if not, still give it a try, you could have fun, and not need to worry about being locked behind a paywal.

review: This game?? It is the best hat simulator created on the face of the earth. No other game will surpasses this games addicting hat simulator play style. The purpose of this game is to show off your hats and collect them, once you download the game you will need to join a server. Once your in it you will need to fight against players with normal hats or flaming or sparkling hats, the latter will be the hardest to defeat. As a new player you will need to use your skills to ' Dominate' a person, when you accomplish this you will receive the legendary ' Gibus' which will help you along the journey to become a Team Fortress pro. 10/10 Best hat simulator will recommend to friends or family

review: Now, before you skip past this review, just take a moment to have a look. This is my opinion: Team Fortress 2 is one of the best Free To Play games I could ever have. I belive the game used to cost something, but now it is free. The download time isn't one of those games that take 2 days and then if you quit you have to restart it. You can resume the download at any time, and it doesn't take long to install the game. Now for the actual GAMEPLAY. The TF2 Gameplay is amazing. Powerups, Taunts, Upgrrades, AI's, Weapons. Thy are all amazing features that is each something that makes Team Fortress 2 well, Team Fortress 2. The way the game is animated, and the blood, means it is a bit more friendly towards younger players. The controls can be edited to the desired key (as most Steam games) which makes it easier to play, and you don't have to remember different controls for different games. The maps are very good within content, and features. They are very detailed and hardly ever glitch. The game doesn't usually lag, ranging from (worst) 4 - 37 (amazing) FPS rate. This is a long review, so lets summarize... Team Fortress - as I said earlier - is one of the best (if not best) F2P game I have, and many others have. Hopefully, if you don't own the game yet, you soon will. Enjoy the game.

review: Review: If you like a cartoony animated FPS, then this is your dream game. It has good gameplay and the classes have their own strengths and weaknesses which makes gameplay very unique. Also the classes are made to work together to win a match. My Most Favorite Part of Team Fortress 2: The Halloween event is my favorite part of TF2, It's all crazy and very funny when you play on the Halloween Event maps. But the downside is that you can only play the Halloween Event around the time of Halloween. I also like the unique classes What I Don't Like About Team Fortress 2: I think the prices on many items in the shop are outrageous. They should also have more weapons instead of many more cosmetics. Also, there needs to be a more secured VAC (Valve Anti-Cheat) system because I have been in games where the hacker doesn't take any damage, I have played with at least 26 hackers in my entire time playing this game.

review: Well hello, my name is Esau (ryhmes with seesaw). Ive been playing games for a while, wether its been console or pc or handheld. But there was one game that stuck out for me. It was Team Fortress 2. This game literally made my life what it is today. I downloaded it and booted it up and immediately fell in love. So far ive put over 2k hours into this game and ive made such amazing friends that its hard to believe its a video game. Rayne, Jade, Fluffy, Krys, Reindeer, Walrus, ing noir, and Gawd. You guys in particular have made my life so god damn amazing. Thanks. But now i have to leave this game. Ive played it for many a good time and i think its time to pack it up and move on. What will i replace it with? I have no idea. Maybe ill fall in love with Overwatch. Maybe ill start playing Indie games, maybe ill go full time CS:GO. But whatever it is i want to thank this game. It literally morphed my life and i plan to take advantage of the things its given me. I now have a love for my friends and gaming. So yeah. Thanks. Bye.

review: This game is a must for ANY fans of FPSs or shooters for that matter. I wish most FPSs were half as good as this game is. It's free-to-play. Got that? FREE... and guess what? NO IN-GAME PURCHASES THAT MAKE YOU BETTER. This game is in NO way a P2W (Pay-To-Win) game, it is in it's whole goodness a free game that's easy to pick up and play, easy to start off with and always fun to play. The game has 9 different balanced classes that are excellent both in design and in gameplay, with each one changing your team's options of beating the enemy. With tons of weapons that can be gotten freely without paying, and are completly balanced, the game keeps throwing options of changing your playstyle. This game is great no matter what kind of player you are. Like to take it easy? Go as a sniper. Want to rush in and out before anyone notices and get in the enemy's faces? Go scout. Or do you feel like punching somebody in the face? Well guess what, there's a class for you (It's the heavy). With plenty of character, plenty of options, plenty of weapons and plenty of hours of fun in it, this game will not disappoint when you play it. So have fun!

review: Team Fortress 2... where to begin, you were the game we as a community needed. You didn't care about the generic shooters and made something so interesting, addictive and fun. Life was awesome at your early years... but then the bronies struck. The bronies were unrelentless in their assault, roaming in packs, server to server to give every unsuspecting player autism as they spread their "love and tolerance" to our precious, fragile community. They began to take root in your server lists with maps like "trade_bronycraft" which to this day have given me a huge traumatic experience, with your dumb high value in game item but have little to contribute in gameplay. But that's a ludicrous topic, Team Fortress 2 skill is based on your hats' value and if you owned items with little "value" you were shunned by these low lifed basement dwellers. The community had to accept the fate that their precious Team Fortress had succumbed to, they tried to tend to the damage the neckbeards had caused. But then the salt was poured on the fresh wound, the weeaboos came. As if some coordinated strike from the scumlickers of the internet, the weeaboos steamrolled throughout the already diminishing community, morales were low; such a dark time. It almost happened instantly, the game was flooded with autistic splash damage mains with their pockets, spamming binds like the Lenny, renaming their items to names that were almost as original as their characters. Currently the assault of these degenerates continues, will the game that fell from such grace ever regenerate into the jewel that Valve had uncovered? Only time will tell. I rate this up due to the fun I've had from this game.

review: After playing 1000+ Hours, I might do a re-write of the re-write of my review Stage 1: Graphics Everyone knows the cartoony graphics of Team Fortress 2, IMO, the change from a Realistic Shooter that Team Fortress 2 was supposed to be, was a good idea. The graphics are amazing, HD and no lag when at high, hopefully, TF3 (If they actually do make one) has the same graphics from the current game that everyone loves. Rating: 10/10 - Beautiful Art Design Stage 2: Gameplay and Mechanics In the usual FPS, its simple, WASD to move and Mouse 1 to shoot and kill everyone to win. Well, in TF2 its much different, Custom Weapons that allow whole new styles to play, Gamemodes that never get old (Especially Payload and Control Points) and the creative maps, no map is the same except for its gameplay mechanics. One problem I have with this is, they don't have a filter that allows premium players who have higher skill than free to players, this causes unbalance in some teams when a team where its mostly free to players and and other team where its highly skilled players always destroy the other team. As well as the auto balance, it makes people who are about to win then BAM! the player is now on the losing team. But overall, the mechanics of the game may have little downsides but never stop people from enjoying the gameplay and different weapons. Rating: 8.5/10 Close to amazing Final Stage: Community, Updates and Content First, I'll start with the community, the TF2 Community is amazing, a lot of faithful players who love this game to the very end, but it has some flaws, free to players, These people are so stupid, these players can't even listen to direction, I've tried coaching and it sucks so much, they don't listen to you at all and clueless to what is happening. Second, Premium, those people are mean, in trading they force you to pay more than what its worth, they should add rules to trading, chatting and other things that can effect new players. I hope those who are mean, become good and help those who are new and change the way they play. Second, Updates, the updates are lacking very lacking, Valve step it up, after some updates, TF2 is losing their community I mean the EotL was overhyped, there was supposed to be new weapons and a new map then Valve says "the map was too confusing for new players" how about rd_asteroid? Even players who played for a long time don't get cp_steel. Basically, step it up Valve. Finally, Content, there is A LOT of content in this game, mostly hats. They should focus more on weapons than hats. That covers most of that but now, gamemodes, no new game modes for a long time, except for Mann Power but recent players of the Gamemode think its bad. Valve is focusing on hats and bugs. Rating 1: 9/10\ Rating 2: 4/10 Overall:7.1/10 Need a bit of work Rating 3: 7/10/ Overall Rating: 8.6/10 - Amazing Game

review: I'd heard some talk about this team fortress 2. My friends loved it and seemed so enthralled in it's HUGE community. I eventually got to playing it myself at a friends house to try it out. I thought it was very complicated and too confusing at first. My friend was screaming, "We need a demoknight over here, but everyone's too busy being spy and trading!" I thought he was insane. My friends badgered me to install it on my computer and told me to play for eight hours straight with them. So I did. My hours are short, and I still am utterly terrible at the game, but here I am just a few hours before writing this screaming into my monitor (mic off accept for my friends) "We need a demoknight over here, but everyone's too busy being spy and trading!" My mom thinks I'm insane. And even on my crappyt DELL computer, this game runs great (with a few graphical adjustements) and keeps me entertained. Bottom line, if you get this game, you won't come out of it.

review: Best war-themed hat simulator ever
game-hours: 3896.8
review: People asked me alot, why I play this game, they mostly say: "Geez, such bad graphic." or "What's that for a kind of shooter? Not even realistic like Call of Duty." But I tell you why I play this: This game is called TEAM Fortress 2, so it basically has a teamplaying role, something what many shooters don't have. To get more into detail: This game IS a bit surrealistic, but that makes more fun. TF2 is a game for FUN, you can work together or against and still play relaxed. The "role-playing" with the 9 classes makes a perfect synergy with the term TEAM, so you wont get bored by doing always the same thing and you can help each other out by just doing something different. Another thing which is good in this game is that you can first TRY the game, so its a Free-to-play game and gives beginners a good chance to try it out. And if they like it, they buy something and get premium, so they can have full access to the game. (and for you F2P-haters... be honest, 70% of all TF2 mercs were F2P when they started, so still calling F2Ps n00bs is a bit respectless...) There are so many more reasons why this game is actually good, but if you want to know more about the game, just try it out! It's free for everyone and has a lot of gamemodes to play for you and your friends and so on. So try this No.1-hat-simulator-game from Valve out and THEN you can shout at it :)

review: The most awesome first person shooter ever! I started off as a F2P, like almost everyone else. Some time went by and now I have over 1000 hours of playtime and I became one of the many virtual hat traders. This game is not all about shooting the bad guys and winning the game, this game has a whole economy running behind it and when I first discovered trading, I became obsessed with it. I learned everything about the prices and I am still learning new things. The game also has a fantastic community, constantly providing content in the Steam Workshop while Valve decides which content is being added to the game. Besides the trading and the awesome community, it also has great gameplay. What makes me play it more is the amount of fun I have while ingame. Like, in every match I play there will be something that gives me a big smile on my face. Is there someone in the server annoying you with Mic-spamming or just being a total ? You can mute, kick and ban that er, thank you Valve for that! What also makes me play the game more is the great sense of humour. The personalities of the 9 classes are so well thought out and they all have great voice lines. To win the game, you have to work together with your team. You can try to win without them, but that is basically impossible! It's the best teamwork-based Hat Simulator FPS on the planet, what else needs to be said? 10/10, Go play it now!

review: Hello. If you read this, you should be feel good, because you got something of my handyness. Okay, Team Fortress 2 is truly one of the best games I've been playing to this day.It's gameplay is smooth and easy and there aren't any bugs*(Only map related bugs*) and the game , steam in common has a complicated, yet easy trading system that allows you to exchange your items with other users. You should give Tf2 a try, it's free!

review: Rocket flies above your head. Fire burns the surrounding. Grenade lies over the floor(it will explode any second). Bullets spam everywhere. People running around trying to hit you. Intensely feel that you will die from 1 shot kill. Nervous and worry about backstabbing. You have no way to escape except for doing the things above. That's right. CHAOS!! One shall not simply stop! If you stop at the middle of the road, you die. If you jump, you die. You walk, you die. Yes. Every single move is towards death. All you can do is fightback! This game is extremely ENJOYABLE! What's so fun about keep dying in a game? Well, you can respawn and go for alternate way. Do this game has replay values? Of Course. You must play at your own risk, as you may get addicted to it. You get to play every classes with different tactics. Therefore, you'll experience different kind of gameplay. I'm afraid that this game will be dead and the server would be empty. Well, no worries, mate. Is Counter-Strike dead yet? No. TF2 is more fun than CS! Besides, Valve always keep this game updated with special event such as Anually Halloween Event(which is my favourite event). This game provides trade system. Trading is another fun activity you can do in TF2. Due to the massive amount of items in TF2, you can trade to get your long-wishes item! Overall, this is a comedy-filled action rpg-like multiplayer game. You will like it. I promise.

review: Many people wonder why one plays tf2, when there are many other better online shooters. I simply say to them: you don't pay a dime to waste your time Of course it is not a complete waste of time. The thing that makes tf2 unique is that it is not just a shooter. It is a stabber, healer, runner, sneaker, jumper, builder, burner, boomer, and of course, a team strategy game. It has spawned many internet memes and youtube videos, and has many different weapons and customization items. Of course, it would take hours to describe the whole game, so I will just say this: install the game, try it out, and have fun.

review: This game ruined my life. First it started, with me just shooting stuff as soldier. I died. and died. and died. I got mad. I then pressed the , button. And that is where it all started: Spy. I sucked at it sure, and kinda do still. But as I got my first backstab. I went insane. Backstab after backstab, it felt so good. Soon, I just went offline on tr_walkway, not to practice, just to get a few backstabs. Then I met some people, who would let you backstab them for only a few Mann Co. Crate Keys. I bought one key and did it, then all of the sudden, it turned into dozens and hundreds of keys. I had to sell my dog, sell my house, and go to 7/11 just to buy a damn steam card. I just had to get THOSE DAMN STEAM CARDS MAN. Every backstab I got felt so good, but I knew it was wrong. So damn wrong. So then the night after. I invited my family over. I went to "get a soda from the store" When I came back, there were police cars, and all of the sudden, when they let me inside. My family was dead. With the wallets on the floor. Nothing inside. Then I realised. There were 50 dollar steam cards in my hand. The cops rammed me to the ground and started to tell me my rights. I went to jail for 7 years. I bought a crappy apartment and a Mac. and now here I am. Still getting backstabs. This game ruined my life, made it impossible to get a good job, killed my family, and am now going to kill myself soon. I guess the game is pretty good, 10/10

review: Team Fortress 2 is an amazing game. It is very skill based. Unlike other games, such as CoD, tf2 has no weapon unlock system and the weapons are as balanced as possible (unlike games like CoD where a weapon is better than another no matter what). The game play is very fast and fun. You need to pay attention to everything around you in order to play at the best of your abilities. Even though there is a limited number of weapons (there is quite alot though) there is always new gameplay stratigies and tactics to discover and learn. No one class is the best class to play, each one has their own advantages and disadvantages that may make it better to take out one class but harder to counter another. Many people that begin playing tf2 often give up quickly thinking they are not good enough, but everyone needs practice we all started bad at one time. Even if you are not getting alot of kills you can still be a great deal of help to the other team by being a distraction, providing health and damage buffs, or picking off a single class on the other team that would otherwise give your team a dissadvantage. Regarding the trade system, i consider it a quite good economic simulator. I have used the trade system to gain funds in my steam wallet and buy even more games without the need to spend alot of cash in real life. Team Fortress 2 also has things such as a costom scripting system, and the ability to make your own hats and game modles. But that is mostly not for all people and tf2 is not generally played for that.

game-hours: 2943.1
review: Team Fortress 2 is not your typical first person shooter. Why is that? Hats. Shiny hats. Vintage hats. Strange hats. Still don't believe that makes it different? Alright, then picture this : nine mercenaries, fighting over... gravel, all of them with a whole set of diverse, original weapons, starting from a fish wrapped in newspapers to a sniper rifle loaded with urine filled syringes, and available for free*. Now imagine them defending their supplier's facilities from hordes of robots and getting sweet, sweet l00t out of it. If you're more of a business man (or woman), those nine mercenaries can trade anything they get their hands on. Always dreamed of wearing a burning hat? Just find the guy who wants to get rid of his! Many, many game modes are available in TF2, and the gameplay varies greatly from one to the other. Capture the flag will have you run to the enemy base, grabbing their intel to bring it back home; attack/defense will make you work with your team to either cap or protect one or multiple control point(s); Payload has your team pushing a bomb through an entire battlefield, trying to bring the other team's plans to an end... And that's just three of the official ones! TF2's community is filled with creative, interested people who constantly come up with new things to do - have you ever played a game in which you end up facing the CEO of the hat company that had the guns you use built? I sure did! -, and whose work potentially gets added officially to the game. Scared to play because FPS's are not your cup of tea? Fear no more! Valve's matchmaking algorythm and official servers usually let you play with people whose experience won't leave you hopeless compared to yours (I would highly recommend going on those servers first, before hopping onto a community made one, just to get the basics). In-game tutorials for each class as well as community made guides will also help you through your learning the ropes. Overall, this game is fun and unique. I have been playing it for over four years, and have seen it get bigger and better as time went by, without ever getting bored of it. It's updated frequently with new content, new maps to play on, as well as mind-blowing holiday events such as the annual Scream Fortress updates (the one that happened this year brought wizardry to the game. How awesome is that?). So what are you waiting for? Click that "Play game" button, download Team Fortress 2, and join us in this crazy world of glorious, gorey, genuine fun**! * That is, unless you actually /want/ to buy them. But you can find all those weapons and more for absolutely no money! How nice is that? ** May contain hats.

review: Team Fortress 2 is a game hard to write a review for, its constantly updated, new things are always added (Mostly Hats) but Valve does a good job keeping it alive. The community ingame is a bit like being in the deep end of the Pool not expecting whats to come when you go deeper into the pool, Some people are generally nice to talk to and very kind, some are a  and racists but hey its the internet what can you do? but generally people are nice. Classes are balanced....a bit to a point where most of the time classes can kill each other easily if you play that class really well, The classes have their Pro's and Con's but its really all up to how you play that specific class. MVM is a bit of a push and shove trying to get a good team that does Not compose of prepubescent children who have such a squeaky voice they could do a voice over for mickey mouse if need be. but MVM is a nice addon for TF2 killing robots instead of Merc's. As i said before TF2 is hard game to make a review about but its really fun...Buggy sometimes but the bugs usually get patched quickly.

review: I'm personally not a fan of first person shooters...I always found them to be somewhat bland, unoriginal, repetitive, and can get really boring after a while... That being said, I freaking love this game! With a total of 9 unique classes, each having their own play style, awesome personalities, and a HUUUUUGE amount of weapons to obtain, each with their own unique attributes, you never know what you might face when playing this game. Onto the classes: We have Heavy, who wields a... Ahem. "Mini"-gun, and a freaking HUUUGE HP stat of 300, the Medic, who can keep his teammates alive with his Medigun, as well as increase their base health for a few seconds in a process called "overheal", the Scout, a fast, powerful, but fragile class that can provide a large amount of satisfaction when you annoy the crap out of people... The Soldier, the most basic, yet reliable class, wielding a deadly rocket launcher, and some intersting unlockables such as the Buff Banner. We have the Pyro, a class who is good at ambushes with his flamethrower, can deflect projectiles with his compression blast, and his afterburn technique can do insane amounts of damage if left untreated.. We have the Demoman, a class who excels at indirect fire, wielding an arching grenade launcher, and a useful sticky bomb launcher, making him essential to the team's efforts. We have the Spy, who wields a cloaking device, a basic yet useful revolver, a disguise kit, allowing him to blend in with the opposition, an Electro Sapper, letting him mutilate the buildings of Engineers, and the most OVERPOWERED KNIFE IN FICTION, where he instantly kills you upon a sucessful backstab. However, he also hosts the most glaring weaknesses of any class, making him the hardest to master. We have the Engineer, an absolutely essential class that can deploy Teleporters, Sentries, and Dispensers. Teleporters warp teammates from point A to point B, Dispensers provide health and ammo to teammates, and Sentrys: They just tear  appart with their rockets and huge machine guns.. However, if a Spy decides to stalk you, you'd better switch class, because unless you're using the Gunslinger on an offensive push, he will sap everything you have. And last, but not least, is the Sniper, who can help take out enemies from afar and use his Jarate, which is basically a jar of piss, to help eliminate key threats. Notice I haven't even gotten to the game modes. From Payload, to King of the Hill, to Capture Points, and Capture the Flag, there are a lot of different game modes that require the different strengths of different classes. But say you're not that good at multiplayer. Maybe you want to play with people instead of against them: They thought of that, and made Mann Vs. Machine as a result. Basically, the robots have bombs that they use to try to kill Mann. Co: Where all of these classes work. And they have a large army of them, including giant robot versions of those classes. But, to even out the compitition, you can upgrade your weapons upon killing robots that drop money, which they are apparently powered by...Yeah, I don't get it either. Either way, these upgrades can range from being able to deploy a second Sentry gun, to being able to regenerate health, to being able to set up a projectile wall of death that kills any robots that touch it, there's a lot of fun to be had here. But say you've played everything for hours, and you're getting bored. Thanks to the brillaint art of modding, they can at least help cure your bordom. From playing dodgeball with a OHKO rocket and airblasting Pyros, trying to take down a Spy who can only be seen when attacking, and getting insane upgrades for Mann Vs. Machine, such as afterburn to normal weapons, max health increase, and up to SIX additional Mini-Sentries, there's a lot to be had here. Overall, there's something for a everyone in this game. The characters are funny, the weapons and gamemodes are unique, there's plenty to do, the art style is colorful, and if you're tired of getting your butt kicked by people who have been playing much longer, you can go mutliate some AI Robot Classes. The virdict? A 5/5.

review: I bought Team Fortress 2 before hats even existed. Remember the "meet the-" Videos? Never even existed. This is one of my favorite games, even with all the hat hate. If you dont know what this game is by now, god bless. This game is an example of Free to Play done right.

review: A classic steam game with shooting and first-person elements all packed into one game. Plus a wide assortment of accessories to choose from including hats, outfits, weapons, and many others. Can't go wrong with the huge number of game modes and customized game servers to add to the excitement. Definitely the first game to find and play when starting steam.

review: Hello. If you read this, you should be feel good, because you got something of my handyness. Okay, Team Fortress 2 is truly one of the best games I've been playing to this day.It's gameplay is smooth and easy and there aren't any bugs*(Only map related bugs*) and the game , steam in common has a complicated, yet easy trading system that allows you to exchange your items with other users. You should give Tf2 a try, it's free!

review: Have you ever played a first person shooter that you really loved? After a while, they usually get a little drab if the developers don't update them.

review: Team Fortress 2 is a game hard to write a review for, its constantly updated, new things are always added (Mostly Hats) but Valve does a good job keeping it alive. The community ingame is a bit like being in the deep end of the Pool not expecting whats to come when you go deeper into the pool, Some people are generally nice to talk to and very kind, some are a  and racists but hey its the internet what can you do? but generally people are nice. Classes are balanced....a bit to a point where most of the time classes can kill each other easily if you play that class really well, The classes have their Pro's and Con's but its really all up to how you play that specific class. MVM is a bit of a push and shove trying to get a good team that does Not compose of prepubescent children who have such a squeaky voice they could do a voice over for mickey mouse if need be. but MVM is a nice addon for TF2 killing robots instead of Merc's. As i said before TF2 is hard game to make a review about but its really fun...Buggy sometimes but the bugs usually get patched quickly.

review: I'm personally not a fan of first person shooters...I always found them to be somewhat bland, unoriginal, repetitive, and can get really boring after a while... That being said, I freaking love this game! With a total of 9 unique classes, each having their own play style, awesome personalities, and a HUUUUUGE amount of weapons to obtain, each with their own unique attributes, you never know what you might face when playing this game. Onto the classes: We have Heavy, who wields a... Ahem. "Mini"-gun, and a freaking HUUUGE HP stat of 300, the Medic, who can keep his teammates alive with his Medigun, as well as increase their base health for a few seconds in a process called "overheal", the Scout, a fast, powerful, but fragile class that can provide a large amount of satisfaction when you annoy the crap out of people... The Soldier, the most basic, yet reliable class, wielding a deadly rocket launcher, and some intersting unlockables such as the Buff Banner. We have the Pyro, a class who is good at ambushes with his flamethrower, can deflect projectiles with his compression blast, and his afterburn technique can do insane amounts of damage if left untreated.. We have the Demoman, a class who excels at indirect fire, wielding an arching grenade launcher, and a useful sticky bomb launcher, making him essential to the team's efforts. We have the Spy, who wields a cloaking device, a basic yet useful revolver, a disguise kit, allowing him to blend in with the opposition, an Electro Sapper, letting him mutilate the buildings of Engineers, and the most OVERPOWERED KNIFE IN FICTION, where he instantly kills you upon a sucessful backstab. However, he also hosts the most glaring weaknesses of any class, making him the hardest to master. We have the Engineer, an absolutely essential class that can deploy Teleporters, Sentries, and Dispensers. Teleporters warp teammates from point A to point B, Dispensers provide health and ammo to teammates, and Sentrys: They just tear  appart with their rockets and huge machine guns.. However, if a Spy decides to stalk you, you'd better switch class, because unless you're using the Gunslinger on an offensive push, he will sap everything you have. And last, but not least, is the Sniper, who can help take out enemies from afar and use his Jarate, which is basically a jar of piss, to help eliminate key threats. Notice I haven't even gotten to the game modes. From Payload, to King of the Hill, to Capture Points, and Capture the Flag, there are a lot of different game modes that require the different strengths of different classes. But say you're not that good at multiplayer. Maybe you want to play with people instead of against them: They thought of that, and made Mann Vs. Machine as a result. Basically, the robots have bombs that they use to try to kill Mann. Co: Where all of these classes work. And they have a large army of them, including giant robot versions of those classes. But, to even out the compitition, you can upgrade your weapons upon killing robots that drop money, which they are apparently powered by...Yeah, I don't get it either. Either way, these upgrades can range from being able to deploy a second Sentry gun, to being able to regenerate health, to being able to set up a projectile wall of death that kills any robots that touch it, there's a lot of fun to be had here. But say you've played everything for hours, and you're getting bored. Thanks to the brillaint art of modding, they can at least help cure your bordom. From playing dodgeball with a OHKO rocket and airblasting Pyros, trying to take down a Spy who can only be seen when attacking, and getting insane upgrades for Mann Vs. Machine, such as afterburn to normal weapons, max health increase, and up to SIX additional Mini-Sentries, there's a lot to be had here. Overall, there's something for a everyone in this game. The characters are funny, the weapons and gamemodes are unique, there's plenty to do, the art style is colorful, and if you're tired of getting your butt kicked by people who have been playing much longer, you can go mutliate some AI Robot Classes. The virdict? A 5/5.

review: This is by the best FPS I have ever played. The gameplay at its core is outstanding, and is auguemented to unbelievable levels when you add in the different gamemodes and subclasses. Each class has its own unique playstyle, meaning that there's over 9 different ways to have fun in the fast-paced team-objective game. For those of you who are considering picking up this game, do it. There's no reason not to, it's one of Valve's masterpiece's, and it's FREE! If you think it might be a bit difficult to pick up at first, don't fret. The Team Fortress 2 community is typically a friendly and humurous entity, and within it you will find several references (TF2 guides, forumns, Tutorials videos on Steam and Youtube) to improve your gameplay and have even more fun! I hope you will enjoy this game as much as I and countless others have!

review: The moment I clicked the "Download now" button, a celestial light bled through the cloudy skies and swept through my home. I heard heaven's voice. My ragged bathrobe and spaghetti sauce laden wife-beater undershirt instantly metamorphosed into an elegant, untouched, and fully tailored tuxedo: a gold-lined cummerbund, 42-carat diamond cufflinks, and a coat that was laced from the pubic -hairs of Zeus himself, still odored from the blood of his enemies. My Ikea chair began evolving into a throne - carved by Jesus himself and lumbered from the woods of Narnia - as my hair turned into platinum locks, so lustrous, elegant, and untamed that a jealous and envious Samson would have chosen me over Delilah. I felt like a deity. But it did not end there. My doorbell rang; I noticed the sound had changed from the hackneyed, generic tritone noise into a cathedral choir of a thousand virgin women singing in harmony to announce the arrival of my hat. I quivered in fear of the presence of such a thing. But alas, I marched onward as each of my steps left a silver-lined footprint on my now diamond-tiled floor. My hands shook and my palms ached as I felt the sweat drip down my nose and onto the floor only to see the perspiration alchemize into liquid gold on my floor. I opened the door and there it was: Gaben he was fully nude, modeling in a contrapposto fashion - he was engulfed with a halo of warmth and handed me the package. His voice was near ic as I listened to him say: "Sign here, please". I shuddered in awe as I took the emerald pen and signed my signature with ink from the blood of a unicorn. He vanished in a slow cloud of menthol with a hint of nectar vapor. I took the package to my now 50-foot dining table and examined it. The box had a superficial wrapping made from what I could only guess to be the Golden Fleece, procured from the winged ram of Ancient Greece. I untied the silk bows and unraveled the package and opened the box to discover the hat. The experience was ineffable. When I laid eyes on the hat, I instantly saw into the eleven theorized dimensions of space-time. I saw past, future, present, and everything in between. I knew the reasons for everything and knew the reasons to come. String theory was simple arithmetic to me and all the mysteries of life and existence embodied the slow, ticking hands of the watch. I put the hat on my head and instantly became ambidextrous. It seared into my hair and skin and it was then that I felt the rush of purity. My diabetes, hepatitis, and hypertension washed away from me. Cancer cells were eradicated from my anatomy and the concept of aging was a thing of the past. My saliva tasted of sweet syrup and nectar. I bled liquid fire. I had obtained immortality. I must end my review here for I have seen the deterministic events that will entail with the divulging of any further information.

This game can be scary sometimes in my opinion XD not because of the servers. Because of when someone pops up and I someone could scream xD. Its pretty much very active,fun, and sometimes taking it seriously. But there is a workshop for valve to add miscs,weapons and stuff. :3

But about 2 years ago, I upgraded both. A couple of months ago, I decided, on a whim, to give it another go. This game is a lot of fun. The balance between the players is fantastic, with the short-range (but very powerful) Pyro to the far more tactical demoman, you can find what suits your flavor of play.

review: Team Fortress 2 is a multiplayer shooter that defines its genre. Every class is a completely different challenge to master, and just when you get tired of how they play, you can use a different item set (which require some work to unlock) to completely change the game. With a variety of gamemodes, including the recently-released Mann Vs Machine hoarde mode, that all add whole new layers of replayability to the game keep it fresh even 6 years from initial release. Team Fortress 2 is possibly the best Free-To-Play game on the market, and you have absolutely no reason to not give it a try.

review: Want fast paced action? Want hours of entertainment from the stupidest of things? Want constant updates that will break the game? Look no further than Team Fortress 2! Valve's sequel to the even more broken Team Fortress Classic delivers non stop surprises as you journey through a dessert, and a factory,and a barn in order to complete objective such as pushing and standing. You'll start your voyage as a f2p "gibus" but once you earn your wings, you'll notice people with shiny guns and fancy hats. From then on your life will be hell trading and trading, metal and hats just to get the one unusual to make it all worth it, and you'll be trapped, unable to escape the reality that you've playec this game flor nearly 600 hours. Also, if you're a sensitive, impressionable youngster make sure to disable multiplayer sprays (not as bad as gmod). Good game i r8 8/8

review: Rocket flies above your head. Fire burns the surrounding. Grenade lies over the floor(it will explode any second). Bullets spam everywhere. People running around trying to hit you. Intensely feel that you will die from 1 shot kill. Nervous and worry about backstabbing. You have no way to escape except for doing the things above. That's right. CHAOS!! One shall not simply stop! If you stop at the middle of the road, you die. If you jump, you die. You walk, you die. Yes. Every single move is towards death. All you can do is fightback! This game is extremely ENJOYABLE! What's so fun about keep dying in a game? Well, you can respawn and go for alternate way. Do this game has replay values? Of Course. You must play at your own risk, as you may get addicted to it. You get to play every classes with different tactics. Therefore, you'll experience different kind of gameplay. I'm afraid that this game will be dead and the server would be empty. Well, no worries, mate. Is Counter-Strike dead yet? No. TF2 is more fun than CS! Besides, Valve always keep this game updated with special event such as Anually Halloween Event(which is my favourite event). This game provides trade system. Trading is another fun activity you can do in TF2. Due to the massive amount of items in TF2, you can trade to get your long-wishes item! Overall, this is a comedy-filled action rpg-like multiplayer game. You will like it. I promise.

review: To begin I would like to say that TF2 is a F2P game and I would recommend it to anybody. The following is a Shrek Is Love Shrek Is Life parody that is CHILD FRIENDLY. I was only 13 years old. I loved TF2 so much. I had put countless ammounts of money onto steam to get al the TF2 miscs. Every night I pray to the scout, soldier, engineer, medic, sniper, spy, heavy and demos that I would get a good trade in the morning. My parents hear me and say I have an addiction. I knew he was jeleous of my pro skills at TF2 so I said he should leave me alone. My parents ban me and send me to sleep. I know I will never gte my Level Three Chin anymore now. I feel a warmth approaching me in my bed. Its a fat engineer that says "i see you found my teleporter enterance". I tell the fat engineer that I am ready. He gets out a chair and sits down drinking beer. He offers me one now but I say no. I feel my eyes tearing at his fat face. But I know that one day I want to be like him. So thats my parody of Shrek Is Love Shrek Is Life. Please go check out the video afterwards if you already havn't to understand this fully. WARNING THHIS VIDOE ON YOUTUBE WILL CONTAIN RUDE WORDS AND SCENES! So in the end I think of TF2 as a fantastic game!

review: The Cat in the Hat Game is designed for parents and children to play together. The rules are simple and the game is played in the same manner every time, so children can quickly become comfortable with the game. This game teaches and reinforces early reading skills: children look for letters that form words and learn to recognize words as they see them paired with pictures. The game also features counting, matching, and introductory strategy skills. Since the game is not over until the last player reaches Finish, every player stays involved in the game until the very end.

Its all about the team effort in this game if you don't have it then your going to die, die agian, and die some more. Theirs also only 8 characters in this game, so now that all the characters have been released its almost unnecassary to play.

review: Il migliore FPS Free to Play. Assicurato. Presente sin dal 2007, la community  pi attiva che mai. Sembra non possa morire. Gameplay intuitivo, facile da capire, assolutamente non pay2win, ogni arma ha i suoi pro e i suoi contro, quindi si pu benissimo giocare con le armi standard che si hanno sin da l'inizio, le cosiddette 'stock'. Lasciamo stare i famosi cappelli, utili solo a decorare il nostro mercenario, niente di pi. Se sei bravo  grazie alle tue abilit, non di certo ai cappelli. Community molto buona, una delle migliori che io abbia mai trovato. Basato molto (se non interamente) sulla cooperazione e sulla squadra. Le nove classi sono tutte molto differenti e ognuno ha il suo compito o ruolo; Il Cecchino per esempio, dovrebbe stare nelle retrovie, uccidendo eventuali Cecchini nemici o minacce importanti al team, come un Medico con la Uber pronta. Il Soldato ed il Grosso, ad esempio, sono classi che dovrebbero stare sul fronte, insieme all'assistenza di un Medico, magari. Medico indispensabile per i cosiddetti push, mentre l'Ingegnere aiuta tutta la squadra ad arrivare velocemente sul punto grazie ai teletrasporti, e rifornire quest'ultima di munizioni e salute con i dispenser. Questo  solo un'esempio di una classica squadra di TF2. Con pi di 1,400 ore spese su questo gioco, posso certamente dire che  uno dei giochi pi divertenti a cui io abbia mai giocato. Vi lovvo tutti <3

Myself alone have clocked about 1600's Hours on this game and still find it fun. AND THE BEST PART IS. Its a free online (And offline) Fps With dynamic gameplay and a large diffrence than the rest of the fps market (Such as battlefield and Call of duty). Now a simple thing about this game is it is Free to play and also if you do want the premium benifits it is litterly as cheap as 49 cents U.S Currency

Team Fortress 2 was my first love, it was what it made me get Steam and even if I preffer the classic for my reasons and even if I was pissed at it because people mocked that I was non-premium user, I learned to ignore that fact and enjoy the actual game. You'll love TF2 for the game, not the hats, not the weapons, just the proper game. Mann vs machine, payload and a lot of new unique game modes are waiting for you. It's free, go ahead and get it if you haven't already.

review: Yeah when I play heavy, a lot of stuff goes over my head too since it's such a complex class. A lot of people think it's just an easy class where you hold m1 over the enemy, but they don't understand that m2 allows you to spin your barrel but not fire, which can fake the enemy out. In fact one of the most exciting meta games in tf2 is watching two heavies duke it out, since a lot of times it's really not about aim but about the sheer determination and willpower and how badly each player wants it.

review: I have a lot of time and effort put into this game. After 6 years of playing, and how I experience games these days... Wasn't worth it. This game, in my opinion, is horrible. Many people are addicted to it, but if they saw what I see, many would agree. This game is poorly balanced and developed. The only way to possibly have fun in this game is by being those players with tons of expensive items and infinite skill with top-notch computers. Usually these people also take advantage of cheap flaws in the games as well. Soldier, in my opinion, is the most absolutely over-powered class. I say this because it's always that class experienced players play, since Soldier has pretty much no downsides when played well. Nothing can touch them. Then there are snipers that never miss, sporting their unusual and professional killstreak sniper rifle. Sticky spamming demos that taunt after every kill. Combo pyros, demoknights, so on and so forth. Now everyone can agree that these are a part of the game, but they get rediculous. The only way TF2 is fun, for me at least, is by actually being able to be successful. Unfortunately for me, I have ADHD and stuff, so that makes it much harder. Especially when there are servers full of unusual-wearing players who absolutely destroooy everything and take advantage of public servers full of learning players. It makes this game unbearable and kills any aspect of fun when instead of doing a role or playing for fun, all you're doing is trying to out-war that one player who is ruining the game. Lately, for me, MvM seems to be the only thing I can consider always fun about TF2, however you have to pay for a rewarding experience. That wouldn't be so bad if free MvM games weren't dead or full of people who haven't yet learned the rocket jumper deals no damage and such. While on the topic, I feel like Mann Up should have tour match ups, so players with few tours only find games with players with few tours, and the same for people with higher tours, since MvM is basically kicking that no tour pyro who's using the degreaser. I used to have sooo much fun with this game, and I was addicted. Sadly I feel like this game has become nothing more than a money harvester for Valve, since you see things that give profit to them get added 100x more often than something the players have fun with. I understand maps and weapons have to be tested and balanced, though. (Although I feel many weapons have failed their tests and were added anyway.) My main reason for this review was that I wish Team Fortress 2 was about just what it's called: TEAM Fortress. Instead it is "Free-to-Play team carried by advanced players" Fortress. At the end of the day, the only people who have fun are the ones who are beyond professional and Valve. Being professional takes time, but some people can't catch up to that point, and it's not fair for new players or those who struggle with the game. I only wish the game was more balanced for newer players and had more about the game itself, and less about hats and Valve's profit. I miss my old Team Fortress 2.

review: This game is a must have for 12 year olds with low self esteem. Seriously if you have the maturity of a 12 year old child and want the opportunity to make yourself feel better about your crummy life by belittling people on an online multiplayer fps game then download this game right now. I have experienced many times on this game absolutely disgusting behaviour from other players in the community. It is sad. It is sad knowing that there are so many children growing up in this world who show complete and utter ignorance, unprovoked to people they do not even know. For instance: A kid said this to a friend of mine while in a match. Hey liked how I wrecked you last round? (No reply from my friend) Oh what you got nothing to say? Must be too poor to buy a mic. (So poor yet he owns a computer right?) (I then attempt to kick this child from the game for his ignorance) Random other guy who must have been this childs friend starts. What the f#$% you trying to do? (My vote to kick the initial child fails) (They try and kick me) Shouts Kick this f@#$^% out of here he's trying to send me pictures of his d$%^ (I get kicked). Now I don't care about being kicked out of a game. There are many other lobbies I can join to play and try to have fun on. What I care about is how completely toxic the community is on this game. Yeah I get it, it is the internet you have to at some point accept the reality that there are many trolls and immature children out there. The problem for me is not ignoring it and moving on. The problem is when I, like many others, sit down to relax in their spare time and try to have fun playing a team based game get put into situations of unpleasant, abusive, conflict constantly it becomes something besides fun and enjoyment but rather stressful and disturbing. Literally every server will have people on that have nothing better to say besides overused insults. There is absolutely no need for it. There is not a single thing that requires someone to be a complete piece of trash in order to have fun or even be good at a video game. It ruins everything video games are meant to be about. Besides the absolutely toxic community in which you cannot really change in anyway there are other issues. The game is goofy with it's cartoon style which is a hint that you should not take it too seriously. If you find yourself taking tf2 seriously then that is the point in time that you should uninstall it. Trust me once you start taking the game seriously you will degrade yourself by involving yourself with the toxic players, you will lose money, you will lose friends and you will no longer enjoy something you once did. I realized this after seeing how much I spent on the game, the situation I explained above and when I started to become frustrated at people dancing around the spawn wasting time (which should be the fun of it yet it became annoying). Looking at the lucrative micro transaction style system involved, it is at least how I see it addicting. Who wants to use ugly stock weapons when they can open crates to get fancy shiny ones or simply buy them? Constantly buying more keys, to open more crates, in the hopes of getting something valuable to get your money back or make a profit (it hardly ever happens). It is exactly like gambling and the risk is greater than the reward. You may get an unusual hat but what does that actually do for you? Can you sell it and make a profit? Yes. Can you withdraw that money and buy yourself a bike, or a baseball bat, or pay the rent and bills? Nope. Every dime you spend on this game is forever invested into Steam. So you don't really make anything off of buying and trading these types of virtual items and they do not improve your skills in the game or increase your enjoyment. It gives you this false sense that you did but in the end it eats your money and that is it's only purpose. Spending money on games like this is okay if you really feel like it will bring you enjoyment but fair warning it can end up costing you a significant amount of money especially if you do not know what you are doing. I let myself became consumed in this system and have spent much more than I should ever have with next to nothing to show for in the end. I regret spending any money on this game on the virtual items especially now that I have lost my enjoyment of the game. Overall I had fun. 800 hours on a free to play game in my opinion made it worth it. What I realize now though is that games like this are only as fun as the people you play them with. I started seeing a significant amount of toxic players no matter what server I was on and that killed my enjoyment. Listening to people constantly insult each other over nothing gets tiring. I guess maybe I am just at an age where I have to move on to another saga of gaming to find more enjoyment. Will I miss playing tf2? Probably not now that I have expanded my game library. Will I play it again? Likely but only for an hour or two here and there just to have fun. I will never invest my time, like I used to, back into this game because it is really not worth it. I would recommend if you want to have some fun (100-500 hours) try Team Fortress 2 out, BUT my warning and the point of my review, DO NOT invest a significant amount of time and/or money into this game. It is really not worth it once you become tired of the toxic community. Everything you worked on getting will increase your disappointment when you make the decision to stop playing the game.

review: Ive played the  out of this game but for some people 500 hours is nothing. TF2 is a awesome FPS that is very different from most, for the reason of it being pretty comical and a cartoony style which makes it so great. Why i love this game so much is the community of all the weapons you can collect and the hats you get to show whos inventory as the most vaule. The maps people create are amazing when i comes to achievement idle or trading maps or just plain goofing off in a mingame based TF2 Ware this game never gets old. Hell the real best part is ITS FREE! so no reason not to get it.

review: In my opinion, THE BEST free to play game on Steam available from what I've seen. If you love FPS's, you will love TF2. If you love a mix of strategy and classed-based combat, you'll love TF2. If you like comedy and goofiness influenced in gameplay, you'll love TF2. And if you like hats, well, you get the point. But truthfully, this is an amazing game. I honestly don't know why it's free, because it deserves to be a pay-to-play game. And another thing, my laptop is probably around 5 or 6 years old, and I'll be honest, not the best. But when I first launched it, it acted like it was nothing...high quality, too. So you really don't have to worry about it lagging so much, at least from your computer. Still depends on your connection to play multiplayer, of course. And if it is laggy on your computer, it was free anyways, all you have to do is delete it. But that should'nt be necessary. I'd actually play this game instead of any Call of Duty game anyday. Really you have to at least give it a try. My personal rating, 10/10. Hope you guys enjoy the game as much as I am!!

review: Highly competitive shooter for tryhards. Make no mistake on that. Valve markets it as something else but it doesn't change what it is. It's NOT easy to pick up. If you're new to quake-like shooters, you'd better have a friend already playing it explain the basics to you, or you might get frustrated by some things. Public pvp and pve (known as mvm in tf2) servers are suitable for casual players once the basics are learned. If you don't want to go comp you can stop there and have quite a bit of fun. Sweaty competitive tryhards will really see where this game shines though. Well balanced, competitive modes will bring your tactical sense and deathmatch ability to a real test. Despite Valve overlooking the competitive format, multiple leagues have arisen offering unforgettable experience for teams on any skill level. If You want to do team based esports, look no further than TF2, this game has more competitive spirit in it than LoL and DOTA combined. As for visual aesthetics the game looks well despite its age, thanks to its stylised look. Some items from content updates are very much out of the game's theme, though, which is very disappointing given how unique that theme is. The game is poorly optimised in some instances too, (especially mvm), but that can be solved by fps boosting configs. All in all: Iz good.

review: I would recommend this one to everyone. Lots of laughs. Seems that there's a lot of people playing it. Free to play unless you like to spend money and have what many others can't afford. As for myself? I'm starting to stay away from F2P/P2P games. It's not worth the time to me anymore. Box it and I'll buy it, if, it has SP for it. I want to learn a game before I jump into multiplayer.

review: TF2 is a game that I, on multiple accounts, have accumulated about 3,000 hours on. I love it to death. I'm even happier that it is still WELL populated and regulated. If you are looking to buy TF2, here are a few things you might want to know. Pros: Skill-based yet accessible gameplay. TF2 is a perfect mix of difficulty, with each class giving a different level of skill. With some very basic twitch skills you can do quite well. At the same time, with practice you can become a god of the field, dominating enemies with a long range rocket hitting them in the air. Gameplay suited to you. Different classes and weapons offer you any placestyle, suited to you. Balanced gameplay. All of the weapons, classes, and mechanics of TF2 feel well-tested for balance. There are few items that are unbalanced, and none that are gamebreaking. Team-based gameplay. As the name implies, a good team is needed to win. You will get more-or-less randomly paired with a team. You don't necessarily have to be good: you just have to contribute. F2P in the best sense. You do not need to buy anything to be good or have fun in TF2. While you cannot trade or find hats as a F2P, those are very little things that do not affect most gameplay. Plenty of gamemodes and maps. Team Fortress 2 keeps the gameplay fresh with plenty of new maps and old, and many gamemodes. Constantly updated. Valve still updates TF2, and even when major updates are scarce, they still care for the game. The community is very much alive as well. Cons: Bad community. There are many good people who play TF2, but there are an equal number of bad who play it too. Nothing can take the fun out of a game of TF2 more than some embittered teammate complaining about how bad you are doing. There are all manner of villainy (I love that word) in the game: scammers who dedicate their existence to getting virtual items with no effect on gameplay, annoying players who key-bind after every kill, little children who think they're in charge (those are more cute than annoying) and elitist players who will scorn you for every failure. The last is perhaps the most irritating: there is many a player who, at the first sight of you being new or bad, will not hesitate to call you a noob or otherwise call you out. There are also many who judge your skill based on your number of hats: I recall on one occasion a behatted P2P getting dominated by a F2P who was better than him, and remarking that the F2P was "lucky" and was a "noob." It was deplorable. I advise going into the game with a thick skin. All in all, I give TF2 a 8.5/10. The game is the best-made I have ever played, and although the community can be a bother, the game itself is remarkably solid. Also, if you don't like it...well, it's free. Seriously, go download it right now. RIGHT NOW.

review: Being upfront about this game is about as hard as a baloney sandwich. Nine classes, 3 base or "stock" weapons each, (unincluding the spy and engineer classes) with multiple abilities and different playstyles for each. That was the base game. Being upfront about this game now is about as hard as wrestling a polar bear with a machine gun strapped to its back in zero gravity. Same nine classes, same stock weapons. But due to updates, content additions and big roll-outs of weapons and hats, this game has changed unbelieveably. Now with new weapons for every class with all new statistics and abilities, strange-teir weapons, vintage-teir weapons, genuine-teir weapons, collector-teir weapons, strangifies, chemistry sets, killstreak kits and fabricators, unusual hats, australium weapons, keys, refined metal- you get it. There's a lot to take in. Team Fortress 2 even has it's own economey that functions similarly to real life ones. But after you learn about it, the game is truly a gem. Hundreds of gamemodes both company and community made, thousands of servers, thousands of maps- there's still a lot to take in. Playing well, developing a strategy, finding new friends and groups- still not done. Trading and finding new items to have, hats to wear, modifiers for your favorite weapons, and much more. If you'd like a quirky, challenging game with thousands of things to do, you're in luck, as Team Fortress 2 has it. If you'd like a serious, hardcore game with clans to join and other clans and groups to beat- you're still in luck, because Team Fortress 2 has that as well. Now stop reading! Go get the game! (p.s. it's free.) 10/10

review: Great game. Another game where you have to apply teamwork to achieve the goal. Unlike many other warfare games, you can't just rush into the battlefield and get #1 on the leaderboard. You might be able to do this, but it 's only helping you and not your team. Each class has their own fun, creative, and interesting personality and styles. Any of these ranging from a German mad scientist, all the way to a mysterious pyromaniac that no one really knows much about. It's overall an amazing game. There's hundreds of different game modes, communities, maps, and much more. You'll never get bored (I mean.. You might)! graphics are pretty sweet, characters are fun and enjoyable to play as and of course, is probably one of the best "Red vs. Blue" stories ever.

review: Oh TF2. I started steam wanted to play Garys Mod, but i did not have the money at the time. As i was looking on steam, i saw this and said "Hey, isn't that the multiplayer game i played on the orange box on Xbox" (I was little at the time. About 9-12 years old.) So, me being a new steam user, also with a slight (Major) case of not paying attention at the time, I didn't look at the price..... and accidentally "bought" the game. I cried for hours at the time because i had my father's credit card attached to this account. (i was 13 at the time, so be quiet.) When my dad looked at the price, he had his trademark sarcastic smile and he said: "well good job Co(errm, Trace, noone needs to know mah name.) you just made me spend $100 on a game!" Let me tell you, i saw my life flash before my eyes. (again, 13 and i had very little common sense... this was before I grew out of being a kid.) Then my dad laughed and said: "Oh i was just joking, dummy. it's a free game!" And that is how i got this game. Oh, what's that, you want a reveiw, not me rambling. *sigh* fine. This game, is Free. (uh Hurr Durr Dummy) Now, Free games are usually sub-par. But this game is different, due to it starting as a paid game, so it had a metric s*** ton of development. So the game is VERY polished. And is STILL polished. Now, time to divide this review into catagories. Gameplay, Controls, Graphics, Community, and it's Total Score. Gameplay: 9/10 This game has a great style of play. You want to know why? It's different. It is not call of duty with regenerating health, or BattleField with Giant maps. The maps are actually not that big, but are of decent size. TF2 has health bars. According to the COD fan that is my friend, That is Bulls***. But don't listen to him. Health bars are great. It makes the game FAIR.... most of the time. You see, with a health bar, it makes you see how long you have to live, and you care about that. without a health bar, you feel like you could run around and spam the SMG or AR. And, along with the health bar, you usually have long as hell respawn times, so you really do not want to die. Now, let's talk about the classes and importance. There are 9 different classes, each with a use. The scout is there to piss off the other team and do chip damage, so others can kill them easy. The soldier is there to deal explosive damage to take down the guys with high health. The pyro is there to act as a counter to the soldier, demo, and spys, with fire to get the spys and airblast for rockets and stickybombs. Then we get to the demo, who can use sticky bombs for traps and deal explosive damage. The heavy is the allclass deterrent, as he can soak up damage, as long as you have a medic or sandvich. The engineer is there to add a line of defense, but the spy can ruin his day easily. The medic does what a medic should do, keep the team healed and shove a medigun up the heavy's . The sniper is there as the heavy killer as headshots at full charge do massive damage. The spy, the hardest class to master, is to get behind the enemy's lines and generally ruin the day. Now, along with nine classes, there are many weapons that are unlockable or craftable, each with an upside and a downside compared to the defaults. If you need to get to the action faster, get the Gloves of Running Urgently for the heavy, or the PowerJack for the pyro. Need to survive as a soldier? Use the BlackBox. The gameplay itself is very polished, fast-paced and generally fun as hell. And more than anything, it is balanced. Shall we move on? Controls: 7/10 The controls are good, but not the best at times. Yes, you can configure it, but i love playing with default controls on every game. WASD is always good, and M1,M2 and M3 are also good. But when the non-essential controls come to play, we have some problems. ZXC are used for character speech. Thats fine and dandy, but there are 9 different types of voicelines. so, the order goes as followed: ZX or C, then 12345678 or 9. But that's not the worst. CTRL is for crouch. not only does that hurt the pinky finger, but crouch is used a lot for explosive jumping and helping with jumping up larger objects. But the reason why the score is not lower is due to the customization for it. I, personally only changed crouch to L. SHIFT and that's really all, other than decline is at O and not K. And with that, let's move on. Graphics: 10/10 Now, Graphics do not make a game good. It only enchances the game. But that aside, the graphics are amazing Many people would say the cartoon-ish graphics make it a kid's game. Faaaaaaaaar from it. this game actually gets quite high with the gore factor, not as bad as some games, but still, quite the amount of gore. But the cartoon atmosphere gives the game a nice, fun feel. Sort of that stupid fun you get when you watch the loony tunes or play Little Big Planet. (my little sisters force me to play it with them.) Heck, sometimes it reminds me of Pokemon emerald with it's bright graphics. (yes, i grew up with emerald.) And when i look at any light-ish green in the game, I get a large rush of nostalgia because it reminds me of my favorite pokemon. (yes, i know i got the dress wrong in my pixel art. I'm working on it.) So, in short, the graphics are great, and gives me nastolgia, but will not contribute much to the score. Moving on to my least favorite part. Community: 6/10 Oh the TF2 community. you can be great at some times, but not all the time. Now, I am not a hater of anything, so long as you do not shove it in my face. Right now, TF2 is full of COD lovers, Bronys, pegasisters, demopans, Star_ lovers, Demospams, unusual flaunters, and more. Now, i am not saying these people are bad, far from it, but a large amount of these people shove it in our faces like we NEED these to survive. Not all, but a lot of them do this. But what redeems this catagory are the workshopers, map makers, good admins and hateblockers. The steam workshop has great stuff that would be great if it would be added. Some of the maps that people make are great, like Black Mesa and TrainSawLaser, even though that is a joke map. The admins on a lot of servers are nice, friendly, and generally are helpful. Hate blockers help with Haters, usually by adding logic into arguments and generally are great people. So, in general, there are a good amount of Fans who shove their interests in our faces, but the rest of the community helps with redemption. Total Score: 8/10 This game is amazing. For a F2P game, it is more than worth getting and is mostly essential to a steam user. Now, this is Silph Co. is a Lie, signing out to eat an omlet. Make sure to rate, post a comment and if i got anything wrong, feel free to correct me, as this is my first reveiw. so, thanks for reading, and tune into my Amnesia, The Dark Descent reveiw next mont.

review: I never was a fan of the first prson shooter games, I just thought that they were all the same Call of Duty style gameplay and nothing more. *Course I forgot that games that I've played in the past like Spyro 3 had some first person gameplay* This game eventually chnged my mind on that. Team Fortress 2 is a sequel to somewhat lesser known Team Fortress. Some of the basic missions in the game include capture the flag where you have to capture the enemies intelegence, attack/defend where one team attacks and the other defends, payload where one team has to deliver a bomb to the enemy, and various other missions. Then there's the co-op mode, Mann vs. Machine where it's one team defending an area from an army of robots. The gameplay is a lot of fun as there are tons of different choices in class and weapons. It helps experimenting with them to see which class you are better at and which weapon works best for you. Unlike in the first game where everyone had the same line, each class member: Scout, Soilder, Pyro, Demoman, Heavy, Engineer, Medic, Sniper and Spy have their own personalities and dailouge. just listening to them talk or watching the Meet the Team series gives you a good idea on what these characters are. one thing that I'm not fond of are the mann co creates that ocassionly appear in your inventory as drop items. In order to open them, you need to buy a key at the mann co store for about $2.30. You think by now they would've been a nit more friendly and just redused it down to a buck instead of people having to deal with crates pilling up in their inventory and can never sell. There are also Stranges, Vintage, Unusual and other named titles to make the weapons or asscessories sound more vailuble, but I don't really care for it that much. I'm just glad that I bought the Mining Light hat for Engi before they stopped selling them. So yeah, TF2 is a fun first person shooter game with it's missions. And if you get tired of that, thre are tons of fan made servers on other styles of gameplay, Saxton Hale Mode, Zombie Survivl, servers for trading or hanging out at like all of those FiM servers, the list never ends. And since it's free, it's a good deal, the only thing you have to pay for is for buying stuff at the Mann Co. Store, unless you get lucky with trading.

review: Okay, I should maybe make this review more fair. Team Fortress 2. What is there to say? This game is pretty fun. Hours of entertainment await in this free game by our favorite developers, VALVe. Hats, guns, giblets, servers, and Pyros make this game extremely fun. But there are some things you should know before using your space for the game: It crashes. A LOT. This game is only slightly more stable than your average Bethesda game, where it appears to be being held together with scotch tape, so if you think you can just pickit up and play it uninterupted for hours, wise up. The hitboxes and lag compensation is also a problem. Beware if your'e Spy or Sniper, as you'll likely miss an obvious headshot/backstab, likewise fighting spies or sniper, as you'll almost definately get backstabbed while looking at the spy face to face or headshot when the sniper wasn't looking at you at some point in your experience. You'll also notice some balancing issues, when 3 engineers start camping your spawn with 3 level 3 sentries with 4 heavies being healed by 4 medics with ubers on standbye. Aside from all that, the game is fun, modable, dumb, and has lots of comedy. If you have patience, this is one of the best shooters you'll ever play. If you have anger/patience issues, beware.

That's not in my TF2 -tionary! - Tryhard Genuine AWPer Hand + Genuine Anger Snipers! - Refrigerators! (Huntsmen!) - Tryhard "I know all 5000 tricks in the book" cornerstabbing Spies! - People who are actually friendly! (Wait, a good highlight? Time to make another bad one.) - Speaking of friendly people, that one guy who kills everyone when you're all having a friendly party! - Tryhards with Unusuals, Buds, and Bills! (10 pages of Keys included.) - Overpriced and overcomplicated economy full of *intelligent* people running it! - Tryhard Spacebar-masher Scouts with Botkillers! (Yes, with Botkillers, usually Silver MKII, or a Soda Popper.)

review: What is Team Fortress 2? It is a game FULL of variety and choices. Team Fortress 2 or TF2 for short, has been out for quite some time and building up a story for TF2. Now the question "What is TF2?" will ne answered. TF2 Is a multiplayer only game about 9 mercenaries who fight against each other to complete certain tasks the 9 mercenaries are: the Scout. the Soldier, the Pyro, the Demoman, the heavy, the engineer, the medic, the sniper, and the spy. Each one of these classes have they're own personality and tricks to hide. Starting off with the scout he is a runner born in boston and learned quickly how to fight living where he did. He takes an interest in baseball and constantly suggests that he should be in a team. The scout in-game is a very fast runner that has a shotgun called the scattergun a pistol and a metal bat. Used in combination he has a double jump manuever. Although he's very fast he has very low health; the lowest in the game. The soldier: A man who claims to have been in the army is a man who takes things way too seriously, Is kinda wierd in the head, and is homeless. We dont know too much but his old house he lived with a magician named "Merasumus" Anyways, the soldier gets a rocket launcher, a shotgun, and a shovel as his weapon. he has average health and uses his rocket launcher to his advantage by shooting a rocket at his feet making him shoot into the air. this is called rocket jumping. The pyro: We have NO idea who this is and where he/she came from this is a man/woman in a flame retardant suit that wears a gas mask and can't speak with it on so the pyro's talking comes out in mumbles. When the "Meet The Pyro" video came out we figures out the pyro is delusional, Believing the world is full of rainbows and instead of a flamethrower he's carrying an orchestra but in real life he's using a flamethrower. So many people either think the pyro is a gay male or just a really wierd woman. The pyro comes equipped with a flamethrower a shotgun and a fireaxe, But we don't have much more information than that. The Demoman: A scottish man who specializes in demolition takes to the battlefield drunk and really angry. As a child it is said he lost his eye to a book called the Bombinomicon But many believe since he talks about it so much that the loch ness monster was the cause. Not much is said about the demoman other than that, except he has average health like the soldier and the soldier and him seem to have a good friendship. He carries a grenade launcher, a stickybomb laucher As he can stickybomb lauch like rocket jumping and a beer bottle. The heavy: A big russian man who carries around a giant minigun fighting off people on the battlefield. It is said he lives in siberia. We don't have too much information on him because the meet the heavy video didn't explain much like the others. The heavy carries around a minigun, a shotgun, and as a melee his fists. The engineer:A texas man who is a builder that can get a nice sentry gun built up in a few minutes. He builds things for the team like dispensers which give ammo and a little health, Sentries which are helpful for defending and teleporters to get to the battlefield. Like the heavy we dont have too much info on him. He carries around a shotgun a pistol and a wrench he can also upgrade all of the said buildings by hitting them with his wrench. The medic: The medic is a german medic who cares not for the patient but for the treatment. He lived in Rottenburg and kept a bird named archamedies. The medic carries around a syringe gun, a healing gun or medigun, and a bonesaw The sniper: an austrailan sniper who lives in a camper van on the road. He specializes in headshots and shooting sniper rifles. He carries a sniper rifle an SMG and a kukri or a big claw looking knife. The spy: A frenchman shrouded in mystery his main attack is backstabbing people with his knife. The spy carries around a revolver a sapper that destroys engineer's buildings, a knife, a invisable watch and a disguise kit. The part that makes the spy so dangerous is the disguise kit he could be anyone on the other team he disguises himself to look like a class of his choosing so the spy could be anyone. The pyro is a good counter to the spies though as the spies when they use they're invisable watch they will be shown by the fire around them. The economy: TF2 is a game that is FILLED with hat's and cosmetics and people are willing to pay for them. This means there is a currency as well. It is metal. In the game there is a crafting option you can take a couple of weapons you have and craft them together to make metal take that metal you made them make 2 more then craft those 3 together and you have a bigger value of metal. This is a frustrating thing to do but if you want that item that bad then go for it. Choices: When i said the game was full of variety and choices i mean this: you have the ability to use HUNDREDS of weapons at your disposal but to do that you must play. After a while of playing it will say you have found an item this is how you earn weapons and eventually cosmetics. Each class varies in weapon. That being said your loadout could be COMPLETELY different in every way to someone elses. Man vs machine: In TF2 there is a gamemode called man versus machine or MVM for short. It's about robots that attack certain areas with a bomb you have to defend the area to make sure these robots dont reach that area and put the bomb in or you lose. The robots are robotic versions of all mercenaries and some are giant versions. There is also a tank but im not going to get into that. Trading: This will be the final part of the review. Trading is a bit of a problem in this game as there are, but few scammers here. You can trade metal for items like taunts, cosmetics and weapons Or you could trade a weapon for a weapon or a taunt for a taunt. In trading there are items called unusuals do not bother trying to get one unless you have mann co keys from the store. I'm sorry but this is the end of the guide but in short tf2 is a fun game full of variety for people to enjoy like myself anyways i hope you enjoyed the guide and i will see you later :3

review: This is the best JRPG I've ever played. The customizability of your teammates is just ridiculous, and with over 400 Personas to summon, the game just oozes with content. My only problem is there are only 8 social links to do, and there aren't enough male characters; don't get me wrong, I love a JRPG with powerful female companions, but there's only one male in this game and it's the main character. There are also over 50 dungeons in the game, and while the game can be hard, the challenge is certainly one of the most enjoyable aspects of TF2. I give TF2 a 10/10, because it is the best JRPG ever since Call of Duty on the PS1.

review: Being upfront about this game is about as hard as a baloney sandwich. Nine classes, 3 base or "stock" weapons each, (unincluding the spy and engineer classes) with multiple abilities and different playstyles for each. That was the base game. Being upfront about this game now is about as hard as wrestling a polar bear with a machine gun strapped to its back in zero gravity. Same nine classes, same stock weapons. But due to updates, content additions and big roll-outs of weapons and hats, this game has changed unbelieveably. Now with new weapons for every class with all new statistics and abilities, strange-teir weapons, vintage-teir weapons, genuine-teir weapons, collector-teir weapons, strangifies, chemistry sets, killstreak kits and fabricators, unusual hats, australium weapons, keys, refined metal- you get it. There's a lot to take in. Team Fortress 2 even has it's own economey that functions similarly to real life ones. But after you learn about it, the game is truly a gem. Hundreds of gamemodes both company and community made, thousands of servers, thousands of maps- there's still a lot to take in. Playing well, developing a strategy, finding new friends and groups- still not done. Trading and finding new items to have, hats to wear, modifiers for your favorite weapons, and much more. If you'd like a quirky, challenging game with thousands of things to do, you're in luck, as Team Fortress 2 has it. If you'd like a serious, hardcore game with clans to join and other clans and groups to beat- you're still in luck, because Team Fortress 2 has that as well. Now stop reading! Go get the game! (p.s. it's free.) 10/10

So I threw a jar of urine at him and headshotted him with a bow and arrow. Then he stabbed me in the back with an ice pick and froze my corpse. So I set him on fire with a gun that fires rainbows. We became best friends, then spent the rest of the round doing the Conga. 11/10 would conga again.

Overall the gameplay is great, also the characters have their own story to tell. If there is a character that you like to play, then Team Fortress is just the game for you! Hop in and choose a character of your liking, sadly as I said in the previous lines.. The cosmetic items are sometimes really expensive, so loosen up your wallet a bit! Good points: -Dynamic gameplay -Easy going and fast learning -Fun with friends -a wild variation of weapons to choose of! Meh points: -Not as free as they telling you -A very annoying kick-system -Alot of trade requests

review: team fortress 2 is a brilliant game which sucsesfully orients its self around extream vilonce (first person shooter) but pulls it off with a comical feel hopeing to make people take it less seriosly. the game also has an ultrapenerial aspect to it with scrap banking involved and also some items with more than 5000 you can get lots of money for doing these things. i would recomend this to someone who has never had much experiance with FPSs and especily someone who has not played call of duly alot becuase of the very diffrent battle styles. this game would be perfect for someone who is above the age of eight.

review: First it's a fun game, but then you get a hat. Then you want more hats AND MORE AND MORE AND MORE AND MORE..... And then you play the actual game. And holy sh*t it's a masterpiece. Best Class-based shooter I have ever seen. Has a nice engine, artstyle, original fun weapons and cool game mechanics. It also has MVM and of course... And the upcoming BREAD MONSTER Turns out valve didn't add a bread monster. Shame on you Valve, shame on you...

review: This game is 1 of it's bests and so I will like it. Why? 1) It's one of the best F2P(free-to-play) games ever created, because the concept of this game itself is just great. 2) This game is not as PTW(pay-to-win) as any of F2P games that I have yet encountered. 3) It is really a game that is build on cummunity and is great to play with friends, really... almost every item here from now included is made by community. 10/10 - "Best free-to-play game existing" I hope my comment to this game "Team Fortress 2" was somehow usefull, if you think I was wrong at some point please contact me. Have a nice day. Bye. THANKS FOR READING

review: Team Fortress 2, after 7 years of its lifetime, still hosts a great community(Mostly) The grand feature of this game, is the classes. They all have something unique about them, comparing spy and sniper. Spy is more relaxed, mischivous(Is this how you spell it?) and a guy likes to **** with your head. Sniper is rude, curses WAY more than spy(Spy does say **** you occasionally) and even likes to mock the dead, charming. But theres more, their isn't just "Pick sniper cause 360 No scopes(although a new weapon allows for this)" they all are handy in different situations, spy is great for sapping and destroying strong enemies behind enemy lines. Sniper is great for picking off the medic and engineers(Weirdly, sniper is a counter to engineer) Theres all unique playstyles in the game. But some might not be your cup of tea. Scout is fast moving. Soldier is strong and has high mobility. Pyro burns ****. Demoman blows up whatever the **** he sees. Heavy is tank nuff said. Engineer is the high intelligence defence builder. Medic is that most is the most helpful class on the front lines. Sniper stays back and shoots peoples heads off. Spy is the chaser or the chased. 9 different playstyles, but none of them might fit you. But we have someone to spice up the playstyles. Some weapons in TF2 can COMPLETELY change your playstyle. E.G the Air Strike encourgages you to rocket jump for that extra firing speed that is fast as Usain Bolt. Another E.G the B.A.S.E jumper encourages you to put on the Air Strike for soldier for extra damage and mobility. Overall a 10/10 but does lack in major updates, but that dosen't matter as they change up the game most of the minor ones.

review: HOLY  THIS GAME IS AMAZING. sorry had to get that out, but if a friend tells you to get this game, DO IT IMMEDIATLY, it is so amazing the cartoony gameplay is new and fresh the controls are amazing and you can make a good profit from this game, Play your cards right and you just might get a lot of free games or good items (seriously from only spending a total of .41 cents on this game only to get premium i didnt regret it and i met some guy online we played and he gave me a free copy of bioschock for no reason). Plus it is extremely addicting and i cant stop playing, in a period of 6 months or less i have spent almost 400 hours on this game, it is amazing. TIP never say that hats are useless IN CHAT people will call you a noob and you kind of are. Just to say, Hats show your rankings as a player for me i am decently respected and I have a couple of really good miscs, The hatless the hated on a lot and BUY AN ITEM to get premium, trust me it is worth it in the long run.

review: For those who don't know what this game is, it is a M+ rated game about a war between 2 teams/robots. The gameplay is extremely varied in a good way. You can choose from 9 classes to play as, each with strengths and weaknesses. As well as training, there is multiplayer which is great too. There are 8 gamemodes to play in multiplayer. From pushing a bomb down a road to delivering a briefcase to a missile, these modes are also diverse. Plus trading items obtained or crafted in the game to other players to collect new ones and this game is just amazing. 5 out of 5, 10 out of 10, however you want to say it. Also in terms of graphics, the game is pretty good in that department. 9 out of 10 for graphics. The in-game store works very well and adds people's creations for sale. The Steam market also lets you sell stuff but in a different way: selling marketable items in your inventory. You can get money out of this to buy stuff from the in-game store so about a 8 1/2 for the store and overall a 9 1/4 for the entire game. Last thing: hats are the most important thing in the game.

review: The rockets represent the hardships and malice that the soldier has been weighted with throughout his life of war. He doesn't believe what his eyes are telling him. All they show is limitation, the heavy burden of only succeeding with violence. He looks with understanding, to find out what he already knows, that his violence is essential for the team, for survival. And then he sees the way to fly.

It lets me make s mad with my 1337 h34d5h0t 5k1ll5. It lets me rage at a certain area-denial class. It lets me feel helpful by pointing a healy beam towards people with nice hats. It lets me huddah my huddah while reflecting huddahs' huddahs. It lets me be a giant Russian man with nothing but a sandwich and mittens, protesting violence.

It is free-to-play, and although there are in game transactions, you can run through 90 hours of gametime and not have to pay a single cent to have a lot of fun. The only real problems are the occasional few squeaker brats and the power of the computer your using.

review: Everything good about this game as already been said but regardless it's a good game has guns n' classes. This game you could be a team player or a lone wolf and theres a class for each and anyones play style but best to test each class for yourself. One problem is the outrageous prices for stuff just to find out it's alot less than what you traded for so if your not being ripped off by a player your just supplying Valve with more money than they need. Overall is amazing and the custom maps and gamemodes not to mention skins and sounds you can mod in makes the game all the more enjoyable.

All I know is I got up from the bed, like I was going down to the can or something, and then I tried to sock him, with all my might, right smack in the toothbrush, so it would split his goddam throat open. Only, I missed. I didnt connect. All I did was sort of get him on the side of the head or something. It probably hurt him a little bit, but not as much as I wanted. It probably wouldve hurt him a lot, but I did it with my right hand, and I cant make a good fist with that hand. On account of that injury I told you about.

review: Team Fortress 2 is a game about the most cut throat thing in human history, fashion. Every aspect of this award winning game is made as an allegory to the ever changing world of fashion and the pitfalls that can befall any who wish to partake of this amazing experience. You must find hats and accessories through a random drop system that represents the elusive mistress of, 'inspiration.' Then you must find the perfect colors, names, and descriptions for your hats and accesories to set yourself apart from the other less fortunate players of the game. This would be a boring system much like the many you can find in the bland JRPGs that litter the market. What sets TF2 apart is their inclusion of a fantastic and complicated mini-game about shooting each other that blends wonderfully into the allegorical narrarative of cut throat, fast paced, deadly fashion.

review: Highly competitive shooter for tryhards. Make no mistake on that. Valve markets it as something else but it doesn't change what it is. It's NOT easy to pick up. If you're new to quake-like shooters, you'd better have a friend already playing it explain the basics to you, or you might get frustrated by some things. Public pvp and pve (known as mvm in tf2) servers are suitable for casual players once the basics are learned. If you don't want to go comp you can stop there and have quite a bit of fun. Sweaty competitive tryhards will really see where this game shines though. Well balanced, competitive modes will bring your tactical sense and deathmatch ability to a real test. Despite Valve overlooking the competitive format, multiple leagues have arisen offering unforgettable experience for teams on any skill level. If You want to do team based esports, look no further than TF2, this game has more competitive spirit in it than LoL and DOTA combined. As for visual aesthetics the game looks well despite its age, thanks to its stylised look. Some items from content updates are very much out of the game's theme, though, which is very disappointing given how unique that theme is. The game is poorly optimised in some instances too, (especially mvm), but that can be solved by fps boosting configs. All in all: Iz good.

review: Welcome to profit simulator 20XX. The jist of this game is to buy stuff as cheap as possible, sell that stuff as expansive as possible then rinse and repeat. I don't always play this simulator as the gameplay gets quite repetitve and it's hard to get items that are on fire "cause fire n warm glowy stuff" - Trading cornmunity on a regular basis. Other than these flaws the gameplay is fine. You have 9 classes, Scout he has +50% profit and +75% chance of ruining your day and sadly you can only play him in 4 colors black, white, pink and green he isn't a very good stealth class because his vibrant colors standout on the maps making me think they didn't think it through when choosing his color scheme. Soldier he has +40% profit -15% speed and +60% dressing apeal. He too falls to the same flaws as the scout having only 2 color choices pink and green. Despite his -15% speed he can sacrifice a chunk of his health to do a super jump, although they say you use the rocket launcher to do this you end up exploding into millions of pieces you actually hold down right click to charge it and let go while looking up to perform this move. This class is overall good and can help you out if making profit is a bit time consuming and boring with his increased dressing apeal can add a few extra hours of fun just by dressing him up. Pyro he has +25% profit +999% speed while target is in contact by flames, +85% outfit diversity and 65% more confusion. Her main weapon is the flamethrower which allows major bursts of speed if you set people on fire making him a very interesting but new players should avoid using her as his most game changing ability is her comrpession blast which can defend you by deflecting rockets, grenades, plasma grenades, ariplanes, soldiers, wild cabermen and steam flash sales but you have to time his ability or else you'll be hit which is why she isn't recomended for new players. With the highest outfit diversity in the game he can create intersting and profitable combos which also requires a decent amount of experince to even pull off. Demoman has +35% profit, +50% boom, -25% outfit diversity, +999% damage only active with stock secondary and +45% stealth (Only active during the night). This "unique" looking individual is the explosive expert of the team with his loadout that consist of sharp blades, shields and boots making him an agile tank of destruction, pairing this up with the stock secondary makes you invincible because your aura becomes so strong from the damage increase everything gets ripped from reality and only requires you to press two buttons repeatedly making him easily the best class in combat. Unfourtunatly despite his godly stats in combat he falls short in profiting abilities with having outfits of things from the past, making diversity a problem and can hinder his profit stat. Heavyweapons has -35% speed, +90 more ammo, +10% profit, +60 more gun, +45% outfit diversity +175 bulk. This character is a mixed bag for combat and profit his combat ability is soaking damage and retaliating but he is slow forcing him into a more defence gameplay which can be quite slow and doesn't feel rewarding and the fact that demoman's damage is off the charts the heavy can only last 3 seconds once he enters the demoman's 30 metre aura making this class redundant. As for profit he can be very effective if you can find someone who prefers this characters outfits which because of his offical mascot status can make this quite easy to find. Oh an also the heavy has a hidden ability called "Thick Fat" which makes him take 50% less damage from temperature based attacks. The Engineer has +35% profit, +90% calm down, +35% fun and -20% height. Don't look at that -20% height as a bad thing that can be the difference between life and death (even though the characters share the same hit boxes for most projectiles.) and with his sentry gun ability you can create a machine gun that has aimbot and can even upgrade it to shoot rockets aswell making this class easily the most defensive class and with his +90% calm down stat makes him a good switch after a stressful day of ripping people off. The engineers outfit divirsity is interesting and quite large but nothing like the pyros. The elusive Medic has +0.005% speed, +80% happiness, -45% damage, +60% crit ratio, -90% common. The medic is a god send in the meta-game and has the most complex and useful magic attacks in the game with such abilities such as partner shield, skill crits and restore these along can be used together to create devastating combos that can counter even the demomans destructive aura which is why they used this spell combinations on the already powerful demoman to tripple his aura's damage and radius. The truth to why the medic is so powerful is because of how rare and fragile they are but when someone experienced enough gets ahold of one they can unleash hell. The medic is soley combat orientated the only ability in profit he is capable of is restoring hats to their original form. Sniper has +90% common, +90% new players, -100% usefullness in large numbers, -70% productivity, -35% vision and -75% interesting outfits. This class can be beast in the hands of a pro but will still be destroyed by demomen, making him pointless and all you can do for fun is scope in atleast with soldier and scout you can do something intersting with them and too many new players choose him like some kind of god or something as if it's the  in some other game or something like and fail with him that and then we end up having just scouts, snipers and spies. It's just as bad for profit they only have 2 colors pink and green which is a small choice for making profits plus people are lazy with how they look and take the generic stuff angus hood, outback interlectual, that berret with a little shield on it, those sound thingys from apple that hurt your ears and that leather thing for his face and nothing else making him a very linear and boring class combat and profit wise. Spy has +80% commons, +90% new players, -80% usefullness in large numbers, -55% productivity, +60% style, -75% visibility and +55% stealth. The spy has the same faults as the sniper combat wise the demomans arua wrecks him and and too many inexperienced players choose him. The worse part is that they don't even bother trying to use the revolver his only way of self-defense other than the energy shield watch. Along with this he is a very paitent and slow class that requires finding the right momment to strike and the right momment to run. Profit wise he has a hole wardrobe of stylish fedoras and diverse suits making him a very interesting class for profiting. If you're a fan of tycoon games this might be right up your alley. 8.9/10

review: I love TF2 so much! Even though people are now obsessed with hats (I am a victim), it's still fun for just it's gameplay between the nine classes, the awesome weapons for multiple play-styles, and even the modified servers and the Valve servers. Sure, there's "join this server, type giveall, get all achievements for weapons and hats!" servers (which someone pranked me to type giveall and gave me tons of acheivements that I wanted eo get legit) and strange leveling up servers and the occasional AFK or whatsamacallit ones where you just sit there and get weapons you can just get legit by the weapon drops, but there's amazing ones! Such as randomizer, TF20, TF10, sandbox servers (I think PoniPoniPoni Sandbox is the only one that does this), trade servers (there is an amazing trade system on this game if you haven't tried it out yet), Prop Hunt, and many other ones! If you haven't played TF2, play it! NOW! 10/10 Ruined my life and...... well, fun, I guess

review: This game is very fun, because of its difference with the other FPS games (or should I say TFPS?). Its difference is in the personality of the characters, and they each do different things. Not like 4 people do the same thing just different models. The main reason I play this game is because I am a server hoster and I love modding the game. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Q1: Is that Redstone?

review: I'm just gonna make a short list to make things clear: Pros: + It's not pay-to-win (unlockable weapons are sidegrades but almost no upgrades) + 9 very unique classes with extreme up- and downsides (if you wanna win, you need teamwork) + Since there are almost only sidegrades, they offer different playstyles to discover + Fast gameplay + Overall nice balance (Nothing is too overpowered) + A fun Coop-Mode ("Mann vs. Machine" - 6 players against waves of robot enemies) + Unique 60's comic-like style (Watch the trailers to get an idea of the games style) + Great humor (Character's voice lines, in-game news, item descriptions, ...) + A nice way to individualize your characters with cosmetic items (they dont affect the gameplay) + Still a lot of updates which include bugfixes, new cosmetic items, maps and weapons + Steam Workshop implementation (community items are actually often put into the game) + Nice competitive scene + Much game modification possible (custom skins, custom sounds, custom HUD... you know the drill, it's source engine) + Premium-Accounts don't bring any gameplay advantages + Long-time fun since theres much to discover Cons: - Some unlocks are rather annoying - Some classes need much practice until you become effective for your team - Content upgrades often only bring new cosmetics, less maps and rarely weapons - Still lots of minor bugs which need to be fixed - Workshop is only for items but not maps Some facts you should also know when you want to try specific weapons: * You gain items randomly when playing. It's a random amount which resets every Thursday. You usually "find" weapons (you can also find cosmetic items, but only when you're premium). * If you wan't to try a specific weapon, try the the ingame shop and look out for a "Test"-Button. Usually, you are able to test the weapon for some days. * If you want to have the weapon as your own item, play the game until you gain some random drops and use the trading system to trade for items with other people (People usually trade 2 random weapons with 1 specific weapon). * Don't buy weapons from the shop, it's horribly overpriced. That's about it. If you like a fast teamwork-based online shooter, you will also like Team Fortress 2. Give it a shot and download it.

review: As far as I know, it's the only class-based multiplayer shooter where a crazed rogue soldier can detonate a fast talking kid from Boston using only a futuristic rocket launcher meant for mangling cows. Oh, and did I mention he was flying through the air at Mach speeds, while sporting a bright lime green Santa beard, a Dr. Seuss hat with money forever falling from the brim, and an eagle taped to his shoulder? Not to mention the Scout was doing the conga with a massive man from Russia, who was obsessed with sandwiches. Yeah. The Soldier's probably screaming something along the lines of "MAGGOTS!" too. Gabe, we waited nine years. We got update after update, waiting for the incredible potential of this masterpiece to be unleashed upon the PC gaming community. Now, because the situation mentioned above is entirely possible within ANY game I have ever played (and enjoyed, for that matter,) I can die a happy person. My soul will be rested with nothing left desired from this world. I can indeed say, this game was, without a doubt, worth the weight. PLAY THIS GAME RIGHT NOW, OR GABE'S WRATH WILL FOREVER BE INFLICTED UPON YOU AND ALL OF YOUR FAMILY TREE. *not really. But, seriousally, play the game. It is extremely good, the best in the FPS genere, in my opinion. Give it a whirl. IT'S FREE. 10/10 Best Gabe Ever

review: Simply put, TF2 is a comical FPS that redefines what we look for in a shooter game. This game never gets old. In addition to the addicting gameplay, there's a whole economy of trading that comes with it. All in all, TF2 is a must-have for any and all game collections.

review: Graphics - The graphics for Team Fortress 2 might not seem up to par with other Valve games, but it's the art style that matters. The cartoonish graphics fit so well with this game, I wouldn't have it any other way! 5/5 Music - This game has amazing music! It's a shame we typically only hear it on the menu and during events. 3/5 Story - While Team Fortress 2 does have a story, it's never told in game. The story can be found on the wikipedia page, if you're interested in reading it. It explains why the two teams are fighting, at least. 2/5 Replayability - Many gamemodes, maps, and weapons always being added. Don't like what they have? Modded game mods range from far and wide, Prophunt, Saxton Hale, the list goes on. It's never a bad time when you launch this game again. 5/5 Gameplay - The gameplay is nice, and balanced. Something other FPS's can't always say. Not pay to win, either, which should be noted considering it's also Free-to-Play! 5/5 Overall Score - 4/5 Good.

review: TF2 is a must have and you should feel ashamed and dirty if you don't already have it. Everyone and their mother is boasting their F2P game nowadays, but it usually turns out to be a Pay2Win. TF2 is not like that at all. While some people may argue the whole Mann Co. Store makes the game Pay2Win, they're lying. Every weapon in the game can be aquired through random drops. No painful leveling, no grinding. Just play at your own leisure and the weapon will eventually fall into your lap. If you are an impatient little  you can always just go to the Mann Co. Store and spend a candy bar's worth of money on whatever weapon you want. TF2 is an incredibly balanced game with no class being better than the other *COUGH* Pyro*COUGH* All of that aside you have 9 completely different play styles if you don't count the plethora of different weapons and gamemodes where you might play a class entirely different. Valve, the sweethearts they are, also host holiday events and constantly add in new weapons and hats. Oh yeah, there are hats. Along with competitive play you can spend money to play with friends COOL RIGHT?! In all honesty, the TF2 Co-Op gamemode is lots of fun and is really hectic and chaotic, but DEAR GOD IS IT DIFFICULT. It's probably just cause I suck. TF2 is truly a spectacle in the FPS world, managing to rake in more money than Ethiopia in a year by selling hats. Now, these hats are not real. They are a line of code. They don't increase health or make you jump higher. They make you look cool. This is one of the aspects I'm not so crazy about. This hat-hierarchy if you will, causes a lot of discrimination between the community as to who's free to play and who's not. Along with that, the community is not the best in the world, especially not the Man Vs Machine one, TF2's Co-Op game. Overall TF2 is a great game to have in your library. It brings hours and hours of fun and excitement and is great to play with friends or by yourself. As an FPS in general it is more goofy than Battlefield or Call of Duty. What it lacks in seriousness it makes up for in charm and being better than Call of Duty. My final rating for TF2 is 8/10 for being a fun and totally replayable FPS for everyone. It is great as an entry level FPS or one for veterans. ALSO IT'S FREEEEEEE! So go on, go get it. What are you waiting for? I'm going to stand here until you go and get it. If you disagree with me feel free to tell me why and try and sway my opinion otherwise.

review: You know what? I recommend this. Not because it's a good game, which it is, but because I know that somewhere, SOMEWHERE, there is a person. A person that doesn't give any bulls about the outside world. If that person is readint this right now, pick this game up. You'll never see the outside world again, or the rest of your house, or anyone you held dear to your heart. But who cares when you have all these hats?

review: an overall brillant game with good gameplay classes and modes to choose from but some of the weapons are just either too overpowered or just too weak,but most are very balanced.Another complaint is that when i try to trade it says i must get steam guard from the settings but i lack the knowlegde of where it is in the settings,i do not dislike this too much though because i dont realy need to trade much.I also suggest a new class as it slowly gets boring if you use the classes too much.But my complaints dont realy bother me much and i still find myself coming over to my laptop to play it.You did good valve, you did good.Anyone who hasent played this,go search it up and start the download.

review: Team Fortress is the first, and the best, hat-based war game ! Using a totally new hat system, it will force you to kill other people to steal their hats ! And, even if you finally get a hat, there's no better showroom than a battlefield !

review: This...Is actually really fun, though I tend to suck at multiplayer FPS games. Smooth gameplay, fun classes with personalities, a whole array of items like a flare gun, bow and arrow, ING QUICKSCOPING SNIPER RIFLE WITH A ROBOT HEAD ATTACHED THAT TRACKS KILLS, cosmetics, ING COWBOY HAT WITH FIRE SWIRLING AROUND IT, and a...A DECENT COMMUNITY. Usually I see teamwork which is always good, the rare friendly heavy that throws sandviches, and Crash Bandiscout using Bonk and running to the intel, medics healing everyone, yada yada yada. It's even free, though their is premium-Which can cost as little as 69 cents. It's a real fun game, but the only downside is the new player friendline-Oh who the  am I kidding, it's good for new players, takes a little while to learn the ropes but it's easy, fast paced (sometimes.) and fun. Only pet peeve about it is sniper class when players learn how to quickscope. Walk outta spawn, die in 0.3 seconds flat. Overall: 8/10

review: This game is like a leech. It slowly sucks the life-juice out of your body with every passing minute. Your funds will drop and you will be forced to eat soggy pieces of bread off of the ground as a source of nutrition. You will lose your religion, GabeN will become your love and your savior. Hats will become your only friends, as your real friends matter not. Overall, I rate Hat Simulator 2 a 10/10, would waste life to ValvE again.

review: This game has absorbed hours, upon hours of my life. And my money. For what? Ill tell you: Hats. Hats become your life once you begin playing tf2. I had a friend, he went insane. Everyday at school, he would sit in the corner whispering, "Hats... hats... hats..." Until he disappeared. The game is fun, but im telling you, people have gone missing because of the hats 10/10 would recomend this to small children

review: Quite an interesting design may I say, the game is a cartoony-realistic shooter based on the american outbacks of the 1970s which introduces you into a very exciting fantastic world of endless battles led by free willing mercenaries that face no consequences for their wars and magically respawn after being shattered into pieces by rockets, fighting on land and not in law for the territories of two dramatically cursed brothers that bicker until the end of their century long lives and after. And you also have hats. Lots.

review: I have played Team Fortress 2 since the day it was released (Oct. 10 2007). It's changed a lot since then, but I still consider it the best multiplayer FPS ever made. I have about 460 hours in this game at the time of this writing, and I still laugh my  off every time I play. By reading this, I'm going to assume you're thinking about trying it for the first time, so here's some things all newbies should know: - Some classes are much more difficult learn than others. I'd start your first games playing as Medic, Soldier, Heavy, and/or Pyro. Until you get a decent grasp of things, stay away from Engineer and especially Spy. - Don't worry about the custom weapons that many other players will have. Although some are good, the base weapons are still often the best choice for every weapon of every class. As long as you don't take the game too seriously, it's impossible to not have fun playing it.

review: Honestly, I cannot find any avid gamer that is on steam and does not play Team Fortress 2. It's almost sacriligious to even have steam installed without also having TF2, as it's called by the players, on at least one computer capable of running it well, and boy is that not surprising. This game literally eats up time like no other (except maybe Dota 2 for some, or call of duty for others), and to be honest, the community is just as great. I can easily find a server where nobody gives a crap about killing as many other players as possible, or I can join one with an internationally recognised player for their prowess or two. The amount of hats too! it's all mind boggling that there are still gamers out there that haven't found TF2 enjoyable or have not even heard of it in general. What else to talk about...oh, the support. Obviously, due to its enourmous fanbase and it's publisher being the great and powerful Gaben (Steam creater and CEO(?)), it will almost always be there, as even Half-Life 2: Deathmatch is still supported and given server-space on top of all the newer games. Anyways, I highly recommend this game, and the game in summary would have to be: Hat Simulator 2014 :3 Happy Hat hunting my friends! I hope to see you in-game.

The cartoony characters, the unique playstyles for all the classes, the unlockable weapons (and hats), and the different types of matches will keep you playing this game for tens to hundreds of hours. Best part: It's completely free!

review: Team Fortress Two, the name itself is well known enough to sell the game. TF2 has existed since for over 6 years now and has still outlived most shooters. Unlike the other team fortress games/mod it is much more quirky than serious. However do not let its good nature fool you, it is still a very competitive game with communities ranging from trading based to competition. Even though it is very serious sometimes, it is also very easily to find a game focused just on having fun, which is rather difficult in most games now. TF2's community is mostly responsible for the current content in the game. Maps, weapons, and character cosmetics are mostly created by the community and added in Valve's official updates. The community is even responsible for creating a currency system using the crafting materials and a few notable cosmetics. Even though the game has existed for many years, there is so much balance amongst the nine classes and their various weaponry that new players and beta testers alike can be engaged in a battle with no clear outcome until the final seconds. In short, there is no reason to not try TF2. There is a class for any playstyle and its a free game that i so fun, I don't think anyone would mind paying for.

Otherwise, I'd be playing it all the time. My advice to anyone who values their current social life: Don't play this game too much if you don't have good real-life friends who also play. And remember, kids, TF2 is not real life. I'm generally considered a noob at this game, but I still have plenty of fun being killed, or if I'm lucky, finding someone else I can kill. Let me repeat myself: don't take this game too seriously. It's a lot of fun until you forget it's a game.

review: Team fortress 2 is unlike any other game ever, its a game where the community rules and they have a say in almost everything, from voting for the top maps to getting their dream items into the game. and the best part is Its Free to Play for everyone. I recommend this game to people who want a difference in a shooter who want originallity in what they play. If you believe that then i recommend team fortess 2 to you.

review: This is one of the best games I've ever played (besides Halo) and I just want to say that I love it a lot. (You can tell by my hours lol) It's true, this game is basically only hats and cosmetics, but I think you could really have a lot of fun on this game. Look at every review, I'll bet you they're ALL positive. This is the best F2P game on steam, so go ahead, get it for yourself all of you noobs out there. Buy some hats (no really don't, this game will clean out your wallet), kill a lot of people! An lastly, get a gibus and wear it on your head with a smile.

review: It's alright, it should be the first free game for everyone but it could be heavily improved if they had better game modes, more realistic weapons (such as machine gun), and if nothing costed money in-game.

review: This game is definitely part of my "top 5 best games vis" In this game you have 9 classes with different features, personalities, stories and of course weapons. Hats plays a big role in the game, but it is completely illogical because no other FPS does not have any hats :3 Hats are awesome as well.

Now, find yourself a strong, friendly, accepting community of fun people to play with, and you don't need any other games.

review: This game is... it's... it's too great to be described with mere adjectives! This game is absolutely with out a doubt one of the best games out there! It was indeed "Worth the Weight". It's art style is amazing because it is so unique and different from anything I've ever seen, this goes for both the characters, items, and enviorment. I find the game's visual appearence breathtaking. For the small amount of soundtracks this game consists of, they are amazing. This game is great because it seemingly never gets old, with dozens of different gamemodes, exciting new content updates, and its annual Scream Fortress, Smissmas, and other events. Yet, the best thing about the game (at least to me it is) is the nine classes that the game consists of. Each class is full of personality and dialogue, whether its insulting taunts or hillarious cathphrases. All of the classes are very different from each other with weapons, dialogue, attitude, style, and the way you play as them. First off you have your Offensive category, consisting of the Scout, Soldier, and Pyro. The Scout is a fast, smart-mouthed, "all bark and no bite" kind of kid with weapons that are most effective at close range, requiring a hit-and-run sort of tactic. The Soldier is a dedicated American with a strong passion to fight. Possessing a Rocket Launcher as his primary weapon, the soldier is a powerful threat to his opponents, but all that power leaves him with a slow speed, requiring him to use a maneuver known as the "Rocket Jump" to travel faster in exchange for some health. The Pyro is a mumbling lunatic, whose history is a mystery to just about everyone, he (or possibly she) wields a Flamethrower as his/her main weapon which makes him/her lack a lot of range, but gives a lot of potential power if used correctly. He/she is best used for ambushing enemies and his/her Compresion Blast (Airblast) can be used to reflect many projectiles back at opponents. Next is the Deffensive category, the Demoman, Heavy, and Engineer. The Demoman is a one-eyed, drunk Scottish man who has no bullet-based weapons and fights instead with 2 explosive weapons. He can take out enemies that he can't see with his Grenade Launcher or lay traps with his Sticky Launcher. The Heavy is a large, strong, Russian beast that uses his beloved Minigun. His immense power and large size leaves him with a very slow speed but with very strong fire power. He may be considered an easy target due to his size, but as long as he has his Minigun he should be treated as a threat just like all the other classes. The Engineer is a intelligent Texan that relies mainly on his buildings to fight. His Sentry Gun is generally a threat to any enemy within it's range, he can build a Dispenser to heal him and his teammates as well as refill there ammo, and he can also build teleporters so his team can access areas faster. The last category is the Supportive classes, consisting of the Medic, Sniper, and Spy. The Medic is a German doctor with amazing medical technology at his disposal. He is not one known for attacking but instead he is known for healing. Using his Medi-gun, he can quickly heal his teammates. Once charged enough, he can deploy what is known as an "Ubercharge", making him and whoever he is healing temporarily invincible to any damage from enemy weapons. The Sniper is an Austrailian outdoorsman who, as his name suggests, uses a Sniper Rifle as his main weapon. He can do extreme ammounts of damage at long range, making him a valueble teammate when used correctly. At short range though, he is more vulnerable and can easily be overwhelmed by enemies. Lastly, we have the Spy, a French trickster who can disguise himself as his opponents and quietly sneak behind enemy lines. He can perform a "Backstab", resulting in an instant kill, use his Sapper to destroy enemy buildings such as Sentries, and use his Cloaking Device to become temporarily invisible to sneak around danger. Playing as a Spy requires stealth and smarts to succeed. The best thing about all these characters is the fact that, other than the Heavy being the games main Icon, none of the classes seem to be better than the rest. They all have their own special weaknesses and none of them are generally favored over the others. The game is a masterpiece and that's all I can say.

review: This is a great fps game. It has a cartoony feel to it which is not very common among most first person shooter games. However if you have played games like COD or other games with guns, be aware that this is nothing like those. It has specific classes with set weapons, all classes have weaknesses and strengths. Not recommended for people who like to play offline either as the training games are not the best.
game-hours: 2299.5
review: Team Fortress 2 is an FPS game with a singleplayer and multiplayer servers. I think that this game is awesome, but they need to upgrade the weapon/item drop system, it needs to give new players a few more items than people who have been playing the game more often. The textures are somewhat realistic with a sort of "cartoony" feel to them. The player models are good but could use a little more detail, even if it's a "cartoony" game. Basic plot: Mann CO. a company run by the tough Saxton Hale who had 3 sons, Red, Blu, and Grey. Red and Blu exiled Grey and fought with eachother like maniacs. Grey came back with replicas of Red and Blus armies, Robots. Classes: Scout, Soldier, Pyro, Demo, Heavy, Engineer, Medic, Sniper, and Spy.

Even if people say, "TF2 is stupid because everybody is only worrying about hats and cosnedics." still, dont judge a book (or game) by it's cover. In my opinion, TF2 is so much better than any other FPS game, mostly because of that they're barely any 3 year olds playing and complaining about how this one guy keeps backstabbing him. 200000000000000000/10 (edit: and mostly always i'm the one doing the backstabbing...)

review: I really like everything in TF2, (hats, weps, random drops, etc). My three favorite classes, are, Pyro, Demo, and, medic. Run in with Pyro and try to fry as many as possiable, hope that theres no medics so that your run wouldn't be ruined, Demo, I had one awesome round with Demo, my team was really close to getting the last cap point, and then i used the "Charge N Targe", and ran on the point and won for us, and i noticed when, i turned around, everyone was coming in. Medic, first class i ever played in TF2, i like how Medic is a simple class, just go heal, maybe heal yourself a bit, but not too much, because you want your teammates to live for a bit longer, and, thats all you gotta do, nothing more...

review: Team Fortress 2: One of the most amazing FPS games of this generation, even if you arent too much into FPS there is always trading and a long list of custom gamemodes. Now "Whats trading?" you may ask, well. Trading is one of the strongest points of TF2, you can swap hats, weapons, tools and ingame currency, now dont worry you dont have to pay A DIME even the ingame currency as mentioned is free (exeption of keys which have to first be bought then traded). Now even if you dont enjoy trading but want swanky new items you can try crafting them or by playing the game and getting random item drops BUT you can also spend some real life money and buy some items! Lets talk about the actual game now, the game itself is one of the most balanced and skill based games ever made. There is 9 classes that are all 100% balanced, over 50 maps and hundreds of custom maps and hundreds of balanced weapons to use! My overall rating for this amazing FPS is 10/10, I have played it everyday and will keep playing forever! ~Delta

review: Truly amazing game, and its been like that for the past 7 years! From the day I started, I have thoroughly enjoyed this game. Valve has chose and done bad mistakes, but people just shake it off, and deal with it. The trading system is very good but Pishers came with it aswell, that can upset some people after clikcing a link. Otherwise, a extraodinary game indeed.

The weapons are so varied and each has a possible potential to be useful. Also has a variaty of maps, and different gamemodes.

Also, there are lots of fun smaller servers and a great trading community along with a competitive community. Also, you can go on special non-official servers such as randomizer, where every quality about your character is randomized to anything on any class, including having 3 different-class weapons.

review: Team Fortress 2 is easily one of the most addictive games I have ever played. The gameplay is very simple, You are either on RED or BLU, Fighting one and other ina variety of objective based gamemodes. This forces players to work together as a team. This game is NOT for the Lone Wolf. What makes TF2 unique is it's insane amount of customaztion. The game features 9 distinct classes, Each with their own Personality, Play-Styles, Designs and weapons. From the Speedy, Loud-Mouthed Scout, To the Insane, Mad Scientist Medic, Each class is unique. This add's depth to this game. There is ALWAYS something new to do and experience. The Community have kept this game alive with constant Mod's and inventive gamemodes, While the TF2 team keep the game fresh with constant free content. Whether is new weapons or New hats, Each update keeps players interested. On top of all of this, TF2 features a very unique art style. This makes it stand out amongst all the other Military shooters. It's cartoonish, 1960's style, Makes it simply beautiful. Valve certianly did a fantastic job in creating a unique world for this game. TF2 is also damn hilarious, With a barrage of Meme's, Quotes and Dark Humor to keep anyone happy. While the humor isn't always for everyone, It certainly get's me laughing to myself as I Gib a Pesky Spy. While TF2 has lost some of it's core charm due to trading/players, It still remains one of Valve's greatest hits. TF2 is a must have for ANY PC gamer. Also, It is free. And you can wear fancy Hats/ If you have yet to experience TF2, I would heavily reccomend to download it right now. 9.5/10.

It's very friendly and welcoming to new players as well- the tutorial and training system is excellent. Weapons are distributed randomly and have certain strengths and weaknesses. And with the 9 classes, each with at least 3 loadout slots, there are a lot of potential strategic loadouts to choose from. Valve amazed me with both TF2 and Left 4 Dead 2.

If so, those are just 3 out of 9 classes with their own unique roles and stratergies. This game can use stratergies such as the use of sticky bombs or turrets or can just be a rush in and destroy everything with a minigun and a knife. Has many gamemodes for the player's desire and many weapons that can change the battlefield and is free to play. There is nothing to lose except all the time you'll be using to play this game!

I get bored of playing 1 class? switch to another and play maybe 34 more minuets. then do it over and over. The different weapons are fun to use, and the hats look sexy. Very fun game, i highly recommend this to any other FPS gamer out there.

review: Probably one of the best online multiplayer shooters to exist. Team Fortress 2 provides a lot of fun with different classes, customizable loadouts, and of course.. hats. The player can choose from 9 different classes, each with different advantages and tactics. The nine classes are divided into three categories: Offense, Defense and Support. Offensive classes would be; The Scout: A faster class that uses a scattergun, a secondary pistol and a bat for melee. This class has less health but can easily avoid enemy fire, and capture enemy control points twice as fast as any other class. The Soldier: A slower offensive class that carries a rocket launcher, a shotgun and a shovel. Soldiers can be used to take care of buildings like sentry guns and teleporters, made by the Engineer. Or, if you're skilled enough, you could "Rocket Jump" by simply pointing the rocket launcher down at the ground below you, before jumping and shooting. The rocket will explode on impact of the ground, launching you high above the ground and give you the ability to quickly fly into enemy grounds. The Pyro: Pretty self-explainatory, the Pyro uses a flamethrower to set enemies... well... on fire, giving additional damage even if the enemy flees. (Unless said enemy flees into water) Other weapons include another shotgun, and a fire axe. Pyros can also shoot strong air out of the flamethrowers muzzle, which gives it the ability to "air blast" rockets back at enemy Soldiers, or grenades back at an enemy Demoman. For the Defense category, we have; The Demoman: A class known to maining on explosives, and to drink. The Demoman wields a grenade launcher, a "stickybomb" launcher and a glass bottle. "Stickybombs" are pretty self explainatory; Bombs that can stick to any surface. These bombs can be used strategically to blow up the enemy when they least expect it. (For example, planting the stickybombs on a control point.) Stickybombs can also be used to launch the Demoman high in the air, similar to "Rocket Jumping". The Heavy: A slow but effectively defensive class who wields a minigun as a primary weapon, shotgun for secondary and uses his own bare fists for melee. Heavys can easily defeat any enemy in close quarters, but skilled players can easily turn the tables. If paired with a Medic, the Heavy could be difficult to take care of. Having a Medic paired with a Heavy can make for a very effective defense, as long as the Medic stays safe. The Engineer: A class that's not as focused on charging into battle, but more on staying back and building different machines to help the team succeed. The machines vary from sentry guns, health and ammo dispensers, and teleporters. The Engineer also has the ability to upgrade any building using "metal", a secondary ammunition that Engineers collect from parts of destroyed buildings, and dropped weapons from defeated enemies and allies alike. And for the Support category, there is; The Medic: Medics have the ability to heal injured allies using a "medi gun". Of course, Medics are also armed with a syringe gun and a bonesaw, for close combat. As the Medic heals an ally, he builds up an "UberCharge" which, when fully charged, can shield the Medic and any ally he's currently healing from any enemy fire for a limited time. Medics can be very effective when paired with the defensive Heavy, so as long as the Medic stays away from enemy fire and keeps safe. The Medic also has the ability to heal over time, but only by a small amount per second. The Sniper: Self-explainatory, the Sniper can be used to hide back unseen and snipe incoming enemies with the Sniper Rifle. This class is also equipped with an SMG, and a kukri knife for close encounters with the enemy. When you stay zoomed in on the scope, a small meter is filled on the side of the screen, leading to a lightning bolt. When this meter is filled, the rifle can fire a "charged" shot that can take most classes out, even if its not a headshot. And the Spy: A unique class that can be used to disguise as an enemy class using a Disguise Kit. The Spy can sneak over to enemy territory and use his Knife to backstab an enemy, instantly killing them no matter how much health they have. Spies are also wielding a Revolver and a "Sapper". Sappers can be used to disable and destroy buildings from the Engineer class. Spies can then sneak behind an Engineer focused on the sapper, and backstab them. But attacking while disguised risks being caught, as a Spy's disguise instantly goes away when attacking. Spies can also cloak to appear invisible, using their watch. But such power is limited, and goes away if used for too long, forcing the Spy to stay visible until its fully charged. Spies cannot attack while invisible, nor can they capture control points cloaked or disguised. Team Fortress 2 also features a completely customizable set of loadouts for your classes. You may recieve different weapons for different strategies, such as giving the Demoman the ability to charge and bash into enemies with the Chargin' Targe. Or the player can give the Heavy to heal quickly with the popular Sandvich. Players may also recieve accessories and of course, hats. Players can also paint certain accessories any color they wish, if they ever get the right bucket. There are also "decal tools", "name tags", and "description tags". Decal tools allow the player to put custom images on certain weapons and accessories, as the Name and Description Tags allow the player to change the name and description of the item to anything they wish. Players may purchase or trade "Mann Co. Supply Crate Keys", which they can use to unlock and open "Mann Co. Supply Crates", which are randomly found in-game. Doing so will grant the player special items, like more accessories or weapons. Most common from crates are the Strange quality weapons. These special weapons can track the total amount of kills the player makes with that specific weapon. Increasing the total kills by certain amounts can "rank up" the weapon, giving it a special name for others to see. (I.E: "Truly Feared Minigun") Team Fortress 2 gives an unforgettable multiplayer experience. Its cartoony graphics, remarkable voice acting, and its unique classes and characters, makes Team Fortress 2 a must-have for gamers everywhere. And best of all, its FREE. Players can also communicate over mic, spray custom images on the wall, and chat in the server's chatbox. But its strongly recommended to NOT do so these days, given the community. (Also, as a warning to new players; Don't enter "unbindall" in the console commands. )

review: Well... How do I talk about a game which dosen't really have a purpose? How do I convey the hours of enjoyment I've gained... if I haven't been doing anything useful. This game... now this game is not a first person shooter. It is a hat simulating, conga lining, unusual trading, strange gathering, killstreak hoarding, taunt collecting piece of beautiful magic that we are lucky to have graced the earth. Deeper into the game you encounter hours of fun which are never the same no matter what you play! This my friends.. is the only game in my WHOLE STEAM LIBRARY THAT I PLAY. not to mention that its free. (If you want to be a gibbus noob) One thing i must say: download this game. It's not serious; its a joke. but its the best joke ever told.

review: Truly amazing game, and its been like that for the past 7 years! From the day I started, I have thoroughly enjoyed this game. Valve has chose and done bad mistakes, but people just shake it off, and deal with it. The trading system is very good but Pishers came with it aswell, that can upset some people after clikcing a link. Otherwise, a extraodinary game indeed.

review: It is a very good game with lots of good things that are good, but the servers are not good why are they not good, i'll tell you why. They are not good because the people are mean to me so that is not good but what is good is the random drops that is good i got a gun which is very good because it is one shot kill that is good. what is bad the op weapons that people use it isnt very good, but what is good is that the characters are funny so that is good becuase it makes me laugh with kek thanks for reading my good review tell me how good it is by messaging on my good steam page bye - Good Gamer1

review: Really nice game to just pick up, join, play. Yes, yes there are a lot of people going on: WOW i got 18 spys on my team; Only M1+W Pyro's; I got this medick with nothning buth shooting syringes... And so on. Also there is a lot of hype about the hats... BUTH THAT DOSENT MATTER!!! Free to play or Pay to play its all the same... You get the best weapons (well almost all) at the beggining as stock weapons! Yes you can upgrade to strange, vintage, unusual, genuine and so on buth it dosent matter if you do or not... Also the hats are just something you have to look like something... They are not really a big deal. And if dont wanna spend any money on this game buth on another steam game you get to "half premuim"-That means you get 100 slots (maybe more), you can craft metal into hats (really spend your usefull weapons for metal and spend 3 refinds to get a hat... Any then you just do that and you can get up to stuff fast and quick and with almost no "no-fun-time" couse even knowing that tradeing is kinda ruining this game you can still have some fun douing it if you got a reason to. Owerall: greate game, fast and slow paced, difrent stuff to do (my favorite: Rocket/Sticky jumping, difrent game mods as you get in GMod)... Has greate "get a competitative game fast" option if you just go to: TF2 Center and click the first link log in and play (you wanna have about 1000 hours so people wont go on and on about how bad you are. Also dont play the medick, pocket for the first time! Accept if you really got lots of hours like about 3000-4000. So just get in dont worry and have fun. 10/10 Steams. 11/10 Hats. 1/10 Gabe's. 10/10 Nice game!

review: This game may be free to play. But it does free to play right. No gems or time limits on guns or classes. every single item is possible to obtain without a special currency. And most of all you NEVER need to buy anything. You can buy things if you are impatiant to find a weapon but you never NEED to. I would rate thise game easily a 10/10 it is an amazing shooter. And teamwork is actually in this fun class based FPS. Looking at you Battle *COUGH* field. Anyway if you are looking for some fast paced action and buckets of fun. This is the game for you my friend.

review: Good game, what sucks is the community. It consists mostly of around 18 yr old YOLO-idiots, homophobics, bronies, furries, sexists and ignorants. There can hardly be a single MVM without harassing, whining and idiotic behavior, annoying setup and ragequitting. There are hardly servers without stupid people on the mic, puking out their racist and intolerant opinions nobody gives a damn about. Maybe I'm too old for this bull frickin' horse , but I'm really tired of the majority of players here. BTW, there are also female players out there, so shove your lesbian sprays up your  and take some more Medic/Engineer action, you homophobic morons.

review: I think there are enough reviews to show that this game is highly recommended, but here's another anyway. TF2 manages to do a few things quite flawlessly: 1. Classes. TF2 has 9 very distinct classes, each with a very different style of gameplay attached to them, making the game very replayable. 2. Clarity. TF2 is a very approachable game, as the classes are very well defined and their roles (from the eyes of a newbie) are fairly clear. The art style in the game also makes it very approachable, catering for pretty much all audiences. 3. Variety. To add on to the classes being varied, there is also a massive set of weapons, which range from minor cosmetic differences to completely different utilities, making weapon combinations become something personal that you can tailor to your style of play. TF2 also boasts a decent range of game-modes, from CTF to Capture Points, to King of the Hill, and even a vastly different co-op mode MvM (Mann vs. Machine). 4. Community. TF2 has a very active trading scene, competitive lobby and league scene, and Steam Workshop. Many items created by fans of the game have ended up being implemented, producing revenue for the artist and Valve itself, which leads onto my final point: 5. Free-to-play done right. Their monetisation methods are non-intrusive and not in your face. There is incentive to gamble with crates for strange/unusual items through buying 'keys', but in the end the high-tier loot are all COSMETIC in nature, rather than unlocking some weapon with vastly OP stats like so many other F2P games. Everything that can be bought can also be traded for, and with the activity of the community it is not too difficult a feat to do. The game also provides you with free items based on play time, which can of course be traded, and non-tradable basic weapons for completing achievement milestones with the different classes. All in all, it's a great class-based shooter/hat simulator with a great setup behind it. Go play!

review: A comical First-Person Shooter, Team Fortress 2 comes right into the top few games in anyone's library. Shoot stuff. Blow up stuff. Sometimes even burn stuff - and progressively get better at it all. If you're the sort of person who likes to shoot other people online, then I see no viable reason that this could NOT be a perfect game for you. If you're a clever tactician, several in-game gimmicks and combos exist to aid you into better combat. That's what I enjoy the most myself... And even if you're a concientious objector, there's a peaceful protest sign with your name on it - literally. Uh... maybe the rest is better left unsaid... All in all, a good and timelessly entertaining game - bring a friend or two along!

review: After 9 years of development, Valve made another very good game that made me lose nearly 2000 hours of my life. Team Fortress 2 came out in year 2007 and is still getting updates which clearly shows how popular and awesome this game is. Game is really free to play which means that you don't have to pay any cent to wreck player who spent thousands of $ on it but you can buy premium to get 300 backpack slots instead of 50, free hat, ability to trade your items and ability to get rare items from weekly items drop but you will have to add at least 5 to your Steam Wallet and just buy cheapest thing in Mann Co. Store (if you have already money in Steam Wallet, you don't even have to spend 0,10 to buy one). I can easily recommend this game to everyone who wants to have fun without spending much money (or doesn't want to spend at all) and loves games with some team work, many mods (custom too) or just loves hats

review: How to feel good playing this game: Heal people on fire about to die with 1 health left. Bonk a heavy about to decimate your team. Snipe that spy about to chain stab your team. Build teleporter exit to first spawn point near the end of a match. Backstab a sniper until he switches to razorback. Headshot him until he switches to pyro. Win a match after team sh*ttalker moves to other "winning" team. Kick a bad medic for trying. Getting 50 kills in a row also feels pretty good, if you can do it. Don't acknowledge the people who defecate in their living room instead of their bathroom. People who bring all their life problems to the game, known as ragers, don't realize the fundamental aspect of entertainment. Whatever good or bad thing happens while playing, is ultimately for your entertainment. You will forget this playing TF2 though just saying and become a rager yourself.

review: I used to think that games used to be about skill and how well you work with a team of freinds/strangers. All that changed when I got TF2 (Hat Simulator 2014). I am educated now and know that the things you need to be good at this game are: -Unusual Hats worth only $50000 -A once full, now empty life savings account -Hats -Hats -Hats In this game you will select one of 9 characters which all have their special OP power which will make even the most patient monk rage quit. This game is about your character going on a pointless, perilous journey in order to get all the keys ever made by Valve. No one knows why you try and complete this story, but if you don't your freinds might get more keys than you and you don't want that. Eventually you spend all your money and/or life to buy these over-priced hats and boast to some guy on the other side of the world about how cool your $560000 hat is, only to have him call you a n00b and show you his $560001 hat and proceed to kick you from the server for being a skrublord. In this game you will experience several gamemodes such as: -Kick everyone on the server who makes a mistake A.K.A Tour of Duty -Practice of Kick everyone on the server who makes a mistake A.K.A Boot Camp -Show off your sexy hats to people who you deem beneth thyself A.K.A Trade servers -School of sniping A.K.A 2fort -Custom gamemodes which can somtimes be more fun the the default game A.K.A Custom games -Every other gamemode with people who you deem Free2play A.K.A Every other gamemode with people who you deem Free2play The best part of the game (apart from the 10/10 hat simulation) is when after 10 mins of you being one of the only contributors to your team and right about to win the game with your freinds, you get switched for "auto-ballance" ad end up on a loosing streak. SO FUUUUUUUUUUUN AND BEST FEATURE OF ANY GAME!!! Because of this game I have no money, no freinds and no life, but I have hats and really... isn't that what life is all about? 10/10 would play again

There is alot of fun to getting this game, and since this game is free there is no reason to not get this game. I reccomend it to any person who bothered to read this ramble all the way through.

review: I've played this game for so many hours, but I'm still not even that great at the game. I can't rocket jump for anything, I still can't properly time airblasts, I'm pretty bad with the Scout, I've barely played Sniper at all. But you know what? There are a few things I can do: I can pop a perfectly timed Uber, I can be useful as a Heavy and heal my teammates with my sanvich, I can stickyjump and aim the Loch'n'Load pretty well, I can setup buldings in strategic spots to be as useful to my team as possible, I can get backstabs half the time I try, and I'm pretty damn good at prop hunt. You see, tf2 is a game you can play for the rest of your life if you find some servers with a good crowd of regulars that use their mics. I've had so many fun times just effing around on some servers, that alone makes the game worth trying. Unfortunately, the tf2 community is extremely divided nowadays. This community used to be one of the best around, a part of it still is, but the more updates there are the more the community splits apart. If you plan on playing this game, it being free there's no reason not to, PLEASE use your mic. Another unfortunate thing about today's tf2, there's less people using their mics than ever and that's how you really work as a team and have fun with one another. Don't be afraid about being new to the game, a lot of people in the community may look down on you, but myself and plenty of others won't. Feel free to ask for help, start with Heavy as your first class and work from there. The shenanigans that occur in this game are limitless, I feel Valve has strayed quite a bit from the game's artstyle with all the cosmetics they've added (originally a pair of windowed shades were how far they'd stretch tf2's artstyle and now that restraint is non-existant) but the game's core mechanics are still great. This game has an incredibly high skill ceiling, it's near impossible for someone to master ALL the classes in the game, so just find 2 or 3 that you like and play them to your heart's content. I maybe only have 1 hour logged with Sniper because I'm terrible at sniping in video games and don't like being a sniper in general, but I'm sure if I practiced with him as much as a played as Demoman or Heavy or Engineer or Soldier or Medic, then I'd actually be decent at sniping. In this game, like most games, practice makes perfect, well not really perfect, more like practice makes you credit to team. Initally, no you won't be credit to team, but the more you play the more useful you will become so keep at it and find a few classes who's playstyle suits YOU! tl;dr I've played this game for a while and I still suck as Sniper, Scout, and Pyro, but I do make a pretty great Demoman, Heavy, Engineer, and Medic and an average Soldier and Spy. The classes I'm good at I'm good at because I played with them a lot and I liked their playstyle. If you play this game you're almost guaranteed to find one class who's playstyle you enjoy so I encourage you to delve into tf2 and find YOUR class. After 9 years in development this game was worth the weight, thanks for reading this review and have fun!

review: Team Fortress 2 is a team-based, first-person shooter multiplayer computer game developed by valve. It is the successful sequel to Tream Fortress Classic. It first came out in a compilation called The Orange Box, which is no longer avaliable. As of 2011, Team Fortress 2 is a free to play game, where you can upgrade to premium via purchasing something from the Team Fortress 2 in-game store. Gameplay: This fun game is based on two oppisite teams, Builders League United, often refered to as BLU team. And RED team, Reliable Excavation and Demolition. Players can choose to play as one of the nine character classes in these teams each with their own unique strenghts, weaknesses and weapons. Each class consist of a primary weapon, a secondary weapon, and a melee weapon. Although certain classes contain PDA's and other unique items. Team Fortress 2 was released with six offical maps, but many more maps have been added. A neat little addition to this game is "The Administrator" a woman announces different game events over PA or Loudspeaker, so that everyone in the game can hear it. Stats are a extreamly nice addition to this game, where time played as a certain class, most kills as that class and most objectives achived in that life, etc... Game Modes: -In Capture the Flag maps, the objective for both teams is to obtain a briefcase of intelligence from the enemy team's base and return it to their own base while preventing the opposing team from doing the same. The player carrying the intelligence can be killed to drop the briefcase, or the player can willingly drop it; in either case this starts a brief timer. A team can only score by delivering the enemy's intelligence to their base. A match lasts until one team scores a set number of points or time runs out. A variant of Capture the Flag, called Special Delivery, has teams vying over a single briefcase to attempt to deliver to a common target. Once the intelligence is picked up by one team, only members of that team can carry it until either it successfully delivered, or the drop timer expires and it is returned to its original spawn point. -Control Point modes are more varied in their objectives, but share the common aim of capturing a particular point on the map by having one or more team members stay on the point without the presence of the opposing team for a short period of time. In standard control point maps, each team already controls an equal number of points, with one additional point left unclaimed; teams can only attempt to capture points that are nearest to those points they already control. Each team attempts to progressively capture all the control points to win the round. In attack/defend-style maps, the RED team already controls all the points on the map, and must hold these points from being captured by the opposing team (BLU Team) for a length of time. Attack/defend-style maps can come in either single-round or multiple-round maps; Rounds past the first will only be played if BLU wins a round. -Territorial control is a more complex version of Control Point, in which each map is divided into a number of closed sections, held between the two teams. Each round has one team attempting to seize control of the opposing team's capture point for that section in a fixed amount of time. Once a team holds all but the enemy's home base point, they then attempt to capture the enemy base point while the enemy defends for a fixed amount of time. -King of the Hill features a single control point in the center of the map, with teams vying for control over it. The control point is locked for a set amount of time after the round start. Once the point is unlocked, either team can capture it. Capturing the control point starts the team's clock counting down. The clock that is currently counting down will only stop if the other team captures the point, the clock reaches 0:00, or another map-specific event occurs such as a Halloween boss spawning during the Halloween event. Teams win the round when their clock reaches 0:00 with the control point currently under their control. If the other team is capturing the point, the round will not end until the point's capture progress resets to 0. -Payload maps feature a length of track atop which sits a bomb mounted on a cart. These maps come in two varieties. In normal Payload maps, one team must escort the cart through a series of checkpoints in a limited amount of time to reach a final target that the other team defends. The cart moves when one or more players of the team are near it without enemies nearby; during this, the cart heals and provides ammo to those close by. If no one is by the cart, it may move backwards towards the last checkpoint, or roll off uphill sections of the track. In Payload Races, both teams race to deliver a bomb-cart to a final target; there are no checkpoints and unmanned carts will not move in reverse, but still require team members nearby to fully complete uphill sections. Both types of Payload maps can come in single-round or multiple-round maps. In standard payload, further rounds will only be played if BLU wins. In Payload Race, all rounds will be played regardless of which team wins, but the winner of previous rounds starts with their cart farther up the track. -Arena is a team deathmatch mode, typically occurring smaller environments featuring a single control point. In each round, players do not respawn on death; a team wins the round by capturing the control point or eliminating all of the other team members. -Medieval mode can be played on maps dedicated to this mode, or enabled for any other mode type. This mode forces players to use melee or similar medieval weapons. -MvM - Mann vs. Machine - is a six player co-operative mode where the mercenaries are defending a structure against increasingly difficult waves of robots. Players have the ability to buy upgrades and improvements between rounds using in-game money earned during previous waves. A "Mann Up" version is available by purchasing tickets with real money to participate in larger events on official servers with the opportunity to win unique cosmetic items after successfully completing a Tour of Duty. If you decided to read this far in, thank-you for reading. :)

review: Team Fortress 2 has been one of my finest gaming experiences ever. I've played many multiplayer games over the years and I must say TF2 has proven to be one of the most innovative and constantly changing (for the better) title I've ever dealt with. Though I'll keep this short I will comment that every class feels unique and every character organic; with a playstyle and personality that each can call their own. This is perhaps my main drawing point to the series as their are few thinks more fun then dominating your enemies while your Demoman slurs drunkenly about the battlefield with a sword and decapitates a Heavy with a Minigun. In all my time playing this game the experience has never diminished and I hold high hopes for the future of this game,

review: Team Fortress 2 is The Best First Person Sprayer Game in existence. It's an extremely popular game with 9 different Classes wich are so balanced and unbalanced at the same time its confusing. Some Classes has guarantied 1 Hit KO Attacks that might make you rage, and some classes has such a ridicolus damage output you wont even see yor enemy before your dead. But in this game you have to remember something the title says it self, TEAM Fortress 2. This is NOT a one man army game, this is a Team Work Game. So Gather up your friends, find out what Class fits you and your friends best, start training, work together, and win together. Welcome to Team Fortress 2

review: Glad that you ask. Team Fortress 2 has been quite an eye catcher since it's release in 2007 Gaining Game of the Year awards Having it's own Large Fan base with Fads and Memes This is one of those games that seems to live on forever It's artistic style never goes out of style due to it's cartoonish rendering Customization is also a pinnacle of this game Hats and Items are bought nearly every day, netting Valve lots of cash each passing day. The game itself is FUN More fun than you could imagine In fact, there are servers that are even dedicated to Fun However, if you're a Tryhard, Go ahead and try those Competitive Servers ! If you're a bit of both then just simply join a Public Server Gameplay-wise This game is VERY FLEXIBLE Almost each class is tweakable to your own style of playing (Yes, there are a few OP weapons) The Scout can turn into a Speeding Powerhouse The Demoman can turn into a Melee Behemoth Even the freaking Medic can turn into an Offensive Class when used properly The Community is also a Mix of Kind Players, Some could be Tryhard but will usually say the Good olg "GG" or "GG NO RE" on Arena However, Kids do appear in the game at times Some of them might even Mic-Spam, but don't worry ! You can just mute them, You can even kick them if the rest of the Server Clients agree with you Overall, This is a GREAT GAME Community, Gameplay, The Game itself 9.9/10 -0.1 Due to the fact, If You're F2P You're considered a Second Class Player Unless you can Prove your Skill at this game You even get less backpack space Spend money on the game to get the full experience.

review: An FPS that introduces a different style of play. Nine classes, each have a different task in the team, and each require different skill sets to play. Not only does one strive to master the classes, but also the various weapons unique to each class. Despite coming with a cost to have weapons (whether money or time in trading), it is definitely worth it if you have time. I don't recommend this to people who are in a busy point of their lives, as it may be addicting to experiment with loadouts and whatnot. Though, if you've got time, take a shot, it's worth your while even if you don't stick around. Also, as a final note, this game is far from a Pay2Win scenario. I've gained enough hours to have experimented with the many weapons, and I will say this: There are no weapons in the game that can be bought in order to destroy in a server. Even if a weapon has great stats (ie. The Back Scatter in the most recent update), in the long run the default is usually superior (unless someone has gained enough skill with such weapon). As long as you have skill, you can make a weapon destroy. Good luck and remember: This is TEAM Fortress 2.

review: If you have not played Team Fortress 2, then you should sit in a corner and think about your life! Team Fortress 2 might just be my favorite first person shooter games. You can choose from 9 classes, each one that has tons and tons of weapons and hats. If you think that it is boring just killing the other team over and over all the time, then you are wrong! Be warned that if you get this game, you will be sucked into it and you will not stop playing it! You will spend your days locked in a dark room with a bowl of Doritos by your side. You will become fat and lazy with no wife, no kids, and most importantly no life. Trust me, it has happened to me already. Remember that this game appears to be free except for one thing.... your life.

To see that VALVe has kept a F2P game up like this, is impressive and is one of the reasons why VALVe is my favorite Game company. This game is great and will be for the years to come.

review: Alright, listen up. I may be a conjurer of evil moons and spawner of children's nightmares, but I have something to say. This game is a good game in general. You know, violence, murder, hat simulation... wait, what? I'll get to that later. Anyway, ever since the game became Free-to-Play (which I shouldn't be saying this because thats how i got into the game), little children and C.O.D Fanboys/Fangirls came in and ruined the game as we knew it. Those who already own the game, think about it. Whining 7 year olds, tryhards, servers dedicated... DEDICATED... to idling and getting pointless (and sometimes not so pointless) items... are you KIDDING ME? Valve has made a huge mistake here. Stupidity at its finest, people. Now, don't get me wrong. I like this game, not just because of the hat simulation. The 9 classes all have unique personalities witha variety of weapons, which the collection of the weapons is slowly building up. The End of the Line update is coming soon, and I hope to Talos that they don't  up this one. After the Love and War Update, the game's tables have been turned. Remember the whole hat simulation thing? Yeah. They added 40 new hats and other cosmetics in this update, along with only 5 weapons. Also, about 14 taunts. Valve, I just hpe you can get rid of all of these little kids begging for Keys, because everyone is tired of them. Now, about the actual gameplay. The gameplay itself is pretty nice, but some of the people playing are not. There are tryhards, whining kids and just plain idiots who join some servers. But if you like competitive play, then you'll like it. The 9 classes have a variety of tools in their arsenal to bring your team to victory. I like this game. Nuff said. Feel free to dislike this, for it turned out to be a humongous rant about little children. Thank you for your consideration.

review: Join Hat Simulator Fortress 2 now! This game is filled with awesome mercenaries that will be better if you make them wear hats! Because hats are their life. 10/10. Seriously though, get this game. It is not your regular FPS game. This game has enough charm to make your head explode. You will have hours of fun and hats. So stop reading and download this game for FREE. (And later on, buy hats on the store.)

review: I love this game, because of the fact that it has, over the past 5 or so years, developed a diverse and mechanical economy of its own. I have spent countless hours trading, crafting, and buying several hundreds of items over the past year. And the fact that this economy has been almost entirely developed by the Steam Community is remarkable. I would be shocked if I found a steam user who did not already own this masterpiece of a game. Any other MMOFPS game that has been thrown my way has not even come close to the mastery of this here game. 10000/10. (TL;DR)

review: This game may be free to play. But it does free to play right. No gems or time limits on guns or classes. every single item is possible to obtain without a special currency. And most of all you NEVER need to buy anything. You can buy things if you are impatiant to find a weapon but you never NEED to. I would rate thise game easily a 10/10 it is an amazing shooter. And teamwork is actually in this fun class based FPS. Looking at you Battle *COUGH* field. Anyway if you are looking for some fast paced action and buckets of fun. This is the game for you my friend.

review: Team Fortress 2 is without a doubt the greatest shooter game I have ever played. While 11 year old tryhards slobber over rehashed Call of Duty garbage, real gamers are playing this colorful, creative, funny, well developed, well written, well put together and very well done First Person Shooter game. The game is free, so there is no excuse for you not to check it out. You really shouldn't regret it (Unless you suffer from addiction to games, then avoid this game at all costs).

review: I think there are enough reviews to show that this game is highly recommended, but here's another anyway. TF2 manages to do a few things quite flawlessly: 1. Classes. TF2 has 9 very distinct classes, each with a very different style of gameplay attached to them, making the game very replayable. 2. Clarity. TF2 is a very approachable game, as the classes are very well defined and their roles (from the eyes of a newbie) are fairly clear. The art style in the game also makes it very approachable, catering for pretty much all audiences. 3. Variety. To add on to the classes being varied, there is also a massive set of weapons, which range from minor cosmetic differences to completely different utilities, making weapon combinations become something personal that you can tailor to your style of play. TF2 also boasts a decent range of game-modes, from CTF to Capture Points, to King of the Hill, and even a vastly different co-op mode MvM (Mann vs. Machine). 4. Community. TF2 has a very active trading scene, competitive lobby and league scene, and Steam Workshop. Many items created by fans of the game have ended up being implemented, producing revenue for the artist and Valve itself, which leads onto my final point: 5. Free-to-play done right. Their monetisation methods are non-intrusive and not in your face. There is incentive to gamble with crates for strange/unusual items through buying 'keys', but in the end the high-tier loot are all COSMETIC in nature, rather than unlocking some weapon with vastly OP stats like so many other F2P games. Everything that can be bought can also be traded for, and with the activity of the community it is not too difficult a feat to do. The game also provides you with free items based on play time, which can of course be traded, and non-tradable basic weapons for completing achievement milestones with the different classes. All in all, it's a great class-based shooter/hat simulator with a great setup behind it. Go play!

review: This game is fun and you should start out official server multiplayer. It is fairly easy to learn and i suggest playing as the pyro first, then moving on to the heavy. Also, there are lots of fun smaller servers and a great trading community along with a competitive community. Also, you can go on special non-official servers such as randomizer, where every quality about your character is randomized to anything on any class, including having 3 different-class weapons.

review: Team Fortress 2 is easily one of the most addictive games I have ever played. The gameplay is very simple, You are either on RED or BLU, Fighting one and other ina variety of objective based gamemodes. This forces players to work together as a team. This game is NOT for the Lone Wolf. What makes TF2 unique is it's insane amount of customaztion. The game features 9 distinct classes, Each with their own Personality, Play-Styles, Designs and weapons. From the Speedy, Loud-Mouthed Scout, To the Insane, Mad Scientist Medic, Each class is unique. This add's depth to this game. There is ALWAYS something new to do and experience. The Community have kept this game alive with constant Mod's and inventive gamemodes, While the TF2 team keep the game fresh with constant free content. Whether is new weapons or New hats, Each update keeps players interested. On top of all of this, TF2 features a very unique art style. This makes it stand out amongst all the other Military shooters. It's cartoonish, 1960's style, Makes it simply beautiful. Valve certianly did a fantastic job in creating a unique world for this game. TF2 is also damn hilarious, With a barrage of Meme's, Quotes and Dark Humor to keep anyone happy. While the humor isn't always for everyone, It certainly get's me laughing to myself as I Gib a Pesky Spy. While TF2 has lost some of it's core charm due to trading/players, It still remains one of Valve's greatest hits. TF2 is a must have for ANY PC gamer. Also, It is free. And you can wear fancy Hats/ If you have yet to experience TF2, I would heavily reccomend to download it right now. 9.5/10.

review: I played in this game from 2008, right from the first time when i read review on this game in a cozy "Igromaniac"... Author said the game has a lot of advantages, 9 distinct glasses, and the main thing... cozy, expensive and cool customization... Later (about a week later) we played on some custom map with my friends and were thinking how this game was cool, how it is well balanced and stuff... But later, we noticed one more thing:the game was always changing. The gameplay was changing, there was added new custom parts... and you know what? i left from this game, because i didn't like all this changes... In 2012 (or 2011) my friend sucked me back in the game with the arguement of "dude, you have to check it out". And the thing was men vs. machine update. I was more than amazed... so much changed for all this 4 years while in most other games stuff stays the same! I highly recommend this game to everybody: from the ones who likes bloody shooters, to the people who likes fat eastern eggs on stuff from media. And especially changes, because this game lives more than 8 years now, and it keeps changing, it keeps being popular, it keeps being fresh.

On top of that, it's 100% free, and the only free to play game I've seen yet that is NOT pay to win. On top of THAT, I love that you can play it in super-serious tryhard mode or just run around doing something silly and have fun either way (and not get yelled at, I should mention the community for this game kicks ) What I'm trying to say is, GET THIS GAME, IT'S AMAZING Plus, even if you don't like it, it's not like it cost you anything

review: This game is silly fun.. Nothing is more satisfying than backstabbing your mate, great over skype. The teamplay is above average , it actually HAS a physics engine, which I like. The unlock system is a bit odd and I dont rally understand the crafting, there arent really enough tutorials. I do however have a reocurring problem, on Gmod and any other valve game... Servers get connection failed after four retries and when I refresh the servers disappear... Anyways I have to rate this game positively becuase it is one of the most fun games I've played and I feel the developers put lots of effort into it. 8/10

review: This is certainly the billionth recommendation for TF2 ever made, most likely. If you need one word to sum up the game: Hats. Need another? Fun. This certainly is a top favorite game of mine for a good reason, and that it's just too much fun. Really, I can say it's one of the best, if not the best, free-to-play game out there, and that's not doing the game much justice. The game has multiple objective-based modes inplemented into a truckload of maps that have been either made by Valve or the community, and contains a pretty deep metagame thanks to the amount of weapons placed in the game and the varying ways that people play each class. Each match may play differently from the last, considering that everyone's going to play differently, which requires you and your team to adapt to survive. Oh, I mentioned it has hats, didn't I? Yeah, think of this as Valve's way of earning money, along with some of the community members who contribute to the game. i really like this system, as you can customize each class however you want to, and it's a way to give back to the community. I could go on about how this is one of the greatest games ever made, but you're probably sick of me rambling on about this game, by this point. And of course, you're already playing this game on some sort of time basis if you're on my friends list, so I guess I'm just talking to myself. I'll shut up and let you get back to playing now XD

review: I used to think that games used to be about skill and how well you work with a team of freinds/strangers. All that changed when I got TF2 (Hat Simulator 2014). I am educated now and know that the things you need to be good at this game are: -Unusual Hats worth only $50000 -A once full, now empty life savings account -Hats -Hats -Hats In this game you will select one of 9 characters which all have their special OP power which will make even the most patient monk rage quit. This game is about your character going on a pointless, perilous journey in order to get all the keys ever made by Valve. No one knows why you try and complete this story, but if you don't your freinds might get more keys than you and you don't want that. Eventually you spend all your money and/or life to buy these over-priced hats and boast to some guy on the other side of the world about how cool your $560000 hat is, only to have him call you a n00b and show you his $560001 hat and proceed to kick you from the server for being a skrublord. In this game you will experience several gamemodes such as: -Kick everyone on the server who makes a mistake A.K.A Tour of Duty -Practice of Kick everyone on the server who makes a mistake A.K.A Boot Camp -Show off your sexy hats to people who you deem beneth thyself A.K.A Trade servers -School of sniping A.K.A 2fort -Custom gamemodes which can somtimes be more fun the the default game A.K.A Custom games -Every other gamemode with people who you deem Free2play A.K.A Every other gamemode with people who you deem Free2play The best part of the game (apart from the 10/10 hat simulation) is when after 10 mins of you being one of the only contributors to your team and right about to win the game with your freinds, you get switched for "auto-ballance" ad end up on a loosing streak. SO FUUUUUUUUUUUN AND BEST FEATURE OF ANY GAME!!! Because of this game I have no money, no freinds and no life, but I have hats and really... isn't that what life is all about? 10/10 would play again

Possibly the only multiplayer game with built in aimbots. Just choose the Engineer class and build a sentry. Do you like OP one hit kills? TF2 is the game for you. Go sniper or spy and headshot or backstab all the baddies. They'll hate you for it, but really- do you care? No. If you do, you probably shouldn't be playing a game with guns in it. If you don't care and you like aimbots, don't cheat in other games. Play TF2 instead, because here it's allowed.

If you never even played it or worse if you never heard of this game I don't think you're human. So sitback relax and wait for the very long download of this game If you are planning to play, which you will.........

review: Hilarious FPS that has Valve written all over it If you've played games by Valve before you know each of there games has an almost unexplanible comedic charm and TF2 is no different, the graphics aren't the best, but thats part of what makes the game funny and what makes it great...Another awesome Valve game!

review: It is a very good game when you get some weapons that you are better at. At first it may seem that everyone is better than you because they have better weapons, stranges,miscs and the most popular- unusual hats. This can change when you play it for a while (don`t end up like me playing over 128 hours in 2 months) and you get good weapons. And then you get to purchace items. It`s a game of cometition, but there can never be 'a best player'. Overall, I am addicted to this game. I love it.

It isn't P2W game, but it is nice to buy a keys with money and trade them for hats, misc, outfits, weapons and unusuals. the trade in tf2 is really fun! you can play f2p, you dont must buy stuff, you can get it in drops. Have in this game a drop weapons and you dont must to buy them, you can craft them but you can trade them for a scrap or other weapons. PLAY THIS GAME!!! Classic, funny and good game!

game-hours: 2323.1
review: This is the best hat simulator in existence. This sounds silly and it is... until you've played it. It won't be long before you find yourself involved in the meta trading game crafting weapons and on the quest for ever cooler hats to replace your Ghastly GIbus and prove you are no longer a noob. You will finally give in on microtransactions and be glad you did. As far as gameplay goes... well, it's probably the best class based shooter out there. The game works and is always kept polished and regularly updated and supported by the community and Valve. With the 9 different classes, there are many more ways to play just based on what your item loadout is, but nothing is really overpowered, just situational in it's advantage. The competative scene is real and there is an incredibly high skill cap within that; time and experience in the game to the tune of thousands of hours actually mean something in terms of your ability to be good at it. And probably the thing that's better than any of this: It's freaking FUN.
game-hours: 814.9
review: i'm 100% addicted to this game, its a really fun game with many ways to play it. its unlike most games in terms of its game play yet probably better than any other game ive ever played, you are able to customize your character loadout (and theres 9 different characters/classes you can choose from to start) tons of game modes and maps plus its free! ive meet many people and made many friends by playing this game, and i know you will too. id rate this game 11/10 and id recommend this game to anyone who is looking for a new amazing game to play, and a new addiction.

review: WOW. This game impressed as soon as I "hit play". It has timeless cartoon-ish graphics that fall right in the boundary line between too animated and too realistic. It has a wide variety of characters, and a lot of items to find, so there will always be a reason to keep playing! Most of the characters are easy to play, but hard to master, so it wont be too difficult to switch characters and play as that one. I reccomend this game to anyone 10 and up. You can turn of the blood, and as long as a kid understands that it's not ok to do any of this in real life, and to keep a positive attitude, he/she should be find. See you in Pyroland!

I can buy a real one for less.) - Many people try scamming you in a trade - Players in pub servers usually start swearing/screaming for various reasons (Another Pro: you can mute them)

review: I've owned Team Fortress 2 since its release on the orange box and over the years its still enjoyable to pick up. Team Fortress 2 dominates areas of team play that hardly any other game compares to. A game where distinct classes are all important to a teams success in the battlefield. Each class comes with its own unique skill ceiling meaning that mastering each class can become its own challenge. Some classes even have multiple play styles that all require different set of skills that differ between styles, for instance while you may be good at being a pocket soldier that protects the medic from harm and kills whatever comes near you, you may not be good at a roaming soldier that does quite the opposite and rocket jumps around the map bombing enemies below. While no game has perfect balancing, Id say Team Fortress 2 comes reasonably close. The game is very fast paced and always keeping you in the action, and to this day it is still one of the best team fps games available. Looking at the marketing side of TF2, I would have to say there is no free to play model I enjoy greater. The micro transactions are 100% fair and are centered around buying cosmetics instead of buffs for your player. You dont have to spend a single dime on the game and be on the exact same playing field as everyone else. However buying an item from the Mann Co. Store opens up trading which allows users to make exchanges with each other. The game has successfully amassed its very own economy within the trading community. I would recommend anyone who enjoys team based fps games to pick up this awesome free title.

Look no further: don your derby, show off your chapeau, and kick  and take names while wearing your toque on Team Fortress 2!

review: There are 2 companies: the Reliable Excavative Demolition (RED) and the Builders League United (BLU) who are competing against each other. Both of the company owners (Blutarch of BLU and Redmond for RED) hired mercenaries to put an end to one another. This is where TF2 multiplayer takes place. In the multiplayer there are 2 teams (RED and BLU) and you can choose between 9 characters. These characters include the: Scout, Demo man, Pyro, Sniper, Medic, Spy, Heavy, Engineer, and Soldier. Each class has their own weapons and abilities (such as the Medic can heal people, the Spy can disguise as other players, the Scout can move twice as fast than others, etc.). The gameplay is SO much fun! Overall, Team Fortress goes beyond great gameplay; it has one of the most fun/best First Person Shooter multiplayer out there. There is just the multiplayer, no campaign mode. But, the multiplayer is enough and Team Fortress 2 still outstands many of the video games out there. Also, ITS FREE. Ok, its sort of free... You still can to buy items from the in-game store (which is relatively cheap). So, if you like FPS, this is your game.

review: Team Fortress 2 is such an addicting game. When I first played it on my old PC, it was freaking laggy, I thought it would be a boring game. My friend kept asking me to play it when I got a new PC, but I had doubts because of how big the file size is. I decided to play it anyway. It was freaking fun! I couldn't stop playing! All the game modes are cool, all the classes are good in their own way. My KDR in TF2 is good unlike in other FPS games where I'm horrible. I recommend playing this game, it's a shame if you can't run it, but it is worth trying :)

review: Great game, highly addictive. Offers many servers and quite a few different gameplay options. Their way of making sure both teams are fair is remarkable, and allows for players to vote on certain things which gives players some control. Not really any hackers. This game is super fun and it's worth it to download and give it a try.

review: Team Fortress 2 was one of the first games I had in my Steam library. I got it in December 2010 and I still play it. I've almost got 2000 hours of playtime, because it IS awesome. The gamemodes are different from each other and the classes, too. You have a choice of nine classes, which can be useful for attacks, defense and support. Find a character who fits your playstyle or more than one and get on the battlefield!

review: You might know Team Fortress 2 as "Hat Fortress 2" or stuff like that,if we ignore the hats and talk about gameplay: It's amazing and totally awesome. i think it's the best Free to Play you can ever find. it's not Pay to Win, it's all about team work. It's addicting and truly a brilliant game. but of cource we can't make a review about Team Fortress 2 without mentioning the hats of cource, well- it makes the game even more beautiful. Have fun playin' it maggots!

review: I was a white teenager with no odd habits. The quintessential student athlete. I barely played this game, because I prefered things like Zelda and Mario galaxy, they made me remember my childhood playing smash bros and mario kart with my family. Then I tried the demoman. Ya know mate, this game aint too bad, no? I played as demo ALL the bloody time, n' I got really in gud at it. I got me a replica eyelander, and I accdntly b'headed me cat with it. I didnt mean fur whiskers to die, but the ole bloody carse was olready thar. I started drinkin. I git really ed up on noight, and tried makin' a wee little pipebomb, jus like me pal demoman!! I' blew up, and the pewder and soot made me skin black, and I loost me eye. Me mum came in me room an started shoutin a' me. I lust control and swung me eyelander, and off went 'er 'ead!!

review: Don't even get me started on this game. I was introduced to it back in 2012 and since then I have never looked back, unbelievably addictive. Team Fortress 2 is one of the most well optimised, consistent performing and superbly balanced games I have ever played and has no Pay to Win aspects at all. A person who has had FPS experience on computer can pick up the Sniper on the first day of playing the game and come top scoring in a pub, this game is so simple and complex at the same time which is why it is so much fun! If you don't play this game more, and have passed it over as another of Valve's ploys for money, seriously think again because unlike what most comments say this game is MORE than just hats. TF2 has teamwork that is unlike any FPS I have played and puts COD and even Battlefield to shame as it is ALMOST impossible to lone wolf in this game. Even the pro snipers can get crowded by sphees or gibus scouts and get killed... nobody is perfect. GIVE THIS GAME A GO THOUGH, just... don't go full  and at least learn what things do by watching videos before playing. Don't be that spy that stabs the sentry ;) Also, PLEASE GO MEDIC IF YOUR TEAM DOES NOT HAVE ONE! 10/10 :D

review: I just realized that I have played this game for more than 1K hours and haven't made a recommendation for it so here I am. When I tried this game (first time), the voice of the "announcer" was so strange I said "I won't be able to tolerate this voice" so I stopped playing basically right after I started. After like, a year maybe I picketed it up again, thanks to "GameDay Iroda". I thought "why not try it again" and boy, after few hours of struggling with... well any class I fell in love. I wasted few hundred bucks on virtual items since then but you know, I don't mind it. This game gave me so many awesome hours and I still like it, I don't know when it will wear off but one thing is for sure: if you haven't played it already just give it a shot (You can't lose anything since it's F2P).

But this game has a charm to it, that incredibally fast-paced, all action... STUFF that makes it great. AND it's a free game! So, really, you don't need to worry about wasting, like, $15 or $200,000. Honestly, if you JUST got steam, you NEED to try out this game first. Like... Need. I'm not kidding. Go play it.

review: Hi, This game is amazing. I would know that because I've played it for 300 hours. This is an amazing FPS game, and you may be thinking "Uhhhg another FPS game." It's not like that. This is some of the most fun I've ever had. There are nine classes to suit your mood and all have their own drawbacks. First off is the scout, he's got 125 Health (which isn't that much) and runs very fast, he can also double jump. The scout also has a Scattergun, pistol, and baseball bat as weapons. Next is the soldier, he's a huge patriot and has 200 health. A Rocket launcher, a shotgun, and a shovel are his stock weapons. That's right a shovel. Next is the Pyro, first off, he is a pain in the butt to deal with. He has 175 health and he also has a flame thrower, a shotgun, and a fire ax as stock weapons. He's only not effective at long range. Next is the demoman, who likes to blow sh*t up. He has 175 health, with a grenade launcher, a sticky bomb launcher, and a bottle as stock weapons. There's also the heavy who has a whoping 300 health. He has a minigun, shotgun, and fists as stock weapons and always targeted first on the battle field. Next off is the Engineer who has 125 helath. He has a wrench, shotgun, construction and destruction PDA, and a pistol. He can build one sentury that kills the other teams player. He can build one dispenser which give him metal, and others health and ammo. The other buildings are the teleporters which can get you into the battle quickly. Also there's the Medic which has a medigun, a syringe gun, and a bonesaw. He also has 150 health. The medigun heals players and even overheals them. They usually be all pocket medic and heal heavys (a pocket medic is one that only heals one person). There's a sniper which gets an insta-kill on any class even with a heavy overhealed if he charges up his sniper shot all the way and get's a headshot. He has 125 health and carrys a sniper rifle, a SMG, and a kukri (which is a sword). He is a goto class for COD players because they want to be all "Quickscope 360 weapon switch knife headshot MOFO!!" What if I told you that Valve incouraged "hardscoping" which is staying in your scope for a long time before getting a kill. So there's that class. Next is the final class, the spy. The spy carrys a knife, invis watch, revolver, and electrosapper. The spy can go invisible, get backstabs which kill any class instantly for 6 times their health, and can get pretty annoying. The drawbacks of spy is you have 125 health. You can only stay invisible for a little while, and is very hard to play as. The sapper will drain the health of engineers buildings. You can also disguise as enemy players but don't bump into anyone since you walk strait through team mates but you dont walk through enemys. Be sure to hide in a corner that's dark. You thought that was long? I'm only getting started. There are also weapons that you get randomly. Theres keys that cost $2.50 and you can open a crate which you also find randomly. Opening crates will give you an item that's diffrent for each crate type. The biggest nag on this game is that there's too many hats. That's actually how most people hear about this game. You end up trying to do challanges such as trading a random weapon up to an unusual hat. Unusual hats are unlocked by a very rare chance when unboxing a crate. That's all I'm going to include so thanks for getting to the end. Hope you have a good day :D

It is so fun and addicting that sometimes i leave myself trapped in the game, Yet some classes are kinda boring and yet useless its fun to switch around with classes so thumbs up for that!

Or 3,500 dollars on a dead person inside of a coffin that you used to get out of a small, 4x4 compact crate that comes with a skull from Five Nights at Freddy's following you around? Or 2,000 dollars for a haircut that makes you look like a crazy, sadistic punk rocker that recently came from Chernobyl? Or 5,500 dollars for the fire hazard named the Sorting Hat from Harry Potter with a demonic face that got lit on fire? Or 928 dollars for a gigantic, burning fish that does nothing but leech off of your brain tissue while you mindlessly slaughter others? Or 200 dollars for a satanic Christmas tree that you can wear? Or maybe even the grandest deal of them all, a Frying Pan or a Wrench painted in pure gold in exchange for your house, your car, and your virginity? This is for you! I still reccomend buying spinach with the money instead.

With lots of colourfull game mods, hats, personalities, weapons, classes and ways to play each of them. A game where payment is truelly optional. Being a f2p doesn't necesarlly mean you're any worse than a p2p, it just means u can have at most 10 hats. In some simple words, this game needs more skill then any CoD and is wai cooler in his cartoonish way.This game is just amazing.

review: Team Fortress 2, a game so drawn out from the First Person Shooters seen in modern day life. The sequel to Team Fortress Classic, it comes with all the unique little inventions that seems to have escaped the worlds of FPS Gaming, such as humor, character, stratergy and general fun. Team Fortress 2 includes a variety of killing machines, the Scout, Soldier, Pyro, Demoman, Heavy, Engineer, Medic, Sniper and the dreaded Spy. Each is a threat, each have weaknesses, each is an absolute B@#[]&$?~! The Scout (by default) is tied with the Engineer, the Sniper and the Spy with the lowest health in the game (125), but he is NOT to be underestimated. His weapons consist of a Scattergun, capable of doing massive damage depending on the distance, a Pistol, to do subtle chip damage and to perhaps finish off retreating foes, and a Baseball Bat, turning you into the blur across your screen slowly chipping away at your health. Made to be annoying, The Scout is also the biggest, cockyest B@#[]&$?~ of them all. What I consider the second hardest class to master. The Soldier has the second highest health in the game (200), a very offensive-driven class with some support options, the Soldier can easily bust through an enemy's line of defence. Mister Jane Doe has no shortage on power, busting through the wacky merceneries with: A Rocket Launcher, doing massive amounts of damage with questionable accuracy, splash damage is a useful tool, a Shotgun, rather average, doing more damage the closer you get, and a... Shovel, because why wouldn't you want to kill someone with a gardening tool, much more embaressing if you think about it. The Pyro, this multi-personality man/woman/thing has the most average health of 175 (Along with the Demoman), many many people curse the Pyro's name in death (Whatever it is) for one of the Pyro's best features, after-burn. Losing three health per half-second for ten seconds is never a position you want to be in. He uses a; Flamethrower, which is responsible for the dreaded after-burn and the just-as-scary air-blast, able to reflect rockets, arrows, pipe bombs, you and more, not to mention the base fire damage! Next is the Shotgun, which is no differant from the Soldier's, and finally the Fire Axe, rather ironic. The Demoman, a bomb throwing drunk from Ullapool, Scotland, Tavish Finnegan DeGroot is a force to be reckoned with, whether defending or attacking. His weapons include a Grenade Launcher, to abuse the laws of physics and blow the opposition to smithereens, a StickyBomb Launcher to wait and blow people to smithereens, and a Bottle of whiskey, to do something with the left over piece of trash, remember kids, reduse, REUSE, recycle! The Heavy is a giant loveable bear-of-a-man from Soviet Russia, willing to give everyone his worth-his-weight-in-gold amount of bullets. Mikhail is a man to be feared due to his truck tone of health (300) and his own set of weapons: The Minigun, holding a total of two hundred bullets, it can moe down enemies like they where the pawns against a queen, the Shotgun, a useless addition due to the giant minigun you might want to use instead, and, what else? His Fists, may the toughest Mann survive! The Engineer is a mann of BRAINPOWER! Del Conagher is not a man to get out there on the front lines (for having 125 Health), he's either slightly behind the front line, gettin' his team to the front or struggling to keep an area under their control, either way he is one to be feared. He is equipped with a simple Shotgun, a Pistol and a Wrench, not much explaining needed, however his buildings is where he shines. Using a Sentry (Representing Attack) to slaughter the enemy, using a Dispencer (Representing Defence) to resupply his team on health and ammo, and a teleporter (Representing Support) to get his comrades to the front in a snap. The Medic, a true help to the team. The homocidal maniac from Germany is here to aid and laugh maniacly while doing so, being semi-weak on the offence, he tends to park himself behind a rather large offensive class, mostly Soldiers, Heavies and possibly Pyros. He owns a Syringe Gun, doing considerable damage if the aim is good enough consistently, a Medigun to heal those classes in need, and finally the Bonesaw to slaughter the enemy and maybe do a diagnostic on them after the round. The Sniper is a damn good assassin from the harsh place known as "The Bush". Mr Mundy is probably the simplist class to grasp, for snipers arn't excatly new to First Person Shooters. The primary weapon isn't hard to guess, zoom in, take aim, and watch the pink cloud as it decends on his allies which leaves them with a dread of exiting their base... until you get backstabbed. The SMG is, to put it bluntly, an awful weapon in TF2, doing next to no damage with the accuracy of a crane fly, and finally the Kukri, a rather badass sword that will help you out. The Spy is one truly feared Frenchie. A man of mystery, the Spy is capable of instantly killing any class simply by stabbing them in the back. He is equipped with a Revolver, not doing that much damage, but enough to annoy people with, a Knife, able to insta-kill, keeps everyone... on their toes, a Disguise Kit to disguise as any class from each team, and finally the Invis Watch, to go fully invisable, but it limits you to just running around until it runs out, not to mension the bane of all Engineers, the god damn sapper, slowly wittering down the health of buildings and making them un-usable. Not to mention the unlockable weapons, their unique personas and funny gags, Team Fortress 2 is a fun game that will suck more out of your life than a wh@#[] ever could, if you have a PC you have no excuse to not have this game, get it and maybe we will meet someday. Thank you for your dedication! -Jay

review: This game shows how Best graphics doesn't make a first person shooter good, and I've always loved this art style way more then this Realistic Crap. And it's not just simple RUN OUT THERE KILL EVERYONE, it's many unique game modes make it fun and never ending and you have to rely on your Team as well as your self. Amazing, this is just one of those game's you had to have played at LEAST once. Not forgeting all classes are evened out, (But not Pyro, Pyro Is So Over Powered It's Not Even Funny) And the final thing I love about this game is how all the classes have there own funny personality!

review: Do you like very serious games? do you like games that have dramatic stories, in-depth gameplay, and touching scenes? WELL THIS GAME IS NOT FOR YOU! This game is not your standard FPS game, this game has so much humor in it, you can't take it seriously. "How do I know that this game isn't some generic FPS game and you're just talking bs?" watch meet the pyro and meet the spy....just..ju.just watch. To conclude this review, there are many different things you can do in it, you can play on custom maps, like mario_kart_v20, randomizer maps, you can purchase hats and costumes to make your character look like a baddas fighting machine, or a strange person in a wierd outfit that makes you cry "I NEED AN ADULT!" i highly suggest this game to anybody who is into whacky and silly stuff, if you find this game to be interesting, i ma going to give you a little advice. remember to spy-check! ;)

review: TF2 is a crazy FPS where you can battle friends and kill them in one foul swoop with a frying pan, make a fat man look like dovakihn, make a one-eyed black scottish man jump across the map and drink a grenade, laugh over your bff's corpse, have a burning Top-hat, kill people with bubbles, get hats, and more hats, and more hats, and more hats, and more hats, DON'T YOU GET IT YET?

This game is a bit like COD, in the FPS side of it (My view) but it offers something compleatly amazing. A community around hats! I have never known a other game that attracted people who likes cosmetics. And we also cant forget the weapons and there uniquability, and their comical factors. Why should you even consider getting this game: ? In my opinion, if you where wanting too ruin your life, and never have a social life this game is for you.

review: Graphics - The graphics for Team Fortress 2 might not seem up to par with other Valve games, but it's the art style that matters. The cartoonish graphics fit so well with this game, I wouldn't have it any other way! 5/5 Music - This game has amazing music! It's a shame we typically only hear it on the menu and during events. 3/5 Story - While Team Fortress 2 does have a story, it's never told in game. The story can be found on the wikipedia page, if you're interested in reading it. It explains why the two teams are fighting, at least. 2/5 Replayability - Many gamemodes, maps, and weapons always being added. Don't like what they have? Modded game mods range from far and wide, Prophunt, Saxton Hale, the list goes on. It's never a bad time when you launch this game again. 5/5 Gameplay - The gameplay is nice, and balanced. Something other FPS's can't always say. Not pay to win, either, which should be noted considering it's also Free-to-Play! 5/5 Overall Score - 4/5 Good.

review: If you have not played Team Fortress 2, then you should sit in a corner and think about your life! Team Fortress 2 might just be my favorite first person shooter games. You can choose from 9 classes, each one that has tons and tons of weapons and hats. If you think that it is boring just killing the other team over and over all the time, then you are wrong! Be warned that if you get this game, you will be sucked into it and you will not stop playing it! You will spend your days locked in a dark room with a bowl of Doritos by your side. You will become fat and lazy with no wife, no kids, and most importantly no life. Trust me, it has happened to me already. Remember that this game appears to be free except for one thing.... your life.

I had to learn how to walk again and learn who my friends and family were again. Naturally, when i got out and couldn't remember passwords to anything (emails, steam, my laptop, nothin') betchyer  i still d/l'ed TF2 the second i got my new laptop, all i can do is gaze upon my former glory thru my old crew profile i managed to rejoin but im still ballin' (still lampin') and still enjoying EVERY ING MINUTE of Team4tress. i love you guys.

review: I was like you once, you know, just browsing the steam store, getting all the valve games. Then I got this one... I was F2P for a long time. Until one morning I decided to buy like, one weapon to get me premium. I'd seen scrap banking videos on YouTube, so I wanted to buy a huntsman and build it up to a strange killstreak. Then, fate looked down on me and decided I didn't need a life. I went on the man co store, planning to buy the huntsman and spend the rest of the fund card on games. Then, I saw the hats. Line by line, those beauties, shining and glittering in the darkness of my bedroom. I bought one. Then my life chsnged forever. Trading, banking, buying, uncrating and just being addicted to these hats... Now it's to late for me. I got a team captain, and realised I'd exceeded my target. But I wanted to spend more money on the store... Pour money into valve... Buy hats. Now I feel hats whispering my name, I feel their prescience. I see them on those I love... I see them in my food. I can feel Gabe Newell in my soul, pressuring me to buy more hats... I can't take it anymore. As I type this, I feel a key in my mouth. Fake hats on my head, professional killstreaks burning my eyes... Help me. I love tf2, deeply recommend this game to anyone, be it a COD player or just an idiot.

With the knowledge anyone can join tournements after 50 hours it motivates you to keep playing. another thing is the items, you want the best of the best and again more motivation to play... finally I got scammed and the dropped my morale so low i haven't played this in 3 months. And yet I still recomend this, I wonder what is the motivation is this time.

review: What can I say, You are a Pixel character that comes in many forms with given skills and weapons to do tasks. Whether it be to defend your base, capturing a point or Killing that Backstabing Spy, This game enhances your gaming experience and takes it to a whole new level. Lots of people gave this bad and good reviews but if you really thing about it, go to anyones profile and 90% of the Community has this as their main played game and over 1,000 hours. This is a good game under the genres Shooter and lets you show off your skills, techniques, items to flaunt, trade, collect and so much more. I give this game a positive review and it's gonna be a perfect score for me.

review: This game is... it's... it's too great to be described with mere adjectives! This game is absolutely with out a doubt one of the best games out there! It was indeed "Worth the Weight". It's art style is amazing because it is so unique and different from anything I've ever seen, this goes for both the characters, items, and enviorment. I find the game's visual appearence breathtaking. For the small amount of soundtracks this game consists of, they are amazing. This game is great because it seemingly never gets old, with dozens of different gamemodes, exciting new content updates, and its annual Scream Fortress, Smissmas, and other events. Yet, the best thing about the game (at least to me it is) is the nine classes that the game consists of. Each class is full of personality and dialogue, whether its insulting taunts or hillarious cathphrases. All of the classes are very different from each other with weapons, dialogue, attitude, style, and the way you play as them. First off you have your Offensive category, consisting of the Scout, Soldier, and Pyro. The Scout is a fast, smart-mouthed, "all bark and no bite" kind of kid with weapons that are most effective at close range, requiring a hit-and-run sort of tactic. The Soldier is a dedicated American with a strong passion to fight. Possessing a Rocket Launcher as his primary weapon, the soldier is a powerful threat to his opponents, but all that power leaves him with a slow speed, requiring him to use a maneuver known as the "Rocket Jump" to travel faster in exchange for some health. The Pyro is a mumbling lunatic, whose history is a mystery to just about everyone, he (or possibly she) wields a Flamethrower as his/her main weapon which makes him/her lack a lot of range, but gives a lot of potential power if used correctly. He/she is best used for ambushing enemies and his/her Compresion Blast (Airblast) can be used to reflect many projectiles back at opponents. Next is the Deffensive category, the Demoman, Heavy, and Engineer. The Demoman is a one-eyed, drunk Scottish man who has no bullet-based weapons and fights instead with 2 explosive weapons. He can take out enemies that he can't see with his Grenade Launcher or lay traps with his Sticky Launcher. The Heavy is a large, strong, Russian beast that uses his beloved Minigun. His immense power and large size leaves him with a very slow speed but with very strong fire power. He may be considered an easy target due to his size, but as long as he has his Minigun he should be treated as a threat just like all the other classes. The Engineer is a intelligent Texan that relies mainly on his buildings to fight. His Sentry Gun is generally a threat to any enemy within it's range, he can build a Dispenser to heal him and his teammates as well as refill there ammo, and he can also build teleporters so his team can access areas faster. The last category is the Supportive classes, consisting of the Medic, Sniper, and Spy. The Medic is a German doctor with amazing medical technology at his disposal. He is not one known for attacking but instead he is known for healing. Using his Medi-gun, he can quickly heal his teammates. Once charged enough, he can deploy what is known as an "Ubercharge", making him and whoever he is healing temporarily invincible to any damage from enemy weapons. The Sniper is an Austrailian outdoorsman who, as his name suggests, uses a Sniper Rifle as his main weapon. He can do extreme ammounts of damage at long range, making him a valueble teammate when used correctly. At short range though, he is more vulnerable and can easily be overwhelmed by enemies. Lastly, we have the Spy, a French trickster who can disguise himself as his opponents and quietly sneak behind enemy lines. He can perform a "Backstab", resulting in an instant kill, use his Sapper to destroy enemy buildings such as Sentries, and use his Cloaking Device to become temporarily invisible to sneak around danger. Playing as a Spy requires stealth and smarts to succeed. The best thing about all these characters is the fact that, other than the Heavy being the games main Icon, none of the classes seem to be better than the rest. They all have their own special weaknesses and none of them are generally favored over the others. The game is a masterpiece and that's all I can say.

review: Team Fortress 2. Three words to describe it are Addicting, Superior and Cosmetics The only problem is that once you buy/find a cosmetic you can't stop so unless you want this showing up on your screen 'R.I.P Wallet' then i recommend limiting yourself to cosmetics but unfortunatly my 'R.I.P Wallet' happend a very very long time ago... But I would definetly recommed this game to the ages of 8+. It is one of my favourite free to play action games on steam and if you do go on TF2 make sure to go on at halloween times because they are always fun So may the cosmetics be ever in your favour HARRY POTTER IS REAL

review: This is a great fps game. It has a cartoony feel to it which is not very common among most first person shooter games. However if you have played games like COD or other games with guns, be aware that this is nothing like those. It has specific classes with set weapons, all classes have weaknesses and strengths. Not recommended for people who like to play offline either as the training games are not the best.

review: Team Fortress 2 is an FPS game with a singleplayer and multiplayer servers. I think that this game is awesome, but they need to upgrade the weapon/item drop system, it needs to give new players a few more items than people who have been playing the game more often. The textures are somewhat realistic with a sort of "cartoony" feel to them. The player models are good but could use a little more detail, even if it's a "cartoony" game. Basic plot: Mann CO. a company run by the tough Saxton Hale who had 3 sons, Red, Blu, and Grey. Red and Blu exiled Grey and fought with eachother like maniacs. Grey came back with replicas of Red and Blus armies, Robots. Classes: Scout, Soldier, Pyro, Demo, Heavy, Engineer, Medic, Sniper, and Spy.

review: This 3D animated shooter is the perfect game for all Valve fans! A complete 10/10, but you have to make sure not to be tempted by the "hats". The "hats" are the way to show victory and coolness in TF2, but some hats require purchasing them with real life money and are not aquireable in any other way. The classes are amazing and one of my favorites being Spy, you can unlock certain items by playing the game or earning achievements without paying money. This aspect of the game brings the fun of showing off your items without paying the five dollars for an awesome hat! Honestly not the best game I've played, but possibly the second or third. The classes are fun in many different ways. - The scout has super speed and can really mess up the other team. - The soldier has a rocket jump which can be used to camp and fire. - The pyro gets an airblast that can deflect most things. Rocket? AIRBLAST!!! - The demoman can spam grenades at you and sticky bomb the entire base if he wants. - The heavy has loads of ammo and good strength, but bad speed and bad aim unless up close. - The engineer can place sentries, dispensers, and teleporters to protect areas. - The medic has a very rapid gun as well as a Medigun which heals other players (best with the heavy). - The sniper can be horrible up close, but he can make headshots and instakill players with his sniper rifle. - The spy can disguise as the other team and even take down the engineer's buildings. Even if the game costed money, it would still be worth it. Once again, a full 10/10.

review: Team Fortress Two, the name itself is well known enough to sell the game. TF2 has existed since for over 6 years now and has still outlived most shooters. Unlike the other team fortress games/mod it is much more quirky than serious. However do not let its good nature fool you, it is still a very competitive game with communities ranging from trading based to competition. Even though it is very serious sometimes, it is also very easily to find a game focused just on having fun, which is rather difficult in most games now. TF2's community is mostly responsible for the current content in the game. Maps, weapons, and character cosmetics are mostly created by the community and added in Valve's official updates. The community is even responsible for creating a currency system using the crafting materials and a few notable cosmetics. Even though the game has existed for many years, there is so much balance amongst the nine classes and their various weaponry that new players and beta testers alike can be engaged in a battle with no clear outcome until the final seconds. In short, there is no reason to not try TF2. There is a class for any playstyle and its a free game that i so fun, I don't think anyone would mind paying for.

I have played this game for so long, and while I occasionally get bored, I am yet to find a game on par with TF2, gameplay, uniqueness and trading-wise.

review: Welcome to profit simulator 20XX. The jist of this game is to buy stuff as cheap as possible, sell that stuff as expansive as possible then rinse and repeat. I don't always play this simulator as the gameplay gets quite repetitve and it's hard to get items that are on fire "cause fire n warm glowy stuff" - Trading cornmunity on a regular basis. Other than these flaws the gameplay is fine. You have 9 classes, Scout he has +50% profit and +75% chance of ruining your day and sadly you can only play him in 4 colors black, white, pink and green he isn't a very good stealth class because his vibrant colors standout on the maps making me think they didn't think it through when choosing his color scheme. Soldier he has +40% profit -15% speed and +60% dressing apeal. He too falls to the same flaws as the scout having only 2 color choices pink and green. Despite his -15% speed he can sacrifice a chunk of his health to do a super jump, although they say you use the rocket launcher to do this you end up exploding into millions of pieces you actually hold down right click to charge it and let go while looking up to perform this move. This class is overall good and can help you out if making profit is a bit time consuming and boring with his increased dressing apeal can add a few extra hours of fun just by dressing him up. Pyro he has +25% profit +999% speed while target is in contact by flames, +85% outfit diversity and 65% more confusion. Her main weapon is the flamethrower which allows major bursts of speed if you set people on fire making him a very interesting but new players should avoid using her as his most game changing ability is her comrpession blast which can defend you by deflecting rockets, grenades, plasma grenades, ariplanes, soldiers, wild cabermen and steam flash sales but you have to time his ability or else you'll be hit which is why she isn't recomended for new players. With the highest outfit diversity in the game he can create intersting and profitable combos which also requires a decent amount of experince to even pull off. Demoman has +35% profit, +50% boom, -25% outfit diversity, +999% damage only active with stock secondary and +45% stealth (Only active during the night). This "unique" looking individual is the explosive expert of the team with his loadout that consist of sharp blades, shields and boots making him an agile tank of destruction, pairing this up with the stock secondary makes you invincible because your aura becomes so strong from the damage increase everything gets ripped from reality and only requires you to press two buttons repeatedly making him easily the best class in combat. Unfourtunatly despite his godly stats in combat he falls short in profiting abilities with having outfits of things from the past, making diversity a problem and can hinder his profit stat. Heavyweapons has -35% speed, +90 more ammo, +10% profit, +60 more gun, +45% outfit diversity +175 bulk. This character is a mixed bag for combat and profit his combat ability is soaking damage and retaliating but he is slow forcing him into a more defence gameplay which can be quite slow and doesn't feel rewarding and the fact that demoman's damage is off the charts the heavy can only last 3 seconds once he enters the demoman's 30 metre aura making this class redundant. As for profit he can be very effective if you can find someone who prefers this characters outfits which because of his offical mascot status can make this quite easy to find. Oh an also the heavy has a hidden ability called "Thick Fat" which makes him take 50% less damage from temperature based attacks. The Engineer has +35% profit, +90% calm down, +35% fun and -20% height. Don't look at that -20% height as a bad thing that can be the difference between life and death (even though the characters share the same hit boxes for most projectiles.) and with his sentry gun ability you can create a machine gun that has aimbot and can even upgrade it to shoot rockets aswell making this class easily the most defensive class and with his +90% calm down stat makes him a good switch after a stressful day of ripping people off. The engineers outfit divirsity is interesting and quite large but nothing like the pyros. The elusive Medic has +0.005% speed, +80% happiness, -45% damage, +60% crit ratio, -90% common. The medic is a god send in the meta-game and has the most complex and useful magic attacks in the game with such abilities such as partner shield, skill crits and restore these along can be used together to create devastating combos that can counter even the demomans destructive aura which is why they used this spell combinations on the already powerful demoman to tripple his aura's damage and radius. The truth to why the medic is so powerful is because of how rare and fragile they are but when someone experienced enough gets ahold of one they can unleash hell. The medic is soley combat orientated the only ability in profit he is capable of is restoring hats to their original form. Sniper has +90% common, +90% new players, -100% usefullness in large numbers, -70% productivity, -35% vision and -75% interesting outfits. This class can be beast in the hands of a pro but will still be destroyed by demomen, making him pointless and all you can do for fun is scope in atleast with soldier and scout you can do something intersting with them and too many new players choose him like some kind of god or something as if it's the  in some other game or something like and fail with him that and then we end up having just scouts, snipers and spies. It's just as bad for profit they only have 2 colors pink and green which is a small choice for making profits plus people are lazy with how they look and take the generic stuff angus hood, outback interlectual, that berret with a little shield on it, those sound thingys from apple that hurt your ears and that leather thing for his face and nothing else making him a very linear and boring class combat and profit wise. Spy has +80% commons, +90% new players, -80% usefullness in large numbers, -55% productivity, +60% style, -75% visibility and +55% stealth. The spy has the same faults as the sniper combat wise the demomans arua wrecks him and and too many inexperienced players choose him. The worse part is that they don't even bother trying to use the revolver his only way of self-defense other than the energy shield watch. Along with this he is a very paitent and slow class that requires finding the right momment to strike and the right momment to run. Profit wise he has a hole wardrobe of stylish fedoras and diverse suits making him a very interesting class for profiting. If you're a fan of tycoon games this might be right up your alley. 8.9/10

review: Team Fortress 2 (AKA: Hat Fortress 2) is a rather interesting FPS that will surely become addicting as time progresses. Because the game is F2P there WILL be in-game purchases, but keys only cost around 2 bucks a pop, keys being the main currency of TF2. (Which can be used to turn into steam cash.) I personally reccomend this to a bored soul who wants to have a fun time killing time. As sane as I can sound this game WILL MAKE YOU ADDICTED. HELP! I'VE BEEN SPENDING TOO MUCH TIME COLLECTING HATS AND MISCS, I AM TOO ADDICTED THIS GAME RUINED MY LIFE HELP ME!!! AHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAHHHHHH!!!!

review: WOW a shooter that looks like it was in a Nintendo carwash! Team Fortress 2, this has been incredibly popular on Steam ever since it debut in 2007. The game is completely different than your ordinary shooter. Firstly, this game is colorful. In most shooters its all HARDCORE and gray. But in TF2, it is the complete opposite of that. It has humor, good writing, an amazing community, different game modes, over 200 (I think) weapons, and SO much more. So, if you are new to Steam and are looking for a good shooter, pick TF2. Because its totally different than the run of the mill Call Of Duty FPS. And its also Free to Play! So you get one of the best games on Steam for free, and if you want a premium account all you have to do is just buy 1 item from the shop! And going premium adds a whole new layer of fun to Team Fortress 2. So please if you haven't already, play this game. Its fresh, its new, and its different. And I don't expect it to go off Steam anytime soon

review: Are you tierd of your standard qick scope, camoflage and camping fights like in call of duty? Sick of all the Proos sqating above your face in games like Halo and Unreal T? Then dos steam have something fore you to day. This was once a not free2play game, but now it is, and it is one of the best and diverce shooters, you wil see. It has a bunch of gamemodes, so you will allway have new stuf to check out. It has 9 classes, so you are sure to find AT A MINIMUM of 3 that you willl like. You can equip everi class with new weapons that you get as (drop or achivments). I sudgest playng againts bots fore some time, so you can se each class specificly, and so you won't get creamed by online competetive play. This game.....DOS NOT CARE ......abaut youre kill death ratio. It isn't displayed aniwere doring game time. So the best way to get points, is to reach your TEAM goal.....Thats why its called TEAM fortres.

review: Team Fortress 2. Arguably the most popular FPS on the PC. This game is insanely fun, even after so many years of playing. Every class is still working as they should. (well, except the Demoman, but let's face it, Valve made every single one of his unlocks make you play him differently) The addition of the steam workshop compatibility makes all new possibilities come up. So, even 5 years after its initial release, Team Fortress 2 is a MUST HAVE FUN GAME, and since it's free now, there's no excuse.

review: oh the memories first game on steam... first game i tried to get good at... first game that vavle pissed me of in... first pc online multiplayer ok, i've had steam for almost 2 years now and this game still has my most hours. Do i recomend it? Does it suck? Is it dead? well prepare to get your questions awnsered IS IT FUN: yes, its a valve shooter, of course its gonna be good with 9 classes and 200+ weapons, it takes a while to get bored IS IT DEAD: No, there are still plenty of servers and players in every gamemode and with community servers there is even more fun to be had IS THE COMMUNITY NICE: No... not really, i face the fact that 90% of the tf2 fanbase are , new and old. New players get their self-esteem destroyed by older players and the new players that call everyone an idiot,noob or skrub suck too. But there are nice players and their always fun to hang around with SO IF THE COMMUNITY SUCKS I SHOULDNT GET THE GAME THEN?: Yes, if you can get some freinds to play the game and play it with you, which isint hard since its the only free valve game, you can have some genuine fun and laughs with them SO SHOULD I GET IT?: Yeah,its a fun,fast shooter with a ehh community and great gameplay, cant miss it 8.5/10 community sucks but is still enjoyable

review: When it comes to Free To Play games ,this game is top. everything in the game is avaliable from the start just waiting to be found or crafted but if you can buy stuff from the Mann CO. store. i will say the Mann CO. store is overprice, i recommend buying at the community market if you're impatient (like me), but if you do buy something from the Mann CO. store you get a premium account where drops are more frequent and expanded backpack, it's worth getting. this game allows you to play to your own playstyle, to take what skills you have and make them a positive feature with a drawback, when used correctly you can be professional, this is why you might see some kids rage because they migrated from COD. Their are many community gamemodes to this game, probably the most iconic VS Saxton Hale or Prop Hunt(yes it's also in TF2), their are also 7 original gamemodes. I will say the hats are kind of "overpraised" upon but still worth(it's not TF2 without hats). This game is about teamwork and it is AWESOME! I recommend.

There can hardly be a single MVM without harassing, whining and idiotic behavior, annoying setup and ragequitting. There are hardly servers without stupid people on the mic, puking out their racist and intolerant opinions nobody gives a damn about. Maybe I'm too old for this bull frickin' horse , but I'm really tired of the majority of players here. BTW, there are also female players out there, so shove your lesbian sprays up your  and take some more Medic/Engineer action, you homophobic morons.

review: How to feel good playing this game: Heal people on fire about to die with 1 health left. Bonk a heavy about to decimate your team. Snipe that spy about to chain stab your team. Build teleporter exit to first spawn point near the end of a match. Backstab a sniper until he switches to razorback. Headshot him until he switches to pyro. Win a match after team sh*ttalker moves to other "winning" team. Kick a bad medic for trying. Getting 50 kills in a row also feels pretty good, if you can do it. Don't acknowledge the people who defecate in their living room instead of their bathroom. People who bring all their life problems to the game, known as ragers, don't realize the fundamental aspect of entertainment. Whatever good or bad thing happens while playing, is ultimately for your entertainment. You will forget this playing TF2 though just saying and become a rager yourself.

review: team fortress 2 is exectly what the name is. its a game where you have to oppose against another team and the best team eventualy wins. this is nothing like Call of Duty as every class in here as an advantage and a disadvantage. for example the scout runs really really fast but has low HP and because you only have shotguns and pistols you need to get close to you emeney in order to take him out quickly. I really advice you to download this game since its free and it has a lot of options. try teaming up with some friends and do some mann vs machine or try to launch a rocked into space. it is all possible with the right amount of teamwork and fun :D

review: Many firstperson shooters feel the same: you're the only one that matters; any weapon will kill in one to two hits; the game takes itself way to seriously; the main goal is KILL, KILL, KILL. Overall, it seems to me that most FPS genre games are lacking a bit in the diversity department. Team Fortress 2 addresses that by giving you a crazy, colorful, whacked-out, and unpredictable world to screw around in. With nine classes to choose from, each with his own arsenal of specialized (and sometimes hilarious) guns, bombs, and blunt instruments to do battle with, you're presented with countless different play styles. Customizing the mercenaries with nonsensical wardrobe changes is a big part of the game as well; just visualize a giant, brutish man wearing a tutu! Team Fortress 2 also encourages a team dynamic of sorts. While you can go off on your own and sucseed, coordination with other players is vital, as each class has his own way(s) to help out his fellow mercenary. I know, this is quite the exstensive review on a free game, but please heed my word and give this a shot. I'm certain you'll enjoy it!

Team Fortress 2 is one of the most played games on Steam and it's not a surprise. It's a FPS with a cartoon-like twist! The more and more you play it the more and more you unlock new things. After a while you just get so caught up into it and BOOM. No life :3. But in all seriousness, I highly reccomend this game for it's extreme balance between players. It doesn't matter if you're a F2P or a P2P, the weapons are always equal. The cosmetics however... different story. All in all, 10/10 stop reading this and go get Team Fortress 2! See you online :L

review: Very fun. All I want is weapons and I've been playing a lot for weapons since that's the only way to get weapons. Weapons are want I want and need. Flamethrowers, snipers, I don't care. As long a I can kill people with it. Also I like the food. This game provides food you can use as combat weapons. Example: The Holy Mackerel (a fish). Again you can kill people with it. One thing I get mixed up with in the game is that if you kill someone along the rails or a fence, it looks like they are standing up, so I waste my ammo trying to kill a dead guy. That's it and remember to get weapons. I recommend this game for people who likes weapons. How many times did I say weapons (not including the time I say weapon in this sentence)?

review: When a FPS meets team play, fun, and strategy :) Team Fortress 2 is a game that looks simple at first glance. Just pick a class, shoot, kill everybody, have fun. But in the end, you realize that it's not that simple. Every class has strengths and weaknesses ; the more balanced is a team, the more chance the team has to win. And once you really understand all the classes and know them all, the game is just bomb. So in this game, being a pro at CS or Quake 3 Arena doesn't mean you'll oneshot everybody here ; you've got to think carefully about what you do, and help the best possible your team. That's precisely what I love in this game : each class is useful, and no class is overpowered. I do not count the number of games that have been won because I was a Medic or an Engineer (which are support classes), and because there were enough big guys in my team to do the rest. And at last but not least, you have in this game a lot of fun contents (cf the pyro glasses ; or when blood becomes balloons, and fire becomes rainbow), which is the icing on the cake. The only backdrop : there is a lot of noobs in public games that don't know how to play, and most of the time, it's the team who has the highest number of non-noobish player who wins. But that shouldn't be a problem for you if you're looking just for fun :)

Even if you don't like the base game VALVe (Volvo Pls) has had good support for custom game modes like Jailbreak PropHunt VS Saxton Hale. The game has a very deep trading system basically created by the community. If you have the space and and bandwith this game is a must get. Atleast try it

review: I love this game. I really do. That's why I have over 1,000 hours on it. Every single thing about it is great. But, the one, SINGLE, thing that makes me hate it is the freaking people who play it. There is a select amount of people who are good, but about, I say, 80% of the people who play it are either: screaming 5 year olds, trollers who wont shut up, hackers who ruin the entire game for everyone, people who think they are better than everyone, and last just your classical . I'm sorry if I'm sounding harsh, but this is how I see it. I just needed to say this and this is the only place I could think of. Thank you for reading and good day.

review: Its cool. Just like other RvB games (red vs blue)...when I started playing I did think it was fun, I did pretty well too, only played CTF really though, overall, it was enjoyable for a few hours a few times, but then it got meh. And when it got a 500mb update I didn't bother at all. I just don't want to write a not recommended review, people who love this game will hate me forever. I mean it was ok and all, but not my fav rvb game. When it comes to gmod, I don't usually bother with TF2, I try to make some themes, but they don't work out too well because I don't favor the game. Pros: Its WAS fun for a time... Cons: ...then I got bored.

review: Well, amongst all the positive reactions upon Team Fortress 2, I want to put in some more critical notes, although the sheer quality of this classic is undeniable. First of all, the game is technically superb ofcourse - it all runs flawlessly and Valve keeps updating and supporting it admiringly. Graphics and sound are also top-notch and deserve nothing but praise. And the sheer imagination of the entire undertaking is gigantic and really awe-inspiring. But. The actual gameplay is really mostly for those who enjoy fast-pacing shooting and jumping action, not for those who enjoy having a bit more time for their actions. Ofcourse it is an option to sit along camping, but that is not what this game is made for, and you won't win many friends by doing that. Also, fir those who are now, in 2014, new to the game, it appears to be difficult to find servers where "newbies" (aka beginners) are really welcomed and encouraged. Maybe I didn't try hard enough to find those, but it seemed like a stiff job to get me going. Don't misunderstand: this game promises tons and 100's of fun-hours for those who just like this fast-paced approach, but for the "others", it is something of a steep mountain to climb. Gameplay: 12/20 (according to taste...) Graphics: 16/20 Sound: 16/10 Stability & patching: 20/20 Long-lasting appeal: 18/20 Overall: 82/100

review: Team Fortress 2... What can one say about this game that hasn't been said already? It's a rather unique game in many ways: How many games have had an entire economy based on hats appear in them thanks to their community? How many games can have an extremely skilled player fragged by another, less skilled yet adecuately equiped player? How many games have a metric -ton of hats that vary from plain and boring to silly and pure awesome? Lets not forget that this is a class-based FPS in which every single class has its weaknesses and strengths twards other classes. As the game gets updated more weapons are added, all of which swap around the classes you're good and bad against. With only a few, minor exceptions, there are no weapons ingame that are a straight upgrade to the default weapons, all are sidegrades. The best weapon in the game is the one that fits your style best, the one you feel most comfortable using. There are many ways to play Team Fortress 2: You can play on official servers, which are all good. Play an objective against other players or play a 6 player coop mode against vast waves of AI controlled characters. OR You could play on community servers, where just about anything can happen. There are servers dedicated to trading, to snipers, to all versus one battles, achievement servers, and a large amount of modded gameplay servers. Play how you like, it's free and it's good.

review: The well known, and appreciated War Themed Hat Simulator, AKA Team Fortress 2. Fantastic game with truly awesome gameplay that does not focus on being realistic, just fun! Unlike many other multiplayer shooters, this one requires a lot of teamwork, hence the title, which can be either rarther frustrating or just plain fantastic! The feeling of when you and your team smashes through the enemy defenses and when you help each other out defeating the enemy is something to experience... You won't find this anytime soon in CoD kids... But of course, there are also some bad sides to the fact that teamwork is such a key element. Often it is seen that a lot of new players decide to go the class that they like- This is problematic since a full 10-man team of snipers simply will have a lot more trouble taking down a sentry nest than a single demoman and medic. Morale is that you have to balance the classes so you have enough of everything. There are a lot of unlockable weapons in the game, but you don't get them by 360'ing 30 people in a row... It's random drops, and to some extent achievement milestones (But not that much really...) Most weapons are simply sidegrades, so there aren't many weapons that are just better! Pretty much everything is balanced. As a final note, there are cosmetics in this game! YEY! These doesn't change anything particular important, even though people love 'em. Just collect them as an extra mini-game! It is not what the entirety is about :) The game is free! So yeah... Go have yourself a good time

With 9 differents classes, Team Forteress 2 has a very various gameplay, if you do not want to play as one class, you can choose one of the 8 others classes of the game! Each class has his speciality and they are all balanced. And, to finish, this game is FREE and you can get all weapons randomly when you are playing ; so this game is not a "pay to win". That is why I recommend this game, also because i have more than 1000 hours of gaming and i still love this game :)

There are nine different classes and you must work together to complete your objective and have fun in the same time. You can play in many ways. Offence , defence you can choose what you wanna play 10/10 PLAY IT WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR, JOIN THE FUN FOR HATS!!!!!

review: I highly reccomend this game to anyone that has not tried it. So many year's has it been available, and it's still going strong. and for quite some time now, its been completley free. Not only does this game have quirky characters, interesting mechanics, great crisp-cartoony like gameplay and graphics, and just fun to play with and even then after you get a tad tired of that, tons of stuff to do, like, collect hats, stranges, vintages, Marketing, Unique gamemodes, and many others. So if you havent tried it out, try it out now.

review: Hats. Hats everywhere. So many Hats and other cosmetic items that it's pretty much impossible not to find a combination you like. Also, enough weapons to find a way of killing your opponents that suits you. 9 Classes, each with a unique set of weapons, a fairly realistic personality, and lots of cool hats to wear. So much extra content (Official comics, etc.) that lets you get an incredibly in-depth look at the game's story and the backstory of each Class. Overall, I give TF2 a Hat/10 Best game ever, play it now.

review: I have played Team Fortress 2 since the day it was released (Oct. 10 2007). It's changed a lot since then, but I still consider it the best multiplayer FPS ever made. I have about 460 hours in this game at the time of this writing, and I still laugh my  off every time I play. By reading this, I'm going to assume you're thinking about trying it for the first time, so here's some things all newbies should know: - Some classes are much more difficult learn than others. I'd start your first games playing as Medic, Soldier, Heavy, and/or Pyro. Until you get a decent grasp of things, stay away from Engineer and especially Spy. - Don't worry about the custom weapons that many other players will have. Although some are good, the base weapons are still often the best choice for every weapon of every class. As long as you don't take the game too seriously, it's impossible to not have fun playing it.

review: Honestly, I cannot find any avid gamer that is on steam and does not play Team Fortress 2. It's almost sacriligious to even have steam installed without also having TF2, as it's called by the players, on at least one computer capable of running it well, and boy is that not surprising. This game literally eats up time like no other (except maybe Dota 2 for some, or call of duty for others), and to be honest, the community is just as great. I can easily find a server where nobody gives a crap about killing as many other players as possible, or I can join one with an internationally recognised player for their prowess or two. The amount of hats too! it's all mind boggling that there are still gamers out there that haven't found TF2 enjoyable or have not even heard of it in general. What else to talk about...oh, the support. Obviously, due to its enourmous fanbase and it's publisher being the great and powerful Gaben (Steam creater and CEO(?)), it will almost always be there, as even Half-Life 2: Deathmatch is still supported and given server-space on top of all the newer games. Anyways, I highly recommend this game, and the game in summary would have to be: Hat Simulator 2014 :3 Happy Hat hunting my friends! I hope to see you in-game.

review: Team Fortress 2 is without a doubt the best FPS game I have ever played and probably the best one I will ever play! And that comes from someone who generally dislikes shooters. The cartoony characters, the unique playstyles for all the classes, the unlockable weapons (and hats), and the different types of matches will keep you playing this game for tens to hundreds of hours. Best part: It's completely free!

review: This is a well thought out team based first person shooter. The game encourages teamwork to win against players of higher skill or well-organized teams. Lone wolfing can still be done on lower levels, especially on public game servers. There are 9 classes to choose from, each one offering unique skill sets and abilities that allow them to fill in a unique role as part of the team as a whole. Because of this, the player is rewarded with a challenging and fun-filled experience, especially when faced against opponents or teams with similar or greater skill. Even though this game was released way back in 2007, the game continues to have an active development team that continues to release updates to the game that add new content, such as new unique weapons or game modes. At the time of this review, the Team Fortress community is preparing for the upcoming Halloween update, which has been an annual event in the game since 2009. While this game is extremely fun and rewarding to play, I have noticed how complex the game has become in regards to new items and game mechanics. I became introduced to this game in 2011, and gradually learned the ropes of the game over time. However, I have noticed how newer players have reported having a hard time grasping how all of the items work and in general feeling a sense of information overload. In order for them to not be considered a "noob" at this game, they must experiment and test with all of the items in the game to have a full understanding of what weapon(s) should be used in certain situations. All of this, however, is a small issue amidst the big picture. This game is fantastic and, being a free-to-play game, allows players to have loads of fun without having to make a big down payment to enjoy it. I continue to return to the game on a daily basis.

review: Team Fortress 2: A beginner's guide to multiplayer games. TF2 has it all. Classes, maps, hats and a humourous attitude. That said it's also terribly addictive like most multiplayer games, and whilst I recommend TF2, I can't help note how serious this addiction can be, when people rack up 10,000+ hours playing this game, it really doesn't deserve that. It's not *that* good of a game to be honest. That says it is a fun time with friends or a group of strangers for a few hours here and there, but little more unless you're an obsessive achievement hunter.

review: Team Fortress 2 is undoubtedly the best free-to-play game Steam has to offer. The graphics are great and while this game may look childish to some, the only thing childish about it are the cartoon-esque designs. Outside of that, TF2 is a game suitable for people of any and all ages 13 and up. What I find most appealing about this game is that even though players are allowed to spend as much money as they'd like to equip their characters with extremely powerful weaponry, the atmosphere of the game is generally quite fair and balanced. Of course some people may seem overpowered at times, but they are often veterans of this game. Just as long as you know how to play right, you don't need anything other than the default items the game provides.

review: If I was to summarise this game, I would simply describe it as the best first person shooter ever made. If you don't have it downloaded then hop right over to the steam library and go to the free games section. However, if you're the type that likes a bit more detail in your descriptions, then team fortress is also the right game for you. It is truly a 'easy to learn, hard to master' type of game. Additionally, upon starting the game you will not be instantly swamped by players who can kill you easier because they have weapons that are better than you. Everything in tf2 is balanced beautifully, between the weapons, individual classes and the overall team dynamic. Each new item doesn't bring with it a new advantage, but a new way that you can tweak your playstyle, with it's own individual positive and negative aspects. The overall feel of the game is great as well, due to the cartoony graphics and humorous quips that your team will constantly spout. Even in the worst matches, when I've had my head driven into the dirt by a more skilled team, I still walk away with an inward grin at that one time that four of my team mates and I walked a literal conga line through the enemy team's defence or airblasting an enemy scout and keeping him pinned against a wall while he shouted that I was a spy, followed by us sharing a high five and his character spontaneously exploding. I could go on about this game for days, but you shouldn't be reading it. You should be playing it as I speak.

review: +The game is a fun FPS with multiple classes to vary up your play style and changes the way it is from other FPS's, then it just being a point and shoot with the regular FPS guns: smg, sniper, assualt rifle, etc. But TF2 adds a more expansive take with weapons: flamethrower, minigun, sentries, etc. I'd say this game is worth it since it's been pretty active for 8 years. (to this date) -Although the game has multiple hats, misc. etc. for you to wear on your characters, and different types of weapons (genuine, vintage, strange, etc.) with along the trading the comes along with this game and can get you into a fuss over wanting an item for a long time and then going into the habbit of buying everything from either the Mann Co. Store or the Steam Market. This game will consume your money more then "pickpocketers" in Europe. Although the game is a new a fun FPS with still 8 years of active people and with the downfall of trading I still give this game a.. 9/10

review: What's amazing about this game, is that if valve never made any more updates for this game, the community, even the game itself, could sustain itself, ab kept alive for a very long time. It's almost as if it was made to be alive forever. Crafting, trading, inventory, cards, item drops, events, it's all here. The gameplay is fun, gory, querky, and addicting: everything you need in a game. The absence of an assault rifle is another thing that makes it stand out. It doesn't need to be like COD, or halo, it is what it is, and that's what makes it better than others. It has bird heads, sandwiches, more birds, shotguns, and everything. I highly recomend it. Best game ever.

review: It is a very good game when you get some weapons that you are better at. At first it may seem that everyone is better than you because they have better weapons, stranges,miscs and the most popular- unusual hats. This can change when you play it for a while (don`t end up like me playing over 128 hours in 2 months) and you get good weapons. And then you get to purchace items. It`s a game of cometition, but there can never be 'a best player'. Overall, I am addicted to this game. I love it.

review: Oh boy, Team Fortress 2. Where to start? Gosh I have over 400 hours docked into this game. This game is endless enjoyment and despite the fact there will be trolls and whiney (cussing) eight year olds, the game itself makes up for all of this. I'm not the BEST TF2 player, but I enjoy playing the game FOR the game. Unfortunately, most people, for some reason, tend to overlook the "Team" in "Team Fortress 2" and don't cooperate as a team all the time. But when you get a good team or some good competition, it's easily enjoyable! Many people on Team Fortress 2 are friendly, at least, most of the time, but of course, not everyone that plays the game is mature, nor a good-sport. But more often than not, there will be some friendly people on a server. I've made a bunch of friends just from meeting friendly people on Team Fortress 2. If you like a good FPS with silliness, fun, and of course, HATS, then Team Fortress 2 is the game for you! PROS: FREE!!! Extremely Addictive Fun Well Made HATS Several different gamemodes Did I say HATS? Different cosmetic items (including hats x3) for the classes Hilarious moments 1000s of different items Trading PROFIT CONS: 4 out of 5 servers will either have or eventually get a whiney, mic-spamming, cussing 5-10 year old Some People get too into the game sometimes and take everything personally You will find yourself investing over 400 dollars into the game x3 You will slowly have your mortal soul taken from you by the game Boot Camp bears the dread of a horrible team Mann Up bears the dread of a Boot Camp team People who like to think everytime they kill someone is the time to rant or spam "rekt" [MOST] Free-To-Plays are often Gibus/Pyrovision-Bearing Micspamming little kids [MOST] Free-to-Plays are AWFULLY annoying at times Otherwise, Team Fortress 2 has MANY more pros that I cannot take the time to list right now. But if you can deal with suddenly looking at your credit card balance then realizing you just blew your last 5 paychecks on TF2 or all the whiney 5-10 year olds, then Team Fortress 2 is a GREAT game and I truely recommend this game. I give it a 20/10 If you decide to download Team Fortress 2, I hope to see you sometime in the game! Trixie Out!

review: I've had COUNTLESS hours of CONSTANT fun with this game! I grew up playing this and I've made almost half of my Steam friends through it! I just absolutely LOVE the concept and idea of this game! I'm always getting into duels and battles to see who's better among my friends (We play arena to see who lasts the longets, last person standing) and I usually get into the mediocre sort of range... I'm nothing special at the game, but I see myself as a pretty good Scout, an OK Medic, a good Heavy, and a great Sniper. I find all sorts of different ways to traverse all sorts of maps as Scout and test my sharpshooting on 2Fort as Sniper. I've played with lots of nice people and on servers with "Plug-ins" that allow you to get upgrades and buffs kind of like an overpowered version of Mann vs Machine in which You and your team of 5 others fight for a certain amount of rounds against Robots and they keep getting harder and harder. Just wait until the tank comes! Then you have a full-team target! Great game overall and you should DEFINITELY get this game!

review: TF2, being another one of Valve's best (which is about every one of them) games is a FPS based around 9 classes in colourful and fun maps. The game is of course also known as Hat Simulator 2, as hats are what you do to display your skill, even though said hats are purely cosmetical. This game has sucked up almost 2000 hours of my life, and was the one game to get me into steam, as TF2 is completely free to play (purchasing any item in the in-game store upgrades your account to premium, allowing for a couple of perks as a free hat and more in-game item drops). It should also be mentioned that even though it is F2P, there is no need to pay if you'd like to win! You can get the weapons from in game drops, achievements or a clever crafting system, and I can almost guarantee that you'll be enjoying this game from start to end. Give it a shot, it is free after all. 9/10 This game is at its best with the real F2P and the user-friendlyness, but it does have a couple of bugs and annoying things which will get on your nerves. If you're looking for a casual FPS with competitive possibilities, check out TF2.

Did I mention it's free and has hats and guns and guns and hats and frees and games and mentions and has hases and has ands and hats and hats and guns and hats and guns and frees? If it did not mention that fact, then I need to tell you that it has Hats and Guns. Hats and Guns/10 But I do digress, the latest updates have made the game exponentially laggier, to the point where having fun isn't an option. It was fine before. Dang it, Valve.

review: No wonder why Team Fortress 2 is rated to be the best Free to play game. Unlike other first-person shooter, Team Fortress develops in it's own unique way, by including various diffrent maps, various diffrent weapons and even diffrent class with diffrent ability that reflects the player's personality. Once you enter the world of TF2 ( chopping other player's head's off, burning them with your flamethrower, betraying their trust by backstabbing them physically) you would wish you will never have to stop playing. I mean what I say and I say what I mean, and this is what I will say " Tf2 is the best game I had ever played".

It turned into a riot. Gabe... We know you like Snickers and every other chocolate but stop being so jewish about that money thing...

Maybe just one. Or two." And now I'm an active trader and have bought a bunch of keys for metals and taunts and weapons and most importantly hats.

review: This game is amazing. The weapons are unique, the game modes are fun and exciting, and overall it's a very fun game. I especially appreciate the fact that while there is an in-game store, the game is not pay-to-win, like most games nowadays. By this I mean the "weapon drop" system. For those of you who don't know what I mean, there is a function in the game that at random times while playing, you can find a random weapon or item. This means that certain weapons aren't restricted to paying players. It allows free-to-play players enjoy all the awesome weapons paying players get. There's also a lot of really cool functions and taunts to the game, and an underlying sense of humor that makes the game overall extremely fun to play. And sure, it has its glitches and problems (aghermghermGabeNewallaghermgherm) but if you look past it, TF2 is an amazing game, and I think that almost anyone can find enjoyment in it. The only problem I have with it, Mini-Sentries. Nerf them. Now. Valve. DROP WHAT YOU'RE DOING AND NERF MINI-SENTRIES RIGHT NOW. #GibusPride #PyroFoLife

You can play offline with bots, online with other people, or a campaign like story called Mann vs. Machine. While playing, you can unlock new pieces of equipment. There is so many items that it is overwhelming! You can choose between 9 classes. Scout, soilder, pyro, demo man, heavy, engineer, medic, sniper, and spy. You can play on different types of gamemodes and maps. There are also always new updates coming out. If you have steam and you don't have this game the GET IT!

If you dont like blowing people up with a rocket launcher or shooting exploding enemies with a grenade launcher, then you can try to run around like crazy and shoot enemies heads off with a scatter gun. If you are just like you wanna camp you can try headshotting enemies with the sniper or just be the engineer, who can build machines like a sentry that aims automatticly or shoot them, build dispensers so you you can heal your teammates, or build teleporters to get your teammates up to the line quickly!

review: This is the best FTP game i have ever played! There is so much to do, no need to buy anything with real money if you dont want to. Everything can be crafted! All 9 classes are awesome. I never feel that one of them is too OP because you can always counter them. Once you mastered one class there is always more! If you master Scout, you can then start to master some else class or just dont master anything and still have a good time wiht this game. PvP mode works like it should, nothing special, just 7 differend game modes and some beta gamemodes, lots of maps and everyone is fun to play. there is also an PvE mode called MvM. Its supper fun with firends and some of them are hard. To top it off, i like this game :)

review: This might be hard to believe, but this man is the leader of a group of lizards from the hyper elite. I know this first hand. I took care of this being as the mentor, as I am a hyper elite of the syntax-sector of the Illuminati. I have experimented with teleportation, Obama, and lizards shape-shifting into Secret-service agents. When the syntax-sector of the hyper elite barracks in the north pole, most experiments broke loose. This prototype, however, was smarter than most. With little to no signs of lizard-like structures when shape-shifted, he was the perfect man for our job. I once used my transformation powers, but was quickly spotted, and the extra-molecular shape-shifting superdinosaur came and saved me, with the hyperbeam harvested from Dialga in the Pokemon dimension. Yes, that show is real, made by the Ancient Gods from Sector-B//AnimationDimension//X-3, we transported the creatures into the "intelligent" planet called Earth, in my opinion, the weakest sector of the whole Illuminati. If you want more information about these creatures first hand, contact me via Google+ or teleportating to the hyperdimension in Class-A.

review: My oppinion of a first person shooter done right. This game has so much going for it. The levels are well designed, and fun to play on. All 9 of the classes are unique and balance well (each class has it's own niche and weakness). Controls are smooth and easy to pick up, even for a person new to the FPS genre. The comunity has an empesis on creativity with a workshop, mod maps, character custimization (both cosmetics and weapon loadouts), trading, and much more. Finaly, this game has something that no FPS has had in a long time, as sense of humor and presonality mostly stemming from the characters unique personas and how they interact with eachother.

review: Originally, I downloaded this game simply for content in Garry's Mod, thinking I would never take interest in it and play it. I made a mistake. I started playing it in early September, and I'm very glad I did. Everything about it is so loveable. The less realistic, stylized art style, the map design, the gamemodes, the variety of the classes, (the satisfaction when you kill a really good player), weapons, hats and outfits, and the constant stream of community made items! In my opinion, it is far better than other FPS games on the market, and it's free! Without a doubt, I recommend this game to anyone who wants exactly what Team Fortress 2 has to offer, or someone who simply wants a game to be addicted to!

He smacks me and takes my computer away, sending me to sleep. I'm crying now, I lay in bed, and my face hurts. It's cold, and I feel a warmth moving towards me. Something touches me. It's Gaben! I'm so happy, he whispers in my ear, "HALF LIFE 3 CONFIRMED." He grabs me with his powerful programming hands, I'm ready. I spread my asscheeks for Gaben, he puts a hat on my butt. It looks so stupid but I do it for Gaben. My dad walks in to check on me and apologize, and shouts, "WHAT THE ?!" Gaben looks him straight in the eyes and says, "PORTAL 3 CONFIRMED." He flies through the window. Hats are love. Hats are life.

review: Ever Look across a lake and see a shooting star fly across the sky? Well, good for you. Nobody cares. The important thing is Team Fortress 2 is not your ordanary FPS game. It's a really fun and challenging game, with up to nine different classes that you can play as. These classes are the scout, soldier, pyro, demoman, heavy, engineer, medic, sniper, and spy. These names need no introduction, they speak for themselves! Also you can use different weapons, all uniquely different! So when you see Team Fortress 2 in the Steam store, you get it! (It's freeee). So when this review asks me if I recommend this game, I say YES.

review: This will technically be my 2nd review on this game as that my last one was 2-3 years ago, i now have ALLOT more expierence in this game and i know nooks and crannies and secrets, but as you are reading this review you probly want to play this game so i won't spoil anything. One of the best things about this game is that it has its own economy... That fluctuates.... what i mean is that the economy changes like a item on E-bay. You know that one VINTAGE Harmonica your DIEING to get and sometimes the price goes up and sometimes it goes down. the price changes bepending on how rare it is, what its made of, and its demand. Second thing i love about this game is just the Variety of how you can play it, and i don't mean just 9 out of the 9 classes. I won't go into the the items you pick up on the way as that would be to much for a little review box. Scout is fast SURE but he can play as a great distraction against the team and i find him to be more to be a class to stall the enemy team. But thats just how i play, a scout can be right in your face a beat you and blast you solidly in the face. Though with strong weapons and agillity he is also sorta weak, work around that issue the way you see fit. Soldier is kinda bulky and his weapons are very strong as long as you know how to use them. There is one form of getting around for soldier called a Rocket Jump, a rocket jump is a blast directly under/next to him using the blast force to push him in the desired direction, issue is rocket jumps can harm him and the fall damage of coming back down from the air can hurt too. Pyro is actually very easy to use if your brand new to the game even if we hate seeing the old fashion "M1 + W" pyro. he can be very helpful with some expertise as he can reflect rockets back into the senders face with a Air-blast. Pyro can Spy-Check as in BURN the area around him hitting any invisible/disguised spies around. but he is mostly for Short-Range attacks. Demo can be used 2 very different ways (other ways are available) as explosives are fine and all but you can also go into whats called a "Demo-knight" and go without any sort of Gun and only use your meelee to cut threw your foes' necks. Issue with explosives he can do harm to himself, and his Demo-knight strategy... well lets face it they have guns and he doesn't... so be careful Heavy is VERY bulky but has allot of fire power with his minigun and stays alive Via his sandvich, and/or medic, you can also do "Heavy Boxing" but in a real fight of tf2 i wouldn't recommend it. Engineer works with his machines but is susceptable to spys, demos, and soldiers. as they can all cause MAJOR harm, even from a distance, to his builds anyhow. Engi is very helpful to his team as he keeps stock to their ammo and health. With a teleporter to get his teammates to locations much faster. But his personal weapons rather than his machines are not exactly strong so you kinda have to rely on your sentry Medic is extremely smart in machines of the medical type, using his Medi-gun or "Uber Cannon" as some call it, he can keep everyone in their Peak physical condition, and more so with Overheal. He can revive the dead itself with his expertise. Trouble is that he is definately not built for a fight by himself as he only carries his Medi-gun, a Syringe gun, and a Bone saw Sniper is pretty easy to guess what his expertise is, he puts bullets threw players' heads! He can be very hard for some to master or some VERY EASY to master, Depending on their past work. He can use a sniper rifles of many varieties or a Bow and Arrow. He uses Jarate wich can be a real harm to the enemy as it causes more damage to them. But as sniper is most of the time scoped in, his peripheral is narrowed, making him susceptable to... well whatevers behind him like spies. Spy can be very hard to master as he has to go unnoticed by the enemy. Why is this difficult? Because people scream when they have a knife in their back. But spy can become any person on the oppisite team and even his own team to trick them with a Dead Ringer to fake his own death! if disguised as his own team its like they die rather than him. Spy can be extremely powerful if unnoticed but is very weak. There is many ways to play the game that i won't get into, enjoy Team Fortress 2 10/10

review: A nice shooter game, Dosent do anything extremely innovative but it plays its cards right and simply assembles a neat shooter game with no Jack Of All Trades classes and plenty of maps, classes and weapons to collect. And whats the cost? nothing! essentially how it works is that you cannot give anything in a trade and cannot earn any COSMETIC items besides the few newbie hats. But if you dont want to spend a dime on the game, go for it you can still earn the weapons without any restriction so knock yourself out!

review: Team Fortress 2 is a very well balanced game it have things for everyone with difference play style, sick of shooting people your self build a sentry and start camping, tired of shooting and sick of sentries be a spy and baclstab people and sap those sentry, tired of killing master the arts healing as the medic and support your team today. Reasons this game can last that long is because of it's massive community and valve's caring toward this community listening to ideas, the End of the Line update is one of the great examples. There is no pay to win in this game the other weapons is not a direct upgrade to the origin wepons, every weapon have it's positive and negatives.

review: This review is split into sections, using numerals to show each section. All in all a 10/10 game. You should be playing this right now. I There are several game modes: CTF (Capture the Flag or briefcase in this game), TDM (Team Death Match), FFA (Free For All Death Match), Control Point (Capture and Hold Controls Points), King of the Hill (One team, or player must defend a single Control Point to win), and Payload (a team must push their bomb to the enemy base in order to win). Graphics are cartoonish. Gameplay is very well done, and holy crap is it fun. Bugs almost nonexistent. Hat Simulator 2 II Gameplay The maps in the game are near perfectly balanced, not giving any team any type of real heads up. There are plenty of weapons, and cosmetics to choose from. It is considered that the default weapons are the best weapons, but each is entitled to their own opinions. There are a large number of maps, and a large number of other content available to the players. There are many items in the game that were created by the community itself, including maps, weapons, and cosmetics. Choosing random game modes/maps will always give you a different map every time (after 40ish hours you might have seen every map rotation), weapons can be earned through achievements, or by purchasing their variants through the market place. Valve does give you an option to switch to their beta maps as well, which of course are being tested by the players who choose to do so. The gameplay is fast paced and very logically developed, and due to its cartoonish graphical style it is very much enjoyable. III Free to Play Vs. Paid to Play The game is indeed Free to Play, but if you receive any item drops, you are unable to use them/sell them. Unless of course you purchase an item from the Team Fortress 2 website, or from the MarketPlace. Purchasing an item gives you many more slots in your backpack for items, and removes all restrictions of Free to Play. All in all a 10/10 game. You should be playing this right now.

review: Quite a nice game. Sorry for jumping on the bandwagon, but here's the positives and negatives. Positive: -BIG community. Even in 3 in the morning you have 1000 servers full of friendly people. -No OP weapons. Even though some people complain, the developers makes sure that no matter how much money you spend in the game, everything is equal. -Flexibility. Whether you want to trade in a minecraft mod, kill idle people in a box, or hook onto walls and be superman, you've got it all. -Cool feature like CONGA and a frying pan. Negative -You will encounter rude people. Whether with micspam, spawncamp, or scammers, not everyone is nice. -Tryhards. By tryhard I don't mean someone who's good. I mean someone who is bad but pretends/try to be good. They sometimes rage and spoil the fun for them and other people. -(Sometimes)Developers hat focus too much on making money, not content. In the recent End of The Line, the only weapon they promised was useless, overpriced "Ducks", canceling the map, and not giving the community enough for their hard work. I'm not trying to hate on Valve, but sometimes they are dissapointing. Overall, since it's free, go ahead, try it out. You might encounter some ups and downs. Don't rage. These are my personal opinion. True or False, I hope you enjoyed my point of view. -Toaster

review: This game is really good because you can play in many varying ways. As a spy you could be sneaky. If you like to be a support you could always play as a medic and heal injured teammates. If you wanna be a bit tanky, though you will probably need a medic to be in the frontlines of a fight, you could play as a heavy and kill everybody with your minigun. If you like being fast and capture points and the intelligence fast you will be playing as the scout. There's other classes such as sniper, pyro, soldier demoman, and engineer. Another great thing is that you can find new weapons to play differently. Definitely recommend, Hell I would give the game 10/10!

review: Valve's Team Fortress 2 is quite different from most multiplayer games that come out these days. First of all, the balance of this game is excellent. Seriously. Out of all the classes, the only one which comes even close to being overpowered and unbalanced is the Pyro, which is terrible at long range, so probably that evens out. Secondly, the humour and the classes are enough to keep anybody entertained. There are 9 classes in the game, and each one has their own unique personality and traits. I definitely recommend this game. If you haven't played it yet, do so right now. It's free to play, but I had bought it when Orange Box came out.

review: I was only 15 years old I loved TF2 so much I prayed to TF2 every night, thanking it for the love I've been given. "Hats are love." I say. "Hats are life." My dad walks in on me as I max out the credit card to buy all the hats and he calls me a theifing , I know he's just jealous that I'm going to raise my steam level, I called him a . He smacks me and takes my computer away, sending me to sleep. I'm crying now, I lay in bed, and my face hurts. It's cold, and I feel a warmth moving towards me. Something touches me. It's Gaben! I'm so happy, he whispers in my ear, "HALF LIFE 3 CONFIRMED." He grabs me with his powerful programming hands, I'm ready. I spread my asscheeks for Gaben, he puts a hat on my butt. It looks so stupid but I do it for Gaben. My dad walks in to check on me and apologize, and shouts, "WHAT THE ?!" Gaben looks him straight in the eyes and says, "PORTAL 3 CONFIRMED." He flies through the window. Hats are love. Hats are life.

review: Before playing Team Fortress 2, I would've said "to hell with first-person shooters." With so many of them being carbon copies of each other, with the same old gritty, realstic style, it's easy to lose faith in there being originality in the genre. Team Fortress 2 is a fine example of everything having an exception. It's always the perfect solution for when I'm having a crappy day or I'm bored. Except for when it's not. But it often is! Moreso than almost any other game. It's incredibly fun and designed to be the kind of game you pour hundreds of hours into, which is very easy to do! It's free and it's fun, there's no damn excuse to not play it! Give it a try, you'll probably surprise yourself with how enjoyable it is! Even if the ordinary gameplay style isn't your thing, there's many other types of servers and play styles to always offer something exciting. Even when I'm getting my  kicked on this game, I tend to be having fun and laughing. It's easy to get into and easy to get addicted to as well. If you're wondering, there is a "catch" to it being free to play, which is that there's also a premium version but to get that version you just need to purchase any in-game item, which can be for as little as 60 pence or something like that, plus it is possible to play for as long as you like with the free version if you're satisfied with that. The main motivation to get premium is the space in your inventory is quite limited in the free version and after a few hundred hours (!) playing you might start to feel like you're running out of space, assuming you like to keep anything interesting you get. As far as catches go, I'd say that's pretty fair, certainly gives you a loooong time to decide whether this game is worth putting your money towards... a potentially very small amount of money, I might add. Getting premium allows you to get rarer drops such as hats and be able to trade items with other players freely, allowing you to get your hands on all sorts of cool stuff. You'll probably only want to get it if you've got really into the game and want to experience it in full and have been playing long enough for the inventory space to become an issue, so don't feel this is a game where you feel incredibly stunted by your free-to-play status. In conclusion this game is super-super fun, few other games have the potential to have so many hundreds of hours poured into them and remain enjoyable. Give it a try, you'll probably be very glad you did! Although having said all that, it does have autobalance, the worst feature to be included in any game ever. Nothing like getting put on the team you've been working against all this time the moment you die, after having called vote after vote to prevent such a fate but everybody adores a gamebreaking flaw too much for there to be enough "yes" votes. If you end up the very opposite to glad that you gave this a game a try after all, finding yourself on the verge of suicide over how something as evil as autobalance can exist in this world, I'm very sorry. Truly, who could have expected that in a team-based game, anyone could think it'd be a good idea to have a feature that targets you the exact second you die, no matter how long you had been alive beforehand and forces you to turn against your own team? A feature that in an instant, turns a highly enjoyable round into an extremely irritating one. A feature that, despite having been criticised for years, still hasn't been reworked, all we've got is a vote feature that people are too stupid to vote "yes" for.

review: In case you can't tell, I love this game. Just look at how many hours I have on it. It is hands down the best Multiplayer FPS out there. Also it's free to play. And free things are awesome. You do need to buy at least one item from the in-game store to get a premieum, but the cheapest item is currently $0.10, so it's not that big a deal. Now, onto the gameplay. This game appeals to all people who like FPS games. Wanna snipe? Go sniper. Wanna be a healer? Go medic. Wanna be an indestructable tank in the battlefield? Go heavy. The list goes on and on. Its wonderfully balanced (except for the gunslinger). Also the hats are pretty neat.

review: All my life I wanted to be a pro...a warrior and I just couldn't succeed.But then,I found it.The fate of the world was now in my hands,a weapon designed by the gods of pootis,a true amazing weapon that would aid me in every battle that I would ever be in it was...........the phlog.This weapon was made for me,but only those with true power could use this righteous glory of pure holiness that is this weapon.The beauty of this weapon gives me a hardcore erection that can not and will not be tamed.People yell and hate on me because I wield the power of the almighty.Not only is the weapon a very balanced item,but it represents life..time...and humanity.The mechanical look of the phlog represents us...as humans it shows that we are gears turning endlessly cought up in many things..but we are like this for a reason.You see...the gears turn and work together to produce the flame of the heavenly guards that once protected this weapon.Anyway what im saying is the gears help each other to charge and activate...the mmph meter.The pure skill and patience it takes to activate this will literally give you the power of everything,demons,angels,and even God himself.Once this meter has run out you go back to your slightly better than normal self.After having this weapon for over 10 milliniums,I finally unlocked the helment of grace and glory...this hat is.....the GIBUS.I CAN'T SAY ANYMORE OR ELSE THE GODS WILL PUNISH ME FOR THE SIN I HAVE COMMITED TELLING EVERYONE AND ANYONE ABOUT THIS IS JUST DEATH FOR ME.SO GO MY FRIENDS AND PHLOG ON. :D :D :D

review: Team Fortress 2 is an amazing, creative, hilarious, and incredibly fun multiplayer first person shooter. This game is one of a kind, and it is incredibly popular for many good reasons like: it perfectly balances the 9 classes to make the game a lot more fun (Because who wants to constantly die against someone with virtualy no weakness?). The balancing in this game makes sure that no one class is too overpowered, and encourages a lot of team work and stradegy. The game probably wouldn't be as fun if it wasnt balanced to perfection. Valve also listens to their fans, something that many game companies don't do. We have the Steam Workshop to show fan - made items that have at least a chance of becoming in game items! They also listen to feedback about for example: balancing issues, or a glitch. The constant updates are great especialy since like the game, they are all free! These important updates could include new weapons, taunts, costumes, maps, or even modes! (Like Mann vs. Machine) The 9 classes are so full of stereotypical humor, bright personalities, and amusing lines. The Scout is a stereotypical teenager from Boston with a baseball bat and an awesome accent, the Soldier is a stereotypical American drill sargent with a bazooka who sounds exactly like what I would think a stereotypical drill sargent sounds like, the Demoman is a drunken black scottish guy with an accent, a grenade launcher, a stickybomb launcher, and an eyepatch, many peoples favorite class: the Heavy is a giant Russian man with a minigun named "Sasha", and a Russian accent who punches people with his bare (or bear!) hands and created an internet meme because of the almighty Sandvich, the Engineer is a Texan who can build Sentry guns, Dispensers, and Teleporters to help the team, has a Texan accent, and palys the guitar, the Sniper is an seemingly everyday Australian man with a Rifle that can do an instant kill (Headshot), an Australian accent, a hat and sunglasses, and is an assasin for hire, not just a mercinary. the Medic is a German doctor that has a German accent, stole a dove from a German prime ministers wedding and named it "Archimedes", and lost his medical liscence who can breifly turn people invincible, the Spy (my favorite) is a mysterious French gentleman who can do an instant kill (Back stab), has a French accent, can turn invisible, can use his Electro sapper to destroy an Engineer's Buildings in time, is an assasin for hire like the Sniper, and is CRUEL to everybody, and my second favorite class: the Pyro is a complete mystery since he has a fire protective suit that covers his entire body, a gas mask that covers his face (if he even HAS one), and only says "Mmph", and has a huge variety of Flame-throwers, secondary weapons, (Like Flare guns) and Meele weapons (Like axes) who is arguably the best class in the game!!!!!! (Even with the Pyro's balances like mostly close-ranged combat) I could go on and on about the entire game, but I dont want to bore any one reading this review by making it even longer that it already is. Team Fortress 2 is one of the funniest, most creative, one of a kind, and best games I have ever played, and the best PC game EVER period. I would recomend this more than anything else, and if it wasn't free when I got it, it would be higher than #1 on my wishlist. Infact, the one reason I made a Steam accout is to get Team Fortress 2! It is truly a godly game. GET. THIS. GAME. NOW!!!!!

review: One of the best online FPS to date. Characters are awesome, voice acting is awesome, weapons are awesome. Class based, with a giant arsenal of different weapons to equip. Smooth and optimized performance, awesome fan made and oficial maps. Has in game store, were all weapons and cosmetics are. (Execpt for a few promo items.) But here is the twist: Almost all of the stock weapons which you recieve from the start, are the best. Weapons drop rather freqeuntly, aswell as having achivements which gives weapons. (Hint: There is a LOT of achivements.) So in short: Play this game. If you dont enjoy, no harm. Its free. Just uninstall and be on your way... 12/10 would play again.

review: Very fun game, in my opinion one of the best games that has ever existed. During my long playtime I learned a lot about the community. With the probably addition of competitive matchmaking valve will "revive" this game since a lot of players say it is dying. All I hope is that Valve will add this new feature and this game will have even more players like CS:GO and DOTA 2. Cosmetics are also a part of the game that keep the community alive! People say traders are stupid and don't even play the game and traders say that people who play the game only for gameplay are stupid and poor. That's not true at all. The F2P players aren't always noobs... There are some F2Ps with expensive backpacks and there are some F2Ps with crazy skills. It's not the gibus or the team captain, it's the skills, no matter what type of skills - trading or playing. It is a fair and balanced game and people can easily get started playing it. There aren't any complex mechanics or anything, just hop on and have fun. Lots of weapons to choose from, lots of gamemodes, lots of fun. The perfect trio. I started playing this game and the first 1000 hours I only played without trading. I got premium at 500 hours and started trading after 1000. I started playing the game without trading just months ago. My backpack is worth a bit and I do not need more than this. As a conclusion, I am both a trader and a player and I suggest you play this game for both of those things! The only bad thing I can say is that the trading community is going to hell.

review: TF2 is a team based hat simulator. The main goal is to collect hats and move your way up the ranks of the top traders. Although Hats are obviously the main part about this game, the shooting game included is great! Well balanced, but with LOTS of inexperienced people calling you a "Cheater" for sticky jumping across the map. Jokes aside, TF2 is a great game and I recommend you try it at least once.

review: TF2 is by far the best free game on the steam market. It has a variety of game modes (plus it's free! (can't go wrong with free games)). With some free games, you find to actually do something, you have to pay, but you can rock on tf2 without having to pay a single penny! Spy and soldier are my favourite classes and my soldier is pimped with awesome gear that i traded for on trade servers. I would reccomend this to anyone who likes action packed first person shooters!!

review: This game is possibly one of the greatest F2P games ever. However, once you reach that premium level, the game only gets better. Starting the game out, people do not realize the potential that they have. They look at their inventories, see the stock items placed in the slots, and connect to the first payload game that they find. And so the journey begins on TF2. But with only .50 cents in your steam wallet, you can unlock all the secrets of TF2. Purchasing their first wrangler opens them up to the world of hats, trading, and of course, unusuals. When a newly found premium player gets his first key, he opens up the crate that had no use before this. The suspense is killing him... 3... 2... 1... You unboxed! Strange Jarate! Not knowing the dissapointment in this. The player screams with excitement about getting a strange! Selling this strange for 1 rec turns into buying another, and getting a ref. This ref turns into a key. And the key into a bud. Now, you are a veteran of TF2 trading. However, with new updates coming every so often (BREAAD), new oppurtunites are created, and the game of Team Fortress get even better.

review: Once you find a server that fits well with your skill level, appropriate ratio of seriousness to humor, and is generally free of s, I've found TF2 to be one of the most enjoyable ways you can spend your time. Luckily, TF2's community is exceptional compared to other FPSs out there, so this generally isn't difficult. I do want to stress, however, how much server jumping can improve your experience if your first few tries aren't stellar. Lots of people play this game for lots of different reasons, so shop around and find a like-minded community. Whether you're super serious or just wanna conga or somewhere in between, who you play with affects your experience hugely.

Not only does this game have quirky characters, interesting mechanics, great crisp-cartoony like gameplay and graphics, and just fun to play with and even then after you get a tad tired of that, tons of stuff to do, like, collect hats, stranges, vintages, Marketing, Unique gamemodes, and many others. So if you havent tried it out, try it out now.

review: Hats. Hats everywhere. So many Hats and other cosmetic items that it's pretty much impossible not to find a combination you like. Also, enough weapons to find a way of killing your opponents that suits you. 9 Classes, each with a unique set of weapons, a fairly realistic personality, and lots of cool hats to wear. So much extra content (Official comics, etc.) that lets you get an incredibly in-depth look at the game's story and the backstory of each Class. Overall, I give TF2 a Hat/10 Best game ever, play it now.

review: I've wasted many glorious hours playing this, and I can say I've had one heck of a time. In Team Fortress 2, you're essentially playing 9 different games at once with the radical gameplay differences each class has, and on top of that the many gamemodes provides even more diverseity to how you play each class, since their role changes depending on the gamemode. It is an unorthodox and first person shooter that continues to break the mold of what a game in the genre can be, and I would recommend it to anyone that, essentially, wants something that is completely different, while still maintaining enough familiarity for those accustomed to the fps genre. Effective teamwork, diversity, balanced and fast-paced gameplay; what more could you ask for in a fun-to-play and free-to-play first person shooter like TF2. Oh yeah...hats...don't forget about hats...

review: Team Fortress 2 is a fast-paced game.From characters as fast as scout to characters as slow as heavy.Although some people might argue,I personally feel that scout is not the fastest. As a soldier,rocket jumping proves to be a good mean of reaching to the front line.A great item to have as a soldier when rocket jumping is the 'Gunboats'.The gunboats is a pair of AMAZING item.It provides lots of mobility.Next we're going to look at the classes. 1. Scout=Fast,good mean of damage with the scattergun,flying guillotine+sandman can take down a heavy fast 2.Soldier=Slow at moving,fast at rocket jumping,highest mean of damage with stock rocket launcher,gunboats for mobility and market gardener/escape plan 3.Pyro=Normal speed,reflecting rockets is the way to play pyro properly i feel and using the flare and axtinguisher gives you lots of damage output. 4.Demoman=Slower by normal speed by a bit,Pipes and stickybomb launcher is a really good mean of taking down sentry nests.You can have lots of fun by being a troll demoman by having the boots,tide turner or sticky jumper(depending of map) and the ullapool caber.The fun factor is high. 5.Heavy=Slowest class,Good mean of damage and very effective at attacking sentries. 6.Engineer=Normal speed,widowmaker teaches you how to aim your shotgun as missing takes out your ammo,pistol for secondary as its your seond long range weapon.Gunslinger as its annoying and fun to use. 7. Medic=Faster than normal by a bit,blutsauger,kritzkrieg for the healing taunt and uber saw to build uber for team. 8.Sniper=Normal speed,challenging but fun,sniper is an effective class to deal with heavies. 9.Spy=Normal speed.Last but not least,we have the SPY.An effective class against sentry nests,heavies and medics,the spy is a very sly class,able to take out sentry nests with the sapper,taking out heavy and medic combos is a huge up side. Overall tf2 is a fun game to play .

review: Ive played this game for quite some time and had much fun in this game, it is quite original and a unique gem in the line of video games out there. For instance, I was walking around in Dustbowl and encountered an enemy pyro. Then astonishingly, he croutched down, pulled out an axe, and called me a "spy" in friendliness. I did the same except with a shovel. Being a new Tf2 player and never seeing this behavior before, I scrounged the voice command list for "spy". Upon completing my feat of seeking the correct word, we walked toward eachother slowly, legs crouched, and stared at eachother, spamming "spy". We did this for a few moments until one of my team mates (soldier) came waddling himself down towards me and the pyro. He stared at us both in confusion, the little ghost dangling off his gibus in the fresh dusty air, and shot a rocket at the pyro, sending his body flying many yards away. Upon seeing my first Tf2 ragdoll, I burst into tears crying with laughter as the pyro's body fell through the air and made the "squish" splat noise. Such a sight is unheard of in any other game and is quite common in this game. I am not a Tf2 fanboy, as I have grown up playing games like the Halo series my whole life since before I was 5, and playing CoD for a few years. I can easily say Halo is a very fun game, but that is another story. You will never find another experience like the ones you find in Tf2 nearly all the time every day, there is much laughter to have and enjoy in this game. 10/10 Is gud stuff. -Heavy

review: Team fortress 2 has quickly grown to one of my faverite games faster than any other game, besides Red Dead Redemption XD. I simply love and sometimes hate this game. This Multiplayer/Co-oprative game is extremly fun with the friends and many more to be made! My friends and I are simply in love with this game as it can be very interesting/Extremly fun to play. TF2's comunity is very dedicated and has been here for 7 to 8 years. The comunity always is alive and is no matter what gonna be here. Untill Valve learns to count to 3 I mean (TF2, Portal 2, Half life 2, Left for dead 2...) ! So I Really Recommend This game to everyone and anyone in general!

review: This game is the very best ive been playing it for a long time and im not even the tiniest bit board. This game mixes random with medevil and future kinda stuff. It has alien robots which I call the that cause the music. And 9 classes which are all very unique in personality and game wise. Hats, sprays, christmas presents(Item Find). Its amazing! ITS A AMAZING GAME ITS FREE?!?!??!?! WHY IS IT FREE?!?!?!! I hope they keep it that way but this game doesnt seem like a free game. 10 out of 10 stars for me.

review: When I was growing up in the white trash apartment complex in the 90s, I often spent my days playing outside. I would catch toads, fish, and bugs and often keep them as pets. One day my mother burned my face with a cigar. A few years ago my brother and I were fishing. We caught a catfish and as we were cleaning and gutting it, we noticed a pair of human infant feet in the catfish's stomach contents. More importantly, this taught me a valuable lesson about not running on floors covered in ice or human excrement.

review: Nice free-to-play online game from Valve, that based on a team work. You can play for one of 9 classes: scout, soldier, demoman, pyro, heavy, engineer, medic, sniper, spy. Every class has its special limitations, capabilities and features. Universe of a game is crazy, comic, kind of funny, bloody, violent, enthralling. By the way, this game also famous for it's variety of hats.

review: This review is split into sections, using numerals to show each section. All in all a 10/10 game. You should be playing this right now. I There are several game modes: CTF (Capture the Flag or briefcase in this game), TDM (Team Death Match), FFA (Free For All Death Match), Control Point (Capture and Hold Controls Points), King of the Hill (One team, or player must defend a single Control Point to win), and Payload (a team must push their bomb to the enemy base in order to win). Graphics are cartoonish. Gameplay is very well done, and holy crap is it fun. Bugs almost nonexistent. Hat Simulator 2 II Gameplay The maps in the game are near perfectly balanced, not giving any team any type of real heads up. There are plenty of weapons, and cosmetics to choose from. It is considered that the default weapons are the best weapons, but each is entitled to their own opinions. There are a large number of maps, and a large number of other content available to the players. There are many items in the game that were created by the community itself, including maps, weapons, and cosmetics. Choosing random game modes/maps will always give you a different map every time (after 40ish hours you might have seen every map rotation), weapons can be earned through achievements, or by purchasing their variants through the market place. Valve does give you an option to switch to their beta maps as well, which of course are being tested by the players who choose to do so. The gameplay is fast paced and very logically developed, and due to its cartoonish graphical style it is very much enjoyable. III Free to Play Vs. Paid to Play The game is indeed Free to Play, but if you receive any item drops, you are unable to use them/sell them. Unless of course you purchase an item from the Team Fortress 2 website, or from the MarketPlace. Purchasing an item gives you many more slots in your backpack for items, and removes all restrictions of Free to Play. All in all a 10/10 game. You should be playing this right now.

review: Quite a nice game. Sorry for jumping on the bandwagon, but here's the positives and negatives. Positive: -BIG community. Even in 3 in the morning you have 1000 servers full of friendly people. -No OP weapons. Even though some people complain, the developers makes sure that no matter how much money you spend in the game, everything is equal. -Flexibility. Whether you want to trade in a minecraft mod, kill idle people in a box, or hook onto walls and be superman, you've got it all. -Cool feature like CONGA and a frying pan. Negative -You will encounter rude people. Whether with micspam, spawncamp, or scammers, not everyone is nice. -Tryhards. By tryhard I don't mean someone who's good. I mean someone who is bad but pretends/try to be good. They sometimes rage and spoil the fun for them and other people. -(Sometimes)Developers hat focus too much on making money, not content. In the recent End of The Line, the only weapon they promised was useless, overpriced "Ducks", canceling the map, and not giving the community enough for their hard work. I'm not trying to hate on Valve, but sometimes they are dissapointing. Overall, since it's free, go ahead, try it out. You might encounter some ups and downs. Don't rage. These are my personal opinion. True or False, I hope you enjoyed my point of view. -Toaster

This game is my most played game on steam, There's so much to do, If you are into trading you could just focus on that, If you just want to have fun with friends then you could just join a server and have fun. People say that "Commpetetive" doesn't exist in Team fortress 2 but it sure does. People also says that "Teamwork" doesn't exist in Team fortress 2 but it also surly does. This is atleast one of the best FPS games out there. Hat Simulator 2, I mean... Team Fortress 2 gets 11/10

review: Team Fortress 2 is always hard to start off. I remember starting and dying constantly but still enjoying it. Eventually I got better and started learning other things like Rocket Jumping and Trading. With all the classes, weapons, maps and gamemodes I never get bored. And they keep bringing more out! There's also all the mods and community made gamemodes such as saxton hale or super smash bros. I would definitely reccomend this to anyone who has a PC. I play on a laptop and from time to time it can lag, but nowhere near as bad as some games and it's still playable. Unlike other FPS games like Call of Duty, the classes in this are just hilarious. They have each of their own personalities and just say some funny stuff while your playing. With the fact that you can still kind of customize your character with all the hats and cosmetics they keep adding, and keep the actual character is great. There's also the Halloween - Scream Fortress (which I'm enjoying at the moment) and the christmas - Smissmas. This is by far my favourite game today and I don't intend to stop playing it anytime soon.

My favourite weopen is the tide turner , that is why i would like to see a new shields , maybe something like .... it does fire damage on impact or ... when charge you fly up in the air and smashes down on people.you must also make something for the engineer ..... it is a drone that the engineer can take control of... and dont stop making selley hats .. i like it. you guys can also try to make team fortress 3.. thanks for reading valve.. bye

review: Originally, I downloaded this game simply for content in Garry's Mod, thinking I would never take interest in it and play it. I made a mistake. I started playing it in early September, and I'm very glad I did. Everything about it is so loveable. The less realistic, stylized art style, the map design, the gamemodes, the variety of the classes, (the satisfaction when you kill a really good player), weapons, hats and outfits, and the constant stream of community made items! In my opinion, it is far better than other FPS games on the market, and it's free! Without a doubt, I recommend this game to anyone who wants exactly what Team Fortress 2 has to offer, or someone who simply wants a game to be addicted to!

review: Honestly, this game is literally one of the best games created. I can't get enough of it, the economy, the games, the endless posibilities. And I suggest anybody who hasn't tried it at least gives it a go. And although I'm not trying to bash them, they do have one flaw. They need to get their things together in terms of servers. Not dedicated servers, like the ones you play multiplayer on. I mean the item servers, the trading servers, which have both been down a lot recently. It's been starting to get to me quite a bit, as I'm trying to start up a good trading account, however with both those servers down it's literally impossible. All in all though, with everything up and running, this is sheer awesomeness. To everybody at Valve, good job. You've made a game that is loved by almost all who play it. "+rep"

Team Fortress 2 is Free To Play now, so everyone (including Gibus wearers) can enjoy the fun... probably. I'm not that "ermg it haz goats 10/10" guy. Overall, my rating is 9.8/10.

review: This game. Is free. AND BY GOD YOU WILL ENJOY IT! AMERICA!- The BLU Soldier, 1972 This game IS pretty much the most fun you can have online. It's well balanced but still has a lot of variety between characters, weapons etc. and is pretty damn funny too. I mean, you can get a Haunted Haunter Hat! What else do you need to complete your life? And, of course, it's free, and premium is enabled as soon as you buy any item, even one of the weapons costing about 30p, and is with you for life, and enables trading, and by extension the amazing economy the community has built up over the years. To be fair, though, to ultimately succeed in this game you must own hats. Miscs, maybe get some, weapons help too, but seriously, get hats. You wouldn't enter the world's #1 War-Themed Hat Simulator and not buy a hat, would you? So, as we all know hats and, even better, UNUSUAL HATS, improve skill, this game is technically Pay-2-Win. But if you think you can handle the hattening, and you have ANY space left on your computer, get this. There's no reason not to. It's free (UNTIL HATS). And fun. So yeah. Buy it. NOW.

review: This game does it again. The thing i love about Valve games is.....No matter how much you play it,there is countless servers with mods or different game modes,basically expanding the game way beyond it's limits,just like CSS and Day of Defeat,i find myself playing official modes now and then,and the next second i'm already playing some of the weird game modes. I do not really like MvM for some reason,i think it's....just not my style. Plus,this game is ing cursed. I love collecting stuff and hoarding items,so,this game did hit me really hard. I find myself trying to collect more hats,yes,HATS,and when i think i have all the ones i want,A FREAKING UPDATE COMES UP AND BRINGS LOTS OF NEW ONES THAT I WANT TO GET. So,yeah,this game is pretty adictive,i would recommend it,definitely,specially because it is free to play,but be warned,if you pick up speed,this game is just like drugs. It s you up,it leaves you poor and regretting all the stuff you bought in here....But with many little valuables,of course. <3

review: Ok, so I'm an old guy. We used to have to play this stuff for real in the playground of our local school. Man, you don't know problems 'til you've got a bunch of little kids screaming and running from your makeshift flamethrowers and grenade launchers. Anyway, years later, we played Unreal Tournament, which was hella fun and didn't get the police or FBI involved. It looks primitive now like a Ford Pinto looks primitive (or would, if you ever saw one, which you don't). After all this time, I found myself really missing the bloody gibfest of psychopathic entertainment. So I picked up TF2. KILL ME WITH SUPERIOR FIREPOWER. That's all I can say. I get slap-happy and stoopid with adrenaline playing this fragfest of a killing game. I am giddy among the rain of giblets. Screaming bloody hoo-ha as I <crit> shot someone's head. It's almost obscene, the amount of fun I have. And you can have the same kind of fun! Just download the game now and join in! You'll be fragging jokers all day! You'll forget food. You'll forget showers. You'll forget to use the toilet. You will become a single-focus zombie mad murdering death machine, and you'll like it. Rrrraaaawwwwrrrr!!!!1! Then, when it's all over, you will appreciate wee little kittens and otters and whatnot, docile as a flower. Until next time.

review: I started playing this game in the Spring of... what, 2007? That's the year after it came out, right? The grand old days. I remember when spies couldn't take teleporters because the glow would persist even when you were cloaked or disguised, and the only way to refill the invisibility watch was to stand in a corner and hope desperately that nobody was going to turn around. I remember when Pyros had no airblast and Engies couldn't move their buildings or upgrade anything but sentries to level 3. Ahh, yes, that was a simpler time. A time before demoknights and mini-sentries. A time before crates and item drops. A time, by gum, before hats. A time when spies had their mouths crammed full of cigarettes, when wielding the Ubersaw was a mark of excellence, when Spytech provided equipment instead of Mann Co and nobody had heard of Australium. Those were the good old days, the golden years of TF2... You know what? The game's improved a lot since then. Go play it. I still do.

review: F2. This is nearly the ultimate Free-To-Play game on Steam. Second only to Dota 2 in the number of users playing daily. Why is it so popular? Let's take a look, shall we? First off, the obvious: It's free. 100% free. This means its accessible to everyone on Steam. This is just the icing on the cake though. What really shines about TF2 is the game itself. Team Fortress 2 usually consists of two teams (Red and Blue) going head to head against each other. Sometimes fulfilling certain objectives or just downright killing each other. There are many, many maps and modes, such as Payload, Capture Points, and Mann VS Machine. But the general idea no matter the map or mode is to KILL EVERYTHING THAT MOVES! And my god, is it fun to do so. The game has 9 playable mercenaries, each actually being a certain "class". Each class is divided into 3 different roles: Offense, Defense, and Support. Let's go over each role and class. Offensive roles specialize in dealing damage to the opposing team. These are your main attack force. Scouts are the speedy hit and run class, with the ability to double or even triple jump depending on equipped items. Soldiers pack a bit more firepower with their rocket launchers, which gives them not only power, but mobility due to the ability known as "rocket jumping". The Pyro is great at setting the opposition on fire, as well as extinguishing burning teammates using an airblast. Defensive roles serve to inhibit enemy access and to hold enemies back from vital points on the map. Overall, the defensive group has the most firepower of all the groups. Demomen can safeguard areas with stickybombs that they can detonate when enemies come by. Heavies are great for mowing down incoming troops and pushing back forces. Heavies can also keep enemies in an area while whittling their health for teammates to finish off. Engineers can build Sentry Guns for effective area defense, as well as build Teleporters and Dispensers for logistical support of the team. Support classes cannot hold the fight on their own, but their specialized abilities can tip the balance in their team's favor. They offer the offensive and defensive classes an extra edge in battle and can help turn the tide of the game. Whether crippling the enemy advance from behind or keeping teammates healed, the support classes are always handy to have around. Medics are the team healers, capable of providing numerous buffs depending on their equipments. Spies are great for sneak attacks or eiliminating key threats. Snipers excel at long range, also eliminating key threats, as well as extinguishing burning teammates with jarate and providing a damage boost to teammates. Next, let's look at the presentation. TF2 has a very unqiue art style. It's somewhat cartoonish, but very appealing. It's simple, and un-complex. But it doesn't need to be complex. It's simplicity is it's strength. Everything is detailed enough to where you can easily tell whats going on, what a specific model or item is, and they all stand out. The soundtrack is also very appealing and catchy, especially the main theme. I personally have it as a ringtone/alarm tone on my smartphone! :) One of the best aspects of TF2 is the Steam Workshop. Users can submit designs for items and weapons, and possibly have them added to the game! A very lucrative sub-market has also emerged from this game in the form of the Crate Keys. That's a whole different ballgame in and of itself, so we won't get into it here. During normal gameplay on most servers, you can obtain random items, weapons, and sometimes crates, and taunts....through the item drops system. You can only receive so many drops per week, and you will get them randomly as you play. You can use these items and weapons to customise your mercenary's loadout, or you can use them to craft other items, hats, and weapons. You can take multiples of items and craft them into Scrap, then Reclaimed Metal, then Refined Metal. You can then use these metals to craft specific class weapons/items, among other things. The crafting system is simple yet robust, with lots of possiblities. Some of it is very luck based. You can take some very common items and end up crafting a super rare hat or gun worth a lot of moolah on the Steam Market! All-in-all, Team Fortress 2 is just a very fun game. Endless entertainment awaits when you start up this game, especially if you play with friends on your favorite server. Probably the best free-to-play game on Steam.

review: Highly addicting game that doesn't get boring with the different characters and items up for grabs. The various classes have such charming personalities.

review: WOW. This game impressed as soon as I "hit play". It has timeless cartoon-ish graphics that fall right in the boundary line between too animated and too realistic. It has a wide variety of characters, and a lot of items to find, so there will always be a reason to keep playing! Most of the characters are easy to play, but hard to master, so it wont be too difficult to switch characters and play as that one. I reccomend this game to anyone 10 and up. You can turn of the blood, and as long as a kid understands that it's not ok to do any of this in real life, and to keep a positive attitude, he/she should be find. See you in Pyroland!

review: Want a fun, awesome, first person shooter game that is so awesome your face will fall off?, yeah? wait did you just say no? leave. TF2/Team Fortress 2 is a great game and should have atleast the playtime of a minute on each steam account, the community that this game has is amazing and is probably the reason why this game is still one of the top most played game on steam. You can pick from 9 classes each with different play types: Offense Classes: Scout - For the player who wants fast paced action and fun. Soldier- For the player who wants to fly and blow players up! Pyro - For the player who doesnt want to put too much skill in the game but piss off others. Defense Classes: Engineer - For the player who simply leaves it up to the machine to do the work. Demoman - For the player who wants some good ol'fashion melee fighting but can also blow players up! Heavy - For the player who wants alot of power in their gun but also wants to take it slow. Support Classes: Sniper - For the player who just came here from other FPS's. Spy - For the player who reaches level 100 sneak in RPG's and to get set a flame. alot. Medic - For the player who just wants to rage quit from this game for not being protected. (BTW in this game having good aim will help, because hitboxes actually stay with the model when moving <3) If you really want to have fun download this game, right now. It is probably one of the best games i've ever played with countless updates that adds alot. So if you want countless fun download this game and start the insanity that is

review: Team Fortress 2 is the best free-to-play game ever. It is a very addicting game for true gamers. It is very fun. The fun thing is if you play a lot, you will get a drop. But, some thing at the Mann Co Store is expensive. What are you waiting for? Download this game.

review: Easily one of my favourite games ever. Most of the weapons are well balanced, and the combat is absolutely insanely fun. What's more, it's free! (Strictly speaking, you should buy at least one thing from the Mann Co store to get the full fun out of it, but that's like a $0.50 outlay, which heck, you can get with trading cards).

review: THE best game that I have ever played. TF2 Is a class based FPS. The classes are all easily countered and fun. No 1 class is too OP and the range of items that you can find is astounding. Some items help counter the class that counters you which I think is great. This is definitely a game that you want to play.

review: Team Fortress 2 has changed a lot recently, and you know what? In my opinion, it's not getting better. Not any more. Unless Gaben or the community does something about this Free-to-play game, it might just die one day. The servers will be empty, the only ones that will be filled is trading servers and "competitive" servers, which is kind of  in itself. "TF2 was not meant to be a competitive game." Anyway, TF2 has still changed me, sorta. Or should I say, the people I've met has changed me and how I look at the game today. As an autistic little f*ck I am, I loved the competitive community, until a lot of  happened in the UGC leauge, around the seasons 12 and 13. Maybe there's still some  left, who knows. But for a F2P, this game is a great experience, if you want to find out what unbalanced teams and  weapons are, you're more than welcome to join TF2! 6/10, I'm still playing it.

Overal its a fun game with a nice community. its a miracle that it still updates after 7 years! The thing that its free makes it complete. It's not a pay to win, but you do get hat drops if you pay for the game, you can buy it for less than 30 cents! Overal, i recommend you trying this game!

review: An excellent game, one of my favorite online games of all time. It's entirely free, except for hats and weapons, BUT! You can get all those weapons by just PLAYING THE GAME! That's what I did, and even now that I have all the weapons, I can still have fun playing. Also, there's updates every few months that fix balance issues, and add a lot of items (mainly hats). Plus, you can make items in the Steam Workshop that can possibly be ADDED TO THE GAME! Incredible, right? Lastly, trading in this game is an immense economy full of rises and drops. Once you get into this trading community, you can make serious profit, and eventually, you can MAKE. MONEY. That's right, you can BUY other Steam games by PLAYING A FREE ONE! Is that not AMAZING? If you aren't downloading this game right this second, I pity what you're missing out on. Over 2000 hours and still going strong.

review: I totally recommend this game to anyone interested. TF2 is a first person shooter... kinda. This game can involve wacky shenanagins, like bumper cars, giant strongman games, silly cosmetics, and watching really bad players. What i really like is that you can get almost a full experiance with the free to play option, with only some crafting, trading, and inventory space being limited. The only downsides to this game are the cost of some items, like keys and paints, and the glitches. Oh the glitches. Although sometimes funny, they can be a real hassle. There are times when you can't join games, have trading errors, are unable to turn or quite, and can only swing your current weapon, glitches caused by using the chat, and anything along those lines. Overall though, this game can be a lot of fun for people of many ages.

review: So... This isn't my first review, BUT, I guess I need to do it again, since the first one was on 40 hours of playing... SO, after a year I get to know 5 things about this game. 1. It's awesome the TONS of nice people, almost every friend I have is from TF2, I can make some mentions, like the best player in my list, is a nice guy with true heart, and soemone that helped me when I was about to kill myself due to a break up with... anyway, other guys, like a teacher from a rocket jump server, that now is one of my best friends, an asian guy... that... well is asian, and a german guy with a profile pic of a girl... xD, you can get to know, I've been playing in almost every kind of server, from a normal valve Control Points server, to a Death Run server hosted by nice admins. Also, you can get to some weird servers, that are full of bots, or idle people, but well, that's something that happens sometimes. 2. Hats... 3. The community is half good, and half bad, I mean you get to know nice players, and some funny servers to just have fun, and other servers to completely destroy the enemy team, but since mannconomy update, now there is another market for all the things you can have and get, BUT you need items to do it, like keys and , and they have prices, and a lot of more things that I don't want to get into it... I mean, yeah I used the market, tf2outpost, and trade.tf, but I don't care about prices or those things, If I want a thing, I GET THE THING, no matters what is the price for it... So I just skip this part, but if you wanna get into it, you will need to use backpack.tf 4. Last thing, this game saved my life, with the friends I got from it, I must say thank you for it, if you have a history, just ing add me and hang me with me for a while, maybe I can even be your new friend (?) 5. Hats.

review: A giant multiplayer game with tons of things to do and dicover. This is not like your ordinaery shooter, no, this is TEAM fortress 2. Work together closely with other classes and find a balance in your team to what is possible and what isn't. Pyro's best tactic isn't walking forward while firing, rather airblast the enemy and use your shotgun. Gets them every time. Soldiers rocket can do splash damage so they hit more while hitting the ground. The community is also rather fun to play with, since there are plenty of nice people. Recommended for anyone age 12+

Well have you just played a game or on a server that had only friendly and repuable people? Well tf2 is just that exept the repuable part xD. This game offers great game play and solid mechanics. If you just think that you're just not that type of pub person who wants to tryhard all the time (Im talking to all of you spam soldiers -_-) valve offers the great system of trading in tf2 where you can explore items and see their true value to others. The game also offers a variety of classes to play as, 9 to be exact. From run and gun to stand still and snipe this truely gives everyone a well - deserved spot to play in. Overall 10/10 IGN Would play again 100% Recomended no reason to not give this game a try since it's free.

review: I was 9 years old... I loved TF2 so much. I had all of Gabens merchandise. I decided to play on a public server on tf2. I couldnt believe it. When I pressed tab, I saw "Gabe Newell". Was Gaben(the lord and savior) really playing on a server with a skrub like me? Gaben sent me a trade request. I quickly took a screenshot to make all my friends jelly. I then accepted the request. "Hey kid, wanna give me all your items 4 this rare item?" he added a Ghostly Gibus. But no, it wasnt any regular skrubby ghostly gibus. It was a new hat. The name read "Gabens Special Hat, for a Special Boy". I knew that this deal was a once in a lifetime oppurtunity. I quickly added all of my 146 items into the trade. "Very good" Gaben said. He hit confirm trade, as did I. Once I got the item, I nearly peed my pants in joy. I asked my friend how much this new item was worth (not that I would sell it, but I just wanted to know). He broke the news to me. It turns out, it wasnt a new hat. It was just a ghostly gibus that had been renamed. I cried myself to sleep that night. When I awoke the next morning, I was surprised to see Gaben standing by my bed, watching me. He pulled out a box out of his pants. He handed it to me with love and care. "Wha-Whats this for?" I asked, almost too afraid to question The Almighty Gaben. "It's a surprise" he told me. When I opened the box, there was a decapitated head in it. "This is the man who scammed you" Gaben said. I smiled in delight. "Thank you Gaben!" I ran up to him and gabe him a warm and tight hug. "Oh, but my boy, the present isnt over" he said. I heard a sound coming from my computer. On the tf2 main screen, I had pending alerts. I clicked on the alert box, and I couldnt believe it. I got all my items back. But something seemed a little strange. I had more items in my inventory than before. I scrolled through my inventory and was amazed to see a whole page filled with unusuals. I went to go put my items in my profile display case, but something seemed to be downloading. I checked what was, and I almost died in shock. It was Hl3. "Thank you Gaben, my lord and savior!" I said. "Anything for a son, my boy". And with that, he flew out the window. Gaben is not life. Gaben, is a WAY of life.

review: Are you sick of how frusturating Call of Duty is sometimes? Are frusturated with almost never getting kills in Battlefield? Are you sick of the conventional fps? Do you just plain want something innovative and non-conventional? If any of the above apply to you, I would strongly recommend playing Team Fortress 2. Team Fortress 2 is literally the definition of a non-conventional fps. First off, you can't sprint and you can't aim down sights (except for snipers). But what you can do is play 9 different distinct classes that all have their strengths and weaknesses. There is the scout, which is a close range mobile class, the heavy, a slow powerhouse and the medic, the supportive healing class just to name a few. TF2 has multiple game modes, such as CTF, King of the Hill, Attack/Defend, Payload, Mann vs Machine and Medieval. If you get bored with that, there are plugins such as tf2 x10, dodgeball, uber upgrades, deathrun, randomizer and prop hunt to keep you busy. TF2 also has a drop system which drops random weapons as you play, so as long as you play you will recieve weapons, rather than having to unlock them like in other fps. However it makes it harder to get all the weapons, but you can always craft and trade for them. Overall TF2 is a really great game and I would greatly recommend trying it out, at least long enough to try all the classes and find the one that fits you best.

review: This. Game. Is. Great. I started playing after some very tragic issues in life, as I slowly became even more of a gamer and an antisocial. To be honest, I only expected a few hours of fun and then I'd be moving on, but, that was not the case. I joined a server, one night, and got sucked in. The class diversity, the community (other than that of the MvM community), taunts, weapons, and most importantly.... Hats. So, while most people think the community is toxic, they must've been in the wrong damned place, because everywhere I have been everyone has been very polite and nice. With one exception, the MvM Tour of Duty community. People there are so damned strict with what they want, as they push through one of the most challenging tasks of getting an Australium weapon. Many of them have ego's larger than the  on a black male, but, some aren't as religiously following this gamemode, and they will mess around if they realize being serious isn't beating the wave. So, other than that, our community is running fine. Team Fortress has fought changing times, and has succeeded. It's the game that you hate to love, but the game you can't put away. 10/10 would play another 1,000 hours and probably will.

Such a cool game! The Day you get the GIBUS!: Hmm is this a hat? Let`s try it on! After you realise that Tf2 is a conga and a hat simulator you want more HATS. Because, well , why not? After 1 month: You love this game so much, you have a single hat and you want more but you realise that you don`t have inventory. You buy a great hat from mann co store and then SURPISE! You get other hat gifted my mann co store because you bought something!! A few moments after you realise that you got those hats: Hmm...I have one hat(Gibus) and these 2 hats. Illuminati triangle has 3 sides. 1+2=3 --Illuminati Confirmed!! Anyway gr8 game m8. 7.357/10-IGN-Best HAT simulator ever made. As an additional information you realise that your money disappeared.

review: As you can tell by my play time I quite enjoy this game. I find it extremely fun. This game is filled with the craziest things. You can grab your minigun, or your sheild and sword. It has nine classes to chose from, all with distinct roles and weapon sets. What is really cool is that it is fun even to the free players. You can get most weapons without having to pay. If you decide to buy anything from the in-game store you are automatically upgraded to a premium account. All you gain from this is more frequent item drops, the ability to trade and other minor things. All in all I think the game is extremely entertaining.

review: This game is great for if you are looking for a team based game. From Medics that can heal your team, to spies that can cloak and disguise as a member of the oppisite team, to the wacky and wide variety of weapons you have at your disposal, this game never gets old. On top of that, there is a large community behind this. An, although broken, economy, and much more. Also, hats. If you are worried about if your computer can't handle this, my 1 year old windows laptop can handle this game on the highest graphics with more then playable frames per second. This game is also not very serious, which, depending on your taste, is a great way of bringing humor to this game. This game gets constant updates with new weapons, features, cosmetics, and sometimes maps. On top of this, you can play this game free of charge! However, the downsides are that this game requires you to buy something off of the in game store in order to expand your storage, you also can't trade until you buy something off the store. This may be a problem for some people that are having a hard time with their money at the moment. This game isn't the most balanced, either. This is mostly due to the wide variety of weapons that are avaliable. Overall, this game is the best FPS i have played in a while, and the only game i have been playing for some time.

review: This is bigger than Phishing. This is bigger than sharking. This is bigger that pocket medics on Heavy. This is bigger than turtling Engis and Pyros. This is bigger than W+M1 pyros This is bigger than Stair Stabbers And this is bigger than a good spy, combinded.. S+M2 Pyros. Everyday they walk backwards and airblast everyone. The airblast you in a corner and just keep you in a corner. Laughing. Hi i'm Sarah Palubigboilen. Do you believe S+M2 Pyros are a problem? Donate today, and together we can hire Engi's to build up some sentries and kill them. Everyday they airblast innocent Heavies and Snipers in a corner.. Mocking. With a simple donation of 1 rec, we can help stop this today. If you donate in the next 24 hours, we'll send you a picture of a saved Spy. Together we can save the mercs from the S+M2 Pyros, and stop this horror. So please, donate today. In the aaaaarms oooof an aaangeel. Fly awaaaaaaaaay.. from here. From this daaaaark cooooold hotel room. And the emptiness that you feel. Just call 1-800-uwot-mate today, and you can save these poor mercs from this abuse. Thank you.

review: If you can't afford games like Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare, Or Counter Strike: Global Offesive, then this game is for you! Why you ask? Well its a great game overall, because its a cartoony shooter what more can ask? it's not like those games with fancy graphics like Tomb Raider, COD: Advanced warfare, Bioshock2, Portal2, Etc. So I suggest you add this game to your library and give it a try :)

review: I used to love this game, I sucked over 1,000 hours into it... However, given its current state. I honestly can't reccomend this game at all. The first thing I want to check off the list is the community, trade this and trade that. I honestly think the community is awful (still no where near as bad as CoD's) but I hate the fact that I can't play a simple game without getting trade requests up the . Even when I play with my friend, all he does is go "DUDE, LEWK AT MY BRAND NEW UNUSAL! ISN'T IT COOL!!! I COULD BE DOING MORE SMART THINGS WITH IT LIKE SELL IT FOR MONEY AND DONATE IT TO CHARITY AND HELP THE POOR, BUT INSTEAD IMA JUST SHOW OFF MY HAT!!!" What a bunch of . Next thing I wanna address is the game play... Which is quite good honestly. However during the 3 years I've played this game, it got pretty boring and lackluster. Not to mention the new weapons they added suck hard. Now, let's focus on the updates... Remember when they added weapons? Yeah. Those things. And yes I know they just realeased brand new weps, but I'm not counting those since they suck . Honestly, they haven't added real weapons in two years, its just hats. Well I'm tired of typing this , so I'll just leave it at. TF2 is an old repetitive barbie dress up game with some guns and violence thrown in. After 3 years I've gotten tired and bored of the game and over all woke up and realized thart I was wasting my money on nothing but some virtual hats, but hey it's free! That's a reedeming factor! Welp, that's my review on TF2. I hope you understand atleast my points and overall what I'm trying to say. If you were offended.. (I dont know why you would be) Remember! It's just a game, that's all my time, folks.

review: I totally recommend this game to anyone interested. TF2 is a first person shooter... kinda. This game can involve wacky shenanagins, like bumper cars, giant strongman games, silly cosmetics, and watching really bad players. What i really like is that you can get almost a full experiance with the free to play option, with only some crafting, trading, and inventory space being limited. The only downsides to this game are the cost of some items, like keys and paints, and the glitches. Oh the glitches. Although sometimes funny, they can be a real hassle. There are times when you can't join games, have trading errors, are unable to turn or quite, and can only swing your current weapon, glitches caused by using the chat, and anything along those lines. Overall though, this game can be a lot of fun for people of many ages.

review: Probably in the Top 10 for my favorite games of all time easily. So many modes, some fun mods... Well structured classes with their own deep backstories. Humorous. Not to mention that the balance and diversity of weapons is great. No overpowered weapons. Trading in this game adds a whole new dimension for some people. I don't trade for profit anymore. Why not give it a shot? It's free. If you take a liking to it I would highly reccommend going premium. I didn't go premium until I hit 200 hours though. It was definetly worth the 49 cent investment. DEFINETLY. I later went on to play competitive tf2, which I found increasingly fun compared to the pubs in which I was dominating the rest of the server. I think valve should add a match making/ rank system in tf2. It would really help the game garner more attention as an e-sport. I think the problem is that with out these built in features, few people know about competitive at all. PLZ VALVE PLZ I give it a pineapple out of a guava

review: This game is in my opinion the most addictive shooter. You have 9 completly different classes to play : Scout, Medic, Pyro, Soldier, Engineer, Heavy, Demoman, Spy, Sniper. Every Class has its own playstyles, which can also be changed by a large amount of different weapons for every slot : primary, secondary, melee. You Don't die so easy in this game, so you can play really hard, long duels against players. But never think you are indestructible. Something could kill you instantly. If you want to learn the game, you need to play it. You need to learn the classes pros and cons. After ca. 100 hrs of playing this game you will be able to learn the game. Give it a try, you'll not repend it.

review: When Team Fortress 2 was released in 2007, it was the result of nine years of development. It's now seven years later, and development hasn't actually stopped. A wealth of gamemodes, weapons, and gameplay adjustments later, Team Fortress 2 is less intricately well-balanced, but is still as exciting and funny as it ever was. Going free-to-play was also a smart decision, I feel, as the expanded player-base means you'll never go without a match. Absolutely recommended.

Team Fortress 2 has 9 different classes to choose from, all with different personalities, strengths, weaknesses, items, and gameplay. There are 8 main gamemodes, but also some other fun gamemodes on different servers. Most weapons that you can buy/find have stats, wich can perform different styles of gameplay and defeats players differently. Team Fortress 2 is the only game I play because its too fun! TF2 is funny, has alot of action, and its a must-play for anyone. The best part? Its free! All you have to do is download it! Good Luck & Have Fun!

As ridiculous as this game seems, the gameplay is still one of the best. Its a balanced shooter with multiple gameplay modes and 9 different unique classes. If the gameplay doesn't capture you, the trading will. Be careful. I recall a time when I spent more time trading than I did actually playing....

When I tried this game (first time), the voice of the "announcer" was so strange I said "I won't be able to tolerate this voice" so I stopped playing basically right after I started. After like, a year maybe I picketed it up again, thanks to "GameDay Iroda". I thought "why not try it again" and boy, after few hours of struggling with... well any class I fell in love. I wasted few hundred bucks on virtual items since then but you know, I don't mind it. This game gave me so many awesome hours and I still like it, I don't know when it will wear off but one thing is for sure: if you haven't played it already just give it a shot (You can't lose anything since it's F2P).

review: Team Fortress 2 is a game you should own. It provides interesting, engaging, well-themed combat with options available for all skill levels from novice right up to professional play. Aside from the actual gameplay, it also provides a place for the collectors and completists with hundreds of miscelaneous items and, of course, hats available for character customisation or straight up vanilla collecting. With as large a community as the one Team Fortress 2 has and as thriving a trading economy too, Team Fortress 2 is a game I can recommend to anyone looking for casual or professional play. And if that fails to convince you, it's free!

review: I played this game all the time. I had good weapons. I had lots of fun. I had lots of friends. I got lots of noscopes. 10/10 It ruins your outside life, It makes your gaming life more cooler. : ) Also Gaben takes all your money for cool hats, keys and stamps (But who actually buys stamps.)

review: I highly recommend getting Team Fortress 2, wheter you are getting because it's free and looking for something new or plan on being a dedicated fan. This is a fast paced action shooter with 9 unique classes to choose from each supporting thier team in diffirent ways.One of the besy shooters out there. And hey, it's free!(Unless you become dedicated and decide to spend your hard-earned cash on items, but the base price is nothing.

Must collect money, but money is hard now' >he sounds sad and I asked him if he ever saw meet the medic to brighten up the mood >when he said no, I gave him the link to the video >he was very estatic and eagerly asking me about the part when the medic put the uber part on the heart >I said heart transplants are possible, but without uber >he got sad again >'Maybe in the future' >He gave me a heavy laugh and said 'THEN DOCTOR, HEAVY WILL WAIT FOR FUTURE' FEW WEEKS LATER >he messaged me saying 'DOCTOR, Heavy will not be fighting until later in the night' >it wasn't until tomorrow he got on For the record, he referenced himself as the 'Heavy' since it's the only class he ever played and it was his steam name >got the message saying ' DOCTOR, Heavy doesn't feel well. I go to other doctors, but they were nowhere near as good as you doctor' >he sent this message when I was already asleep, I have no idea where he lives >last message said 'DOCTOR, Heavy will go now. But do not fear baby men on other team. You are good doctor. With you victory is always good.

I'm sorry. Are you the doctor he was always talking about? You're the only friend in his list. He was always going on about how him and Doctor were best friends and always leading the team to victory. I don't know what he was talking about, but I was happy that he was happy. Whenever he was on the computer he always had this smile on his face, and I've never seen him happier. He always stayed strong because he wanted to be with the Doctor >Thank you for making him happy >I'm selling this computer because we were never wealthy to begin with. If we were, he'd be here right now.

review: This is a well made, stylized, team based first person shooter. Teamwork is needed to win at higher levels of play, though lone wolfing is fine on lower skill levels such as on most public servers. There are 9 classes to choose from. Each class has unique weapons and abilities that allow each to fill a unique roll as part of a larger team. This provides for a challenging and rewarding experience when faced against opponents of similar or better skill levels. There are two official modes of play: player versus player and 'Mann Versus Machine'. Player versus player is a mode where one team of players battles against another team of players. Within this mode, there are different types of maps. Each type of map has it's own objectives for both teams to achieve. 'Mann Verses Machine' is a mode where a team of up to 6 players battles against waves of bots. Players collect money from destroyed bots. The money is divided equally among players in the team and can be used to purchase upgrades and abilities for the next wave of bots. The pay to play sub-mode, "Mann Up", gives rewards upon completing a "tour". In addition to game play, players will randomly receive free items from the game. Some of the free items given out are weapons, hats and crates. Hats can be worn by a class to change the appearance of that class. Crates can be opened with a key. Keys can be purchased from the Mann Co Store or from the Steam Community Market or traded for from another player. Most crates will list which items can be found within them. I really recomended the game :)

review: Probably your best first experience in a shooter, but after playing a lot, you can see it is lacking a lot, and the major things you can notice is : non serious players, bad teammates and then some "good" teammates who can get the kills but are only fragging. I give you an advice : after you reach 1000 hours, quit the game.

The game gets frequent updates and is just filled to the brim with content. The gameplay is fun and fair (for the most part) Every class has a distinctive personality they makes them all unique to each other, which adds another layer to the game.

review: I was only 12 years old. I had played TF2 my entire life. I loved TF2 and it's creator Gaben. I prayed to Gaben everynight for a Unusual Sunbeams Max Head. My father hears and tells me to delete Steam off my laptop. I say no and call him a weeaboo. He slaps me and mutters "I don't even know what that means..." I cry and fall asleep. When I wake up my body feels...funny. I pull down my pants and out of my  emerges Gaben! He tells me: "This is GabeN. Go to sleep. It'll be all ok. When you wake up, you will recieve every item in TF2 in your backpack." I complied and closed my eyes. It was hard to fall asleep, due to GabeN constantly moaning and pounding my . I screamed as well. I wasn't scared, but I was very happy. I came all over GabeN's sexy sweater vest. He groaned a sexy groan as he flooded my room with his magic sperm. Then, he performs...THE IRON TIGER!!!He runs to the back of my room. I'm ready. He charges for my butt and jumps. He misses and flies right on top of me. All 9,000 lbs of GabeN suffocated me to death. I died LOL. GabeN is love. GabeN is life. 10/10 IGN recommends

It has 9 classes to choose from (Heavy, Medic, Sniper, ect.), lots of gamemodes (Capture the Flag, Control Points, ect.), humorous voicelines for each of the classes, lots of weapons that you can find at random, and of course, hats to customize your characters. Oh, and did I mention it's free? I highly recommend this to anyone who likes FPS games.

review: Its a great game and I appreciate the 9 years worth of work put into this, but like every game; there are flaws. It's mainly glitches and exploits like the sandvich exploit to get endless points without cheating but this game sets the standards for what a first person shooter should be and if you had a mind you would think the same. Thank you ~Kaifyre

review: In short, this FPS is uniquie. What i mean by that? Most of FPS avaliable to aquire are military shooters. They tend to be really serious one, where having a good killing spree or doing great at playing objective is main thing You focus on, but TF2 isn't that one. It places fun over those two, where in other situations fun was somewhere below. For example when You kill other player in some fancy way and other one from opposing team will see this, then there is good chance that except of trying to kill You, he might give You thumbs up and go his way (but don't start thinking that everyone will do this!). Sometimes players from opposing teams stop to shoot to each other just to walk around and have some fun with voice commands. Yes, I have to agree that "friendliness" appears in many other FPS's but here it's most common. Other than just having fun TF2 offers 9 classes. Hah, You may think its nothing new, but hell no. Each of those classes are allmost completly different, and they allmost always have pretty much good counters (except snipers ofc. Those are always problem in every FPS) And same map and same players, but playing different class will change whole perspective of gameplay (just in this situations 9 games in 1). I can say that TF2 isn't just a one game, It's combination of them! Those are things that will give You completly new experience while playing Team Fortress 2 - Rocket jumping - Sticky jumping - Sentry jumping - Surf maps - Zombie Fortress maps - Dogdeball - Smash bros maps - Death run maps - Trick stabs - Shortcuts for each maps - Even griefing - And many more If You don't know what any of those means, than You should get into Team Fortress 2 right now. So If You are bored of those military shooters out there and want to try something new, than check it out!

review: This game is my life. It has changed me. I have become a pub star and noobs rage quit before i even join. Team Fortress is love Team Fortress is Life. With the help of my highly pretigious group The Shire Brothers we have successully conquered all the pubs and conjoined those lands with those of The Shire. They have tought me that to be the best you have to beat a bunch of noobs so that is what I all day everyday. My eyes have been opened to the truth. This game is the future of our society. I forsee that parents will no longer be excited when their child take their first step rather commend their children on their first killstreak in game or their first strange weapon. I recommend this game to everyone with a open heart so maybe you will see the truth as I have.

review: I think the real credit for this game lies in the balance. Team Fortress 2 manages to make nine different 'classes' intertwine perfectly, like no other FPS I've seen. The classes provide different abilities and skills, which means that the game can encompass a variety of 'play styles' (for instance some people may enjoy the stealth aspect of playing as Spy, whereas I might enjoy building turrets as the Engineer). There are many aspects of the game to be enjoyed by many types of people. Back to balance: all of these classes interact with and compliment eachother perfectly. For example, the Pyro is naturally drawn to kill the Spy, but the Spy is naturally drawn to kill Engineers and Heavies. If played properly, each class has a certain role in the game. However, the Spy can pick up certain items to counter the Pyro, which leads me on to say that even the items available to each class are balanced and intertwined. The only complaint I have is that Valve should impliment a better shuffle system, coupled with a skill-rating system, so that each round, the teams are automatically balanced. There are other free games that impliment such a system, such as Quake Live. TF2 has given me many games in which either my team didn't stand a chance, or the other team didn't stand a chance. Also, public servers are littered with AFK players and noobs, but this isn't really a complaint of the game. Great game. 9/10.

review: Team fortress 2 was originally a game I had disregarded, seeing it as a simple shooter game that wasn't worth my time. I gave the game a try and was fairly displeased it at first, however I came back to the game a year later and my opinion had been turned around completely. In a world of drab, bland and un-stylised modern video games, team fortress 2 stands out like a saw thumb, a unique and flavourful experience that provides near limitless amounts of fun and interesting content. From medieval mode, to Mann vs. machine, this game gives a more enjoyable experience than all other FPS games I have ever played. It runs smoothly, And you can customise the game to your heart's content, with a huge variety of advanced options, downloadable huds, weapons and character skins, sprays, and in-game purchases such as the world renowned hats. The game even has crafting, a competitive scene and 9 completely different classes to choose from. And that's what settled it for me. Each of the classes at first glance are simple, categorised, fill a certain role and 6 of them share identical melee, 4 of them share identical shotgun-secondary's. However, this is the best part, you can change up your loud outs, and become completely different classes altogether, such as the demo knight and battle-engineer. This will keep you coming back for years. The game modes are well thought out, well balanced, and are accompanied by maps that help you figure out where to go, lead you in the right direction, whilst providing enough flavour to be interesting to look at after the tenth time playing on the map, but don't take your eyes of your enemy. The Classes voice actors did a great job making each of the characters fleshed out and entertaining (and for me, especially the soldier and sniper) and each of the classes are well designed, so much so that even from a distance, wherein crazy hats and misc. items, you can still tell who is who and which team they are on, which is fantastic for a lot of people, especially those first getting to grips with the game. Overall, this game is a beautifully crafted First person shooter, that entices you to come back and play more, all for the wonderful price of NOTHING! (of course you end up spending tonnes on hats and keys, but maybe you might get lucky and sell a unusual hat on Christmas day for 91... :P )

review: I would like to say that Team Fortress 2 is awesome. After playing Team Fortress classic and seeing the big difference I noticed how amazing the gameplay is. Just like any other standard first person shooter the world of TF2 is challenging and full of wacky stages both by Valve and the community. The wide variety of items is amazing and the characters are all special and unique. I'll be honest in the beginning I just knew TF2 would be like any other first person shooter, I have come to realize that it is fare from it. What it develops in character it also develops a well balanced and in-depth story line that leaves the player begging for more. The gameplay is smooth and the graphics are above average. There is room for improvement but as far as i'm concerned right now the world of TF2 is amazing so far.

review: This game... where do I start with this game... Probably one of the most addictive FPS games I have ever fell victim to. Now kids, this isn't your average Call of Duty where if you start getting bored you just swap a few weapons around, when you start getting bored in Team Fortress 2 you swap your whole GAMEPLAY STYLE around. The nine classes, Scout (<3), Soldier, Pyro, Demoman, Heavy, Engineer, Medic, Sniper and Spy are all unique in terms of gameplay and style, the voice acting for the nine classes is just plain captivating. Talking about gameplay, you could go from the straight up brawn of the Heavy to the overconfident Spy or to the insanity that is the Medic, you just can't get bored easily! Oh how could I NOT touch on the cosmetics? With most of the people that play this game, it doesn't matter about your skills, all that matter are your fancy hats; make the Heavy look like a bear or make the Scout look like a 1920's milkman, it's up to you as long as you can afford the hatage! 10/10 up to this day is STILL a game I can play daily for a good amount of hours.

review: Team Fortress 2 is a first-person shooter game designed for team playing. In Team Fortress 2, there is 9 classes, Scout, Soldier, Pyro, Demoman, Heavy, Engineer, Sniper, Medic and Spy. If you want to be a Offensive Engineer/Medic consider using Gunslinger/Blutsauger. REMEMBER none of the weapons are DIRECT upgrades for you. The hardest class in the game (in my opinion) is the Spy. It requires very much of map knowledge and acting like your enemies as a disguised Spy, also avoid Scouts and Pyros. Pyros are lethal for almost every class expect the Scout and other Pyros. In TF2, there is several gamemodes, Payload (pl_), Capture Point (cp_), King of the Hill (koth_), Attack/Defend (cp_), Payload Race (plr_), Arena (arena_), Capture the Flag (ctf_), and Special Delivery (sd_). Before an update, you had a hat slot and 2 Misc. slots. After this update, now they are replaced as Cosmetic slots. I personally LOVE the Spy. With his personality of being alone without friends, he has become a French backstabber. With the ability of disguising and sapping enemy structures, he is one of the games dangerous classes if used correctly. Scout has 125hp and is the fastest class in the game. With the arsenal of Scattergun, Pistol and a Bat. Scout has x2 Cap speed. Soldier, he has 200hp . Slower than a Scout. Armed with a Rocket Launcher, Shotgun and a Shovel. Pyro, it has 175hp and has a normal speed of 100%. Armed with an arsenal of a Flamethrower, Shotgun and a Fire Axe. Pyro sets things on fire. Demoman, he's a drunk man with 175hp. He's from Scotland, and has an arsenal of a Grenade Launcher, Sticky bomb Launcher and a Bottle. Demoman has only one eye. Heavy has 300hp, having the highest hp than any other class. Having an arsenal of a Minigun, Shotgun and his own Fists. Heavy is the slowest class in the game. Engineer has 125hp, but being the most weakest class in the game by taking damage very fast than any other class, but armed with his Shotgun, Pistol and a Wrench. The Engineer has also a Construction PDA, what he uses to build, Sentry guns, Dispensers and Teleporters. Any building can be leveled to a maximum level of 3 (expect the Mini-sentry is only level 1). Medic, the most important class in the game. Has the health of 175, and is armed with a Syringe gun, Medi gun and his Bonesaw. Medic has a special ability to regen his health. Sniper, he has 125hp, but can Headshot (same goes for the Ambassador for Spy). Sniper is armed with a Sniper Rifle, SMG and a Kukri. Sniper lives in a van. Spy, he has 125hp (expect for Conniver's Kunai and The Big Earner, Kunai leaves only 60hp and Earner 100) Spy can Backstab, sap enemy buildings built by a Engineer and disguise as a enemy. Spy is lethal with his Revolver, Sapper, Knife, Invis Watch and Disguise kit. The Spy can be invinsible for 8 seconds with the Invis Watch. The Dead Ringer has only 6 seconds of invis time, also can be ONLY activated via enemy damage or fall damage. Cloak and Dagger has the fastest recharge rate, but cannot gain cloak for picking up ammo. Cloak and Dagger recharges when not moving while in cloak or not cloaking at all. After the charges has depleted on the Cloak and Dagger, it will show a silhouette of yourself. I will give this game a rating of 10/10. Happy gaming, fellow gamers!

review: Team Fortress 2 is very fun. It is multiplayer, with servers and it can be against computer too! You can choose different classes to be, like heavy, or spy. It is set in the modern age. There are different goals of a game to choose from.

review: I have spent 128 days playing this game and my lust for hats is still not satisfied. Praise our lord and savior Gaben and the demigod Robin Walker for this gift. If I had to pick one thing about this game that I didn't like it would be the lack of hats. Seriously, more hats.

review: Beyond the world of mortal Mann, beyond the layman's game, There lies a land of rock and sand, of rockets, bombs and flame; Where ruined fortresses rise and soar, where hats are sold in bulk, And all around, without a sound, the spies will slowly skulk. -------------------------- Above the other games it soars, available on Steam, Through shifting tides of Newell's code, a noob or vet'ran's dream. Performing frequent updates, with new promos every day An everchanging arena with so many ways to play. Beneath a sweeping canopy of heat-distorted hue Fight to take the intel, or give some n00bs their due. The Fortress provides many laughs, and after all, it's free! Just make sure you wear good hats, and don't play CoD. So give this class-y game a try, and storm a mighty base; Or cap a point, or craft a gun, or swing a Demo's mace. Kill some 'bots in MVM, or just play TF2. And give Valve's many Source-erors their well deserv'ed due. - ZK, with a little help from Graeme Base

Online is heaps of funs with friends and the classes are extremely unique from one another. you feel like you don't need to buy anything at all to enjoy the full game. Overall an amazing game and completely free to play. i am horrible at first person shooters so coming from a person like me, thats a pretty damn good game

review: I would like to say that Team Fortress 2 is awesome. After playing Team Fortress classic and seeing the big difference I noticed how amazing the gameplay is. Just like any other standard first person shooter the world of TF2 is challenging and full of wacky stages both by Valve and the community. The wide variety of items is amazing and the characters are all special and unique. I'll be honest in the beginning I just knew TF2 would be like any other first person shooter, I have come to realize that it is fare from it. What it develops in character it also develops a well balanced and in-depth story line that leaves the player begging for more. The gameplay is smooth and the graphics are above average. There is room for improvement but as far as i'm concerned right now the world of TF2 is amazing so far.

review: Team Fortress 2 is one of the best "cartoon" action games I have played in a VERY long time. The heavy loadout is just an epic classic. The sniper loadout is one of the ones I used the most, very trustable to use when in battle on this game, and all I can say is, EPIC game. Suggested by me totally :)

review: The best MMOFPS the free-to-play can offer. Lots of content (and constantly updated). Weapons can be dropped during gameplay, so you don't have to "pay-to-win" (and there is no gun that is clearly superior to other or even stock item). The thing you probably will have to pay for are HATS! They rarely offer more than make you look cool, so if it's just gameplay you want, then you don't even have to pay a penny. Class-system is well-covered. there is no strict "rock-paper-scissors" game where one class can be used to counter other (ok, it is, but the countered class still might win if played right). While mechanics are good and rather solid, the game experience might be something else. If you stick to valve servers, it's good. but there are those custom servers on which if you pay, you basically get cheats in-game. AVOID THAT! speaking of custom, there are a lot of user-generated maps, mods etc. that might even expand the gameplay in a ways, that can make even a different game (I recommend Prop Hunt for example). Personally, The game was worth it's money before and now, when it's free-to-play it's totally worth to try at least.

review: This is a well made, stylized, team based first person shooter. Teamwork is needed to win at higher levels of play, though lone wolfing is fine on lower skill levels such as on most public servers. There are 9 classes to choose from. Each class has unique weapons and abilities that allow each to fill a unique roll as part of a larger team. This provides for a challenging and rewarding experience when faced against opponents of similar or better skill levels. There are two official modes of play: player versus player and 'Mann Versus Machine'. Player versus player is a mode where one team of players battles against another team of players. Within this mode, there are different types of maps. Each type of map has it's own objectives for both teams to achieve. 'Mann Versus Machine' is a mode where a team of up to 6 players battles against waves of bots. Players collect money from destroyed bots. The money is divided equally among players in the team and can be used to purchase upgrades and abilities for the next wave of bots. The pay to play sub-mode, "Mann Up", gives rewards upon completing a "tour". In addition to the official modes of play, there are several player made mods that introduce other modes of play such as 'Versus Saxton Hale', where a team of players battles against a player playing as a character named Saxton Hale; 'Dodge Ball', where two teams of players playing as Pyros must airblast rockets and other projectiles back and forth in order to stay alive; 'Zombie Mod', where a team of players must make it to the end of the map without dying to zombies that are played by other players; to name just a few of the many player made mods available. In addition to game play, players will randomly receive free items from the game. Some of the free items given out are weapons, hats and crates. Hats can be worn by a class to change the appearance of that class. Crates can be opened with a key. Keys can be purchased from the Mann Co. Store or from the Steam Community Market or traded for from another player. Most crates will list which items can be found within them. The game has several communities for a player to choose from if a community is what you are looking for. The game is easy to pick up and play, either alone or with friends, yet has a depth of play that will keep you from becoming bored too quickly. The dynamics between the different classes, weapons, play styles, skill levels, modes and maps provides content for many hours of play. I have been playing since November 2007 and I still return to the game on a regular basis.

review: Team Fortress 2 is not only a game based on killing each other, but it is a game revolving around one thing. Hats. Basically, if you don't have a hat in Team Fortress 2, you're not playing it right. You should definetly put something on your head to cover that bald spot. Play Team Fortress 2.

It has a decent supply of maps to keep you going and there is no real problem, there are some nice mods and modes going, there are decent weapons and overal you can get some hours in the game and have fun. When you start unlocking hats and ingame items, you will start getting random adds from people who want to setup trades and that is annoying. The problem is not the game, it is with the community who are hat mad. Overal this game will keep you going for a long and it is now free to play which is great. I suspect a TF3 because of this. Just download and play, you will enjoy this game with a friend or few.

review: This game is my life. It has changed me. I have become a pub star and noobs rage quit before i even join. Team Fortress is love Team Fortress is Life. With the help of my highly pretigious group The Shire Brothers we have successully conquered all the pubs and conjoined those lands with those of The Shire. They have tought me that to be the best you have to beat a bunch of noobs so that is what I all day everyday. My eyes have been opened to the truth. This game is the future of our society. I forsee that parents will no longer be excited when their child take their first step rather commend their children on their first killstreak in game or their first strange weapon. I recommend this game to everyone with a open heart so maybe you will see the truth as I have.

review: This is an amazing game that is very fun (and addicting) to play. A lot of work has clearly gone into the game design, but it would be far better if not for the heavy orientation on microtransactions. The way I've come to see it is this: People spend money, real money, which they put their own blood, sweat, and tears into earning, on virtual (i.e. not real) hats, which they can put on virtual characters in a game where you don't typically see other people up close for over ten seconds. Sound like a fair tradeoff to you? Me neither. Bottom line is, don't buy anything, and this game's a barrel of explosive, bone-crunching fun.

review: maybe you played at launch, maybe not. maybe you were a former player who felt alienated because of all the hats and other nonsense and gave it up. whatever the reason was i recommend returning to this great game. sure it got ridiculous with all the hats and other nonsense but it's still hella fun. i know i was one of those people who moaned and groaned when this game became F2P. but i gave in downloaded and am having a blast. so in short, wanna shoot  up and have some fun? i highly recommend this.

review: There is a set of cosmetics for literally everyone. Aside from being able to wear 3 cosmetic items and 1 action item(Can either be a noise maker, canteen[purely cosmetic outside of Mann vs Machine], spellbook[purely cosmetic outside of Halloween], or taunts such as laughing at enemies or Hi-5ing a teammate) some items are paintable for which you can make it a variety of colors from white to brown to lime green or even simply team colored. Some items also have different styles that can make them look a little different. My biggest gripe are the players who are terrible at the game. Those who never listen to adivce or reccomendation, who use weapons such as the Rocket Jumper or Sticky Jumper for combat, and who just simply idiots.

Then your soul fuses with atron, and you become Don Cheadle. One day you discover your one true love, Teenage mutant ninja rats (betcha thought i was gonna say turtles you gay arab). You decide to write fan fiction for the show and post it to fakku, the world's largest supply of cocaine and hentai. After getting a lot of reveiws based on how good the fanfics were at sexing the rats, you retire and enjoy rolling in your gay hentai money. You marry your one other true love, Charlie Sheen. You give him all your cocaine supply and he says "Thanks m8" and leaves you because your black. After 20 billliongagillion years, you hang yourself and die. Then you download and play Team Fortress 2. I rate this game, (2/17) "Not bad" - Liam Wolf (some gay kid)

review: After playing this game for +900 hours i finally realised that this may actually be the best, most balanced and entertaining game for both casual players and advanced players. Classes means you only need to focus on one aspect of the game at a time, meaning that ideally responsibility is spread evenly throughout the classes. For example it is up to spies to clear sentry nests and get rid of MVP's on the other team to weaken their defences for the ultimate push. Or the humble scout, whos duty it is to wild and harass the other team, spreading them out. And for those people who want a bit more than just casual running, gunning, jumping and stabbing theres of cours the mastery of all classes. All classes are easy to play, but hard to master. And when you do die, chances are its because you werent using the stock weapon, or the opponent was simply better than you. This is strange in the world of F2P games, because normally, 'stock' (default) weapons are considered weaker than the latter ones. Not here. All custom content is either entirely cosmetic or highly situational. TL;DR Team fortress 2 is a well balanced game that hasnt really got that much of a premium/F2P divide and since its made by valve, youre guaranteed to at least run the game. Just dont be quick to rage quit if its your first time playing because no matter what server, there will ALWAYS be someone slightly more skilled than you, offering a challenge no matter the server. If you have friends, have a look at MvM.

review: TF2 is one of the most enticing games I play in Valve's collection of quality games. You play as one of the nine classes in a fight between Red and Blu in a variety of game modes, such as Control Points, Attack/Defense, Capture the Flag, and more. In addition to the standard PvP of the main game, you can also choose to shoot up robots in Mann Versus Machine in bootcamp mode for your entertainment, or Mann Up mode for a chance at prizes and rare items. The game plays so well in its control and physics, using Valve's beloved Source engine. And not only that, the dialogue spoken from the classes you play as are so well done and quite humorous. Another great aspect is that the game is free-to-play. However, this is also part of the game's greatest drawback, and the main reason is that things like bans become meaningless, as you can simply make another account and play TF2 on that one instead. Also, Valve needs to make a profit in order to continue development, which unfortunately causes the inevitable pay-walling. While it's not as drastic as some games are willing to go, this means having items in your inventory and trading are going to be a bit of a pain. Problems aside, this game is one of the greatest examples of the brilliance Valve can do if they get things right.

review: i like this game
game-hours: 909.8
review: This game is full of great things, and it's evident why this thing is so popular! PROS 1: Class based warfare. The fact that this game has gone the class based system really adds some unique flavor to the traditional FPS scene. 2: Additional weapons are not uber powerful upgrades. This is something that works to this game's advantage! Every weapon you get out of luck is more of a Side-grade to your natural weapon which is actually the optimal weapon. 3: Cosmetic customization features DON'T effect the game(mostly). This is something that sets the stage for a lot of F2P games to suck, as most free games you play ask for you to buy what you want to win over everybody else. TF2 doesn't rely on that, and cosmetic items are a great way to show off your own style. 4: The most balanced F2P and modern FPS in the world! Unlike atrocities like Combat Arms(god I hate that annoying ...) the weapons are somewhat more balanced. Not the best balance, but clearly more balanced than the competition. 5: Intense multiplayer mode. this is a dealbreaker for this game! Since the focus is on TEAM play, it's only logical to encourage a great multiplayer mode. The sheer number of multiplayer modes are familiar main stays, all team variations of familiar modes. CTF, Control point, King of the Hill, and even adds some unique modes like VS Saxton Hale, and the user created "Deathrun" and Race modes. 6: Each class has it's own personality! THIS is what can sell games! Each class has their own way of bragging, complaining, cheering, jeering, etc, the emotes really bring this home, it conveys a great personality for this game as each character is drastically different! No two classes play the same, and their personalities are actually hugely different. CONS(This list was a LOT harder to come up with than you think) 1: the blance is not perfect. A somewhat minor issue, but what can you expect from a game with so much good going for it? The problem is, there's not really a way to avoid being one hit killed by a demoman grenade, a sniper bullet, or a spy backstab. what about making Soldier's rocket launcher a one hit kill weapon? Or at least follow through the "Direct hit with a rocket means instant death" deal? I know there's a weapon called "The Direct Hit" which has increased rocket damage, but it's not the same as a rocket with a decent blast radius like Quake 2. 2: Lacking in single player modes. It lets you play on maps you're familiar with, but if you picked up maps online, there are no bots to play against you. Of the more fun maps, there are Balloon race, and Wacky Races, which are the ebst user-made maps to date! These maps could use some bots running around for the thrill of it! Just in case you lose your connection or want to practice alone. The lack of a story mode is also a problem, what if I want to play alone and enjoy a story? Or even a more fleshed out tutorial that helps me learn how to counter classes against me using certain mechanics. A single player campaign with some old school flare would do this game a lot of good for solo players. 3: Inability to host games yourself on your own computer. This seems to be a trend with a LOT of games hosted on Steam. If you've not paid to host your own private server, you can't play exclusively with your friends. I remember old school LAN parties where players could make their own servers using their own computer to host their games. Why not do that for TF2? It's not impossible. 4: Not enough customization/cosmetic slots. Some things look amazing together, and some things are too cool to shelve. I would personally love to show off all my badges and medals at once, while flaunting hats, costume, and other cosmetic pieces, but there's not enough slots for them. 5: No "Gender equality". The lack of female versions of characters is kinda depressing. Given the timeline of the game, it's not surprising, but it isn't really that big of a deal. It's actually historically accurate which is very good. This is only really a major gripe if you want to play through gender equality. The only character who is androgynous enough to fit either or both male or female roles is Pyro, but that class is a lunatic engrossed in a fantasy world of balloonicorns and cartoony horns that shoot rainbows instead of spewing firey death! 6: The presence of jerks and griefers. This is a personal player to player concern, and not really Valve's fault. Griefers are going to walk in and cheat or exploit their way to claiming they have "MVP status" or "Top MVP". These toxic abusers of the game, including "Squeakers" plague the game. If there was a "report Micspam/Squeaker" function that muted a player on a server for the benefit of everyone who voted to mute them on every server, it would be great. Simply muting them doesn't lways help, as some of these toxic players simply logout, then rejoin the map to get around being muted. The Pros are huge compared to how minor the Cons are, but I recommend this game! At least until the CA fantards start crying for Sniper to be godmoded... I hate being picked off by a sniper... Rockets need to be a top damage one hit kill on quishy classes weapon.

The way I've come to see it is this: People spend money, real money, which they put their own blood, sweat, and tears into earning, on virtual (i.e. not real) hats, which they can put on virtual characters in a game where you don't typically see other people up close for over ten seconds. Sound like a fair tradeoff to you? Me neither. Bottom line is, don't buy anything, and this game's a barrel of explosive, bone-crunching fun.

review: This is a great first person shooter suited for teens with an interest in more than jsut shooting, when playing tf2 you are offered things such as hats and shirts that make the experience more enjoyable. The community is always nice and willing to help you in times of doubt or need.

review: I'm doing this for a badge. TF2 kicks SOOOO much ! Although the community whines too much about updates and weapons. Team Fortress 2 is a lot of fun, but there are a lot of annoying players that don't realise you don't wanna trade your only valuable weapon/hat, or are 4 year olds with mics that yell, " YOU FREAKING HACKER!! I'LL SKEWL YOU!!!" Yeah, that's annoying. All the classes are balanced out to fight each other equally, though people whine a lot. *COUGHCOUGH THE GUYS WHINING ABOUT THE DEMO/HEAVY NERF COUGH* I will admit that I get annoyed by skilled Pyros that endlessly hunt you down, or spawn camping Engineers, or Demoman sticky bomb spammers. But this game is amazingly fun even though the community whines too much. The graphics are great and cartoony, the characters are fregging hilarious, and the weapons are mostly balanced

review: This game..... I have a policy in life. Never spend money on a F2P. I have sunk in $50 on this game for what?! Hats! Stupid, worthless, digital, hats! I could have gotten a new game or multiple indie ones for the same price but this, this evil, cruel, monstrosity of a game just did what it does to everyone. It starts off as a unasuming F2P. Its fun and a nice break from all of the Call of Duty clones out there. At first all you want are the weapons. Then one day you get it..... The Ghastly Gibous. Everything changes. Suddenly nothing matters in your life. By this point you are already adding all of your money on to steam to buy the latest and newest hats. It is no longer a game anymore. It is your second life. Your BETTER life. Life just becomes the flavourless sauce that takes up the extra space in the real flavour which is you and your hat collection. By this point the game has taken full hold in you. You are powerless as you watch your funds go down and down, only to go back up as you add "just $2 more I swear". But it's never just $2. Its 2, then its 5, then its, 10, then its 20 and on and on and on. Then one day it hits you. No one talks to you anymore. You are out of money. Your only friends are your hats. And worst of all. You are fine with it. You dont need them. It wont be long before they all submit..... 10 out of 10 would ruin life again

review: Fun game, at times. If you love hats and wasting your money you will love this game. A little to fremium to my liking. For instance I stopped playing around 6-7 months ago and didn't boot it again till about a week ago, looked at the store, found NO new weapons but an ASSLOAD of hats. Didn't realise Valve would reduce this game to a money making front. Overall get the game if you like hats, dont get it if you like the objective

review: Possibly one of the worst ports on Mac in our human existence. Load times that go on for 5-10 Minutes+. Framerate dipping down to 5 very often, but the average is maybe 15-20 FPS. This is odd considering how my machine can run Dead Space completely smooth on the highest settings, via a Wineskin port, meaning that the performance is even worse than what a native port would be. Sadly I can't speak for the game itself, why? BECAUSE OF THIS ING PORT.

GO SNIPER? Like scare the  out of everybody? GO PYRO... OR HEAVY. Like beeing helpful ? Go Medic. And thats the thing. Its not only one dude that run normal and have normal health. Its 9 absolutely diffrent classes. 4.Diffrent Gamemodes 5.Diffrent maps 6.A lot of players to have fun with. 7.A lot sfm movies. 8.Have diffrent weapons.... not only skins (talking about cod) 9.Is the goodest part: ITS FREE!

Whether it be capturing a flag, taking controll points, or even pushing a payload equipted with a bomb! Different loadouts mean more possible combinations to rule everyone! This game is by far one of my favorite games ever made. On a scale of 1-10 I have made some of my opinions.

review: This is a well made, stylized, team based first person shooter. Teamwork is needed to win at higher levels of play, though lone wolfing is fine on lower skill levels such as on most public servers. There are 9 classes to choose from. Each class has unique weapons and abilities that allow each to fulfill a unique roll as part of a larger team. This provides for a challenging and rewarding experience when faced against opponents of similar or better skill levels. The game has an active dev team that continues to release updates to the game that add new content such as weapons or game modes. At the time of this review, there are two official modes of play: player versus player and 'Mann Versus Machine'. Player versus player is a mode where one team of players battles against another team of players. Within this mode, there are different types of maps. Each type of map has it's own objective or objectives for each team to achieve. 'Mann Versus Machine' is a mode where a team of up to 6 players battles against waves of bots. Players collect money from destroyed bots. The money is divided equally among players in the team and can be used to purchase upgrades and abilities for the next wave of bots. The pay to play sub-mode, "Mann Up", gives rewards upon completing a "tour". In addition to the official modes of play, there are several player made mods that introduce other modes of play such as 'Versus Saxton Hale', where a team of players battles against a player playing as a character named Saxton Hale; 'Dodge Ball', where two teams of players playing as Pyros must airblast rockets and other projectiles back and forth in order to stay alive; 'Zombie Mod', where a team of players must make it to the end of the map without dying to zombies that are played by other players; to name just a few of the many player made mods available. In addition to game play, players will randomly receive free items from the game. Some of the free items given out are weapons, hats and crates. Hats can be worn by a class to change the appearance of that class. Crates can be opened with a key. Keys can be purchased from the Mann Co Store or from the Steam Community Market or traded for from another player. Most crates will list which items can be found within them. The game has several communities for a player to choose from if a community is what you are looking for. The game is easy to pick up and play, either alone or with friends, yet has a depth of play that will keep you from becoming bored too quickly. The dynamics between the different classes, weapons, play styles, skill levels, modes and maps provides content for many hours of play. I have been playing since December 2014 and I still return to the game on a regular basis.

review: Basically a good first-time-game, if you want to play shooting games. Graphics are unique when you compare it to other pvp games. A big shop with a lot of clothing and free weapons makes the game more interesting, in a way that the users can get creative and style their own characters. Nine classes, makes the game more challenging and less boring, as you can just switch class when you feel like it. The videos about the characters and their histories are absolutely terrific and the medic is something you don't see in every game, as you heal with a medic-gun and shoots with this incredible "syringe shooting gun", where in other games it's often a character with a medic-back and often with normal (often normal) guns or in use of some type of magic. Also is the game always active with players and new products in store. In all is the game catchy and available for everyone.

review: Team Fortress 2 is a solidly constructed online FPS experience. It's fully playable right when you open the game, with no deceitful tricks to empty your wallet. It also uses the Source Engine, so your game will probably run pretty smoothly, even if you have a  PC. TF2 offers 9 distinctly different classes to choose from, and hundreds of customizable loadouts available, so you are bound to find your own playing style. The community is great, and definitely not as hostile as in some other games (ahem, DOTA). In addition, there's a large sense of collecting to do in the game, with hats and unique weapons to trade for. If you ever become bored with your regular pubs for some reason, you can always get into competitive play, which will surely keep you interested. All in all, Team Fortress 2 is a fantastic title that players are bound to enjoy.

review: Team Fortress 2 is one of the best first person shooters I ever played. With 9 different classes, alot of weapons, a variety of gamemodes, and plenty of HATS!!! I would recommend this game to anyone who love to shoot, explode, or burn other players. The only things I dislike in this game are the hackers, scammers, and trolls. But you rarely find them. But if you do they will get banned or kicked. If you bought any other games from steam you may get free items. So this would be a great game for gamers who love austrilian snipers, french spies, russian heavies, and american soldiers. (The game is free to play so what are you waiting for.)

review: Don't play this game. You might think it's an award-winning FPS, but it's actually a high school--cliques, man, CLIQUES. There are the traders who try to make money off of this game, the gibus F2Ps, the comp snobs (I'm one of them), the comp superstars, the too-good-for-pubs people who pubstomp, the people who make videos, and the modders. There are also hackers, scammers, phishers, spoiled 12-year olds and all around s. Wait--wait what? You mean every online FPS is like that? Oh. Oh. Nevermind. Play this game. The hats are pretty silly.

review: Very interesting and fun free to play (f2p) first-person shooter! The choice of 9 classes makes it a very flexible and fast paced gaming experience! A Premium account is easy to achieve for new players by just spening a few cents on the Mann Co. in-game store. Premium is not a must have though since this game is based on skill>hats. The community is friendlier than any other comms i saw yet! There are also very good guides for new and advanced players in the guide section but sadly also a lot of troll guides. Lastly i recommend this game to every first person shooter fan and for people who likes to have fun in a gun game since there can be really hilarious situations coming up! May the hats be with you!

review: Before I started tf2, my life was a dark pit fulled with hatless misery every waking moment of the day. The first moment I walked out of spawn on 2fort, I saw a teammate offer me a high five. From that moment on, I knew i was never going to put this game down. 1100 hours and counting later, Team Fortress 2 fills up the majority of my time, whether its messing around on pubs, trading hats for even better hats, or playing with my Highlander team, Team Fortress 2 is truely the most fun you can ever have with an online game. 11/10 would reccomend

review: Team Fortress: The Sequel to Garry's Mod is a game dedicated to transforming the point-and-click adventure game scene forever. Revel in the true (cel-shaded) warlike experience all the while sporting an expensive, fancy fedora that resembles the one you own in real life! Face irrational people as they yell and assume to their hearts' content as you stand by bewildered that such people even exist! Your options within the game dictate how the story plays out, giving YOU the ability to wear a hat and create a dynamic story for you and your wacky friends. Select from a wide range of options in dialog such as: "I don't like you person 1" "I don't like you person 2" "jesus christ shut the  up seriously who the  argues this much over nothing?" "" Also I think there are some zombies in this game.

review: First of all. The community is one of the worst i've seen in an online game. What tf2 needs is an unskippable tutorial or something. The servers are filled with people who don't even know the basics of the game. Like that you have to capture and defend controll points and that you need teamwork to succeed(you know...in TEAM fortress 2!). Also, there are way too many pointless cosmetic items compared to equipable weapons. But still, if you happen to find players who know what they are playing, it's very recommendable. Also, you need to ignore trading. There's some stupid economy run by fat neckbeards going on, ignore it.

And as of characters there are: Scout, Soilder, Spy, Demoman, Engineer, Pyro, Sniper, Heavy, and of corse, the medic. Personally, I like the egineer, medic, and the scout. Now I'm not gonna go into detail, but just know you'll have a fun times, or bad times whenever you're ing dominated. But if you keep at it, you'll become good. Just takes some time. Okie anyways this game is awesome, and I tottaly recomend it if you're looking for an awesome F2P game.

review: 10/10 Hat Simulator. In all seriousness though, a very fast paced multiplayer shooter game with some of my favorite visual styles. The voice acting in this game gives each and every character a personality which you don't see in other multiplayer shooters, I'm looking at you Call of Duty... If you do get bored in this game there are so many other game modes that you probably have not tried out yet, and if you have played those and are bored then trust me, whether you want to or not you're going to get started back up. I give this game a solid 9.3/10

review: Team Fortress 2 can be an entertaining multiplayer game in the right hands. TF2 is a TEAM BASED game and is required newcomers to realize that there is more to it than trying to keep yourself alive. It really becomes frustrating to veterans when newcomers can't grasp the concept out of the bat. Essentially, teams are pitted against each other where one team's veteran/F2P ratio is rather uneven. It's flawed system with every game, it can't be helped. The game uses an item drop system along with an inventory to provide players selection of weapons to choose from. The weapons that are unlocked/found provide different playstyles for all the characters. There is no "best" weapon in the game but it's rather how you use the weapon that will help you succeed. Sadly, not all weapons play fair which some might call "OP". This doesn't contridict to the "best" weapon statement eariler. Like I said, the weapon in the hands of an inexperienced player is hardly OP. Along side weapons, players can customize their each class with hats and miscs. These items are purely cosmetics and don't affect the combat in anyway. That said, the community has become ravid with the introduction of hats, putting real money on buying/selling virtual items which outright absured. Hats are label as Dirty/Clean and the rarest and expensive hats are called "Unusuals" which look like normal hats but with a special particle hover over it. The way I see the trading community is just pathetic but that's the just Apples and Oranges. Nonetheless, Hats/Miscs are a fun addition, the community is not. With TF2 being F2P since 2 years ago (as I write this), Valve uses microtransactions as an alternative to the pay $20 for the whole game system. It allows Valve to continue making revenue off the game. The good news is....TF2 isn't pay to win. All the weapons can be easily unlocked/found/traded. Players can buy weapons if they don't have the patience for one but there is no advantage to do so. There are exclusive items that can only be bought but these help with customizing your hats/misc or used to obtain variation of items such as Strange or Unusual items. It's a pay for convenience but in no way, Pay 2 Win. Overall, give the game a try. It's best to start with the training mode first and move on the real servers. It's not a game for everyone but there is only one way to find out.

review: I do not why i'm doing this but here are my thoughts on TF2 and how i've seen it develope within the past 3 years of which I have been playing it. Team Fortress 2. It used to be nice. We got new weapons. We didn't get crappy hats or dumb cosmetics It was a joyous time. Then it was after the Pyromania update when I saw things going downhill, Meet the Pyro was awful, the Tomislav was nerf into oblivion, Scout got the stupid Baby Face's Blaster which is now stupidly Overpowered from a recent update, the Pyromania update however, was the biggest bunch of weapons we've had since the moment I am typing this. In the summer of 2012 maybe 2 months after the Pyromania update we did get 3 new weapons, The Huo-Long Heater for the Heavy, The "Gimmick" Guiliotine, and the stupid Neon annahilator which only works on 2fort basically unless you have a scout with you running mad milk or a sniper throwing piss everywhere. Since this update we have not had a new weapon since. And I mean an actual weapon with stats, not dumb reskins. The robotic boogaloo was supposed to be the first community created update and it was a F***ing disaster, as if getting nothing but weapon reskins wasn't bad enough we got hat reskins that are as cheap as dirt now because no one likes them. Great job with the first community update Valve. 90% of the hats from the halloween update SUCKED, all the nice ones weren't added in such as the Bull head for the Heavy. INSTEAD OH HURR DURR WE GOT THE "IVAN THE UNEDIABLE GHOST SANDVICH" and all other classes got  hats, the list just goes on and on. Now with this Christmas update, I was a brainless fool to even think we had a possibility of getting new weapons. Instead we got a buff for the Soldier which weren't even needed because soldier is a stupid enough class as it is, all you have to do is shoot the god-damn ground and you deal nearly 100 damage. This Christmas update was terrible. All we got are dumb Festive weapons and hats that I bet look like crap. R.I.P. TF2 You were fun. Also. I don't give a single F*** if you like TF2 getting absoulutely no weapons. Don't comment on this giving me a reason why TF2 can't have no weapons. You're literally taking your time and throwing it in the garbage just like how Valve has done the exact same to Team Fortress 2.

There are so many things you can do in TF2, rocket jump, kill people, and so many more but I am not going to list time all because this would be the longest reveiw ever, but I would recommend to play this game for some multiplayer fun. If I were you and want to start to play TF2 I would watch every meet the class because it just gives you an understanding on what every class does and how they play.

review: Ok. So after having over 1000 hours on Team Fortress 2. Yes im still enjoying it, but not as much as i did with i first started playing, Why you may ask. Well is because 90% of the community are utter . All they seem to care about is who has the better hat or how much is this or that worth. The remaining 10% are split into another 2 smaller catagories 5% being new and not knowing about the massive trading economy that this game has and the other 5% just generally not caring about it. I will still recommend Team Fortress 2, Its a free game that is enjoyable to play, but you lose intrest eventually when you realise what the community is like.

review: Team Fortress 2 is an interesting game. I don't mean it in a bad way. With rewards for playing, it's nearly impossible to stop. I give this game a 99.9/100. I docked .1 points because there's no team deathmatch mode. BUT IT IS STILL AWESOME. Edit: There Is A TDM. .1 point restored. :) Edit to my Edit: There is not a legitamate TDM Map. (Still 100)

review: Think about a multiplayer game. It has weapons, it has different classes, it has different abilities for every classes, different weapons for every classes, it has different modes, special events, many many maps for multiplayer, it has pretty fun co-op mode, it has customization (which is not affecting game balance at all). And everything about characters, TF2 universe is hillarious. This game has everything. Just give it a little time, then you will not able to stop playing it. I guarantee it.

Thats cool. now, with the game play. Any body who would play CoD, and not this, is dumb. This is by far, the best FPS I have played to this date, with more strategy than "I shot first." 17/5 stars from me!

review: The way you interact with players using the quick voice commands and do Sandvich parties is priceless, and I made lots of friends thanks to this game and its awesome servers. What I like is that, apart from being Rambo and kill all enemies, you could even stay with your teammates for fun and do stuff like high-fives and other taunts. No wonder there are also servers made just to hang around with people instead of only killing enemies. And of course, like in many other popular games, you may meet kids/dumb people sometimes so you should ignore them and move on. The TF2 characters by themselves are both brutal (when you kill enemies and dominate them) and funny, especially because of the awesome voice actors. You can play this game both competitively in versus modes or cooperatively (wave-based survival mode), not to mention this is highly moddable and you can always look for something different to keep your experience always fresh. And there are many items to unlock, LOTS of them (not only hats, but weapon and miscs). Definitely worth a try, also because it's free. Hell, I even paid full price for this when it wasn't F2P and it was worth every penny. Oh, and  microtransactions.

review: Team Fortress 2. Everybody knows it in the meantime. It's a good comic-style shooter and it has a lot of funny stuff in it, such as voices, jokes, etc. etc. What can I tell about this game? The game is part of the Orange Box, one of the most successful games Valve made, besides Half-Life of course. Play as 1 of the 9 classes. There are 2 ways to play too! Just play with people and shoot all the enemies you see OR you can go afk in an idle-room and farm items, which is just a waste of time, in my opinion. Team Fortress 2 wasn't free in the beginning, it was around 20 and you'd get Garry's Mod and Portal with it. It was a nice game, fun, kind people. There were a lot of equal and skiled players, but there was a limited amount of maps. like 3-5 maps only! Suddenly Valve decided to make it Free-to-Play and noobs visited the game. Now the game is full of idling players, grinding for items, buying hats and crafting them. The game is not about the shooting anymore, it's about hats. My opinion since they made it a Free-to-Play game: It was good, now it's a useless game. Luckiy there are still players left that actually play. Yes, it's fun to look cool and impress other players with your hats, gloves, necklace or whatever, but that is not what the game is about. Rating: 6/10 If it wouldn't be Free-to-Play and the shooting was still the main purpose of the game, I would give it a 9/10. Now it's just a fun game for a couple hours and getting hats which you never use, since you don't actually play matches. Still worth a try though. Do notice that you cannot trade items, unless you bought at least 1 item with real money in the store.

review: So after playing some more TF2, I've come to list the following: 1. Hats 2. If you don't own hats, you're bad at this game ( Somebody actually legitimately said this to me ) 3. People will do anything to scam you 4. Prepare to be criticized for being a F2P player, it doesn't matter if you're better, if you top the scoreboard, have rare items, or a $1,000 hat. If you're F2P, it automatically makes you a bad player for some reason, even if the person saying it is worse than you are. 5. Oy vey, that's a very nice expen--hat you have there, how about I trade a Spy-Cicle for it? 6. Prepare to get kicked by 420BLAZEITYOLO2FAST scout admins when you kill them with a mini-sentry when protecting the objective. 7. Hats

review: I realize I came late to the review party, but I might as well give it a shot too. Team Fortress 2 is the F2P team based shooter that many know and play, and has a long and interesting history in the gaming world. Below I'll list the pros and cons of the game, which are based on my personal experiences and the experiences of others while playing. Agree or disagree, feel free to post why in the comments, and as always, I included a TL;DR version at the bottom. Now let's begin: The pros: - 9 different character classes, each offering a unique gameplay experience: Each class has a different base role, but you can specialize and change up your playing style in many different ways thanks to the many different weapons available in the game. - A variety of game modes to mix up the gameplay: These are mostly objective based, and do their job well in keeping the game from becoming stale. - Mann vs Machine: MvM for short, this is a special game mode completely different from the others. It pits you and 5 other players into a tower defense styled game where you are pitted against a robot army. Very fun to play, but its hard to find a proper team unless you're playing the payable version with tickets. - The game is F2P (Free to play): A great thing about this game is that you can download it, try it out and even play it for your desired length of time for free. Please note that the game is free to PLAY, and not free for everything it has to offer. - Not P2W (Pay to win): There's little difference between a free and a premium player. If you lack a desired weapon you can earn it as an achievement, craft it, or find it in one of the many random drops you get each week. - Cosmetics: I chopped a demonic airplane pilot assassin's head off with a golf club as a one eyed black Scottish demolitions expert wearing traditional Japanese samurai armor, before I was smacked to death by a giant Russian Santa Claus wielding a large piece of ham as a weapon, who was was being healed by a German chef doctor screaming about Oktoberfest and dispensers. (You may have to dish some money out depending on what you want though) - You don't have to make an account aside from your existing Steam account to be able to play: Click "Download". Wait for it to install. Play the game. - Emphasis on team gameplay: Knowing your role and cooperating with your team, while still being allowed to do and play what you want is what makes this game so unique and fun. And there's nothing quite like the feeling of satisfaction after you change the tide of the round and bring victory for yout team. - Trading: Turn your TF2 into an economy simulator. Become a merchant and sell your stuff to others for profit. Invest carefully and you can actually make some real life profit with this. The cons: - Class and/or weapon imbalances: Not going into detail here since in the end its all a matter of people's different opinions and beliefs, and it also depends which map and game mode is being played. But I think that we can all agree that there's no such thing as perfect game balance, no matter how hard the developers try. - Random crits: Some love them and some hate them. A crit in most cases means an insta kill even if you're at full health, with only a few exceptions. They make the game much more chaotic and unpredictable, to the point where they can completely turn the tide of a round around. You will get them too, but for every crit kill, you will get killed right back by them tenfold. - Community's attitude towards F2P players: Not pointing fingers at anyone here, but from what I've seen, new players and F2P's in general are being treated badly and have a hard time being accepted into TF2's community. I'm not saying everyone is like that though, as there are also people out there who welcome new players with open arms, gladly helping and advising them when necessary. - Hackers: With both Steam and TF2 being free, you can often find hackers on official servers ruining your fun. It takes a few days for the ban to apply even after they're reported, and there is nothing stopping a hacker from simply creating a new account after he gets banned and continue right where he left off. - Hit registration: Sometimes it works properly, but for the most part its just awful. Especialy noticeable when using meele weapons where you get the hitsound and you see your weapon hit, but no damage will be dealt. Works the other way as well, where hitting the empty space next to your opponent will score a hit. - Lag compensation: Getting headshot by a Sniper after you're already out of his line of sight behind a corner is always fun. - Bugs and glitches: Every game has these so they're unavoidable, but I often feel that a lot of them could be prevented by better testing before updating, and/or patching them up already, especialy the ones that have gone for years without getting a proper fix. - Valve (the developer) doesn't care anymore: The amount of content and updates that this game receives is slowly declining. The updates bring us cosmetics and crates nowadays, with the occassional weapon here and there. The End of the Line, a major update that the community was expecting for a long time was a huge dissapointment for me and others alike for example. Additionally, Valve deciding to re-relase some very rare, limited items in a new set of crates while also raising the prices of keys (and other items) in their Mann co store makes me think they're converting TF2 into nothing but a money milking machine now. The conclusion: TF2 is still a great and unique game even with its age, but overall, I cannot say that the pros outweigh the cons and therefore I sadly cannot give it a positive recommendation. It remains one of my favorite games of all time, and as a longtime player I will keep playing it, but I can't advise new players to do the same. You can install it and try it out for yourself, and then create and mould your own decision from what you experience. If you don't intend to play much or for long, then stick with your free account. If you decide to go for the long term investment, then pay what little it takes to get a premium membership, but don't spend more money on it afterwards. I realize I'll get a lot of hate from the negative aspects of this review by angry fans, but someone has to speak up for once. This review would have easily received a positive recommendation, if Valve would just show that they still care. I still have hope, and in the case that things really do change I'll gladly edit this review to a big thumbs up. I apologize for any mistakes in spelling and grammar, and I hope this review helps you. TL;DR version: Game is still good, but nowhere near as good as it was before. It has a lot of issues, the developers don't seem to care anymore, and its turning into nothing but a money milker.

review: TL;DR the TL;DR: Game is flooded with people who mimic their idols and tryhards who demolish people trying to have a good time. Play at own risk. TL;DR: I used to have fun playing this game. I stopped having that fun when a majority of the team is afk and can't be vote kicked because the majority doesn't vote (I'll discuss the voting issues later) or they go "teehee look at me I'm a shpee don't kill me" or another form of stupidity they want to recreate because they found it "sooo funny" when their idol on youtube did it. It is not at all fun when four members of your team who are actively trying to play and trying to have fun are getting demolished by the entire other team who are all trying to win as if they're Korean Grandmasters in SC2. If you want to do your stupid shpee , go to a server tagged: "stupid shpee ". If you want to go afk mid game. Either join spectator or leave the server and come back when you're good to go. Mann vs. Machine. It's quite fun IF and only IF you play with a squad of people who know what to do. If it's your first time playing or you're wanting to understand the maps, actually use the mode in MvM called: bootcamp. If people go to bootcamp they're not rewarded with special items for being beginners to the maps, as it should be. They're rewarded with knowledge on how to sucessfully farm Mann up mode instead. At the very least, you'll be yelled at severely by your teammates for wasting their time for hours for YOU being uninformed. At the very most, your teammates who are fed up with you, will vote kick you and all that's required is your vote being the only one against you. And that brings me to the topic of the ingame vote kicking. It doesn't work. Multiple times has someone stayed in a server because two(2) people on the team voted not to kick, four(4) people voted TO kick and the rest didn't vote at all because they're afk or indifferent. In this situation the person doesn't get kicked HOWEVER. There's a situation where only a single person votes to kick a player. That single vote to kick the player suceeds for no reason because it's one(1) vote yes and one(1) vote no (the kickee always votes no on itself) That vote should not at all suceed because it's one(1) against one(1). There's also times when ten(10) people vote to kick a player, one(1) person votes to stay ( the kickee) and one person doesn't vote at all. In this situation the vote should pass, the person should be kicked, but because of the guy who didn't vote the player stays in the game. You could use the hotkey for an abuse report screenshot( only if it's rule breaking) or you could record a highlight with the in-game replay system (if you don't play on valve servers because valve doesn't support their own systems). What's a replay you say? Valve created a little tool a long time ago that lets you record from a server ( not valve servers ( mostly servers with watermarks so you have an ugly blemish on your recording)). Sure that <sounds> cool but replays often come with many errors that cause the replay to not be salvageable or to cause what you were seeing in game to not look at all what it's supposed to be in the replay (Conga taunt for instance has an issue where a majority of the time it shows the character models doing a sprint animation that moves slowly across the screen). If you're anticipating a STABLE replay system you're better off playing the game as normal, while running a recording software like OBS. It'll cause your HUD to be in the video but that's better than a broken recording. Finally, I want to touch upon items, maps, competitive players and other things. Items, for the majority, are pretty ok. People who say "cosmetics ruin tf2" are the same people who try hard to win the game for no value whatsoever. Valve recently ( as of July 2014) released new weapons for tf2. They were in house tested and released to the players with what Valve though was good while weakening some of the original weapon mechanics (later removing some of the changes). TF2 used to have a beta client that was shutdown before the split of the equalizer into the equalizer and escape plan. The beta client would have helped not create a msasive backlash like the community gave to Valve for the friend and family tested weapons but not player tested weapons. Maps. Maps were released as finished products while still being very buggy. Valve has released a new "game mode" so to say that when queued up for, will give you only beta maps, for the purpose of testing, and the purpose of checking them out. It's a very smart decision as it lets people do what a beta client once was without the need of downloading another client. With many people having accessability, and beta maps being their own playlist, a majority of the bugs will hopefully be stomped by the time the maps are released as a finished product. Competitive Players. People who try way too hard to win for the sake of winning.(for the most part) I have fallen in this category many times because losing round after round is very frustrating. I just want to have fun doing things while being beneficial to the team and not dead weight (looking at you "shpees"). There is not one instance where "wins" are counted in the core game of tf2 ( server benefits don't count) and I know that, they know that. The people who want to be super competitive and don't want to go through a community like UGC, ESEA, or any other league, don't have a place to queue up like beta maps and MvM without going through "Valve OK'd" sites like tf2 center, or tf2 lobby. This system should have been implemented IN GAME but instead are ran by communities that are not valve itself. Very competitive players who dislike going through these methods frequently go into valve servers preying on relaxing players new players who then have a bad experience with the game. Other Things. Play with friends. Play with people you're willing to communicate. It's Team Fortress 2. Not Solo Stronghold 8.

review: Team Fortress 2 was released back in 2007. Back then, it was a fun little game where you would simply kill your friends, capture points, steal the enemy's intelligence, push carts etc.. But now, Valve just doesn't care about TF2 now. It's completely dead. Almost every update now simply brings us little cosmetic items. No new weapons, apart from cruddy reskins. Back in the day, this game used to be fun as hell. Then the Sniper VS Spy update came, and things started to go a little downhill. The SVS update brought us our first batch of hats, 1 for each class. It was pretty nice at the time. But from then on, pretty much every update kept bringing us new hats, and then eventually introduced trading. From that point, players could see TF2 was starting to die. The game eventually changed into what people called the "Hat Simulator" or "Hat Fortress 2" due to the fact that over half the game's population just focused on getting those cool hats. Then the worst update of all came. The one that caused many players to leave the game behind, and the one that almost actually completely killed the game. The Free To Play update. From then on, the game was F2P. New players started flooding in everywhere. Horrible players. Players that most of us would refer to as "basement dwellers." Players that were under the age of 12. And the hats just kept coming, too. After a few more updates and things like that, the game died. It's filled now with nothing but F2Ps. They were, 95% of the time, horrible players that are just extremely painful to watch and play with, and are sometimes also just plain rude, racist, and just annoying. The game also has trading, which, of course, allows players to trade their items to others for their items. The prices for these items, however, are absolutely beyond pathetic. I mean, you have to pay  nearly 9 refined metal, about the price of 8 normal hats, for earbuds, a piece of rubber that goes into your character's ears. This is all thanks to backpack.tf. If you're a trader, I do NOT recommend using prices from that site. There's still some good players roaming the servers, trying to find a server full of the rare and endangered good and friendly players. But seriously, the game is just dead. And it's just too addicting too. I don't like the game, BUT I CAN'T STOP PLAYING. NNRGGHHH. I guess in some way, I still love it. But it's just dead to me. If you're gonna get this game, good luck. And please, PLEASE, don't be like these usual F2Ps. Don't be like that kid I saw the other day who spouted out racist comments every time he died and got kills and who also kept trying to scam everyone's items.

review: As an option for F2P videogames out there, Team Fortress 2 is a very well crafted first person shooter focused only in multiplayer mode. Packed with several game modes and character classes, this title from Valve really meets the highest standards in FPS games. It's balanced, fast phased, it has style, it can run in almost any rig and, more important, it is fun.

Whether you want push a bomb to an enemy base, steal a briefcase, or capture some control points, this game is accessable and fun to anyone. This game is NOT like other shooters. There is no minimap, no helicopters, and no killstreaks. This game has hats. And it's free - that's the best part, absolutely free.

review: WHY THE HELL ARE YOU READING THIS SENTANCE!? YOU SHOULD HAVE SCROLLED UP AND DOWNLOADED THIS GAME 5 YEARS AGO!! Seriously, though....this game is freakin' epic. When a friend suggested it to me, I thought it was just gonna be one of those FPS games that I would play for a few months then get bored and go back to Minecraft. But, I was wrong. In three years of devoted playing, I have logged over 1,600 hours. Even my name is a reference. Despite my frankly humiliating lack of an unusual, I remain devoted to my goal of eventually getting "The PERFECT cosmetic set" for every one of my classes. 4 down, 5 to go. It doesn't matter if you are a primeval warrior or a mere mercenary at FPS's, this game will knock your bloody socks off.

review: This game is great. Alot of people focus around hats,but i only own 3 hats,so i focus on getting weapons.If you don't want this game because of how much it raves about hats,then get it for the gameplay.There are loads of different servers,and the weapons seem very thought out.The 9 classes are very balanced,so you will most likely have alot of fun.The focus on teams is nice,as you can't expect to win alone against a whole team,so asking teammates for help is nice.The game also manages to be balanced no matter what weapons you have,a thing most other games fail to do.Overall,i find this game very nice and balanced. 10/10

review: Hat simulator since 23 June 2011. Ok, now to serious part of this review. #1 Classes and Teamwork, This is a fast pasted FPS that is based on moded engine of another fast pasted FPS: Quake 3 Arena. The gameplay is mixed by 9 totaly different classes: Scout, Pyro, Soldier, Demoman, Heavy, Engieneer, Medic, Sniper and a Spy. All of those classes are unique in gameplay and each one suits different types of players, but you can't be the same class all the time because the teamwork is the most important thing in this game. If there would be 4 snipers in a team of 6 players and another team is well balanced between defensive and offensive classes the sniper team would lose the match. #2 Weapons and Items, Since 2011 this game became a F2P game. Valve mixed the items so it wouldn't be a "Pay to Win" game. In total there are different types of items that you can buy in the in-game shop: Weapons, Decorations, Emotes and Usebale items. Some of you might thing- "How can a game be balanced if you can buy yourself a gun that might have some benefits to it?"- well the answer is easy: those guns have their disadvantages. Those weapons can be a random drop as well, so you will get most of them. Usable items are basicly keys to open crates that contain decorations and weapons. #3 Gameplay features. This is one of those games that you find out something new almost all the time during your play. Ther are TONS of them so don't worry about getting to know all of them in nearest 5 hours ;) Final virdict: It ruined many lives

This game always make me smile with its models, maps and gamemodes. This game has everything to offer for you, from competitive gameplay to casual gameplay. If you're into holding off waves of robots, then the MvM (Mann. vs Machine) gamemode is there for you. If you're interested in objectived related gamemodes

This game is great, it is free to play and has a great style and flow to the gameplay. Unlike Call Of Duty and other popular shooters Team Fortress 2 only has 9 classes each with their own specific weapons that you can change by nabbing weapons from random drops or buying from the in-game store or the community market. Along with buying weapons come the hats, TF2 is most notable for the extreme amout of hat collecting OCD it provites to its players. This game would receive a 8/10 for the most fun I could have online for FREE.

Like helping out your team? Play as the Medic! Want to infiltrate the enemy lines undetected and take the enemy team out one by one? Play as the Spy! Also, let's not forget the giant array of maps and gamemodes that this game offers. Now you might be asking, what REALLY is the best thing about game? It's FREE!

review: To be honest at first i didn't like the game because i wasn't used to playing this type of FPS. Team Fortress 2 is a game you have to play constantly to like and it really is most enjoyed when played with friends. There are many variety of gamemodes such as CTF(Capture The Flag), KOTH(King of The Hill), Payload, Payload race etc. There are even special types of game modes that are super fun such as Slender, Freak Fortress, Parkour Fortress, etc. TF2 is not just a basic shooter like Call of Booty or Battlefield. It actually requires some sort of skill to kill someone in this game. Unlike COD or BF u can't just run up and shoot them you will get demolished! Also classes depend on a what a person wants to do for their teams. For example you become a Engi(Engineer) for defense. Like protecting your intel or protecting a point. Personally i love the Spy >:3 I help my team out behind the scenes and i can also sap(sapping means when you use your sapper to disable or reverse the Engi's buildings). When sapping its best to use a disguise so u can sometimes fool the enemy and sentries dont shoot you. Engi's (Sentries, Dispensers, and Teleporters are buildings). Anyways i have been playing this game for 2 years and if anyone needs any advice or help ill gladly help just friend me or message me. :D *AND DON'T FORGET HAVE FUN*

review: Team Fortress 2 (TF2) is the sequel to the game that put class-based, multiplayer team warfare on the map. TF2 delivers new gametypes, a signature art style powered by Valves next generation animation technology, persistent player statistics, and more. Unlike other "class-based" games that offer a variety of combat classes only, Team Fortress 2 packs a wild variety of classes which provide a broad range of tactical abilities and personalities, and lend themselves to a variety of player skills. Play as the flame-throwing Pyro, the room clearing Heavy, or the Spy, a master of disguises. Other classes include: Scout, Sniper, Medic, Engineer, Demoman, or Soldier. TF2 features the most advanced graphics of any Source-based game released to date  and the most exciting class-based action ever created
game-hours: 310.4
review: Team fortress 2, if you haven't heard of it, is a class based first person shooter. There are many gametypes, etc, but you can look at its key features for that. One of the best games I have ever played. Most of the community is amazing and Valve always stays in touch. There are plenty of animations to watch, items to obtain, people to meet, and hats to wear. Servers are very customizable, and people even make community maps to play on. Each class is unique, and unlike some FPS' *cough* Battlefield-call o' duty *cough*, classes are balanced. Each class pretty much has their own enemy (Soldier and Demo, Spy and Sniper, Scout and Heavy...), and snipers aren't 300 feet away from you on a building that is super hard to get up to, they're on a ledge nearby, out in the open but still hard to kill. The game is very well put together, and if you have never tried it, I suggest you should. 10/10 Would meme again

review: This was the game that got me into PC gaming. I've had many a lot of games for PC before but Halo and Star Wars Battlefront 2 were the only games I had to give me an online experience. Like many I bought it solely for Gmod but I gave it a try since I didn't really have much eperience with the game on the 360 and it quickly took over my afternoons after school while my Xbox was broken. I believe the amount of time Steam states is wrong seeing how I played this game for a month. This was before the hats and crates. You might hear people call this game "Hat Fortress" and say that it's all about hats. In reality, they're just collectables used as a form a customization, not affecting the gameplay. As for the gameplay, TF2 is a balanced FPS with many game modes to play such as: CTF, Control Point, a horde mode, King of the Hill to be played on a variety of maps. There are also several unoffical game modes with custom maps. And with the 9 different speciliazed classes to choose from, It's not long before you find what's suits you perfectly. The game isn't your usual Free-to-Play game. most of those games are riddled with miicrotransactions that are made to capitalize on those who are impatient. TF2 has a unique drop system to help those who are new and with only one payment you own the game! With the trade system, you won't have to worry about not finding a gun or maybe even a hat you'd want.

review: Practically a great F2P, One of the first on steam, instead of writing a long review I am give you a list of why its great - It Has Great Gameplay and Different Variation On The Classes - Storyline is Silly and Comical giving a Good Feel About the Game - Graphics Is Runnable on a Bad PC but Also Can Look Beautiful - Awesome Communities With Its Own Currency and Market. - You can Make Money And Has a Mann Co. Key Which is Universal - Servers Are Diverse and As well as having The Basics (CTF, TD) Many More Points but I Dont want to Bore you, Great Game, I should of Just said "Valve Made it" and you should of Got it.
game-hours: 856.4
review: So i have played this game for a long long time. and i just have to say it might just be the best F2P game of all time. all though 70% of the community only collects hats and miscs and i cant play 5 minuets of a genuine game untill people add me to trade to offer on my bills hat, anyway. it is a fun and balanced game where no class is op its just how you play and use the classes. and the gamemodes are great also as the maps.

review: This game always has me coming back for more thats how great it is! Yeah yeah, people may say its "Hats Fortress" because of all the hats in the game but I dont really think its like that. Gameplay: Simple gameplay easy to learn, it took me 5 minutes to learn how to kill the other team. Lag: There is lag in this game, just a heads up!!!!!!! I get lag spikes A LOT but that doesnt make this a bad game. Community, The community is great and full of friendly people will to "battle" against, Just.... watch out for the trigger happy f2ps(Free to Plays) or the skilled going on a killing spree. Thats all i can really say about this game. 9/10

review: This game is uncommonly silly, so folks looking for a 'serious' experience ought to look elsewhere. Most everyone else will find something to enjoy, whether socializing with fellow wierdoes, goofing around doing the conga, spawning bread out of the teleporters, or actually playing the game, 'as intended'. I have also found the TF2 fandom friendlier and more supportive than most other multiplayer games. :3

review: This is currently and always will be my favourite Steam Game! Over the hundreds of hours I have spent playing this game I seem to never get bored of it unlike other players. The objective of this first person shooter is to collect expensive hats and unusuals (This should always be a priority),collaborate and work as a team (unless in a Pub server full of newbies),Choose from 9 different classes who each have a unique ability (Example:Scout can Double Jump,Cap Points 2x Faster and is currently the fastest class avalible) to play to keep it fresh while playing,pick from a variety of game modes to spice things up when bored of constantly playing Payload,crush the opposing team's spirit's and accomplsih the given task. This is an amazing first person shooter and is super addictive.I rate TeamFortress 2 10/10

review: As a long-term Team Fortress player (I used to play a lot of TFC and even had the Quake mod back in the day), this is unsurprisingly one of my favourite Valve games. Since it's release, there have been a heap of new weapons added in the game, which are available as randomly given items while playing, along with hats (most of which have absolutely no effect on gameplay, but are valued highly by players). Admittedly, there are a few 'elitist' players because the game's been out so long, but if you're a fan of team-based FPS games then *definitely* give it a shot.

review: Team Fortress 2, the best hat simulator 2013-14-15 whatever. This game got me addicted and still haven't stopped playing ever since I stopped playing Garry's Mod. This game has many things to do like Control Points, Capture the Flag, and many more. The number one thing about this game is hats. Yes, Hats. Valve released an update I think about 2011 maybe? Which added crates and keys. This update made it possible to get the "Unusual hat" An Unusual hat is a rare hat you get from a crate. It's a 1% chance to get one. For myself, I got one on my other account on Nov. 22, 2013 I think. On the otherside this game is fun to play as all the classes. If you plan to stick with one class it's alright. Okay, ignore what I said above this game ruined my life. 11/10 Hats <3

review: I recommend this game 100% to people who want to try a combat game that doesn't use actual guns on the battlefield. It uses very unique weapons and classes. It's fun trying out the classes, but your KDR in-game might be bad at first. You just need to find a class you're best at and you'll do just fine. For me, the Pyro was an instant success. Pyro is a class in TF2 that gives you the starting items: Flamethrower, Shotgun, Axe. If you have fun with it, you'll notice items you want, or items you see people commonly using... so get out there and you might be able to get one of 'em.

review: Do you like hats? I'm Hats-in-my-eyes Johnson here at Hats-in-my-eyes hat store. There're so many sunglasses, fedoras, scarves, badges, I think. I can't-I'm not 100% sure what we have here in stock because I can't see anything. Our prices, I hope, aren't too low. Check out this hat with nuts and bolts! Only $200! These earbuds only $100. I mean, that's fair. I'm Hats-in-my-eyes Johnson. Everything's full of particle effects. I can't see a thing. And also I can't feel anything either, did I mention that? But that's not as catchy as having hats in your eyes so that always goes, you know, off by the wayside. I can't feel - it's a very rare disease. All my nerves, they don't allow for the sensation of touch so I never know what's going on. Am I standing, sitting? I don't know.

review: Odds are, you've played TF2, you're probably playing it RIGHT. NOW. ...or thinking about it. And who can blame you, hypothetical reader? There really is no reason not to give it a shot. It's free, it's fun, it's fair, it's something else that starts with "F". The only downside is that this game will ruin your spare time if you get addicted. Unless you're not into FPS' or huge multiplayer games, give it a shot at least, you got nothing to lose.

review: TF2 worst game ever wasted my time and money just for hats 10/10 will keep playing On a more serious note, this is a wonderful and amazing game I've spent hundreds of hours playing this and I don't regret it at all. It never gets old because no two matches are the same, something will always be different as soon as those spawn doors open and you run out onto the front lines.

review: Team Fortess 2, where do I start with ye? Well I guess from the beggining It is possibly the most fun FPS I have ever played, no game, and I mean NO GAME, has ever come so close to replay value as this game has, and it's even more fun with friends, nothing beats tf2 on friday nights! The game is also very well balanced, it isn't Pay To Win *cough*callofduty*cough*, yeah you can buy items but every item is balanced so you don't get an advantage over other players. The game also has hats which it is notorious for, I promised when I started playing TF2 I wouldn't get suckered into buying hats but.... well I did XD Anyway that's enough blabbing, after 2 years of playing I can honestly say this may be one of my favourite games IN EXISTANCE, so what are you waiting for? It's free so you having nothing to lose! Game on!

review: Team Fortress 2 offers the player with an exciting and absorbing experience. Players can range from healing their teammates to stabbing the enemy in the back. There are various skills that must be taken into account with this game, such as "surfing" which quite literally means that when you're up in the air, you must have control to avoid death. Basically.... If you enjoy hectic, fun games.. Team Fortress was made for you. It should also be noted that you need hands and are required to be of the living in order to play this game. Rules and conditions apply... Probably.. Iunno.. Are you still reading this? I'm impressed.

review: There's not much to say about Team Fortress 2, considering the fact that it is free to play and is availilbe instantly to anyone who joins Steam. TF2 has become THE quintisential Vavle gam, the best representative of that company and to an extent of Steam. Nevertheless, in the event that there are people out there who have not yet tried this game, this review is for you. Team Fortress 2 is the result of almost 9 years of work by the Vavle comanpy, the same company that brought you the Left 4 Dead, Half-Life, and Portal series. The basic idea of TF2, a basic team-based shooter with 9 classes of soldiers to choose from, was founded back in the days of Quake, which quickly gave rise to Team Fortress Classic. Once Valve had the model they were after for Team Fortress, they spent years refining and programming it into the monsterous, magnificent behemoth that is TF2. When it was originally released, it was regarded as the pinnacle of shooters. You also had to buy it to play it. I was among those who bought TF2 in the short time after it was released. At first I wasn't particularly enthused by the game. I was more used to the Call of Duty format of shooters, with rapid action, lone-wolf tactics, instant kills, instant deaths, and a basic but highly customizable point-and-shoot mechanic to the game. TF2 has highly specialized classes, team strategy, and weapons that aren't exactly point-and-shoot-for-instant-kill. I was upset at the general lack of customization availible, although what kept me occasionally coming back for more was the fact that TF2 ha a wide variety of game modes, all of which require very different strategies on the part of players. You can't simply treat every class the same way in every game mode. So I wasn't a regular at TF2. Didn't play enough to get any good at it. But then things began to change, and they changed for the better. First, the game aquired more items and weapons for each of the different classes, allowing for a greater level of customization than what previously existed. Then, the game became free to play; which brought along with it scores of other benifits. A)- Free to play means more players, which means a better variety of skills and skill-sets, and more games availible at any given time. B)- A new set of training missions, meant to help noobs find their way a little bit. So sweet. C)- Constant updates with new weapons, items, maps, and game modes. In effect, Team Fortress 2 has become that dream game: a shooter that requires teamwork and strategy, that is constantly updated and is always having things added to it, and is played by virtually all computer-gamers in one form or another. I won't talk much about the game itself, because again, most of you have already played it, or can fidn stuff out for yourself since you all have it automatically, but here we go: The nine classes, each with distinct abilities and weapons, both of the greatest variety that there has ever been in a video game, are... -SOLDIER- Shoots rockets, moves sorta slow, but has good health. Usually carries a shotgun and melee as well. -SCOUT- Runs fast, shoots shotguns and pistols, carries a baseballbat. -HEAVY- Big guy, big health, big gun (a minigun!), moves slow. -SNIPER- A one-hit-kill wonder, with a sniper rifle and assorted secondaries. -MEDIC- He heals, runs fast, and in MvM he can bring you back from the dead! -PYRO- Fire. -DEMOMAN- Runs medium speed with a grenade launcher, a sticky bomb launcher, and a variety of Scottish-themed melee weapons. -ENGINEER- Builds sentry guns, health and ammo dispensers, and teleporters. -SPY- Diguises as enemies and then backstabs them at high speeds. There are a variety of game modes. -PAYLOAD- Push a cart with a bomb through a series of maps. -PAYLOAD RACE- Two carts, one map. -CAPTURE THE FLAG- Steal a shinny briefcase from the enemy. -ARENA- Basic team deathmatch, but you only have one life. -CONTROL POINT- Battle it out for control of...well, points! Comes in symetrical mode (both teams have even numbers of points) and attack/defend mode (one team starts with all the points). -KING OF THE HILL- Requires no explaining. -MANN VS MACHINE- The only co-op mode, in which you fight waves of enemy robots. Think Nazi-Zombies, but the game has an end. -SPECIAL DELIVERY- There is one suitcase, and one rocket. First team to get said suitcase to said rocket wins. ...AND probably a few that I have forgotten. The maps are of a great variety and all are filled with multiple ways of getting from one place to another. There is something for everyone: secret passages, sniper perches, saferooms, and other elements that allow each class to preform at it's best, so long as you know how to exploit each map to your advantage. Team Fortress 2 is immensley fun, easy enough to get good at, and is absolutely massive in terms of items, game modes, maps, and community. There is not any real reason not to play this game, unless of course you just don't want to. I'd give TF2 a 9 out of 10.

review: Team Fortress 2... one of the best multiplayer games i've ever played and that's impressive considering it's a shooter. The 9 different classes and an entire armory of weapons keeps the gameplay and variety flowing. This game was released in 2007 and it's still relevant today which is impressive for today's standards. Not to mention the chat which is always a good thing. Each class is unique with their own playstyles and abilities with weapons that cater to one playstyle or another. There is an assortment of different maps and gamemodes, all of them unique and fun to play. There's also hats which you can collect and wear for no purpose other then looking good. These hats are all different and you will always find a hat that you like. The graphics are wonderfully cartoony, being based off of early 21st century artists like Norman Rockwell. Each character has their own unique charming personalities, suiting them well and making them more funny with their quotes. Overall, i think Team Fortress 2 is a great multiplayer game having both excellent gameplay and funny charm. I give this game 10/10

review: How to Properly Play the Game Step 1: Do nothing Step 2: Once you did nothing for about 50 hours, you will earn a hat Step 3: Jump onto a trade server Step 4: As you connect yourself to the server, brace yourself for sprays that are not suitable for minors Step 5: Ignore the Rainbow Dash booty call spray and type in chat "Selling hat" Step 6: Once you accepted his/her trade, crush their soul and steal their hats Step 7: Once you have crushed enough souls, you will become rich Step 8: Amass your wealth to get an Unusual, which is an amalgamation of pixels floating around the hat Step 9: Play the shooting mini-game that comes along with Hat Simulator 2, and get beaten in a gunfight against a free to play person wearing an achievement hat Step 10: Punch a hole through your computer and hang yourself

review: Team Fortress 2 is a free to play class-based game with 9 classes. These classes include Scout, Soldier, Pyro, Demoman, Heavy, Engineer, Medic, Sniper and spy. Each class has its won unique play style and weaponry. All the classes loadout consist of a primary weapon, secondary weapon and melee weapon. There is also weapons you can find by playing the game. There is also hats you can find,make or buy. If you are planning on buying a hat i recommend buying them on the community market which may be for a cheaper price. You can also buy weapons on the community market that arent normal weapons instead they are strange, killstreaking, botkillers and festive even though they are different than the normal weapons they sell for less than the store on tf2 (note this dosent apply for all weapons). I recommend not to buy anything untill you are sure you like tf2 and you will be playing for a while. This is a great game to play with friends to be competitive or goof around . This happens to be the game me and my friends play together the most we really like to join games with no one in them and play eacother. It is also a advantage to have a friend who plays tf2 cause you can trade wit hthen and you can give them a weapon you dont want but they do and they can give you one they dont want. You could also count on a good deal with trades from a friend. There is many game modes in tf2. These game modes are Control points, King of the Hill, Special delivery, Payload, Payload race, Capture the flag and Attack/Defence. Each game mode has a different objective than the others. Attack/denfence is my favorite. Each game mode takes skill to master. Im not even that good at all the game modes or the game in general yet. Thats all i have to say about this great game for now but i may edit it and add more so keep your eyes open. ~nobel~

review: TF2 Is a hat (and now conga) based simulator. It features an FPS minigame, but that is not the point of the game. Crafting extra weapons that may drop from the mini game, you can craft metals and the metals into metals to trade for hats. Or you can be like everybody else and spend all of your money on hats. The FPS minigame is unique where it has 9 classes with different gameplay mechancics. Usually though you'd probably just see backburner pyro's and people who think they have the perfect sentry nest. But who cares about the FPS experience, when you've got hats. 10/10

If you don't like playing in a team, tough luck because TEAM Fortress 2 puts your skills to act as a Chain-link to beat the opposing team! Break their links, or be the weakest link. THERE IS NO INBETWEEN. Also. Hats, don't forget about hats.

review: An absolutely wonderful game for those who want a LEVEL playing field. Sure there will be bugs from time to time when they add new items and/or facets to the game but, unlike most others, they meticulously work to make sure that the playing field is FAIR. This isn't Call of Duty where you can earn "CheaterPro" from 17th prestige and stomp all over the new kid simply because he's new...it's all based on skill. Sure a lot of people disliked the addition of the store, the ability to buy new weapons before others have them...but they're all side-grades with very little advantage in terms of power. Strategy and skill are key and, if all else fails, there's plenty of maps to troll about on! Don't take yourself so srsly all the time :>, have fun, laugh.

review: I have to say this is THE best game I have played in a very long time. The only thing I don't like are the camper's, but that isn't really part of the game. So for this, I recomend this game to anyone. It is very detailed (To my eyes it is, probably not to everyone) and the fun never ends. Maybe. You should try out this game and give it a chance, the best part is that it is 100% free unless you want to buy something from the Mann Co. Store. I highly recomend you get this game. I say this wonderful game deserves 100/10. Play this the first chance you get. I bet you will enjoy the exerience. Unless you are head-shoted by a camping Sniper. Then you can get mad.

review: A game with a large variety of maps, modes, and players that make every round an entirely different experience. The customization features are great, and the ability to replay this game is much better than a lot of other games in the genre. The story and characters are simple enough that complex plotlines don't get in the way of action or confuse new fans, which makes it ideal for those who don't want all the exposition and just want to shoot the other guys. Simple enough controls that casual and pro gamers can all enjoy it.

And, yes, even if you have no money, you can play this game, very well too. The multiplayer element is amazing, especially with Steam voice chat, trading, and a diverse selection of server game types.

review: Back in my day this game was $20. Back in my day, the game had three weapons for 9 classes. There were no hats! There was no training mode! Bots, if the servers added them, just hung around in spawn because they were not programmed to fight! We only had CP, CTF and TC game modes back in my day! Then again, the games improved a lot. Hats are not a game play focus, nor is dancing, but you know what? It beats playing some generic shooter brown FPS if the games new additional mechanics are to let you have fun. Remember that - sucking now is only the first step into getting better.

review: I have owned Team Fortress 2 for quite a while now, but only until it was made Free to Play. But I couldn't figure out how to explain it for a while now... Let's try this: Team Fortress 2 is very different. Although some First Person Shooters are very serious, dark, etc., TF2 takes a light-hearted approach to the genre, with cartoony graphics (but bloody), many jokes and dialouge, and the "Darn-this-let's-attack-the-enemy-head-on" feel of the game. Besides the reasons I just stated above, TF2 is very, very different from other FPS games. There's no leveling, EXP, upgrades of any kind. Instead, you do achievements to get milestones and get guns, however those guns have advantages and setbacks compared to the original gun, to be evened out. And besides, you can either pay with real money to buy the gun, or be lucky and "find" it while playing (you'll know what I'm talking about when it comes around.) There are other differences, but I'm running out of space. D: Try it yourself!

review: By golly has this game come far. I have played this game from previous accounts and it has come a long way my friends but lets get on with the review! Team Fortress 2 is an FPS. Even though that word is slightly tainted, TF2 (Team Fortress 2) is an amazing game plus its free so even if you dont like it you can stop playing straight away without the anger that you spent money. By the way this game makes F2P actually look good! Now lets get straight to the main pros and cons Pros: Addictive Highly Charismatic characters and enviroments Great(ish) community Not trying to force you to buy anything unlike most F2P's Mods and plugins coming out the wazoo Cons: Hats and miscs changed many peoples view on the game Rarley updated anymore Some people rather trade then play the game Overall I'd say 8/10 good job valve

Just play it and if you like it play it some more, if you get bored stop playing, if you don''t like shooting play it anyway: what have you got to lose?

review: So much has been said about TF2 that anything I want to write has already been regurgitated a thousand times. However, one thing that cannot be stressed enough is that this is one of (if not the) best first-person shooters available. The game play is amazing, the characters are incredible, and the community is friendly. The best part is, TF2 is free. Free. FREE! The deal here for TF2 is just as good as the Steam summer sale, almost better in my opinion. An Amazing game for $0.

review: Things i like about TF2: 1: it has a retro styled look and awesome characters. (my favorite is scout) 2: it runs on the Source engine. 3: there are many mods, custom maps, and special fan content (fanfics, machinimas, music parodies, etc.) created by the community. 4: it has awesome DLC, and a store filled with special items for use in the game. (hats, weapons, crates, etc) 5: it's on Windows, Mac, and Linux. and 6........ IT'S FREE TO PLAY!!!!!!!! Out of all the Predeccesors it had, (Team Fortress Classic, Quake Team Fortress, Fortress Forever.) I RATE THIS 98 OUT OF 10 SANDVICHES!!!!!!! (Stars)

The gameplay and the art style is unique, the 9 classes provide TONS of variety in the game and will keep you coming back for more everytime, and the game has unlockable weapons that make the game all the more fun. Team Fortess 2 is certainly worth the space on your hard-drive and is a far better choice for a FPS then Call of Duty or Battlefield.

review: The 9 different classes are all almost perfectly balanced, the gameplay is smooth and fast-paced, and most servers are fun to play on. The wide variety of weapons and cosmetic items for each class is impressive, and always fun to collect and mess around with different loadouts. Every game mode presents a new type of gameplay and strategy to work with, and the massive amount of community maps/mods provides TONS of new gameplay options. Very few bugs and glitches, and the game is regularly updated. Jut because this game is free doesn't mean it would be any worse than if you had to pay for it.

review: This game is by far one of the best games on Steam other than GMod(which i will review in later times). Valve always makes good games and this one is proof of that theory. While it is frustrating that other people have better stuff than you most likely because they paid for that cool taunt, hat, costume, or weapon, and you can't download DLC for free but instead have to wait for Valve or Steam to add new stuff because of the number of stars it gets in the workshop, the classes do balance each other out. The game is always getting good stuff, and the community is great. It's the best multiplayer game because it forces you to work with others to achieve the goal. Mann vs. Machine is very fun too, because you're working with a small group to kill and survive waves of robots that impose as different classes. The classes are great because there is a class for every type of player. I prefer Heavy, Soldier, Pyro, and Spy while my friend prefers Sniper and Medic. This game is not very serious and the players should not take themselves or anybody else in the game seriously. My friend and I were doing the Conga taunt and we were kicked off the server because we weren't shooting at the enemies. I also like that when you explode you most of the time blow up into bloody bits and if a sniper gets a headshot it blows your head of it's shoulders! All that should be added is when you get shot enough in one body part it flies off and a gametype that most everyone loves, TEAM DEATHMATCH! This would heighten my interest along with many others. I can't commentate on the economy in the game because I just started the game and have not seen what it was like before. The only bad thing about this game really is that some weapons don't do crap and you should smelt them for better things or trade them as soon as you get them, like the Black Box! It's really a downgrade from the level 1 Rocket Launcher. That's all for my review of TEAM FORTRESS 2 and i give it a 9.9/10.

review: A beautiful game with sufficient graphics, amazingly balanced gameplay and well-defined characters. Each class has its own strengths and weaknesses- but these go far and away beyond the generic 'water-beats-fire-beats-grass-beats-water' system. The gameplay is much more intricate than that. For example, let us look at the Pyro. The Pyro, being a relatively short-range class, must almost always ambush the Heavy instead of face him in direct combat to have a decent chance of dispatching the large Russian beast. Even so, the Pyro's skills must be of a certain standard to kill the aforementioned Heavy. This Heavy, however, is slow and known to be fodder for Spies, especially when preoccupied with firing at other foes. A swift backstab severs the mortal thread of Heavy. The Spy, though, relies on deceit and opportunism to kill, and is all but dead when faced with a Pyro, due to his fragile health and the Pyro's high movement speed and ability to deal a painful stream of fire. Thus, the cycle is brought full-circle. Furthermore, a Spy's sapper causes headaches for Engineers, whose Sentry Guns are a considerable obstacle to Pyros, whose airblast ability provides a beautiful (often touted as overpowered) counter to Demomen and Soldiers, whose projectiles are arguably the most threatening to a Sentry if no Spy is present... Team Fortress 2 boasts complex, intricate gameplay that is an absolute pleasure to experience once one picks it up.

review: Played this game for a long time. Great game to pass time, 9 classes you can learn to play and try to master, tons of maps that some classes it's better to play as, tons of gamemodes, and in game currency which keeps the game intresting and alive. Still would have liked to see it pay to play, but it's valves test game. There are tons and tons of items in game you can buy such as hats, taunts, weapons to keep expanding your character. you can get free items just for playing, or getting milestones in classes. Great game that I always find myself coming back into. I play it everyday by meyself pubing around and still have tons of fun. It only gets better with friends who enjoy tf2 as well. Only real con is it can get competitave, and not be good to play on a bad day. And also you need alot of friends to beat something like MvM and not just random people. Non of my fends play tf2 eally so I'm screwed there. >.<

review: Why aren't you playing this game already? It is never too late to start, and it will never be pay2win. The best players at the professional level use weapons with the same stats as what you are given upon booting it up, so don't worry about that. All the weapons with different stats are sidegrades, not upgrades, and the stock weapons are the most useful most of the time. There's a diverse, completely optional economy around cosmetics, which can be ignored if you just want to shoot people. While there isn't a single player, there is co-op that is quite entertaining. The community is very friendly. Play this now, put on a hat, and don't play pyro or spy as your first class. Instead, how about medic?

review: While I only have about 150 hours on record (some would scoff at how pitiful that is) I consider myself to be good at this game, really good compared to some who do not know how to shoot one of the numerous and interesting weapons that subtly change the game mechanics in favour of a personalised play style. Then theres the hats. Items used for, if nothing else, to show your social standing (a.k.a how much money you are willing to spend on a cosmetic). While it does sound I am bemoaning the game, I am not, really and honestly, I love this game. So much so that I would be eccstatic if a new TF3 came out rather than Half-Life. I even have a good idea on how to transfer the story the comics into the gameplay and how to make it succesful. If only a big name developer would be interested *wink**wink* ;) 20/10

review: Team Fortress 2 is the game for you! Hours of fun with or without friends! Why not try trading weapons or hats. And you should get alllll the hats and spend money in the store. Hats Hats Hats! Get it know! (May cause lack of sleep, family to worry about you not go to work or school and a trading problem) P.S did i say hats?

review: I've been playing TF2 for quite some time now and I've loved nearly every second of it. For the most part, the community is polite. It's a fantastic game that Valve has nurtured and continually balances out. When you hear TF2, you may think of the word "hat" and that is a very normal reaction. When I saw a copy of the Orange Box and that beautiful fat Russian with Gordon... I was overjoyed and bought it. It was certainly not a mistake on my part to do so. The 9 classes to choose from have their own unique and enjoyable features. There's also a lot of hats. All in all, this is the best hat simulator that Valve has to offer.

review: I'll be honest about this game, I was semi hestant about playing it because of its free2play and only multiplayer experiences, oh how I thought wrong. I never though a game about the cliche' of hats, taunts, and 9 classes could be so fun. Plus I met with a variaty of people along the way. Trust me, there is basically a section for all people, trading, competive, casual, minigame minun, you'll find your groove and mix and have fun with the game overall. And once you buy somthing from the mannco store(giftpault), congrats! you are p2p. have fun. o/' 9/10

review: This game is . Everywhere I look "TRADING HATS FOR PILES OF Generic  weapons and paint and other random  this game doesnt need." Last time I was on I joined an achievement server and all the mods were doing was mic spamming and complaining about people going on blue team. ing autistic neckbeards ruined this game. The only trade request are from underage down-syndrome 12 yr olds that randomly pull the trade menu up on your screen to request trade even if u dont want it. This game is a prime example of how a community can ruin a great game. E.g. Cowadooty and Bioware games. This should be renamed to Autistic fortress 2

review: I now have over 10 hours on this game (10.4 to be exact), so I believe I deserve an opinion. Also, I plan to update this review after I have played it for 100, 1000 and 10,000 (if i survive this long) hours to see how my opinion changes and how much value this game saves over time. I am not a fan of FPS games, and the only reason I downloaded this game was "why the hell not, it's free and looks alright". I am very happy I made this decision, since this is one of the best games I have ever played. It is full of action, variety, and, most importantly, explosions! Also, hats. Even though there are items you can purchase for real money in game, they are not necessary. I have enjoyed the game for 8.5 hours before deciding to purchase a sniper rifle, and there is not much difference before and after the upgrade. The game is also a very polished product, no annoyances, only enjoyances. Very good cartoony graphics, subtle humor rarely found in FPS games, and many gameplay options to choose from. Can't recommend this enough, so all kinds of gamers. Whether or not you are a FPS fan, give this game a try, you will be pleasantly surprised.

Also,even tough the game is quite old the game developers are still constantly tweaking weapons to make the game even better For those wondering,the competitive side of the game is very active and you can get involved very easily,once you have a team to play with. It is free to play,so what are you waiting for?

Easy to run on the worst of pc's. AND DID I MENTION IT'S TOTALLY FREE. There's no doubt about getting this. Get it. Now!

review: Team Fortress 2 has the most balanced classes around with some being more for new players and others being for the more experienced. Take the sniper. The sniper is the easiest class in the game and it is extremely easy to use. It is recommended to try and shoot the body and not the head, as it does almost the same amount of damage. The pyro however, is almost impossible to master and the people who are able to use it well have been called w+m1-ers. This stands for win+medic1, because a pyro and a medic are almost unstoppable and can win the game if the pyro has any decent amount of skill. The heavy is also one of the harder class, and the win+medic1 also applies to it. There are many great game modes and maps, but I love deathmatch on 2fort myself.

review: As is common knowledge, Valve always puts 100% into whatever they release, and this is no exception! The client updates always bring the promised new clothes and weapons and the game is entertaining enough to produce hundreds of hours of playtime! If you dont already have TF2, your probably the only one!

review: This is the best money-absorbing, time-eating, free-to-play hat-purchasing simulator in the store. Oh, and there's some awesome team-and-class based first-person shooter elements, gut-busting humor, and interesting, unique characters, if you're into that stuff. Seriously, though; if you have Steam, and enjoy all of the previous things wrapped up in a sugary package of complete bliss, there is no reason you should not get this game.

review: You know, After playing this game since 2008. I've never actually given this game a fair review, but I suppose it's about time I gave this game a decent and fair analysis. To put it simply, Team Fortress 2 is the ultimate multiplayer game. Since it's release in 2007, multiple updates by the creator, Valve and it's dedicated community have extended the lifespan of the game almost indefinitely. Players who tried the beta of the game prior to the release, could never of imagined the direction the game would take to the time of this review in 2014. First of all, the game is Free to Play, so if you haven't tried this game, there is absolutely no reason as to why you shouldnt try it. Secondly, since the game is technically 7 years old, the actual spec that your PC needs to the run the game is actually incredibly low, so even if you have an old rig, you should be able to run the game in a lower quality setting. Handy, right? The amount of game types the player is given to play is staggering, from offical game types such as the popular Payload, Attack and Defence, and even lesser known game types such as Territorial Control will all be able to entertain you for hours upon end. However, as mentioned before, the community have offered their hand in providing additonal game types, such as Deathrun and 'Saxton Hale' mode. Not a fan of Multiplayer? Fine, try out Mann Vs Machine mode. It works as a Co-Op mode that can be played between 6 players. Despite being known commonly nowadays as a 'Hat Simulator' the game actually has it's own in depth economy in selling hats and virtual equipment. Just be careful of scammers! Wrapping this review up, the game is quite simply, amazing. The fact that is still lives and breathes even stronger than what it did 6 years ago is outstanding. But why are you still reading this review? Go play TF2!

review: After playing more than 100 hours,TF2 proves to be a very excellent game.whether you are mastering stock weapons as a free to play,or filling your backpack to the max with rare items,tf2 will last you at least 2 years.every class has a unique way to play with certin abilities that are sometimes the only way to dominate.the game has so many maps that you cant even play them all until a new one comes out from either valve themselves or by a steam user who has a custom one.there is almost no way to 100% this game until you find hundreds of items and earn every achievment possible.there are new players each day so you can never meet them all.Not only does it have lots of maps,but also many gametypes including a co-op mode thats something more original enemy than zombies.gametypes include capture the flag,control points,and many more.With its 100% free status its a must have game for any account.

review: I had started playing TF2 when it came out in 2007. Me and my cousin would enjoy it for hours on end, and the community was just starting. I was addicted to this shooter, with its' cartoon-like graphics and simple objectives. Then all sorts of weapons and headgear/ misc items were released throughout the years, and the game turned into something different; an economy. It's hard to enjoy the game when it's filled with trade servers and all sorts of random junk, but it didn't stop me from finding some amazing communities. As time progressed, I started to get bored of the same old thing. Until I found new modded gamemodes like VS. Saxton Hale, Deathrun, TF2Ware, Slender Fortress 2, and more. My interest soared with playing these games, but eventually, I decided to quit. The community is heading downhill, and I chose to put my items in the market in hopes I can gain some money back. All-in-all, Team Fortress 2 is a great game, but is also a dying one. Hopefully something drastic will happen so I may come back to it.

Then I bought new games.  done, people. But seriously, TF2, best 400+ hours of my life. Fun with friends, fun with your neighbors, fun with your dog. This game cracks me up to no end. Try playing this game without screaming "REKT", or "OMG, LOL". I dare you.

review: ^ The hours that I have played. This is ridiculous. No game I have ever played had this many hours on it. EVER. This game has everything a FPS could ask for. Its got some humor in it with the funny descriptions and the wierd combinations you can get with cosmetics. It has a very strong economy from Backpack.tf (where people can vote on item prices) and from trading. This game is very heavily community based. The best part about that is the community is kind and lively. People are constantly submitting new items into the Steam Workshop in hoping that it may be put into the game. This game you can trade, suggest, have fun, and play. All of this, for free. Just consider this before you go to the store and decide to buy that $40 FPS. Can you trade? Can you take part in a large community? Can you have fun even if you are losing the match? Just think about what Team Fortress 2 has to offer. All of this. For free.

review: Team Fortress 2 is a very fun game with alot of action in it. There are 9 different classes making it more fun cause most Free To Play games only have about 3-4 classes! You can play as each one get hats and miscs for them and even many different taunts like the conga! There are also many different wepons to each class! There are so a many different types of game modes like pay load is where you have to push a cart holding a bomb into a hole. You have saxton hale where there is one guy and your whole team try's to fight him (Also known as Vsh). There is cp which is control points which you try to capture the other teams control points to win the game (Most recommended to play for starters). Then you have much much more when you start to play Team Fortress 2. I hope you found this review helpful!

review: One of the first pictorial depictions of a hat appears in a Thebes tomb painting which shows a man wearing a conical straw hat. Other early hats were the Pileus, a simple skull cap; the Phrygian cap, worn by freed slaves in Greece and Rome; and the Greek petasos, the first known hat with a brim. Women wore veils, kerchiefs, hoods, caps and wimples. St. Clement, the patron saint of felt hatmakers, is said to have discovered wool felt when he filled his sandals with flax fibers to protect his feet.[4] In the Middle Ages, hats were a marker of social status and used to single out certain groups. The 1215 Fourth Council of the Lateran required that all Jews identify themselves by wearing the Judenhat (Jewish hat), marking them as targets for anti-Semitism.[5]The hats were usually yellow, and were either pointed or square. [6] In the Middle Ages, hats for women ranged from simple scarves to elaborate hennin,[7] and denoted social status. Structured hats for women similar to those of male courtiers began to be worn in the late 16th century.[8] The term milliner comes from the Italian city of Milan, where the best quality hats were made in the 18th century. Millinery was traditionally a womans occupation, with the milliner not only creating hats and bonnets but also choosing lace, trimmings and accessories to complete an outfit.[9] Men's hat, 1600-1625 In the first half of the 19th century, women wore bonnets that gradually became larger, decorated with ribbons, flowers, feathers, and gauze trims. By the end of the century, many other styles were introduced, among them hats with wide brims and flat crowns, the flower pot and the toque. By the middle of the 1920s, when women began to cut their hair short, they chose hats that hugged the head like a helmet.[8] The tradition of wearing hats to horse racing events began at the Royal Ascot in Britain, which maintains a strict dress code. All guests in the Royal Enclosure must wear hats.[10] This tradition was adopted at other horse racing events, such as the Kentucky Derby in the United States.[11] Extravagant hats were popular in the 1980s, and in the early 21st century, flamboyant hats made a comeback, with a new wave of competitive young milliners designing creations that include turban caps, trompe-l'oeil-effect felt hats and tall headpieces made of human hair. Some new hat collections have been described as "wearable sculpture." Many pop stars, among them Lady Gaga, have commissioned hats as publicity stunts.[12]

review: This game has been around for almost 7 years might go for it's tenth year and I could see why. What I like about this game is how well it's balanced, not just in weapons but in the classes themselves. Every class and its gun has its up and downs. No sense of it being a "pay-to-win" game. Cheapest gun is low as 0.49 cents and as I said before alot of the guns are fairly balanced. Oh yeah you can't forget about the hats... hats hats HATS!!!!! You can customize your charactor with whatever apperal or hats. Whether you wanna make look badass or just flat out stupid the choices are yours. Some people could say that hats are killing the games. Alot of the updates has just HATS and it could be annoying, buts the hat could go either way. The hats has open up a new world for tf2 but there is more hats then there is guns. But I could see why it's pretty hard to make a gun that is fairly balanced. So I would say this game gats a 9/10

review: Team Fortress 2 is, dare I say, one of the most innovative FPS games of all time. With nine different classes to choose from and battle with other online users head on in different game modes, the combinations are endless. The graphics of this game are somewhat simple, but stylized in such a way that reminds me of a comic book, which is very appealing. Being able to customize your loadout and collect hats, miscs, taunts, etc. the possibilities are endless. The community is also a competitive group of people, all around the world going for the top of the scoreboard, or the community that strives to get that one certain hat, and have the richest backpack. Now, a few downsides would be some of the exploitable bugs, but that's not too big of a deal. Valve is very good with fixing the bugs found nowadays. The annoying downtimes from item servers can be an annoyance as well, but aside from those few things it is overshadowed by Team Fortress 2's greatness. With more being added frequently, the involvement with the community, and addicting gameplay, TF2 is given a solid 9.5/10

I love the gun buying model that allows me to either play for a long time and accumulate guns to turn into parts and craft other guns (which I have done) or buy some too (which I have done only once). This game is great in my book 10/10.

review: This is an awesome game.You should try it. It has more that 100 weapons to try. It has something called a "Mann Co" box and you use a key to open that box to get a rare item. Or something thats, not rare.You have different classes to try like the scout, heavy, or spy. This is why you should try TF2 (Team Fortress 2)

review: I've been playing TF2 for quite some time now and I've loved nearly every second of it. For the most part, the community is polite. It's a fantastic game that Valve has nurtured and continually balances out. When you hear TF2, you may think of the word "hat" and that is a very normal reaction. When I saw a copy of the Orange Box and that beautiful fat Russian with Gordon... I was overjoyed and bought it. It was certainly not a mistake on my part to do so. The 9 classes to choose from have their own unique and enjoyable features. There's also a lot of hats. All in all, this is the best hat simulator that Valve has to offer.

review: This is the one game I can't stop playing. Every single match is a different experience for me and the community is one of the best around. Knowing that other real people are with me in spirit making that final push for the point is something unmatched by any other video game. Nine classes means nine times the fun, and constant updates show that this is a game that not only Valve cares about, but the community as well. Would recommend to anyone who isn't afraid to jump right into a new game and try out this one of a kind first person shooter. If you can play for at least 12 hours, I guarantee that you'll want to play more.

review: It's the number one downloaded free game for a reason. It's fun to play by yourself, and even more fun with friends. The monitization scheme of getting items never gets in the way of the actual game. Though multiplayer games and first person shooters arent for everyone, it's pace, style, and unoque mechanics make it unlike most other games within the same genre. It's highly recomended, even if tis just to waste a single night. There is nothing to lose by just trying it once,

review: 9.5/10 If you've been in a cave for the last 7 years, then you may have not heard of a "Little" game called TF2. TF2 is a class-based FPS, i. e. different characters and loadouts. TF2 strays away from the militaristic style of TF1, and adds a breath of fresh air to the FPS industry, unlike the MONOTONOUS BLACK OPS S- Oops, did I get ahead of myself. The gameplay is so unique, you'll be hooked for life. Every single weapon is different. From rocket launchers to shotguns to pistols to soda to conch shells to lasers to exploding cannon balls - whew. The beauty of this game lies in its totally unique item system. You can acquire items by playing the game, buying them (Hey, they gotta make a profit), or by crafting them. Weapons are used to put up a fight, hats are hard to acquire, but are worth a lot and can make you look like a boss, and tools can be used for various purposes, like opening crates or spreading keys. However, it is F2P, but in a good way. The people who buy the stuff have no clear advantage over the F2Pers. The best part of the game is the classes. They all are different and unique. Take the Soldier. Soldier is your one man army, armed with a RPG, a shotgun, and a shovel, although like all classes, this can be changed. He is a steryotypical crazed patriot from the midwest, and is smart as a pecan. (Not smart). There's also a co-op mode against robots, literal robots who run on piles of money, and the game's fan base can create content on GMOD, increasing the media for this game. One major thing that iffs me is that some things you can unbox from Mann Co Supply Crates (A gimmick for you to buy keys to get a mystery prize) are not even worth how much the key was worth. Stranges and strange parts are sometimes looked down on in the community. Other then that, it's great.

review: One day, I noticed a game I had heard about went free. This day was all the way back in June 2011. The game was Team Fortress 2. Now, TF2 is one of my favorite games--perhaps even my #1. Why? There's a multitude of reasons, but the combination of skill-based shooting, fast gameplay, and completely absurd customization made this game absolutely amazing. I'd definitely recommend Team Fortress 2 to anyone--except Rohan. I tried. He hated it. Apparently the "bad graphics" and "unrealistic look" made him not like the game, as well as the fact that it "wasn't realistic enough because rockets don't kill in one hit". Rohan's an idiot. If Rohan ever recommends a game, don't listen to him. He's an idiot. Don't be an idiot. Don't be Rohan. Play Team Fortress 2. Piss off Rohan and anybody like him with your fancy $5000 spooky glowing golden frying pan . 10/10 would hat simulate again.

review: I think I would find this game as a good phenomenon. SInce this is sort of a new start and experience for me I would think that this would be a very difficult strategetic game. It was very difficult when i tried it out for the first time. For the very first time I was lagging, glitching, everything. Until I realised there were too many tabs open for me. That was until it was broken down and sort of cut down as well. However, Eventually to become a professional gamer in this strategetic shooting game you need some pure skill and lots of teamwork. If you have those sort of aspects I would highly recommend this to you all. If your really into violence, shooting, action all that sort of thing I would highly suggest this game for you.

Trust me, there is basically a section for all people, trading, competive, casual, minigame minun, you'll find your groove and mix and have fun with the game overall.

Last time I was on I joined an achievement server and all the mods were doing was mic spamming and complaining about people going on blue team. ing autistic neckbeards ruined this game. The only trade request are from underage down-syndrome 12 yr olds that randomly pull the trade menu up on your screen to request trade even if u dont want it. This game is a prime example of how a community can ruin a great game. E.g. Cowadooty and Bioware games. This should be renamed to Autistic fortress 2

review: I now have over 10 hours on this game (10.4 to be exact), so I believe I deserve an opinion. Also, I plan to update this review after I have played it for 100, 1000 and 10,000 (if i survive this long) hours to see how my opinion changes and how much value this game saves over time. I am not a fan of FPS games, and the only reason I downloaded this game was "why the hell not, it's free and looks alright". I am very happy I made this decision, since this is one of the best games I have ever played. It is full of action, variety, and, most importantly, explosions! Also, hats. Even though there are items you can purchase for real money in game, they are not necessary. I have enjoyed the game for 8.5 hours before deciding to purchase a sniper rifle, and there is not much difference before and after the upgrade. The game is also a very polished product, no annoyances, only enjoyances. Very good cartoony graphics, subtle humor rarely found in FPS games, and many gameplay options to choose from. Can't recommend this enough, so all kinds of gamers. Whether or not you are a FPS fan, give this game a try, you will be pleasantly surprised.

I've got to give valve some credit for this since there are over 40 weps and keeping them all balanced takes effort. All nine classes in this game have their own little quirky personalities and thier own purpose on the battlefield of the Dustbowl. This game will never cease to amaze you. Oh, and also, HATS!

review: This Game Should Not Be Free If It Wasn't It Would Cost $20.00. This Game Is Extremely Fun. This Game Is On My List Of Top 5 Games Its #1!!!!!!! Well First Of All Theres Alot Of Creative Weapons In The Game And 9 Really Creative Classes Such As, The Scout, The Solider, Pyro, Demoman, Heavy, Engineer, The Medic, Sniper And The Spy. There's Alot Of Stuff In Team Fortress 2 I Wish I Could Say All Of Them But If You Would Like To Figure That Out Yourself GET THE GAME! You Won't Regret It. If You Like A Game Thats Free And A Really Fun GET THIS GAME!

review: The game is nothing like CoD or Battlefield, and its graphics, as some people say it is terrible, is kind of good for a 'cartoon' styled world, rather than a more realistic theme, but this does make it easier to tell the classes of the other players you are playing with. The game is NOT pay-to-win as some people will say, the standard weapons are good, and can kill people who are using unique guns, as the other guns have drawbacks which make it more fair and not overpowered, such as one of the scouts bats dealing damage to yourself if you miss the enemy, causing you to bleed too. BUT, be warned that, due to it being 'cartoon' styled, be sure you are capable of putting up with kids spamming or using the ingame voicechat, or just quickly mute them from the game menu.

review: TF2 is just one of thoes games where you sit down for a molment with a few friends, have a good time, and then question how five hours just went by. While I do find the people that scam trade, and idle a little sketchy at times, I always get excited whenever I come across a new item legitimately. Everything about this game will keep you playing for hours on end, and nothing is preventing me from playing this in my spare time for months to come.

review: This Game made me great in FPS games, It my skills in FPS sharper and look at me now ALMOST NO ONE CAN STOP ME! But Beware you Might end up unlucky. Well to me i dont care if its gonna be lucky or not when im in a serious battle LOL i don't depend on Rare ITEMS or guns,accessories or etc,INSTEAD I USE DEFAULT WEAPONS RATHER THAN USING MY OTHER STRONG GUNS.. STILL THIS is my review!Team Fortress 2 is the most realistic hat simulator created to date. There is absolutely no other simulator quite like this one. The first time you start the simulator, you join a server where you can play a minigame where you show off your hats and items. If you kill a person three times in a row in the minigame, you get your very first hat: the Gibus. This is where it really starts; To play the simulator correctly, you have to spend money in the market place, made by Valve. After that, while you play the minigame, you can find hats which you can trade for, or collect! There is many other people who wants to collect and trade hats, just like you! After you collect enough items and/or hats, try joining a trade server! There, the REAL fun begins! Good luck!

review: So, uh, hi guys. I'm not here to make another joke about... you know... those evil pixels that TWIST OUR VERY HEARTS AND SOULS *ahem* excuse me. Anyway, as I was saying. So, in this game, you can... like, shoot people. Oh, and on a completely unrelated topic, there's this thing called the store. The only thing in there that people consider valuable are Mann Co. Supply Crate Keys. You can use these $2.50 keys to buy Earbuds, which are worth around $47.50. That's a lot of keys. Then, with about ten Earbuds, you can get a hat. But this is not just any hat. This hat... is on fire. I'm pretty sure you can go bald from that, a fire on the hat you're wearng. Anyway, kids, this is a PSA. Don't listen to the jerks calling you a F2P. Soon, you'll find yourself stealing $20 at a time from your mom's purse/your dad's wallet, and you'll be a certified juvenile. Congratulations! 10/10 420blezit noscope 360 WARNING: Side effects may include... Excessive cursing, building rage, anger issues, an overwhelming sense of pride (ONLY TO BE ENDED BY A FREAKING SCOUT MAIN), violent urges, computer throwing, tourettes, autism, and an empty wallet.

A unique game with a fun art style and 9 diverse classes. Tons of weapons, hats, and misc. I would recommend this to anyone who likes FPS. There is no thought about getting this. Easy to run on the worst of pc's. AND DID I MENTION IT'S TOTALLY FREE. There's no doubt about getting this. Get it. Now!

review: Had it for 5 years and only decided to start playing it at the start of 2014 and haven't stopped since! The reason? Well this action packed, round based, comedy driven and absolute ball of fun FPS Multiplayer, is everything you need to have the most fun you could ever get out of gaming and I don't say that lightly! It has 9 very diverse classes you can choose from, all with their own rediculous back story and style of gameplay. Each class is given stock weapons, but can get unique weapons from: *Random drops. *Trading (if you're premium). *Buying from the store. *Gifts. Every weapon can have added cosmetic effects, like killstreaks (every kill done in that specific life, is reset when you're killed) or strange (the amount of kills comitted by the weapon with the specific weapon the strange is added onto), which can have their own sheens on the weapon and more. There are 7 official gamemodes for standard multiplayer and 1 official gamemode for COOP multiplayer, each are quite diverse in gameplay and maps. There are also cosmetics that can be added to your character to make them look snazzy or silly, these are called hats, although there are clothes as well. All this and it's free! (If you don't want to buy anything from the store) I recommend atleast buying the $5 premium, so that you can trade and recieve random hat drops. This game offers so much for so little in return, you have to try it! Anyhow, I give this a 9.5/10, even though it's graphics are outdated, it doesn't matter, the graphics for this game suit it and it won't age at all!

It's the kind of game that you want to show to people who don't play games so that they understand and then either get involved or go away. There is life before Team Fortress 2, and there is life after. After is better. I've never had so much fun losing and being shot :D

review: You get to play as... A speedy smart alleck from Brooklyn that defies physics by jumping in mid air. An ex military man from the midwest with a case of dementia and lead poisoning. Some guy(?) with a fetish for ponies, rainbows, and setting things on fire. a drunk, black, scottish cyclops that makes things go "BOOM". An overweight, minigun toting Russian who has a major in Russian literature. A mild-mannered Texan that builds things by repeatedly swinging a wrench. A manical doctor from Germany who enters a breif state of euphoria after killing someone. A foul-mouthed Australian bushman that kills from afar. And finally, a french man that can only kill people when they're not looking by stabbing them in the back. 11/10, a must play for any who enjoy games that make no sense whatsoever. Fun for the whole family

review: Team Fortress 2. Ah, how amazing it is. This game is one of the best things to happen to me. Why? Because of the sheer awsomeness of it is hard to understand by using words, but i'll try. This game is a fast paced fps that puts you in a seemingly cartoony world where flying drunken sword swiping bomb chucking sticky trapping black scotish cyclopes exist, you already know this is one of the best f2p games you will pick up. This game is different from all the rest, not only because of how it looks, but of the gameplay and classes avalible. the story is told through comics, and thats fine with me.there are 9 classes, The Scout, a fast running loudmouth from Bosten, The Heavy, a Russin family man that will make you piss yourself everytime he opens his mouth, The Engineer, the gentile Texen that can build a sentry that will make your life living hell (if it wasent already), The Demoman, the scotish drunk that you heard about earlyer,The Spy, the french devilish snake that will sneak into the back lines, as well as your mothers bed, The Sniper, a assassin for hire from Austrailia that will take your head off in .5 seconds flat, The Medic, the sasistic healer from Germany that will heal your team as well as stick his medi-gun up the heavys (beeep), The Soldier, the crazy American nut that can blow you into a million giblits, as well as be a flying killing machine that will stick a shovel in the back of your head, and The Pyro, the Pyromaniac that gender is unknown (MatPat's theory has been disproved, sorry) that will w+mi as well as airblast his way through everyone. And that doesnt even cover the gameplay. if you think you should give this game a try, then you are very right. I hope this review helped you, goodbye and gooday, mate (headshots)

The day will come when you have a break, but when you don't want to play it for some weeks, you have already played for hours. Also, you definitely will come back to this awesome game and spend more, maybe hundreds of hours. When you find your first new weapon and have the chance to try it...so great! You learn new technics, new tactics and there are so many weapons, so many different play styles! You want to play as a Knight? No problem! There is a weapon for that!

review: Team Fortress 2 (In case you didn't know) is a class-based first person shooter created by Valve (also owner of Steam). There and nine classes in Team Fortress 2 which are: Scout, Soldier, Pyro, Demoman, Heavy, Engineer, Medic, Sniper and Spy all of which have very humorous personalities, often times very stereotypical. Each class has it's own play-style and a variation of different weapons. It includes about seven different multiplayer modes and it's own game mode called Man vs Machine or MvM for short, in which you fight off against waves of robots trying to protect Mann Co. In a summary, this is a very addicting FPS that I would definitely recommend to anybody who has some spare time, and feels like shooting some dudes up!

review: This is honestly one of the best shooters of our time. With so many weapons and game modes as well as both co-op and pvp, this game represents one of the most well thought out and appropriatly balanced games I, or anyone will ever play. And it is still getting more and more as time goes on. 10/10 would wear the hats again.

review: This is a well made, stylized, team based first person shooter. Teamwork is needed to win at higher levels of play, though lone wolfing is fine on lower skill levels such as on most public servers. There are 9 classes to choose from. Each class has unique weapons and abilities that allow each to fill a unique roll as part of a larger team. This provides for a challenging and rewarding experience when faced against opponents of similar or better skill levels.

review: After I started playing TF2, I couldn't stop. One night, I was unable to sleep, and I was restless in bed, and I saw something appear through my window. After seeing the sillohete, I realied it was the Heavy, HE BROKE INTO MY HOME, AND TOLD ME THIS: "BUY MORE HATS, PLEASE MY MINIGUNS" And that day, I bought 69 hats, and then those hats multiplied into more hats, until the hats became sentient and started to attemt and kill my family. I praised to my lord, shrek, "Please stop making these hats appear!" But nobody responded, then GabeN told me, "TEAM FORTRESS 3 CONFIRMED" I cried. 11/10 GOOD GAME.

review: Anything above a 90 on the metascore is a title you should play. Team Fortress 2 was planned to be a FPS/RTS hybrid in it's early stages but turned out to be one of the most respected and solid FPS titles that doesn't want to be realistic or yet another military based game. The "non-photorealistic" rendering as per it's technical name, is system taxing. That machine on which Half Life 2 runs perfectly on, will see a dip in frame rates (and enjoyment) unless the system is able to handle the higher standards of graphics. The scandal of turning from a paid model into a Free 2 Play model, has people refusing to pick the game up again. The cost of the game was around $15-$20 way back when, and came in the ye' old Orange Box. Profits after doing so increased 2 fold, which is a little known fact. Don't be suprised if you see "Man Co. Store" a lot, which is the paid item store run by Valve. Enjoyment is sure to be found, as it's not really a FPS. The community still calls it a "hat simulator" to this day, thanks to the player class customization. Serious play isn't to be found here. Sit back and just play. Again this is another team based game with 9 classes to choose from. A multitude of weapons and other items for each class will allow you to stand out. 8/10

review: Pros: 1. Game is free. 2. Runs on same engine as games such as Portal 2. 3. Microtransactions are available, but it is set up so that every weapon has its own pros and cons(just because you buy a weapon you won't be op), and you can find and craft them all just by playing the game fairly easy. Clothing and such is also available. You won't have second-class equipment if you don't buy anything. 4. Can waste your life on this game like I did and then sell the stuff you find and craft for cold hard steam store credit. 5. One of the most played games on Steam. Has players 24/7. 6. Game is fun. Cons: 1. You found free FPS perfection. You have nothing to look forward to in life.

review: TL:DR: at the end It was 2011, I had been wandering around best buy when i saw a box case for team fortress 2 for 10 dollars. I wondered why they would be selling the same minimalist game i played on the orange box on my xbox, so i wandered over to the computer section of the store and looked up why someone would buy it on PC. I found that the PC version had more than the 10 maps on the xbox version, it had differnt weapons to pick from and hats too, i thought oh what the hell, and got the game. I came home to set it up on my old cruddy toshiba laptop and as a result caused me to create a steam account, but it couldn't hande it, so i used my brother's laptop whenever he wasn't using it. I fell in love instantly. The multitudes of gamemodes, the custom maps and many achievements to get (and i was an achievement addict back then thanks to my xbox) kept me entertained. My brother got a virus on his computer and blames the custom maps i downloaded because of it (to this day, im not sure if it was the cause). So he didn't let me use it anymore almost a year later it was early 2012, somehow i convinced my brother to play on his computer again when i found out that a few months earlier the game became free to play. A ton of my friends began playing it which made it appealing again. When i came back though everything was about trading, not many went to achievement servers anymore, there were spreadsheets, and things that used to be worth very little (buds were 2 keys and bills were 1) were now jacked up in price. I got used to it though, and adapted to become a good trader, i even met a guy who i called my "partner" and we worked together to trade our way up, and it worked. We got a fireproof diary (which i still dont know what it does) out of pyromania. Despite me finding the deal, he wanted to hold on to it. And around that time i felt him becoming more hostile, I was kind of afraid to ask him to much out of fear that he would run off with the whole thing. And despite my pleads in saying that it would probably triple in value soon (it only doubled, but i was still kind of right) he decided to sell it anyway. And because of my conversations with him being too cautious, he only gave me 25% ( 5 keys out of 20) and i couldn't really do much about it. I was angry. So i created a scheme in which i created a fake account and pretended i had some crazy amount to offer him in a spycrab (look it up if you dont know what it is) and knowing him, he said he had an equal amount (which he didn't). I got lucky and i won it and just like i thought, he changed his name and did a bunch of other things to hide himself. I then used a new fake account (which i pretended was a steam admin of something like that) and told him when he was reported for the spycrab, i investigated and found that the bud he used to have was duped (look that up too). He practically bribed me to keep quiet and i got back a good share of what was mine. He still doesn't know i did this to this day. I lost my tf2 privalages again until late 2013, this year, when i got my own computer. And this was the best time of all for me. From all my previous trading i had a ton of items which raised in value while i was away, i decided (as i didn't need most of it) to do giveaways in different servers. One server in particular (sodahappy) i met a kind admin (still good friends with) who helped me do some giveaways using his admin powers, this influenced me to join the community and become a moderator (so i could do giveways). For a while it was fun. People didn't do the giveaways for only free stuff, but for the fun minigames it had. Such as one where everyone was locked in a small room and had to try and run away while i used a /zap function which killed them if i pressed a button while aiming at them. But then problems started to occur, my giveaways started to become out of hand as everyone was doing them. People no longer cared for the game than the prize. And i got in trouble with the higher up admins because of the amount of zaps ( i had 2800 zaps in the 4 months i was a mod, other mods had no more than 100 in their entire careers). After explaing that issue and a few others i was restricted in giveaways. And over time i got less enthusiastic with it. I left Sodahappy, but i left with a ton of new and good friends on my side who i met through the server. In the recent months i focused on getting my dream unusual (which i wanted long since before free to play was a thing). A texas ten gallon painted gold that was vivid plasma and level 3 or 33 (favorite hat, favorite paint, favorite effect and if you look at my name you can see why the level) After borrowing an entire bud from that admin mentioned above from sodahappy (the first one i met) i purchased the hat for 3.5 buds (with some extra sweets) while it was only worth 2.5. This was because the owner was super reluctant to give it up, but i needed it for its level 33. After paying off the 1 bud debt i felt complete I had a ton of tf2 stuff including my dream hat and i felt it was time to move on. So i gave a lot of my stuff away and stopped playing tf2, revisiting occasionally. Summary/TL:DR: Tf2 is my most played game of all time and i kind of grew up with it. And if i could go back and change anything i wouldn't (maybe except for that  scamming me). As much as it makes me sound like a nerd, Tf2 represents a chapter of my life and i wont soon forget it.

review: You can Pretty much never get tired of this game. You can join any server, and servers can have completly custom maps or models. And if you get tired of the server, you can just find a new one. There are so many diffrent gamemodes and even custom ones, like surfing or pyro dodgeball. There are also tons of wepons. You could be using a sign, or maybe you can hit people with a fish. And so many hats and trading and crafting and much more. I would say this is the perfect multiplayer game.

review: Overall this game has smooth graphics flowing gameplay and beautifull comunnity unlike other games. I think its one of the greatset free games out there. This game is recommended when you first start on steam,but after a while you discover other games you might not play this as much but it's still great. also it's cheap at the cheap price of $0.00 it's perfect.

review: Best hat simulator on the market. I'm serious, I don't even play anymore in fear of being made fun of for having only 10 hats. Sure theres a huge skillcap, a great community, amazing art style, awesome maps, and dedicated developers with tons of unique weapons, but that doesn't matter if you've got ANOTHER MOTHER#$&%*@!NG Ghastly Gibous Pyrovision spy stairstab you. 10/10 Okay

review: If you need to be looking up reviews for Team Fortress 2, you are obviously new to Steam. Now, here is what you should do. Instal this game: This game is literally one of the best FPS and most team oriented I have ever played. And not to mention it is free, I would literally pay $20 for this game any day, and I am sure that everybody else who loves this game would to. You have absolutely no reason not to install.

review: Team Fortress 2. Is an amazing cartoonish themed First Person Shooter. What really cought my eye when playing it was all the differant classes. They each have unique talents. I really love the item trading. There is a whole system for Team Fortress 2 Items. For example. 1 Scrap metal can be traded for 2 Weapons. That kind of thing. Seeing how Team Fortress 2 Is a free game you Really should get it! The Graphics: 8/10 The Voice Acting: 9.5/10 The Objectives: 8.5/10 The Gameplay: 9/10 The Music: 8/10 The overall game: 9/10 I would deffinantly reccomend this game to others!

review: I am a console gamer. Steam is something new to me and I am discovering new stuff daily. Tf2 was one of the first games I got on my laptop and god I was hooked. Now I have lost all interest in console gaming and tf2 has my mind under its control. This game is so freaking fun!!! Its not a typical shooter at all, It has a charm to it and yeah it is a good charm. If you just got steam or you dont have this game, just get it. You will be doing yourself a favor. Overall: Graphics- 8.5/10 Gameplay- 9/10 funability- 10/10 There is so much content in this game for a free game, F2P and P2P players both have fun, This game is a treat. GET IT NOW

review: This Game takes the common multiplayer FPS game and turns it into such a great genre, unlike most ones, their are alot of characters, with personality, and you gotta like atleast ONE, there are huge amounts of gamemodes like capture the flag, king of the hill, and even fan made ones like Murder Ball and Balloon race, with a huge fanbase, atleast 10 people are playing! no matter what time it is, to me, its always TF2 time! *insert TF2 music at the end of all the meet the videos*

review: When you first play this game you'll probably suck at it and you feel like rage quitting and not playing ever again but then you keep playing and you slowly but surely get addicted like the other 50,000 who play the game. All I can say that Team Fortress 2 is another success by Valve as it is a game that you will get addicted to within 1 hour of gameplay. Team Fortress 2 is one of those games that you'll get hooked to and play for the rest of your life. It is full of fun, enjoyment and thrill. It has a variety of classes to play with which means if you're bad with one class you might be good with another class for instance I'm really bad with the Scout while I'm considerably good with the Pyro class. It has a ton of classes consisting of The Scout, Soldier, Pyro, Demoman, Heavy, Engineer, Medic, Sniper and of course the mischievous Spy! Team Fortress 2 is certainly worth your time and many people would say worth your money BUT Team Fortress 2 is a Free To Play game! Althought 95% of the players use money on the game to become premium and to trade it is still a free and fun game. Trading is a HUGE part of the game as making a profit is always on ones mind when people play Team Fortress 2. People spend tonnes of money on the game just to gamble away in a good ole SpyCrab contest or simply just to trade and make a profit. As a former successful trader in Team Fortress 2 and trader in CS:GO trading in games like these are easy and fun at times although there is the occasional scammer. Playing and trading in Team Fortress 2 and CS:GO has made me a giant profit in both games. Overall I've gotta say Team Fortress 2 is one hell of an addicting, amazing and all-rounder game! Would definitely download it and play it. But try not get too addicted. 5 Stars! Would thoroughly recommend this! -ogiX

review: Do not play if you don't want to: Start like a leetle baby and think that everythings prices are equal and then start to learn the prices along with understanding the glory of hats,keys and refs.After that knowing some prices starting to make some metal but find out thats not enough and spend some money on game then starting to rise in the mobster of hat trading (like me) and get afflicted with this tradition.This game is a meth,marihuana,heroin and booze it will always makes you feel good along with making you minute by minute more insane and . Brother if you don' have balls for it,don't play it but if you have the balls for it,marry with this game and know the word: Semper Fidelis. 10/10 *TIMES*

review: Whenever someone thinks of PC gaming, they should think of Team Fortress 2. This game, along with Counter-Strike, has made the FPS genre as it stands possible. The theme is cartoony to match the tongue-in-cheek approach the dev team is taking to death with their sarcastic, satirical humor. Blog posts, shot comics, and constant updates add to an ever increasingly confusing and hilariously strange back-story with absolutely no practical application in game, except to give a base for community-made hats. Did I forget to mention hats, weapons, classes, community maps, mods, and the digitalized hide-and-seek mode of prophunt?

I've played tf2 alot and have so much fun playing with freinds or by myself and your like me who likes to screw around with settings and fixing little things like your hud (heads up display) or hitsounds then you'll love this. The steam community is filled with players looking to make trades and if you like to do buisness then its great.If your new to steam and are looking for a game that you can play and never put down because of the enjoyment thatn get TeamFortress 2.Best thing about it is its free to play:) 10/10

review: This game is a pretty cool game compared to all the other games this one is my favorite. Now this game isn't as much of a "fool around" type of game its more like a "run and gun" game, it is very easily paced by one-anothers game strategy or style of playing. If you were a noob you might or might not get dominated by other gamers that have played this game for over a month. Like many other players, we start hunting achievements and asking for help but you ask yourself "Is this fun?" Hell no! Grab your self a drink and have fun woth it don't hunt for acievements! Thats boring, unlike CoD, BF3, or any other shootin game made by drunk people in companies (jk) this game allows custom customiztions like hats, miscs, and game changing weapons! Each weapon has its own potential, except for weapon reskins, each have many effects such as the Baby Face's Blaster! I would definetly give this a 10/10! Recommended to all gamers!

review: Team Fortress 2 is a first-person shooter and Gaben-conomy simulator. It has a moderately-sized player base, filled with a few different kinds of people. Some include: ** Nooblings asking for free items. I kid you not, this can be a nuisance when playing sometimes. ** Map-makers/editors (Otherwise known as mappers) and people that modify the game's server software to create new game modes or additions to the game (modders). Also, there are modellers, people that create and submit assets to the Workshop for consideration to be included in the game. ** Team-spirited people. There are a few game modes, the most popular being Control Points (defend control points from capture by the attacking team), Capture the Flag, Payload (deliver a bomb cart to the other team) and Mann vs Machine (6 players versus robots of varying class that arrive in waves). In most of TF2's game modes, there are nine different types of mercenary to kill or be killed as. (Most people know these as classes) The only exception is Mann vs Machine mode, where you fight robot versions of these mercenaries. However, the most popular feature of TF2 is the economy. Introduced in 2010, it relies heavily on Steam's trading service. Most items traded are hats or metal. Hat trades are serious business for some people, with sites such as TF2Outpost set up to co-ordinate trades, and some items also have real-world value, so these sites often allow users to trade items for USD/Bitcoins/<currency goes here> or Steam games.

review: Classic, endless class-based combat from the undoutable daddy of the genre. With enough weapons and hats to keep you busy for a long while and the ever amasing numbers of different community made modes, you will find it very hard, if somewhat impossible, to ever get bored. Every class has their own unique personality to bring an extra feeling of character-gamer relation. And it is just unexplainably heartwarming to be the best in this game, to fight the good fight, to win a match back from the brink. And it's free to play, letting gibusvisioned players run free. Just upgrade to premium when you like. My one of my favorite games by a large margin 9/10

It was true! So i installed steam but at first it was only for TF2 but now I have friends on steam that i talk,play,and joke with now all from a simple youtuber and determination. If I have to rate this game it'll be 10 OUT OF ING 10.

review: This is not just a game one plays. Oh, sure it can be, but TF2 is an entire universe to explore. Valve's originally-humble, unique shooter has grown into an even more unique shooter that continues to stand out amongst other multiplayer-centric titles for numerous reasons, and has grown popular across the globe, dwarfing even Valve's own Counter-Strike. Is this game for everyone? Maybe not, but they're in the minority. This game stands out mainly because it continues to receive support and updates seven-plus years after its initial release, and Valve seems to figure out the next big thing from time to time. The growth of TF2 has allowed people entering into this microcosm of gaming to play it the standard way, play it more vanilla-style (like when it first came out), play a co-op mode, make replays and SFM videos, play on custom maps and modded servers, and more. All of this is at the fingertips of anyone with Steam access. See that "Play Game" button up there? Click it and give this game a shot, at least.

I would say that getting into the trading can take a while because everybody is like " I want 28.3462384 keys for this or that" FINAL SCORE 9999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999 out of 10 hats.

review: Possibly one of the greatest first person shooters developed, due to its unique style, character diversity and likeable personality. Though slightly hampered by the occasional chat spammer, multiplayer is relatively enjoyable overall. Would definitely recommend this game to people new to the genre - learning curve is quite shallow and the ingame tutorials as well as the community guides do much to aid new players. Those coming from a different FPS, particularly more formal and "FPSish" games like Battlefield or CoD may find it a bit hard to adjust to the different playstyles, but everyone adapts eventually.

review: A game I can have non-stop fun with Multi-class action on amazing maps with a HUGE variety of weapons to kick  with and INSANE amounts of cosmetics to show off! As of the Love & War update this game got 200% more fun, new taunts like Conga, Skullcracker, Flippin' Awesome give a new depth into the game as co-operation from both sides of the fight is pretty common now! For new players, this game may seem like a bore, because of the masses upon masses of weapons (which you may not have yet) or the large amount of maps and gamemodes that may seem new to you (Payload, Payload Race, Control Points etc.), but trust me, with 1300+ hours I can say each second was well-spent either destroying the opposing team or dancing with them! Either way this game is a blast and I definately recommend it to anyone! 95/100 Pyros are still fairly over-powered, a list of things to nerf: Speed Decrease (10%) Flamethrower DPS (10%) Backburner + Phlog Mini-crit instead of crit Sexcellent game.

review: Great game for COD fans... no it's alot better than that crap... Valve, you have outdone yourself yet AGAIN. While it may not have the best graphics in the world, it is still a great shooter game. In my opinion the best class is either Sniper or Spy. Sniper because you can snipe people from many different distances... AND get a great shield from Spies. Speaking of Spies, they are great because you can turn invisible and walk up behind someone, then morph into someone on their team and backstab them. Everyone can try it, after all, it's free! All out great game and i definately reccommend it.

review: This game is unfathomably good. I don't even like first-person shooters, and not only do I still like TF2, it's actively my favourite game of all time. There are 9 classes, each with different playstyles, and each with a bunch of different weapons you can use to fine-tune the class to how you want to play. It's impressive how balanced the game is - each weapon has benefits and drawbacks compared to the stock weapons you have when you first start the game. There are a few whose benefits outweigh the drawbacks and vice-versa, and a couple that are literally direct upgrades, but you never feel like you're at a huge disadvantage by not having certain weapons. The fact that the game's around 7 years old and they're still updating it is incredible. The Mann vs. Machine update added a new game mode that's a sort of tower defence game. It could have been its own $20-$30 game, but nope, Valve gave it to everyone for free. There are some advantages premium players have over free players, but none of them directly affect gameplay - Premium players can keep more items and trade. Trading makes it so easy to get weapons and Premium can cost less than a dollar, so I really don't see any reason to not upgrade yourself to Premium. I guess at some point I have to talk about hats. They seem silly, right? Why bother making so much of the content have no effect on gameplay? But that's exactly why they do it! A new weapon isn't just about modelling and scripting. You have to make sure it's balanced and can't be exploited in any way. But hats and other cosmetic items can't possibly be 'unbalanced', so of course they can add a hundred hats easier than they can add one new weapon. Maybe they could focus more on weapons, but there are already so many as it is; you don't want to make it impossible for new players to catch up. So obviously TF2 is amazing. 10/10 would play again and probably will this afternoon. There are, however, a few drawbacks. TF2's normal devotion to balance makes it all the more glaring when something isn't balanced. The Soldier has so much versatility in his weapons that it's pretty easy to call him /the best class/ in a game that's supposed to be about teamwork. It's pretty easy to see Valve playing favourites with the Soldier. If some class has a weapon that players are favouring over the other options, most of the time Valve will nerf the over-used weapon (ex. the Spy's Dead Ringer). But for the Soldier, they'll just buff the under-used weapons (ex. The Concheror and Battalion's Backup). Giving the Soldier extra upgrades in Mann vs. Machine also reeked of favouritism when it's the Spy and Pyro who needed the help. One other drawback is that the store's prices on weapons has absolutely nothing to do with how rare / common they are. This isn't really Valve's fault, but it makes a lot of things in the store complete rip-offs. Suppose you want a Phlogistinator. It costs $10 in the store. OR you could buy four Keys ($2.50 each). Each key is worth, in the trading economy, about 100 Phlogistinators. I'm not exaggerating. (Phlogistinator: 0.05 - 0.11 refined. Key: about 8.66 refined.) Basically, once you know a little bit about the economy, you feel like you have to REALLY get into it so you don't get ripped off. Or maybe that was just me.

review: The game is fun. The community is normally SO much better than that of Cod's or BFF's. The micro-transactions are good too. You can get almost anything from item drops in-game. And there are so many different gamemodes! You have the default ones, Doomsday, CTF, CP, but then you have community made ones (that I think some should be real ones,) Freak Fortress 2, Arena, X10, all very fun! It's also very easy to record, as you can easily set up events, give yourself a challenge, or simply shoot at things! All the classes are very different as well, and can help eachother on the same team, (Medic + Heavy) or can destroy eachother on the opposing team, (Sniper + Spy or Spy + Pyro.) Anyways, I recomend this game to everyone, even if you dislike FPS games, because to be honest, this game will never be normal. It's to late to go back.

review: A very enjoyable, but not perfect game. For 2007, this game is doing very well as it is constantly being updated and modded, proving it can stand the test of time. The graphics aren't great, but for running on a game published in 2007, they can be quite impressive. With many different game modes and items, this game offers tons of variety and replay value. I recommend it.

The maps and creations by the players are absolutely wonderful as well as the modes you can play against your opponents. The Mann Vs Machine mode keeps you focused on the goal of the game and you can have tons of fun doing it. 10/10!

review: I played this game over a year ago, and after getting hardware that can run Steam, coming back to Team Fortress 2 brings back the same excitement. There are nine playable classes, so it's easy to find one or more that fits your playstyle while contributing to your team's victory. Additionally, you can get items to further customize your character based on how you fight. You do have to buy a cheap item in order to expand your backpack, and playing more than ten hours a week does not grant additional items. However, this game is still practically a staple for anyone who has steam, and I've heard that the hats are pretty cool :P

review: TF2 is a free to play fighting game with classes such as the heavy, demoman, pyro, medic, spy, soldier, sniper, engineer, and scout.Each class has a certan weakness to another class.For example the spy can sap engineers sentrys and pyros can reaveal cloacked spys.You can also trade a multitude of items like hats and weapons.

review: Team Fortress 2 is the only competitive multiplayer shooter that I have ever played consistently. I've tried others, but in the end, I've always quit after realizing that I don't have the time to compete with the guys who can play these games all day long. I'm sure some people love memorizing all the weapon pickup locations and mastering the jumping, spinning, no-scope headshot, but that ain't me. With the game's nine very specialized classes, you're very likely to find something that really just suits your play style just right. Even as a newb, the class strengths are so drastic, you can almost always get in a few kills if you just do what your class does best. The experience is always lighthearted and 90% of the community is friendly. With loads of unlockable weapons, there's not only a lot of incentive to keep playing, but there ends up being quite a bit of customization within the nine classes as well. For instance, the Pyro's flare gun changed the entire game for me!

review: A good game with memorable characters and decent gameplay, but with a few issues like server lags(during mvm this is a real pain in the butt) and most of the time unbalanced teams ( I mean that if one or two advanced players join in one team and the other, may it be beginner or decent players are just going to get screwed by them and most of the time leave the server). Another thing, but that does not bug me that much, is that way too many players are at the age of ten or even lower( I think I met someone who told me he was six or seven). As I said, it`s not a big deal for me, but for many other (older) players who are just annoyed by them( for example because of mic spamming). But all in all, Team Fortress 2 is a fun game.

review: This is such a great game. It's also a good thing that it's free. Now that's said, it's put two good things together: Good Game + Free = EPICNESS! (then again, I guess it is an F2P) It's graphics are good, it's range of characters and weapons are excellent and it's an all-round good game. It is very easy to get to grips with, the controls are easy and it's probably a game that can be played by anyone, even those who are less confident with FPS games. Also, a funny aspect is the cartoon-y graphics and the certain characters faces when the post-kill video is shown. Definitely one to download. Just switch on your computer, start Steam and click the download button. It's easier than riding a bike!

Download the damn game already, wear your ghostly gibus with pride, find super amazing crates, use high-tech weaponry, fly jets, ride ponies, call in airstrikes, kill terrorists, fight bears, submit to peer pressure and buy more hats, destroy your future, become a drug dealer, invite some friends and have fun.
game-hours: 635.4
review: Overall, i definitely recommend this game to anyone. With 9 versitile classes to choose from, hundreds of weapons, and an infinite number of playstyles for each class, tf2 is a HIGHLY addicting game. Working as a team or simply dominating by yourself, gameplay is amazing with every class. There is another aspect other than just fighting; there is trading! Many people trade on tf2 to get different types of weapons like stranges, festives, vintages, etc. and getting HATS. Some unusual hats can be worth hundreds of dollars! The best part of all, is that the game is free. And although you may have to buy that 99 cent giftapult to go premium, i believe i would have payed 60 dollars for this game, maybe more. That's just how awesome this game is :D

review: This is the one of the best Valve games made . Team Fortress 2 has hats that make you look cooler, and one of the items you can get is a Assassin's creed refrence to the hidden blade. The people you can play as are awesome, The Pyro, The Scout, The Medic, The Soldier, The Spy, The Demoman, the Heavy and the sniper. All of them have there ways of killing people and there all awesome to play as and I thank Valve for updating Team Fortress 2 with all the awesome stuff in the game. So what I say is you should dowload it. It's free after all and it's one of the best games I have ever played.

With a comical 50's setting and time, TF2 picks stereotypes of those times and show them off in nine different classes full of fun. It's a Free-to-play game that includes Co-Op horde mode and competitive. You have my recommendation to dive into this great game!

review: Even though its been out for a long time, it is still a very fun game. There are 9 different classes, (one example is scout which can run really fast and double jump) they each have their own styles. I really love this game because unlike other games where you can change your gun giving maybe a -1% accuracy or somethibg, changing items in this game can make a huge deal. There are also lots of new updates that come out and cool hats, suits, etc. All these things make the game really fun to play. I would recommend this game. 10\10 in my book.

review: This Game stands out to it's name. Yes:It requires teamwork(Unless you are a selfish "Pro" player) The teamwork:It teaches you to respect others,the whole team must use teamwork and fast co-ordination to win a game,not only does it make your team Great but it also makes it easier for new fps players to learn. The Only dislikes:Underestimation from COD and solo-multiplayer games that dont require teamwork cod does teach you to do stuff alone but it makes you self-centered and selfish,Team fortress 2 has alot of customization options and is more friendly to computers with bad specs, only 21% of the squeeker population are from tf2 and 66% from Call of duty. Come to think of it tf2 introduces more violence than COD because of explosions that make you shatter into 7 pieces and also blades that can chop your head off,You cant say that tf2 is for young children to play.The reason why some young children slip through is because of their parents no keeping a good eye on them. Call of duty has 0% gore and is a child friendly shooter. For People who under-estimate tf2 are probably thai s and call of duty players. In team fortress 2 there is a wide range of things to do. :You Can Shoot a rocket under your feet and still fly in one piece. :create custom maps and mods. :Play on a no kill server and still have fun getting drunk and doing fun things. For people who only care about graphics:For the last time, good graphics and crap gameplay=99.9% bad game. Its not about the graphics but its about the heart and emotion you put into the game. A game doesnt need good graphics to be fun. Look at all the poor people who dont have enough money to get a good graphics card and cpu and etc. they need to expierience fun too.

review: Out of all the Dress-Up Sims I have ever played this is by far the worst. There's only two uniforms you can wear, blu or red. The only redeeming quality of this Dress-up Sim is the plethora of hats one can equip to their avatar. Unfortunately in order to do this, one has to stand around doing nothing for hours on end with the chance of even FINDING one of these hats. One thing the creators of this game may want to consider is the ability to at least swap clothing between the different "characters" one can choose for their avatar. That really really big man would look much better in the suit on the scrawny guy, who in turn would look much better with a nice bowler or something instead of a sock on his head. All in all I give this game a 4/10.

review: I recommend this game is because it is just awsome!!! And why it is so awsome is because it ain't just some shooting game oh no it ain't just no shooting game you can find cool weps for all of your 9 characters. And I can't forget the hats and miscs thats right you can costumize your own character you can get him hats and miscs and maybe if your lucky you'll get a unusual those are the best types of hats you can get. Well thats all I got to say today but hey one more thing trust me if you get this game "you won't regret it". Sencirley yours "SniperxProx456".

review: Ah, where do i start about this game! First of all of them, the basic mechanics: You can choose from 9 different classes anytime while you are ingame. You and your team have to complete an objective. But, after you starting to get into it a lot you start to notice the other stuff: all the weapons you can get, all the cosmetics you can wear and the super amazing community that suports this outstanding game! You can either play the game, or start doing some trading stuff. Either way, this game is recommended for anyone: if you like teamplay, shooting people or robots or just doing some absolute nonsense GET THIS GAME!!! Final rating: 10/10 stole my life away and i still come back here everyday.

MVM: This is a fun gamemode, you have to defeat robots in order to win the wave, Collect money to upgrade your player. There is a variety of maps, you will never get bored! PVP: Two teams battle it out on a mission to win the match, there are many game modes, from CTF to Payload race. Pvp is personally my favorite, you can verse your friends or even other people, you can rank up in competitive mode and you can also unlock cool cosmetics! This game is by far my favorite game so far with many updates to come! 10/10

review: Team Fortress 2 is the best First-Person shooters I have ever played. The characters are very entertaining, and their personalities top of to that factor! It's not even just the classes, (Even though they are the best part of the game) the many different weapons, and moves and .... HATS! Hats are the thing you will see under your eyelids when you sleep from now on. Listen up, cupcakes! This is going to be a Hell of a ride! Especially on 2013's Scream Fortress. Anyways, I reccomend it, the gore/violence is very comical, and is mostly swear-free. (Watch out for Scout though, he's a real bugger...)

review: I recommend this game since it gave me so much boners that the boners were boners inside a boner that boner was a boner and a boner. Enough boners. Playing Team Fortress was Really great! The music, the game style! And the weapons! The weapons are really equal! They have a bad and a good side! My favorite classes are the Heavy, Spy, Scout, and Medic! And being the medic gave you a medi gun! The Medi gun would Ubercharge which would make you invincible while killing your foes! I really recommend this game to new players.

review: If you haven't played this before, you may be asking yourself: "What is Team Fortress 2?" Firstly, you sound like David Byrne. Secondly: Team Fortress 2 is setting a spy on fire without knowing he's there. Team Fortress 2 is hitting an engineer with the Force-a-Nature so hard that he flies into the air and can only watch as he falls to his death. Team Fortress 2 is getting 10 kills in a row without spinning down your minigun. Team Fortress 2 is getting all of the control points in one life. Team Fortress 2 is backstabbing every sniper on the map. Team Fortress 2 is dominating the entire other team. Team Fortress 2 is earning the trust of a Medic so he Ubercharges you and you kill the entire other team. Team Fortress 2 is backstabbing an engineer and sapping his sentry. Team Fortress 2 is knocking someone out of the map with your Atomizer. Team Fortress 2 is fighting off a horde of robots with nothing but a flamethrower and a large lollipop. Team Fortress 2 is blowing up a Heavy with a clump of stickybombs he didn't even know whas there. Team Fortress 2 is FUN AS HELL.

Easy to pick up and play, but tough to master especially when playing people with 100 stacks of hats in their inventory.

review: the game that has made me, laugh and had fun through most of my time on steam. this game is one of the best games ever made, customanization of your classes funny, weird and awsome hats, same with the miscs, tons of weapons and many taunts. they game is one of the best games to play if you need to let off some steam ( haha steam joke ). finding weapons take a while but it doesnt matter from all the fun you have inbetween. 8 plus gamemodes, halloween events that will astonish you and amazing custom maps. one of the best custom gamemodes is saxton hale, instead of just saxton you have a few more, including the easter bunny. smalls knives to golden miniguns. humans to giant robots, samurais to clowns with guns. this game is one of the best made and funniest games i have played in a long time. in halloween you can fight a giant flying eyeball that shoots smaller versions of it that explode. the headless horse man himself! an evil wizard called merasmus, he can spawn the king skeliton that will summon more smaller skelitons. want to make an item and put it on the workshop for an update? sure, steam will look at all of the items made and choose what one will be good for the update, then it will be put into the game. this game also promotes other games, like left for dead? get it and you will get bills hat in tf2, like left for dead 2? you will get ellis's hat, this game is deffinitly worth playing, its you simply cannot fall inlove with this game on first sight, sure people dont like this game but thats their opinion, this is my opinion, so if you liked what i said, get the game, oh and its FREE! sure you can buy stuff with real money ingame but it doesnt force you to. this game deserves a 99/10. enjoy the game, play it as much as you like. enjoy

review: Ok Lets talk a bit TF2. I love this game for many reasons. To the Classes to the Hats, I love everything about TF2(expect mini-sentrys). TF2 Out of all the Fps I played gave me a feeling of enjoyement like no other. Some will say that if its the gameplay, or the style of the game, or maybe the commuinty this game has. And its all of that. TF2 gamestyle is centered around 9 classes in which have complete diffrent play styles and mechanics, and that alone should be a selling point, but in addtion to that this game has diffrent weapons for each class that changes some points of game play but is true to what the class is(expect demo...but I love demoknighting). With this much varity you might say that this game might have some op stuff, and the amazing truth is that nothing is better than a other thing(expect medic and pyro melee weps) and it gives this game a curve with the sill of the player. Now back to the classes, the classes themslves are a reason to play, for the lines and personitly given to each are things that gives life into these mercs. Now one thing I have to talk about when talking about TF2 is Hats. That alone sales this game. Hats. Hats. Without poking fun of our hat sim overcomings, TF2 has cosmation on the Classes that puts some flair on them either makes your class Cool looking or just a joy to look at. These Hats give people also to start a Encomy within the game, and has no impact on the gameplay of the game other than it looks cool. I hate play to win game...but TF2 is what I call Pay to look fancy(yeah that sounds dumb). And last The commuinty whever it be the workshop, groups, reddit, or tumblur. TF2 has a Amazing commuinty in which I have seen noting negative at my time playing, but sure some commuinty's have those bad eggs yet they dont ruin the bunch like other games. And hey this game is pretty old from being a mod to its classic mode, and to the Team Fourtress we come to love this game has aged well, and I got to say I love every minute of playing it. And to finally top it all of( and I know i missed stuff but im lazy) this game still gets updates and I say that because of us who keeps on pushing that cart or wrangling them sentrys, and those who Noms away and bonks away, those who pop uber and those who pops heads. from the backstabers to the backburners. And the demos and sollys still in this war. I give this game a 10/10 would recommend to all.

review: Short Review: Virtual Hat Simulator. With Cash. (Relatively) Long Review: - Storyline The plot is simple. There is a war going on between the Builders League United (BLU) and Reliable Excavation Demolition (RED), both subsidiaries of TF Industries. However, due to problems lacking an obvious bureaucratic solution, mercenaries are contracted to address the situation through war. You join one of the two teams (not permanently) and play as one of the nine mercenaries (hereby named 'classes') which each has its own unique features in a war to Attack/Defend (e.g. Payload, Attack/Defend Control Points) or to gain control (e.g. King of the Hill, 5CP, Special Delivery) - Gameplay/Classes The nine classes all play an important role in the game and having too many (or the lack thereof) of one class leads to an imbalanced team, causing the team to suffer heavy penalties in terms of co-operating to push towards their objective. The nine classes, Scout, Soldier, Pyro, Demoman, Heavy, Engineer, Sniper Medic and Spy all have their own distinct features, ranging from invisibility cloaks to the all common 420blazeit sniper. The weapons are more or less well-balanced, in the sense that no weapon is vastly considered to be better than the stock or another weapon, although it does suit different fighting styles. With new maps (almost, or at least somewhat) consistently introduced, you get a different gameplay each time as you encounter players who genuinely help the team, players who go in alone and complains no one is there to help, or players who are so accurate with their shots and low ping you don't stand a chance (unless you lag shot them with your 500 ping). You might also join a "friendly" server where you see players just taunting and "Conga-ing" or walking around, and killing them earns you a kick or a callout for a . - Weapons Most weapons are attained through item drops which occur as you play, so as to "encourage playing" until the item drop cap for that week is reached. Strange and Festive variants can be obtained by using keys (purchased with Steam Wallet) to unlock normal, rare and seasonal crates. These are however, purely cosmetic and do not affect gameplay in anyway (besides distracting you). Using the weapons you get, you can craft them into another weapon of your liking or even get a chance to craft a more uncommon reskin weapon, such as the Mauler and Sharp Dresser. Some weapons can also be obtained via achievements and in general, the weapons are considered sidegrades -- except for several Medic melee weapons, all the weapons can be considered to be both better and worse than the stock weapon you are given. - Cosmetics Team Fortress is well-known for its hat simulator. Using the weapon drops you get, you can craft them into Refined Metals and eventually recombine them to get a common (named as 'Unique' ingame) quality hat (TF2 Premium DLC is required, obtained upon any in-game store purchase). Rarely, you may also get hats or even taunts via item drops. This purely decorates your character but does most of the gameplay here. See that cool-looking unusual guy? Aim him. See that "noob" gibus guy? Aim him. See that guy with a thousand kills on his strange weapon? Aim him. That "vanilla" guy who just started playing? Aim him. (That was rubbish) The cosmetics also run all of the trading in TF2 and it is what allows you to actually earn (or lose) money (in terms of keys) and/or Steam Wallet (by selling the keys on the market). If you are lucky during an unbox, you can also get an Unusual-quality cosmetic or taunt, basically a normal cosmetic or taunt with an additional effect, and this fetches a very high price in the market due to its highly valued effects (market and player dependent). - Economy I will not go deep into this, but it's pretty safe to say that you can play the game fine if you do not care for cosmetics and you can simply find some traders or trading sites to exchange for the weapon you want. There is a large amount of reviews and opinions regarding TF2 trading, ranging from "easy to earn stuff" to "too many sharks/scammers/profiteers" and "impossible to earn stuff" etc. As such, trading is based on their own personal experience which is unique to almost everyone and this cannot exactly be reviewed.

review: You probably know what this game is. Lets be honest, everyone has probably heard of Team Fortress 2 the moment they got on steam. Team Fortress 2 is a free-to-play shooter with a cartoony art style, and an unusual way of playing that sets it apart from other shooters. In Team Fortress 2, there are 9 classes, each with its weaknesses and advantages. Along with the basic shooting, classes have their own unique abilities that help on the battlefield. However, this game is not only famous for the click & shoot, it has one of the most interesting (and complicated) economy that I enjoy to participate in. You can work your way up to be able trade in-game items for actual steam games. This game also doesn't tax your machine and even on low settings is lovable with it's computer-friendly artstyle. Even though it's been released a long time ago, Team Fortress 2 still maintains it's freshness and uniqueness.

review: Wow, what an amazing game... To start off, I have got to say this is probably one of the most enjoyable games I have ever played. Team Fortress 2 provides the experience that no other shooter provides. It is loaded with action, comedy, and most importantly, HATS! The new taunts/hats/weapons added to this game are incredible! The community is amazing, and the workshop is just fun to browse through. There is so many original ideas that it is hard to believe! Team Fortress 2 also is the best class shooter games out there, and also provides the option of customization! With the customization, you can put sick shades on your character, or put a cardigan on. It is your choice. Customization also includes choosing your weapons (changing your stock weapon to a unique weapon, such as the Quick-Fix) and choosing taunts. Taunts can be as zany as throwing fried chicken, or it can also be as simple as laughing at the opponent. The options are almost endless! The weapons are special in there own way as well. You can put a sheen and effect on it (if you get a special kit) which allows you to pimp out your weapon! Weapons also can be renamed and descriptionized, so there is no fear of a terribly named weapon. Team Fortress 2 is also amazing because it is not "Pay 2 Win". Team Fortress 2 gives you almost all of the normal options a premium has, such as hats, taunts, and finding weapons. Oh, I forgot to mention about the weapon drop system. In this game, you are capable of finding any weapon in the game (except for promotional game items). In added bonus if you get premium is that you can also find hats! I once found an All-Father, which is an amazing beard! Team Fortress 2 also has its own economy. That's right! The economy is used to buy items you desire, without having to buy it with real money or waiting to find it! In conclusion, I enjoy Team Fortress 2 a LOT, and recommend this to all! Oh, and here are some ratings: Enjoy Factor= 10/10 Original Factor= 9/10 (it is a shooter, which has been done, but it stands out!) Friendliness Factor (Community)= 10/10 Smoothness Factor (how long you can play it)= 10/10 OVERALL SCORE= 9.75 Thank you for reading my review, and have a fun time gaming! -Detective Doge "The Almighty and Original Doge"

review: First, let me just say that this game is the most amazing FPS I own at the time. Do you know what makes this even better? ITS FREE! Yes, of course they require you to pay to purchase items in the store. You also have to buy one item to get upgraded to premium. This allows you to trade. Luckily, you can still experience the game quite well without spending your dough. The trading element to the game is wonderful. Who ever thought to add a trading mechanic to an FPS? Certainly not Activision (Call of Duty Designers), that's for sure. Valve managed to incorperate the perfict balance of comedy, along side the seriousness of a tacticle FPS. The nine classes are so unique, and they can all work in unison, in order to lead you and your team to victory. In my opinion, the only thing this game lacks are more weapons, and a team death match game mode. I rate this game 9.2 rare hats out of 10.

review: Probably the only game I love to play, Team Fortress 2 just creates a journey to a place where hired men are killing each other for mining grounds. The updates are amazing, you'd be surprised about the prices they have instored in the Mann Co. Store! But all in all, the game is fun and in each big update they make this amazing Source Film Maker movie! I love the Valve crew even though they're ripping us off, but what are you gonna do? If it's too expensive don't be a whiny prick, if you have money then welcome to the world of hats and miscs!

Game is preety balanced, and there is a plenty of classes from which you can choose your favoutite one, depending if you like to be someone like soldier who can bring massive damage, or maybe more of a support class like medic, who can heal and save others lifes. There are different kind of games, for example, king of the hill, or attack & diffense, or capture the flag, and much more. Bunch of events stuff included; and amazing long list of weapons and other items that you can obtain throught game experience.  I would recomand this game to anyone who like to play FPS Multiplayer games.. and if you decide to play it, then maybe, but just maybe.. we'll meet each other on the batllefield where i'm going to kick your ASSteroids.. :)

review: You might wonder why this game is any different than any other fps game and the answer is that the classes provide stratagies other than "shoot the things" which, combined with many updates makes this game have loads of hours of gameplay, possibly even infinite. My proof of this is that this game is 7 almost 8 years old (at the time of this post) and still going strong. Last but not least it is free. (not including microtransactions which are only on a few low level items that you can get for free anyway, some tuants and keys.) The shop is my only criticism and it's not a big one.

review: Now that it's free-to-play, I highly recommend to have it just for the hell of it. I bought this about a year and half ago with the Orange Box and boy, I think I have gotten way more than I bargained for. It's fun, it's got machine guns, there're plenty of weapons to try out: I suggest you upgrade your F2P status to premium to enjoy all of the features! This game takes the meaning of "worth it" beyond and keeps on giving.

review: Team Fortress 2 is one of the best Free to Play Action Games out in virtual entertainment. This game is free; the illustration is not overpowering, but playful and provides a satisfying mood and the performance of in-game action and the game istelf is sensational. 9 classes to play and master and a myriad of maps and servers to aquaint yourself with. As a consequence, a perfect equillibrium of competition and playfulness is established; One of the most intruiging aspects of this game. Furthermore, once you become satisfied with your efforts in-game, your temptation for miscallaneous items and unusuals,stranges eg. will become un-challengeable. You might waste all your money on this game for virtual items, or possibly make a single investment and further expand your virtual inventory with virtual currency. The only downfall it seems, is the frustration of being dominated by players far superior than yourself, however, with time your skills will be able to fairly match those that were once your nemsis. In conclusion after over a thousand hours, I believe my experience is valid and dependable to give you viewers and other fellow Team Fortress 2 comrades an oppertunity to further appreciate and give an insight to Team Fortress 2. This is my absolute and mode game that I have ever indulged myself (or Runescape), even as fast approaching adult. I enjoy this game, and hopefully so do you :) Wishing you all success in your virtual endeavours! - Geebert

review: I've been playing this game for over 1,200 hours, got deep into trading for cool hats and miscs wich is what the game is mostly about nowdays, anyways i gotta say that those were the best 100 days of my life. This game is extremely fun with the variety of classes and task each one provides you with, either is destroying an engi nest as a Spy, saving your teammates from death as a medic or just going all  train as a Medic & Heavy combo on a defended area, this game just provides hours of fun and makes you still want to play it after a long time doing so, either by adding gamemodes made by the community or just relaxing in a pub while discussing about Half Life 3 it will provide you with hours and hours of fun no matter what. Also you need to pay so you don't get harassed by P2P players but besides that its a really amazingly well-made game.

review: Your basic first person shooter. Two teams, nine classes all vary in strategies of play. Some of the most incompitent people play this game. Also the economy is based off of hats that autistic s buy to increase e-peen size and maybe scare a russian or BR who actually still plays this overloaded peice of  into running away instead of fighting you.

review: TEAM FORTRESS 2 RECOMMENDATION REDUX EDITION WITH BONUS DLC HAT: Tired of fighting in MODERN WARZONES? Team Fortress 2 takes you to a wonderful humourous world where two groups battle it out for buisness. Team Fortress 2 is a class-based shooter that focuses on objective-based game types, featuring 9 playable with their own set of perks and traits to assist you in your playstyle. Before you read/play, if you're used to your common MODERN FPS skills, that's all in the trash here. Nothing of what you played before will carry over effectively into this game, which means there's a lot of new learning to be done in terms of combat effectiveness. Each class plays with variety and it can take some time to getting used to, but once you find your "main class" then it'll be a breeze from then on their. Scout is fast, Soldier does damage, Pyro burns, Engineer builds turrets, Heavy tanks, Demoman traps, Medics heal, Snipers... snipe, Spies stealth. Pretty simple, but each of their mechanics have some time getting used to, you can't expect to be a great Spy if you main Scout. A lot of these classes work in conjunction with each other and have their own proper counters. The game features a lot of unlockable weapons and aesthetic items for each of the classes as well, with major differences to alter their gameplay. Now you're thinking, Balance... Right? The game itself remains balanced most of the time, however, along with its ever-changing updates, their has been some weapons released that are slightly more powerful than they should be. However, thankfully, Valve is quick to fix it. (Valve and Quick in the same sentence.. that's weird) The setting takes place in a wacky and cartoon world set aroudn the 1960s, the game is humourous and the characters feature a wonderful set of personality I have yet to see in a multiplayer shooter. Many of the aesthetics features hats and misc. items such as beards and mask that you can decorate your character with (if you like) The game also features a prominent trading community, but if you don't want to deal with people I recommend using TF2WH which features bots. That's about it, the game is Free-To-Play too, so why not? (It's not Pay-To-Win either) Team Fortress 2 reinvents the old forumla of fragfest into a smart reinvention and redemption of a gamestyle long lost in a sea of "Realistic" shooters.

review: TF2 or Team Fortress 2, is a great game with fundamental features that makes it one of the most unique games I have ever played. There are several elements that go into a game that make a good game, well-good. GRAPHICS/ART STYLE The graphics for TF2, isn't the most amazing, but with the artstyle it has, it makes the game fun and enjoyable. The characters are expertly created and always find a way to make you laugh. Whether Spy's back stabbing, rude nature, to Heavy's "stoopid" like appearance. GAMEPLAY This is a no-brainer it seems. The game is perfectly balanced and gives no one and edge. However classes may seem to counter a certain class, but with different items, you can counter them. An example is the Pyro and Spy. Pyro can easily find the Spy, no matter what sneaky beaky hiding spot he may have, but, with help from the spy-cicle or the dead ringer, the Spy can fool the Pyro (Unless you play competetivly, then thats a different story). LEVEL DESIGN Being a level designer myself, I love to have well made, well balanced maps to play on. And boy, does VALVe get a gold star on this! Sure, some maps can be a bit defender sided (Hoodoo, Dustbowl), but with a good team a good communication, you can power through any enemy defences (Unless you play competetivly, then thats a different story). BONUSES I've covered all the fundamentals game mechanics that I see, but what about the other part? The drops? Trading? Hats? I mean, its nick-named Hat Simulator 2014 for a reason, right? Hahahah, correct you are! TF2 awards players who play any where from 20 minutes to 2 hours with a random drop! Whether its a weapon, hat, or a big  yo-I MEAN CRATE. With these items, you can craft them, or trade them! And the more virtual items you have, the more...virtual items you have... CONCLUSION I (and my 900+ hours) highly recommend this game, and its free! So why not?

review: There is a reason why I have played as many hours as I have of this game. Too many for me to list so i'll just say this. Team Fortress 2 is unlike any game I have played before because of not only it's concept but also the community. This game gives the community the opportunity to do these ridiculous feats and it's great so just be able to see these things happen. Try it out at least twice(with a break in between) because the first time I played, I uninstalled pretty fast.

review: An amazing FPS Shooter. The classes are well-balanced and the graphics are amazing and cool. I consider this as one of the best games ever created. TF2 has a created Milestone on gaming history and shall not be forgotten. Buying items in this game is also worth it. The maps are well-made and their is a very active workshop in steam. Maps get added to TF2 from time to time. Or to shortten it. AMAZING.GAME. Well done, Valve :D

review: Not just another mindless shoot 'em up FPS like most games, Team Fortress 2 offers unique bonuses to each class, giving it a slight RPG feel, as certain classes can counter others, such as spy beats engineer, pyro beats spy, heavy beats pyro. Many feel as though classes like the engineer are over powered, the only one that's over powered is the scout, as he can deal high amounts of damage, while circling around you, avoiding being hit, what makes it worse, he has an item, to literally, make him untouchable for a short period of time, not even a level three sentry, which can take a heavy, head on, can touch a scout who drank Bonk, and with the new update, scouts who have the newest weapon, are even more over powered, scouts are already hard to hit, and can easily get behind you, and the new weapon deal bonus damage from behind for the scout!

review: More than just a FPS. Three things are needed to win, FPS skill, Class Skill and Team Skill When first playing, no matter what, it's going to seem unfair. FPS Skill: The weapons aren't "better" than the default. All weapons have their pros and cons. Each weapon is a synchronization to you. If you don't use airblast often and like to ambush players from behind. The Pyro's BackBurner is for you! Find a weapon whos cons don't weigh you down to much. If you're an airblasting pyro pro, don't chose the weapon without airblast! Class Skill: How good you are with your class, know your classes weakness and strengths! Snipers and Heavies are Spy's favorite backstab targets. So know to always watch your back. Team Skill: Also known as "Team Responsibility" No matter how good you are, how synchronized you are with your weapon. If your team does not have the right classes selected. You WILL lose. If your team needs a Medic, be that Medic, Spy? Be that Spy! It is up to you to decide which class will be the most helpful to your team. TF2 is a great game! Good Luck!

review: Well first off why are you even looking at this review, the game is ****ing free. But really the game is great. The gameplay is great (I mainly play demo). The items are great with strange, vintage, genuine etc. The graphics fit the game perfectly because it tells you, hey don't take the game seriously. I love all the characters in a unique humorous way. The gaming community for this game is great. Probably one of my favorite shooters 9.5/10

It's the kind of game that you want to show to people who don't play games so that they understand and then either get involved or go away. There is life before Team Fortress 2, and there is life after. After is better. I've never had so much fun losing and being shot :D

The day will come when you have a break, but when you don't want to play it for some weeks, you have already played for hours. Also, you definitely will come back to this awesome game and spend more, maybe hundreds of hours. When you find your first new weapon and have the chance to try it...so great! You learn new technics, new tactics and there are so many weapons, so many different play styles! You want to play as a Knight? No problem! There is a weapon for that!

review: Amazing. Valve figured out how to do F2P properly. It's super balanced, so even the newbie can kill the veteran. All the classes are unique and genuinely have to work together to survive. Each class as a nemesis. Just got killed from half a mile away by a sniper? Go spy and stab him. Spy stabbed you? Go pyro and barbecue his . Get barbecued? Go scout and beat him to death with a floppy fish. Got beaten to death by a floppy fish? etc. If you can find a decent server with players who actually know what they're doing, it's worth it. There's even a trading economy if you're more of a thinker. All the weapons are equally powerful, even the defaults. The extra weapons aren't upgrades, they're sidegrades so you can tweak your play style. The default scout shotgun is good on it's own, but you can replace it with a sawn off double barelled type thing with more damage, but with knockback and only two shots. That sort of thing.

review: If you like Team Deathmatch, this is the game for you, simialar to Ace Of Spades. It has many gamemodes from capture the flag to king of the hill. TF2 has something for everyone! Give it a shot! Hit me up and I'll play with you! There are many different game modes to the game, almost somthing for everyone. The game is based more on a team effort, its not just about you. Keep that in mind while playing, it'll help you and your team get a lot better. If pubbing isnt for you and you're a really good player, there is competitive Team Fortress to play (haven't really tried it, heard its good). This game you can "trade" virtual items in, which is actually how I have been able to buy most of my games without a cost to me. I have loved Team Fortress for well over a year and I hope to play it much longer. A++

review: (9.6) One of the staples of Valve/Steam. equal values of various community-driven first person shooters do not match the ones in TF2. Of course, in many first person shooters, there is the slight balance. Many people can overcome it. It's cartoon-y setting and atmosphere spawns a deep well-developed shooter. Many items are cheap, though many are not. Graphically, very excellent. It's fast-paced, balanced, and as well as its central gameplay should be praised also.

You would maybe not understand it, and ask me why we want all this hat... And I'll answer you "because"! Play it and you will understand!

review: Ah, TF2, the most popular game on Steam... Team Fortress 2 is a First-Person Shooter, but it sets itself apart from the other FPS games out there, like COD, Battlefield, Medal of Honor, and so on. It does this with class strengths and class weaknesses. And hats. Don't forget the hats. There are nine classes in the game, each with a specific job and strengths against certain other classes (EX: When you play as Engineer you're supposed to build Sentry Guns to defend an area and are good against pretty much anything that has to fight you directly, while Demoman was made as a counter to the Engineer with his bouncing pipe bombs). I won't go into detail about which class does what (except I kinda just did) since doubtlessly other reviewers have done that already. There's several different modes, for both PvP and PvE. You have CTF, Control Points, Payload (where you push a bomb into the other team's base and set it off as one team, whilst the other team tries to defend their base), Arena (try to kill everyone on the other team before they do the same), and a couple others. The game has a TON of people playing it, loads of guides (here on Steam and on Youtube), a dedicated wiki, and loads of customization options. There's even one where you can give your character a sword! As well you have cosmetic options. You can buy hats for your characters to make them look like the dignified, manly killers they truly are. You can also find them sometimes. The entire community is bonkers for hats (well, the entire community except Shibby2142). People have shelled out 100s of dollars for an unusual hat. Overall, fun game, definitely worth your time considering you can put stuff on the Steam Market to earn a little extra pocket change.

review: Dear reader, have you ever played DayZ, spawned and was killed by some man (or woman, i dont discriminate) with an ungodly amount of weapons? Perhaps you played Call of Duty, and helplessly watched as your entire team was killed by someone throwin a grenade. Shenanigans are fun when you have the say in who it goes to, but what if you wanted a game that actually requires skill? Look no further than TF2! this is a game that is serious, but doesnt take itself too seriously. With Valve servers you can duke it out with other players in a fair match, or play in a community made server and bend the rules till your hearts content! The game lacks the weapons that most FPSs base themselves on. To do the most damage you need to get up close and personal with your scatter gun, and dash away before you get yourself killed. This game bases itself and its game play on nine classes, with their own individuel story, perks, stats, and weapon setups. Each class requires different skills to play. Example to effectivly play a good soldier, one would need to understand the speed of the rocket, and the direction the enemy is going. Using this infromation, plus a couple others, you can dispatch this enemy and move onto the next. Not into the whole thinking before doing thing? TF2 has a class for that! Play as the pyro or medic. Either way this game has something for everyone. Those who want a serious game play experiance can use the Highlander servers. Those who want to look fly and nifty can go on trade servers. Why are you not downloading this game? Do you not like fun? I promise you there is a server for you, there is a fandom for you, and there is a faction for you! ThatBronyGuy thinks this game is swell.

review: I've been playing games all my life and i never seen a game that is like Team Fortress 2. This game is both fun yet strategic.TF2 has a unique style of gameplay and game characters. The first Team Fortress (Team Fortress Classic) is so different in graphics and gameplay style wise. Also the hats, miscs and weapons are all great from your starting weapons, to strange weapons with thousands of kills after a while. Alltogether, I think TF2 is a game worth playing no matter where your from.

review: So, If you are looking for an amazingly fun FPS that is both fun and competitive, then this is the game for you. Team fortress 2 is a FREE online FPS which also has hats. Those things should be plenty to make you wanna download it but, just in case, here are my findings from nearly 1000 hours of playing: 1. You will near-always find a server near you, Valve has every well connected area covered. 2. There will be servers that are FUN servers and others will be COMPETITIVE, this means whether you're looking for a fun, taunt kill everyone match or a competitive 32 man cluster flock, you'll find it. 3. The weapons are amazingly balanced, but also fun. Sure everyone loves to hate the Phlog, Pompson e.t.c, once you find a server with a good community, you'll feel right at home. 4. It has one of the best free to play models of any game I have seen. You don't need to spend a penny to get all of the non-cosmetic items in the game. However there are small benefits for spending 0.29 on a can of pop. 5. HATSHATSHATSHATSHATSHATSHATSHATSHATSHATSHATSHATSHATSHATSHATSHATS So, yea. In short this game is #1 on my recommended FTP games because it is balanced, competitive, FREE and, most importantly, FUN :sticky:

review: I have played TF2 since February 2012, and ever since it's kind of been one of those games; "Oh, I don't know what to do. I might just play TF2". A lot of people (including some of my friends) said that this is just one of those Pay-2-Win games but it really isn't. Weapons drop for everyone, randomly. You don't need hats or freaking Unusuals to win a match, you're just good at the game. Most of my friends that play TF2 think that players who wear Gibuses and Pyrovision Goggles are just plain failure, but I was like that too. Nowadays there's this impression that if a player has Premium on TF2 (which btw you can get it by just purchasing one item in the shop) they're immediately very good at the game... It's not like that. I have some complaints though. Unofficial premium servers; that's right, Saigns. Those are Pay-2-Win servers. Never play in one of these. Blacklist all of them.

review: One night as I lay in my bed I could not stop, stop thinking of hats. Hats had become, no, hats are my life. Hats are the very reason I live! As I lay awake in my bed I heard the door crack open. Quickly I turned, only to see lord GabeN standing in my doorway. In his hands rested the most beautiful unusual my eyes had ever seen. It was so beautiful that I was blinded when I looked upon it. With nothing, nothing but the memory of that heavenly hat, I drifted into a hat filled abyss. I awoke the next day in a Denny's parking lot somewhere in the heart of New Mexico wearing nothing but my stunning new unusual. The owners of that Denny's were so stunned from it's pure stunningness that their jaws dropped so far that they came back around and consumed themselves into nothingness, they had become one with the hat abyss. The cook rewarded me with a feast of the finest flapjacks and hog jowls for liberating the two before he too joined them in the hat filled tranquility that many others would soon find themselves in. Looking up at the sky later that day I knew that the almighty lord GabeN was smiling down upon me.

review: Best game when it waters I recommend you play this game if it means you say pay for being using in TF2 to get guns and thus be easier to raft and trad. or be F2P it means to be an actor without using TF2 but anyway you can find guns and make them CRAFT. In short, no matter what you are or who you are you can get guns play do CRAFT AND TRAD.

review: This game is great in a lot of aspects. First lets talk about the gameplay. Team Fortress 2 offers amazing gameplay with fun classes to play. There are currently 9 classes and each class offers a different role to the team. Whether it be defense, offense, or support. It's a fun game to play with friends on multiplayer. You can play on certified Valve Maps and even community made maps. Another good aspect of the game is the shop. The shop allows players to buy and access items, taunts, and various hats to use in game. Another neat factor I like is that for weapons, you can run a test run to try out the weapon for a week. But this doesn't make the game a, "Pay-to-win" game. Other items can counter others, This brings me to another great aspect: Customization. One of the most versatile and best things in TF2. The ability to customize your characters to make it your own. Various weapons to combine in a "loadout." With an option of making 4 loadouts for each class! Also, the customization factor allows you to put hats, different outfits, and various other cosmetics on your character to make them look unique. There are also weapons that count your kills for you, and unusual items that have special effects, rather than just plain old replicas of the item itself. Valve is NOT lazy with this game. Currently putting out updates and patches occasionally with new weapons, cosmetics, items, etc. to make the game interesting, and not make it stay bland. TF2 also provides a trading community. A place where players can trade their items to get new ones. A very effective way of getting what you want. But, unfortunately, you have to buy something from the shop first with real money in order to trade. :( There are also achievements to get for various classes and events to make the game a bit of a challenge. Anyways, there are also Steam Workshops where players can create their own items. Not only for TF2, but for other games too. Sometimes, your items can even get implemented at Valve's request. All in all, TF2 is a great, cartoonish style, free to play first person shooter with a lot of customization to make it fun. The multiplayer is just excellent with the ability to interact with other players on excellent maps. The fact that the community takes part in helping and making new things for the game is amazing. It is just a great game overall, with a lot of fun packed adventures! I HIGHLY recommend this game. Rating: 9/10

It is a lot of fun playing with a range of other gamers (some of which are really good teammates). Also, I love that you can join a friend's game at any time during their gameplay!

review: I really can recommend this game to many other players out there. I rellay love this game and I nearly play it everyday. I just love the game's cartoony style and all the nice 'lil goodies like free update, not like you have to pay 20 bucks for mann vs machine mode, its free. I bought TF2 in the orangebox when it wasnt free to play, however, there are also many COD kids now and, its just funny to hear them rage because TF2 is much much harder to play. Its harder to play because of the fact, that the players have to complete a objective while fighting in team against each other.

game-hours: 356.2
review: This game is extremely fun and highly addictive. The only downside is that the players who bought the game before it was free are really butthurt. If you are a free-to-play player, it is likely that the paid players will be on your  and treat you like you're the new kid in class. My advice: ignore them. They're just silly people who are butthurt that they had to spend money and you didn't. Arguements are easy to get into in this game, so you're best option is to just play the game and avoid all communications unless someone seems really nice. :3 Gameplay wise, you can never go wrong in this game (unless dealing with hackers). The game is incredibly balanced so that even if you're a new player using default weapons, you can still land yourself on the top of the scoreboard. Just don't get cocky. People don't like that. Have fun, be nice, and you may be rewarded with some sweet gear. 9/10 it was okay

review: Probably the best multiplayer FPS games out there, even after all this time. The game maybe cartoonish in nature but that doesn't stop it from being very gory. Of course the gore itself is also rather cartoonish so if your squeemish you should be fine here. The community is (mostly) filled with great players, though you'll occasionally get someone who is difficult to tolerate. None the less its free-to-play so there's no reason to at least try the game out.

review: Team Fortress 2. TF2. Call it what you want, but it'll always be my favorite game. TF2 is a team-base shooter game about a butt-load of different game modes. Payload is a popular one, I like this one best because it's more of a team-based effort, instead of an MVP. Attack/Defense is my next favorite, same thing, encourages teamwork. I'll leave you to decide the remaining game modes. I recommend this game if you're into first person (or third-person for that matter) cartoon-ish shooting games. P.S. Best map IMO: trade_abstract2 P.P.S. HIGHER NATION FTW P.P.P.S. I'm not on crack you dingus -.-

One of the few games where you rely on the strengths of everyone to win, but can still have a lot of fun even when you lose. It doesn't take a lot of learning to figure out how to get going, and the gameplay is solid. They continually add in new weapons and features, as well as new maps, and with it as cheap as it is, it's definitely worth picking up.

Got it. Stealthily dodging enemies and tricking them? Can do it. Build sentries and teleporters? Easy. Or maybe heal your teammates and keep them in the fray? My favorite. And if you absolutely must kill everything in front of you, we've got a man and a minigun. I say again, the best f2p on steam!

review: I played this game and i was instantly captivated by it it is brilliant the unlockables the fast paced action and the enjoyable characters all with their own nationalities (sniper is australian heavy is russian etc) the community is great unlike some other gaming communities (runescape) team fortress 2 is filled with friendly people everywhere you go whatever server you play on there is always atleast 11 friendly people in a game of 14 apart from the non stop tdm feel on team fortress 2 there is also another side to it..... the trading side you can trade to get whatever item you want although it will take some hard work. you can get stranges killstreaks unusuals botkilers hats miscs and taunts. to see what all these things are you will have to play it for yourself. tf2 has such a great trading side to it that it even has it's own currency. you get unlockable weapons every 40 mins to 2 hrs that you play. two of the weapons from the same class will make a scrap metal 3 scrap is a reclaimed 3 reclaimed is a refined in trading reclaimed and refined metal are often referred to as rec and ref. and one little thing. you need to buy something from the in game shop for anything you have to be tradable. it is a bit of a letdown but honestly it was worth it since tf2 itself is free-to-play. back to the tdm side. not all the gamemodes are tdm as a matter of fact it is only an opyion available when you make a server. the gamemodes are control points, capture the flag, king of the hill, payload race and a couple of others that i forget. i am not going to go through what you can do and what the objectives are in each of these gamemodes. i am going to stop this review here and say i would definately recommend this game to anyone looking for a good first person shooter with a bit of a comedic feel (i am aware i made comedic up i couldn't find the right word) not very high gore very fast paces and plenty of unlockables and trades to be had. so yeah play it it's good fun!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

review: This is easily one of my personal favorite games I have ever played. I watched a couple of TF2-related videos on Youtube and thought: Huh. Everyone likes this. I could give it a try, but... What if it's like Call of Duty where it's literally the same thing that has already been done thousand times? Then, I saw Top Nine Team Fortress by Fawful's Minion. I was impressed. There was variation, things that weren't possible in the real world, no annoying blood effects on your screen when you were hurt. I downloaded Steam and the game. Despite it eating up a boatload of memory and lots of my time, I didn't regret my choice and will probably never start to regret it.

review: This game is my favorite. It's really free-to-play! You don't have to pay any money to get weapons, unless you want to. And if you buy any one thing, you're automatically upgraded. And if you really want a hat, you can easily get one from an achievement. It's also a great place to meet friends or dominate noobs, whichever you prefer. So if you don't have this great game, get it. It's free and fun. :)

review: I wouldn't really fully recommend this to any old school gamer, but for free it's one of the best games ever. VALVe have done an amazing job making their games available free to play for all, with premium access to the Orange Box buyers, so now VALVe can bring in lots more players that weren't previously aware of their awesome games. Only problem I find with it is most of the community, and the unseriousness of the gameplay. The hats, the items, they just don't do it for me. TFC was all about teamwork, shooting, and plain seriousness. Whereas with TF2, it's all just joking, cartoon-y, hats, items, trading...You get the point. I like the game, and I still recommend it to everyone, but It's just not for me.

review: This game is one I've put a lot of precious time (and money) into. Characters and cosmedics are constantly developing and improving. And although the general 'gaming' community is reviewed poorly is some cases, the judges have shunned the smaller communities within this well known game. Slender Fortress, Parkour Fortress and smaller trade server groups all have great little societies that they're able to manage. Overall, I'd recommend this to anyone familar to an FPS, but I'd caution them of the F2P system. I'd convert to a P2P by any means necessary, whether buying a hat or a giftapult. Other than that, great game, Valve.

Scout, Soldier, Spy, Sniper, Demoman, Heavy, Engineer, Medic, and Pyro. Tf2 is a gore filled glorified team based shooting game. If your into that stuff I absolutly 100% without a doubt think you should get it. And if you don't get it, your mentaly disordered. Get this game NOW!

review: Pkayed this wacky game for years, and I've experienced momoents of awe, terror, godliness, cleanliness, anger, and disbelief when playing this game. Most of those moments are simply hoping that I can get that last fish hit in on a demoknight before the pyro, who set me on fire, airblasts me off of a cliff. And then I get head shot by a sniper. That is absolutely the typical experience, as long as you remember that killing people or capping points isn't the objective. The objective is to have fun in as many ways as physically possible.

review: A solid FPS, much more diverse gameplay than most others with its 8 classes. Not exactly strategic, but alot of fun and easy to just jump into and kill an hour or two and maybe play with someone else with a mic and then many jokes can be had. Items are great too as a way to customize gameplay further than the 8 classes with thousands of weapon combinations, normally after you've given all the classes a play and figured out how to play them; by which point you'll have found a few items as drops that you can begin experimenting with.

Its increasingly addicitive as they countinue to add hats to the game. Not only is the game great but the comunity is too , which in turn makes playing the game such a great experince. I can personally vouch for it being one of my top 3 games as i have put in over one thousand hours into it , and I know many that have put more. In conclusion its a great game and its completely free so your not losing anything from giving it a try ;) ps: You risk being devoured by a hunger for hats.

Did you know that Team Fortress 2 is the world's best, most realistic and most fun Hat Simulator in the world? That alone should be why you play this game! Well, in the end the gameplay is still fantastic and now we've got a bunch of silly weapons that either induce great rage in your opponents or induce dance parties. I just don't even know anymore. Play this game.

review: I seriously, cannot get enough of Team Fortress 2. It's the only game I've played where people seem to care more about the hats you wear more than the actual game. Yet I still find this game extremely fun. Fast paced action with tons upon tons of humour to help it. The 9 classes are all diverse with thier own personalities and weapons. With the game constantly updated with new items, hats, weapons and recently, new taunts, the game is just so enjoyable to play and I definately recommned it to everyone. TL;DR Hats, Taunts, People doing the Conga instead of playing the game. 11/10 obligitory " hat similator" joke goes here.

I havent found anyhackers and have passed 30 hours for game record. my only problems are 1-I dont find many items and when i do they are ones i already have, 2-you come against people who have way better stuff then you because they spend real money to get ahead and 3-Crafting, i smelt weapons into metals and when you get enough for a weapon it says you need blue prints-HOW DO YOU GET THEM!!!! i like the gameplay style and there aredifferent servers and gamemodes to suit any one. all in all, i think it is a great game to kill time adn is enjoyable. 8/10 stars

review: Went from Team Fortress, to Hat Fortress, now to Conga Fortress. What's might come come around next? The world may never know. This game also broke my life, but it was worth it.. And this game basically stole my money, and it was worth it... This game is a load of fun, and it will never get old for me, so if you haven't played TF2, but your thinking about it, you should definitely do it! It'll be worth the time.

review: I have about 100 games in my steam library. Almost all of them are incredibly unique experiences that I spent lots of money on. I never played any games in my steam library yet, nor have I even started these games. This is all thanks to TF2. This is one of the most fun games to ever exist and it has the best multiplayer around. There are thousands of players always online along with tousands of custom made maps. When playing free-to-plays the big question about it is "Is it pay to win?". Team Fortress 2 is not. Almost all of mircrotransactions are spent on cosmetic things like HATS! I don't understand why you are even reading a review right now when you can get one of the best multiplayer games ever for free. I would have spent 150$ if this game was retai. Great community, great price, great online. No wonder this game has been around for about 10 years!

review: Okay, unless you have some operating system other than Windows, Mac OS, or Linux, you really have no excuse whatsoever to not own this game. I used to think I was not a fan of first-person shooters. I was wrong. This game has scads and scads of humor that kept me going through the early learning periods, allowing me to laugh off my failures instead of get frustrated at them. What I didn't realize at the time, though, was I was still learning how to play. And by the time the humor was wearing thin, skill was taking over. I might have only been classified as 'competent', but I wasn't mindlessly killing myself over and over. I was making a difference, even if just a small one, in each and every match. If you like FPS games, get it. If you don't, get it. If you want a hat simulator, get it. If you want a completionist's wet dream, get it. And best of all, of course, IT. IS. FREE.

review: Team Fortress 2 is a F2P game. Team Fortress 2 is amazing for being an F2P and has so many things to do. First of all it has unlimited replayablity just because of the thousands of items... and ofcourse hats! You can pay to get items and hats, becoming premium is one step. You can also make money out of it by trading items and hats. There are many people who dont want to spend money and they just want to play the game. They often have hats like the Ghastly Gibus and Pyrovision Goggles. They are often pretty bad aswell so If you see one you can judge them easily! This game is both noob-friendly and has so many features that I cant explain everything in one review. Go on, check it out yourself.

review: This was my first game when starting Steam, and I loved every minute of it. It's free, it has an interesting community, and you can make money off of workshop items if they're implemented into the game! Let's actually start to go into detail here - If you bought the game back before 2007, then you won't have to go through what I'm gonna explain; Despite the game being free, there are some consequences that come with being what we call "Free-To-Play" or F2P for short. First off, you're gonna be treated like trash by some of the Premium-To-Play or Paid-To-Play players. You won't have a lot of luck in the Trade servers either unless you can trade. All you really have to be to become P2P(Paid/Premium-To-Play) is just buy anything from the Mann Co. Store, so that's a plus. Despite these inconviniences, the game is a hell of a time if you get past some of the bad parts of the community. For some people, this game might not be for you. That's fine, it's your opinion. But those of you who haven't tried the game already, I suggest trying it before casting your opinion into the sea known as Steam. My personal rating for the game is 8.9/10 for it being so damn fun.

review: While some may pass off Team Fortress 2 as a run-of-the-mill hat simulator, further analysis of the game shows trace elements of a team-based FPS with several different classes and many more loadout combinations to boot. Frequent updates, community contributions, and humorous background lore make this game a very enjoyable experience.

review: As a Cod, I was really blown out of the water by how much I enjoy this game. No class feels overpowered or useless, which really adds variety to the gameplay. Even more variety can be found in the different weapons you can unlock for each class. The addition of hats and cosmetic items really has given the game a sense of fun and chaos you don't find in the more generic FPS games. (Any game where I can hit someone to death with a fish is a plus in my book.)

review: Theres a lot of conflict between TF2 fans and COD fans, but there is no denying that both of them are great games, call of duty requires more raw skill and team fortress 2 makes you build up teamwork and how to utilise many different areas of the game. That is what makes it preside over Call of Duty for me

review: Hat Simulator 2014 is a game about collecting hats, crafting hats, finding hats, unboxing hats, and trading hats. The game has a very complex algorithm for determining which hat you will find, based on choices you have made in the game. The game also includes minigames to play while you wait to recieve a hat, such as killing other players, pushing carts arounds, playing music over the mic, etc. I give this game an overall rating of 7.5 stars out of 2 thumbs up.

review: Team-based first person shooter with many gamemodes. TF2 convinces with solid gameplay and a strong focus on teamplay, watch each others back (literally... dat spy...), with clear roles given, you gotta know your place. Graphicly its ok, unfortunatly the german players are limited to low violence kiddy version for whatever reason (no matter how old the actual user is). The game should run on most machines, even if its 6 years old. The game modes are all enjoyable, and require different stragies of the teams. Gameplaywise the most annoying thing for beginners is probably getting killed by spies, until you start shooting everyone once in a while to make sure its really your team. The payment model is tricky though, first it seems very fair to play without paying anything, but then you realize that your backpack is way to limited to receive f2p-drops, and its hard to craft (+ limited receipes as non-premium). So getting the weapons you want is very unlikley. Unlike Dota 2 items which are cosmetic only, this items actually have stats and some change the way to play a class significantly. I recommend checking the game out if you are a fan of the genre, and then maybe spending <2$ to get premium status, that should give you enough drops and backpack space to enjoy the game for a longer time (until you decide if you want to spent more money, im not there yet). In the end its F2P, so just go for it. 'nuff said.

review: I've started playing this only recently, but I've known of it for a long time. I heard about it through G-Mod videos, but I didn't exactly know it was a game this awesome. I started a game and immediatly lost track of time. I swear, I was in that game for 15 minutes but the session time said 2 hours. Your life will go to this game, I promise. Huge pro is the fact you never really have to buy things with real money, unless you truly want to. Because, if you're lucky, you can find it for free in a round, which I think is perfect, and will keep me playing for a long time. I've only been playing for 5 days, and my small amount of hours is because I'm still in school, but I would HIGHLY recommend this to anybody that enjoys first person shooters or anything action. An amazing game with a huge fanbase, I love it.

review: This is a great game to practice team work with strats and such, grab 8 friends and pull a team together and practice. Its fun to cooperate with friends and family, especially when you whip another teams . Very fun experience, one of the few games with a complex econemy. Everybody can appeal to atleast one aspect of one of the classes. Exact opposite of Call Of Duty.

Playing against organized guilds, that disable voting and team scrambles, is still frustrating but I keep playing anyway. :)

review: I actually really enjoy playing this game, despite it being free to play. First piece of advice: Sell trading cards, until you have 10 cents, and then use it in the mann co store to buy a giftapault. After you do this, you have a premium account, can get hats, more drops, and more backpack slots. If you do this, you won't even need to spend any actual money on the game, since you don't NEED unusuals or taunts (But that doesn't keep them from being amazing), and you can pretty much get all the weapons anways, so this game really isn't pay 2 win at all, and I really like that about this compared to almost every other free to play title.

review: The game is fun and all but its frustrating not getting the item you want at random so thats the only thing i hate but other than that the game is magnificent and i cant stop playing it.

review: Perfect Free2Play integration if you ask me. You can certainly spend as much money on the game as you like, but it is not needed to enjoy the game and to top it off, the game runs perfectly on Linux. Coupled with the vast array of achievements, hats and the co-op pleasures of Mann vs Machine it offers a superb FPS experience!

review: Great game for what you're paying for which is... FREE! It has all the modes you'll ever want to play, and tons of acheivements that you can well acheive! Even if you're new to TF2 like I still am, you have many classes to chose from, the more you play the more unique items you can obtain and eventually you'll be able to create many different types of characters to play as, with many different styles of kill you can choose from.

review: Oh look, another TF2 review. How original. In all seriousness, TF2 is a great game. It might make you angry when you first start, but with enough practice, you can become pretty good. Heck, I used to suck at Sniper not too long ago, but now TF2 is my favorite Point and Click adventure. Even if you don't like to play the actual game, (which you should) you can trade hats or just play the many gamemodes that people have created. This game has a wide variety of features, and is one of the best games I've ever played. I just wish the hit registration was better. ^^"
game-hours: 440.4
review: This game is awsome and most of all the custom game modes that make the game the most fun you can have,with the hat,misc items and are also cool they were created by people like me,once you join a server u can show off your items and get your BOOOM HEAD SHOT moments all off this game.

review: 9/10 - Need I say more? TF2 is one of the best multiplayer experiences steam has to offer. The purpose is in the name, Team Fortress 2 focuses on the use of teamwork to achieve various goals and it does so very well with 9 different and well balanced classes. The major flaw with TF2 is that of the younger crowd, I'd recommend finding some good servers and more mature people to play with before judging TF2's community.

review: TF2 is an awesome game! Perfectly balanced. Premium Players doesn't have a big advantage over the F2P Players because most of the items in this game are cosmetic and i think there are no items that the Premium Players can have that the F2P Players can't. A lot of companies need to learn from Valve on "How to make a F2P game", Dota 2 is another good example of F2P, which is another game from Valve! About the game itself: Unique classes, each with their own weapons(aside from some secondary weapons like the shotgun for some classes), abilities and responsabilities on the battlefield; Good graphics; Teamwork is essential, otherwise it wouldn't be a Team Fortress game; Tons and tons of achievements and overall fun!

review: I had the game before it turned free to play, but it was worth the money! Saying this, if you haven't tried it, why not try it now, that it's completely free? You've nothing to loose! You have an infinite number os maps to play on, an infinite number of different weapons, nine classes and many game modes. If that doesn't cut it the game still has full integration with steam workshop! Team play is also important here. If you go rambo style, the probability is that you will end up dead sooner or later. Each character has it's own charisma and kind of "personality". You can find items while playing and use them to create your own weapons or to equip your characters. The graphics are good with some nice effects, nothing of the other world...but who cares? The fun to play this overcomes them by far. The options menu is well stashed, you have many, many settings to choose from, nothing is missing there, yet, is not confusing at all. The sounds of the weapons and general sound fx follow the fun theme of the game and the music themes are just hilarious! The gameplay is something you should be used to when playing Valve games, different from each game, but simple and awesome! Go for it! 9/10

review: The Game is really fun. And of course this game is free unless wanting to pay for premium or extras. Its good as you can play in singar player and mulitplayer which means you can play with friends, make new friends (or enemies). There is a drop system which means you can get items free needing not to pay for weapon and misc. Trading servers are also available in the game. Idle servers are also available in the game too and of course there are achivements for you to get which awards you with weapons when you achieve th eamount of achivements neede to get.

Like capturing points made of flimsy metal? Yep Like pushing exploding bombs to a giant pit? And it EXPLODES? Yes sir Just wanna kill your enemies for the glory of the kill? HELL yeah! This games got it all. Easy to play, hard to master. Updated weekly and major content updates almost monthly. Training modes for the n00bs and command CVAR's for the tinker. Customization is EVERYWHERE! From loadouts to hats to taunts, YES you can! The art style make's it look cartoony and non-serious, but that is the WHOLE POINT! + as of June 23, 2011, IT IS FREE!!

review: hello, at first I didnt like it, I found graphics too childish, not pretty, I found the characters moving too fast, and the game too buggy, crashing all the time. Then I practiced a lot against bots. Then I got used to it, and I found my favorite class, first always played as heavy, now always pyro, maybe tomorrow another? Other things, it takes 14giga bytes on the hard disk, a lot, but modern games are like that, we are not int the era of 20 megas bytes games anymore...I find it sad, but pcs are faster too. Engine is based on half life 2, but game is buggy, for instance, when pressing ALT TAB, it takes forever to swap to desktop and to game again, sometimes crashes too. I had anoter problem : 2 GB RAM is NOT enough, you will need 3GB at least. Ok enjoy the game, and of course, this is not an intellectual game, it's about shooting and reflex, but you will need to be intelligent a little bit : learn the map, learn to anticipate ennemies movements, learn how to hide, to escape, learn to use weapons, learn where to go, when to go, etc This is not a simple play and shoot, this is more complex as it seems. And most important, it is a TEAMMMM game, that is if someone plays sh... then the team has problems, or if a doctor is mssing, who will heal you, if an engineer missing, who will build a sentry ? ... There is a lot to say, but I will stop here. Oh one note: I still find the characters are moving too fast for being "realistic" humans dont move that fast... Cheers.

There's so many community based gamemodes, and valve as a whole probably makes money off of this game as kellogs makes money off of their cereals! Pro's FREE TO FREAKIN PLAY!!! Great humor Supports mods (That are visual and audioal) Cool looking hats Supports Co-Operation, Addicting Gameplay. Cons ADDICTING AS ING CRACK Hats and key's cost a LOT, and are a pain to trade. weapon drops are infrequent. Hats are often in crates, and crates require keys, and drop too frequently.

review: After wasting alot of time in this game I decided to write a review. First off the game is great the gamplay is fresh alot to do and alot of nice people to play with. The game has items some like them and some hate them but I dont mind if people waste 100$ on a digital hat or just 0.07$ for a weapon. All weapon have a pros and cons to make the game fair so the people with the most money can't just buy that item. The game is alive and will be for a long time. I would say this game would be worth 19,99$. But it's free and everyone can enjoy it free of cost. The game also has MVM (Man versus Machine) when players fight waves of evil robots to defend man Co. So grab a friend and waste money on hats.

review: As far as the F2P games goes, this is one of the best balanced, most established ones on steam. Gameplay-wise, it's exciting class-based shooter action, and if you can get 2 organized teams, it is really fun. Aside from that, it's FREE, but it's a big download. Give it a try anyway.

review: This is a very balanced, fast paced non traditional fps that is a hell of a lot of fun. Each class offers a different style of gameplay ranging from pyro, a destructive and offensive class, to spy, a supportive stealth class. Every class has their strengths and weaknesses, and teamwork for this reason is essential because every class can be countered by another class. Playing with balanced teams is very rewarding because it takes a group effort to win in any situation. I strongly reccomend this game to others and ill be plaing it for a long time.

The game is very stylized and cartoonish, which I think is nice, because not only does it feel like a game, but it's hilarious to look at. Even if you die, chances are, you'll be chuckling. There are 9 classes in total, and because of that diversity, the game play really feels varied. Overall, Team Fortress 2 is a very solid class based shooter on source that will be enjoyed for many years to come

review: It's an addictive multiplayer f2p hat simulator That's the first thing you should know...Hats are a status symbol a sign that you've sunk alot of money into the game (buying crates keys mostly) or have played for a long time next DO NOT WEAR THE GHASTLY GIBUS you will be hated for not being pay to play (stupid but true) gameplay is incredibly addictive and revolves around 9 classes (scout, pyro, soldier, demoman, heavy,engineer,sniper,medic and spy) all of which play very differently and uniquely the weapons you get that you can switch out the defaults for are ALMOST never straightly better then the defaults also you can get all of these weapons if your f2p Now this is a game with mod support so things like non official maps gamemodes and weapon mods exist and are very fun (but mostly not a fun as the main game) The different classes are all countered by another in some way shape or form and (as the name suggests) the game requires teamwork The scout is a harrassment class with a scattergun (a more close ranged based shotgun) a pistol and a baseball bat by default the pyro has a flamethrower woith a secondary fire that does an "airblast" that will reflect explosives and knock back players, a shotgun, and a fire axe the soldier has a rocket launcher with four rockets in it that CAN rocket jump, a shotgun, and a shovel the demoman has a grenade launcher, a stickybomb launcher (that is remote detonated) and a beer bottle the heavy has a minigun, an amazingly deep russian accent, a shotgun,and his baby man crushing fists the engineer has a shotgun, a pistol,a wrench, and two pdas which respectively build or destroy buildings you can create (the sentry gun, the dispenser, and a teleporter entrance and exit) all of which if you hit it with the wrench while it's building it will go faster. When it's fully built you can continue hittting it to upgrade it to a max of level 3, or heal it if it's damaged the sniper has a sniper rifle (you only get headshots while scoped in with it), an smg, and a kukri the medic has a needle gun, a medigun for healing that when you have filled up the "uber" meter you can secondary fire to make a player invincible for 10 seconds, and a bonesaw The spy has a revolver, a electric sapper for destroying buildings, a knife, and a disguise kit for making you look like a player on the enemy team. Also the spy's secondary fire will activate an invisibility watch that will drain as you use it The maps are blanced greatly. While their is no official respawn deathmatch mode however certain maps have been designated "TDM" unofficially due to the difficulty of achieving the objectives (plr_hightower) The gamemodes are usually varitions or just straight out cp or ctf gamemodes payload (pl) is where the attacking team mist push a cart of their color to the enemies base where it will explode and they will win the game capture point (cp) has two variations on it five cp and attack/defense cp both include caturing points (WOW) capture the flag is just that arena is a no respawn tdm gamemode king of the hill is a cp map wiht just 1 cpture point that the teams must attempt to hold for 3 minutes (the time left on the win timer stays after the point is recaptured by the other team) payload race is where their are two carts (one for each team) that's about it GET IT NOW IT'S FREEEE THE END

It's free, easy to play yet hard to master. One downside is every item you want could be hard to find If that is the case, there is a giant store but I don't like to spend money so I must play until I get an item.

review: Team Fortress 2 (also known as Hat Fortress 2) is probably the best hat simulator on Steam. I reccomend it to anyone looking for a hat simulator. Its addictive quality, its cartoony art style and its great ammount of hats are really apealing and really give the game charm. I think graphics are the best part about games and Team Fortress 2 really shows off the Source Engine and how it can render hats with relative ease. The object of the game, as you probably know already, is to get as many hats as possible. You can get them by: A) playing a shooting minigame for about an hour a day to get a random hat drop (sometimes the random drops can be extra weapons to make the shooting minigame easier, I don't reccomend using them, though) B) Crafting your shooting minigame weapons into scrap metal to make a new hat eventually C) buying the hats off of the Mann Co. Store All in all, this is a great hat sim that I reccomend to everyone looking for a fun dressup game. I hope Valve makes more.

That 9 Classes have mission on game.And 3 Parts Of Team (Offensive,Defensive and support) f you playing Offensive,I prefer selecting Scout,Soldier or Pyro,But when playing Defensive  prefer selecting Engineer,Heavy or Demoman... You playing with friends ? Aanna support your friends ? And now best part of team,Support ! n Support select Medic,Sniper or Spy and Stab people and Sap Sentries... :) Hope You like it guys,Be pro in that game :)

game-hours: 595.0
review: Getting a healthy amount of fun from shooters these days is...rather unlikely. One of the major FPS's known for doing that is Call of Duty. There's not much stratedgy involved, it's monotonous, and each installment might as well be just DLC. But Team Fortress 2 wants you to know that fun and innovation is possible to do in a FPS. There's 9 classes to choose from, each with there own characteristics and personalities, unlockables such as new weaponry and goofy (but cool to wear) hats, and the gameplay is so addicting that it's guaranteed to have you coming back for more. You'll be spending hours with people worldwide trying to capture/defend points, play a bloody game of capture the flag, or even maneuver a bomb-loaded minecart to force the RED team to call mercy. With so many rewards and achievements to unlock, as well as excellent co-op, it's no wonder that Team Fortress 2 has been known to be perhaps one of the best video games evr made. Just take caution when playing the Orange Box version on the XBox 360.

review: This game is truely great in every sense of the word it consists of 9 unipue classes all of which have great distintitve playstyles to fit any persons prefered gametype the cartoonish artstyle is a breath of fresh air in this new game generation of EXTREME REALISTIC GRAPHICS also the maps and the gameplay are all so fun and replayable you will never get bored (trust me i havent and i played almost 1000 hours) the commuunity is filled with great people but like every community could use a little work and last but not least HATS you can customize the classes with amazing hats of all shapes and sizes and that alone gives this game a 10/10 but in all seriousness this is one of the best FPSes out there its been going almost 7 years strong and its better then any cod game thats for sure 10/10

game-hours: 1175.2
review: Its a very fun game with different game modes and mods. Many people emphasize on hats and some compare those free to play players and premiums. But most of the community are very friendly and helpful. There is a trading side of tf2, a playing side and even a competitive side. MGE (my gaming edge), HL (highlander) and 6s (6v6) are all forms of competitive while MGE being a mod itself (1v1). Overall, great game and community, highly suggest you buy it (just don't idle so much) and i mean buy, not play. You can play it for a trail but the trading aspect is great as well. But most clans wouldnt mind if you are a f2p (free to play) as long as you are gd at gaming and are friendly, you will most probably enter a clan (if u ask) and bond with them.

review: To those of you new to this game, let's say this, It's not a serious game(may vary if you're playing Mann VS Machine) sure you can kill each other as 1 of 9 mercenary classes, but you can also Trade weapon and/or hats. As I said, sure you can kill other players in it, but it's not really a serious game. (doesn't matter if what you're playing in has an objective.) The Other players can be quite difficult. (to both kill and talk to, depending on person.) This game to me is Super Addicting, never a dull moment. (I must warn some of you, it'll be like , to some you'll have a fantastic time, others they'll go to hell before they die.) Me? I'd give this a 10/10

review: I am truly sorry but you cannot own a PC without at least giving this game a try. Team Fortress 2 is arguably the most balanced and enjoyable F2P FPS on the market (if not out of all FPS's). The F2P model of this game is a work of genius with random item drops roughly every hour; you will be constantly playing just for that next drop. With 9 very distinct classes from the backstabbing Spy, to the adorably dangerous Pyro you dont even have to know how to aim! With a constant stream of updates and the upcoming annual Smissmas update there has never been a better time to fall in love with this game. I promise you won't regret it, and besides IT'S FREE!

review: If you're one of those odd folks that doesn't own this game yet... You're missing out. Endless multiplayer, sweet visual style, hilarious critical kills and more hats than your hometown haberdasher. (Go look that up.) If your tiny town doesn't have one... Screw it. There are just a lot of hats here, and great gameplay to go with 'em.

review: My god where do I even start... EVERYONE on steam has heard of Team Fortress 2 at least once, and if they haven't they soon will. Highly addicting and loaded with tons of cartoonish fun and humor (and all the ing hats), TF2 is pretty much the face of steam (technically of Valve, but they're both made by them). The game itself is actually pretty challenging and is constantly changing. It's NOTHING like Call of Duty, where you can rely on just yourself to survive. In TF2, you actually have to work as a team to get anywhere, which I personally find great for a game. And every one of the 9 classes are unique, powerful, but still dependent on other classes. For example, you can't count on a whole team being snipers and expect to win (trust me, you wont. Ever.) You need variety and strategy. You need to work as a team in the fortress. 2. This game is free, but that doesn't say much. If you want to trade items (which are actually a huge part of TF2 thanks to hatcomony) then you either need to buy an item from the online store (lowest cost for an item is about 50 cents) or get a friend to get you premium. Now go out there and get on the point. Dummkopf.

review: One of the first games that got me into PC gaming on a mac (later on I upgrade to this computer with GTX 760 I have today with Windows 7) was TF2. I was like, how the  do I play this ? I tried aiming down the sights on a scattergun, rocket launcher, and a grenade launcher. I asked this over mic (and text chat) and I got verbal opposition so I was utterly confused. But TF2 has great server communites like Lotus Clan, Intox are some of the bigass communities. They teach you to play today. Today, I have priceless strange quality items with over 500 kills that track scores. 10/10 TF2. TF2 provided my first enjoyable FPS in a long time after Call of Duty went into .

review: For the MORE educated people only! This game goes deep into the heart of economics where one could learn to trade various cosmetic items for metal. Each hat metapohrically represents a slice of life. The more hats you have, the more you are seen as a person in-game. The gibus, however, is like a dying stock share where one could never gain any sort of profit from it. A painted gibus is the ultimate display of poverty since it displays the well-proven fact that you no longer have a hat to paint! Therefore it is recommended that one takes every single STATS course in school in order to understand such a deep, and well-made hat simulator. I have lost my life investing into many hats in order to maximize my virtual metal income. I highly recommend this game for those who are interested in how microeconomics work. Also comes with a fps mini-game.

review: For about three years now, I've been a long-time collector of items in Team Fortress 2, trying to stay on top of new stuff when it comes out. And as frustratingly hard as that sometimes is, I wouldn't trade a minute of it for the world. I say that because Team Fortress 2 is genuinely one of the most fun experiences I've ever had with a video game, multiplayer or otherwise. I'm utterly terrible at most video games, but the fun I've had with TF2 makes me forget all of that, and just have fun with it. At its core, the game has a charm to me that's never even come close to dying out. I've met so many good friends and have so many accomplishments thanks to Team Fortress 2 that this one game has practically changed my entire life. And I'll love every minute of its past, present and future until the time the servers shut down; at which point, I will frame my collection as several large pictures, on each wall of my house, as a memento of time well spent.

review: Team Fortress 2 (a.k.a. Trade Fortress 2, Hat Fortress 2, Promo Fortress 2, Team Fashionista 2, Team Freetress 2) is a class-based first-person hat collection simulator. Originally it was a faithful recreation of the original Quake and Half-Life mods, but has since evolved from its original design into a pointless virtual collect-a-thon where the player must collect every rare item they can by any means necessary, in order to inflate their ego and show off their E-peen. The original point of the game revolved around playing gamemodes, such as capturing the enemy intelligence, pushing a bomb to the enemy base, or controlling a whole map by Scout-rushing control points, although now all this became nothing more than a small minigame to pass the time with while you wait for more hats and as time went on, more weapons to magically drop into your inventory while doing  all on Achievement or Idle servers. 9.5/10 Overall 5/10 just for half the community being mann co store .

Just hats and items is there priorty. Overall great FP2 Game! ~Cheer's

The con's.. makes people rage aton and some server lag. I just love how valve made all classes have relationships with eachother, like the demo and soldier, they used to be friends but Mann co. told them each lies and so they started to fight eachother. The weapons are good BUT Baby's faces... ing OP, NERF NOW.

review: People are giving reviews of this game, saying " BEST GAME 2013/2014". But these are not clear reviews at all. The reason why this game is fun, it is because it has unlimited replay value. When you step your foot into this game, and start to love this game. You're addicted. This game offers very unique mechanics, for example, the Soldier class can rocketjump into high places other classes may not be able to reach. Learning how to aim the rocket on your foot and propeling yourself up into the air can be very fun to play with. This game has a rather deep learning curve to certain classes, mostly being the Soldier, the Demoman, and the Spy. The Demoman is an interesting class to learn, he does not have any Hitscan weapons (weapons that do not have projectiles and hit immediately). He also has the ability to StickyJump, just like the soldier, but it costs more health, but brings you further and higher. Leaning how to do those Rocketjumps and Stickyjumps may not be an easy task to someone who is slower to the game. I took a year to learn how to rocket jump and complete a jump map easily. Different classes have different abilities, switch to the class that you are more comfortable with. But learning how to use more than 2 classes is important, you can switch classes if need be. This game offers a variety of weapons, each different for every class. Every weapon in the game is now balanced. And please, this game is not pay to win. You just have to pay 5 bucks to get premium status and trade your way up there. A weapon would not cost more than a dollar if you actually use the trading system wisely. The game also offers hats and miscs to wear for your favourite classes. There are people, called traders who trade their way so high up there, their backpack is worth a few hundred thousand dollars. If you're in into making a profit off a game that costs 5 dollars, and unlimited fun, this game is for you.

review: It is very rare to find a quality free-to-play game that's enjoyability does not diminish with play time. If you're reading this, you've found a prime example of such a game in Team Foretress Two. This multiplayer-centric, class based fps offers a wonderfully different and addictive experience for those burnt out on the typical first-person-shooter format. You can not run in solo, guns a blazin', and expect to do well in this game. You will have to choose from the nine classes offered and find which works best for you. All about destuction? A Heavy will loads of fun for you. Prefer to hang back and deal out death from a distance? Go Sniper. More of a healer than a fighter? Be a Medic and keep evrybody else going. None of these classes are invincible, however. A Heavy is a slow moving tank that will need constant support to stay alive, and and if you make one false move as a Spy, you'll get lit up. As the name suggests, teamwork is key here. You will need to find what play style and team startegy best compliments your prefered class. The equippent unlocks will also give you a reason to keep playing, as you hope to find that one piece of gear you really want. Get the basics and teamwork down, and you'll find yorself hooked, spending way too much time on this amazingly done, free-to-play title.

review: Team Fortress 2 offers a simple proposition: Throw a wall of humanity at a given objective and see what happens. The result is unimaginably entertaining and seemingly never gets old. The addition of item drops offer variety, but does not become a hinderance in the sense that you should feel the need to do 'homework' before jumping into a game. In fact, the ability to jump into a game is arguably TF2's greatest strength. Yes, there are classes with different abilities, and there are tutorials that will introduce you to the basics, but the game is simple enough to be able to learn by doing, and the frantic pace/ability to change classes between deaths will allow for quick experimentation to find your niche. Data on your performance with each class in loading screens are a nice way to recieve feedback if you're looking for it. Perhaps the best indicator of the emphasis on fun over compeition is the inclusion of kills but no deaths. There's really no way to tell if the guy sitting at 150 kills has it because they're god's gift to TF2 or because they've been playing for 6 hours straight, because there's no other frame of reference. This is a good thing because the goals of TF2 are immediate: Get the flag, push the cart, kill the guys wearing different clothing. The versatility of the format is also on display with the addition of a co-op mode: Mann vs. Machine. This, arguably, requires a bit more knowledge of the classes to successfully battle back a horde of robots, but also provides a new level of fun in the more tight knit group which is ideally composed of friends or agreeable strangers. With the inclusion of new items and holiday game modes, TF2 continues to be just as fun to play as it was the very first day you log in. Given the fact that it's free to play this really feels like a title someone should have tried at least once, and will continue to offer pure fun on afternoons where you simply can't make up your mind or have grown bored of other titles.

With the protective shield, medics can protect their teammates. TF2 is really awsome,and since its F2P, you should get it if you love FPS and PVE.

I've also played on many servers, and I'm yet to find those "abusive players", "glitchy content" or "poor support from Valve" that was mentioned by one reviewer. Don't know what they're talking about. This game is clean, smooth, fun, hacker-free (hackers get banned permanently), well-balanced, funny, easy on the eye, and players are for the most part friendly and cool. If you like online shooters, this is a must-get!

review: Team Fortress 2 An extemely addictive multiplayer Free-to-play FPS that pits two teams, (Red and Blu) aginst each other in objective based gamemodes ie. Capture the flag and Payload Race. There are nine classes to choose from, each giving a different experience to the player. With a multitude of weapons, you can customise a loadout that suits you and your style of play for an enjoyable round everytime. TF2 is a game that you can pick up and play whenever, for infinite replay value. And with a variety of community-made content, (gamemodes, maps, ect) there is always something new to experience. Also, there are hats.

review: You like HALO, Call of Duty, or anything in between? Then this game, ladies gentlemen, is for you. As opposed to the classic "Sprint like hell for the rocket launcher in the middle of the field" why not just spawn with one? Don't worry about getting bored from being too good with it, the Pyros, Snipers, Demo-Men, Heavies, other Soldiers, or any of the 9 playable (and customizable) classes will make sure you eat plenty of humble-pie as you walk your dead  back from the spawn point...oops! Forgot about that Sentry didn't you? Let me put it like this: Pyro: W+MOUSE1, n00b! Engineer: Build stuff, like Sentry Guns Heavy: Find a Medic and unleash hell with your mini-gun! Soldier: Fire rockets at your enemy's feet, or at your own and launch into the air. Demo-Man: Destroy eveyone and everything with an array of bombs! Sniper: Support your team from afar! Scout: Hit and run son, hit and run... Medic: Use your Med-gun to heal teammates and make them innvunerable! Spy: Cloak and Dagger.

review: TF2 is, to put it boldly, the most fun multiplayer FPS on Steam, and probably on PC. Call of Duty it isn't, and that's a good thing. Team Fortress 2 is a game where you choose from one of 9 different classes, all of which are expertly balanced and offer a playstyle for everybody, and try to complete an objective with your team. Teamwork is extremely important here, and those who just want to run around and do their own thing, trying to get as many kills as possible, won't last very long. Every class has a weakness that can be covered by another class, and when the right combination of players get together, magic can happen. There is no reason for you not to play this game, especially since it's free.

The hat/trading system can be pretty cool too, fun to use but the game is still fun nonetheless. Plus, It's free, so what are you waiting for?

Want a different weapon mechanic-- make a new ing weapon! :P

review: TF2 is a game where you shoot people with nine playable gun guys. This game is good because it runs on my gay- computer that struggled to run portal 1. The goal of the game is to look as fabulous as possible while shooting the enemy; this is achieved with the use of hats and other $WAG clothing. I give it a 2/10 because all the characters are straight cis white males (with the exception of the latino demoman who earns a six figure salary) who need to check their privelage.

review: A unique FPS which is frequently updated and enjoyed by millions of players to this day. Unfortunately for new players, there is a steep learning curve in matching up to experienced players, which I believe leads alot of new players with little patience to become frustrated. If you have enough patience to train yourself in the renowned art that is TF2, I suggest you download this game immediately, Did I mention that it's free? 10/10 a great game, but not something you can get into easily, unless you want to get your  handed to you several (thousand) tiems.

As for the gameplay, TF2 looks beautiful in it's own cartoony style and I have really enjoyed it. Overall i would give TF2 a 9/10 just becuase of the slight tediousness of the mann vs machine gameplay, as it is very fun but it gets a bit old with the same thing simply with different enemies.

review: Team Fortress 2 is a fast paced, FPS that's full of fun. With 9 completely different classes with different roles, this game can easily become one of your favorites. TF2 is one of Valve's gems, with constant updates and different weapons to try for each class. And Team Fortress 2 is NOT Pay to Win. The only thing to spend money on is cosmetics. Nothing more. Team Fortress 2 is one of the best FPS games to ever hit the scene. 9/10

review: Have you ever sat down and thought to yourself "Geez I hope there is a new Call of Duty game coming out soon"? Well then chances are you aren't my friend. Why wait for COD when you can play a game that has been popular since 2007. TF2 has amazing gameplay, an awesome fan community, and hats. You know a game can't get any better when there are hats involved. So drop what you are currently doing, click the download (and install) button and start clicking on people to play one of the best games I have ever spent more than 1200 hours of my sad life on. -Remi (A.K.A SPIRIT)

review: A game doesn't get 1500 hours of playtime by being bad, or even by just being good. A game gets 1500 hours of playtime by having collectible hats. I -would- tell you to buy this game immediately, but Valve has decided, in their infinite generosity, to make it Free-to-Play. As such, why the hell don't you have this game yet? Simply excellent.

So overall its a decent free game.

review: What can a guy say about TF2? Well, lot's of things. Yet, I have to say its paramount appeal is character. The twisted humour, the endless amount of pieces you can blow somebody into with a single shot. Such is its life and soul: TF2 is always there for you with its whimsical slaughter. There for insomniacs to lean on, or the sick, or the bored. It's more than a game, it's a friend. SANDVICH

game-hours: 460.8
review: This game is great. Seriously. Even if you never played an FPS, you still need to play it. TF2 involves 2 teams (RED and BLU) trying to accomplish an objective. There are 9 classes to choose from, and they all play completely differently from each other. For example, the Scout is incredibly fast, but he has low HP. The Heavy is the opposite: he's the slowest class in the game, but he has a whopping 300 health. The classes counter each other nicely: are Spies backstabbing your team and easily taking down your defenses? Get some Pyros on your team to blast them away with their flamethrowers, getting rid of their disguises and invisibility. The game also has a lot of unlockable items. There are weapons that have slightly different stats than the orignals: for example, the Heavy's Brass Beast minigun does more damage than the stock minigun, but has a slower spin-up time and lowers your move speed more when spun up. There are also weapons that completely change how a class works: the Sniper's Huntsman replaces the sniper rifle with a bow that is best suited for medium-range fights. The game also has a TON of hats: these don't change any stats, but they make your classes look as swagtastic as possible. There's also a great trading system. The unoffical currencies of trading are scrap metal, crate keys, and earbuds: it's weird, but it's easy enough to get rich-ish. Overall, I'd recomend TF2 to anyone who likes video games. Also, it's free.

The game is very fun and you can sink a chunk of time into it; it'll feel like you've been on only for a short time. Community is overall a pretty nice one, there are always trolls in every game how ever; not the most toxic community, troll wise but it can be unpleasent at times. Overall 10/10 would rail again.

review: Tom Clancy's Team Fortress 2 takes us deep inside the thrilling world of international espionage, where sinister decisions that affect the future of every living soul on the planet are brokered in dark rooms thick with smoke and tension so thick, it chokes. The tagline reads "The most fun you can have online", but can anyone truly enjoy themselves when faced with these impossible decisions? What is in the intelligence briefcase? Is it worth murder? Where shall we go for lunch? I urge you to avoid this game entirely. Thank you.

review: Hat Simulator 2014 Anyway, apart from the overused joke, the actual game is something that's always different, there's always more  that can happen to one person, and more amazing crap that just seems to happen at random. Wanna be good at this game? Well  that! There's always someone who's going to be better, in other words, bragging is something nobody has right to. Because the skill levels are absolutely insane in the people who play this. Good game. Pick it up or something. Or don't. Just go back to playing Nuclear Throne. :3

review: Here's the thing. No one really plays TF2. Sure, there are competitive matches and "Tryhards", but no one really plays the game. You just have fun. And hats. Can't forget about the hats. Where was I? Oh yes. Fun. Sometimes the best thing to do is get a couple friends, hop onto an empty server, and see who can win in a sniper versus spy battle. Or pyro tennis. Or frying pan battles. Or Demoknight Olympics. Whatever it is you're doing, you're most likely having fun. And that's why I love this game. It's the hats. Or was it fun? Meh, whatever.

review: A team-based (obviously) FPS that's as welcoming to first-timers as it is for seasoned vets. The various weapons available by achievements, drops, crafting and shop let you customize your class to how you want to play. And the various maps by Valve and the community gives you tons of options for places to play. Best enjoyed with friends. Now that this game is free you really have no excuse NOT to play it. It may seem intimidating to come in new when others have all kinds of newer weapons but don't let that keep you away! Stock weapons let you enjoy the game and in no way hinders your ability to have fun and assist your team. Plus since you get item drops anyway, you can still customize your classes with some of the other weapons so that your class plays the way that best suits you. If you want to get the benefits of a paid account just spend a buck in the MANN Co. store and you're in as good as those of us who paid for the game.

review: Everyone who is just "remotely" into FPS games should give this a try. It has some kind of cartoonish graphics, so IMO any young person age 8 and up could play it, since it's not a gore fest or wants to be realistic, its about the fun, the shooting and playing the character that you chose well. And last but not least it shouldn't be forgotten: IT'S FREE TO PLAY, TOO! Go get it!

review: 9/10 stars, I recommend this game because its EXTREMELY addictive, now some people may find this bad so if so ignore this review entirely. This game made me have access to such a great community. With this game I gained TONS of friends. I recommend this game for people who like FPS (First Person Shooter). At first you should steer away from the community trading, because then you have got alot to learn.. The only thing that makes this 9/10 is that Valve isnt implementing any weapons in, even ones on the workshop. But I do understand that its hard to add them, so thats why its 9/10.

review: Game: Team Fortress 2  Genre: FPS, Action, Hat-Wearing Simulator  Rating:      5/5  Favorable Aspects: Back in 2007, when it was released, not a lot of people had knowledge about this nowadays masterpiece, prefering to play games such as CS and it's mods. But what did TF2 have that none other game at the time could achieve? Well, we can point out many reasons, but I'll only detach two: game experience and simple gameplay. Combine a "cartoon" graphics FPS game with lots of classes, funny characters and objectives, then you'll get a different gamestyle everytime you join a match. I won't extend it because pratically every decent FPS gamer should've already played it or at least took a look, just ask around.  Negative Aspects: As every work has it's weak spots, it couldn't be different with TF2. To summarize: the addition of hats along with all the cosmetic items brought good and bad effects. The good (specially for Valve): you can customize your character outfit the way you like it, for a price of course. The bad is the unequal proportion between cosmetic and weapon updates, since they introduce a lot more cosmetic items than weapons. Besides, it was spent enough time to produce a new Team Fortress title.  How much is it worth to pay: [] Full Price* [ ] 75% [ ] 50% or Less *

review: This Is a very good game this game I play the most of, of all of my games, its a good fast clean game. Really good graphics and the ragdoll physics are amazing. (when force is aplied and objects move like they would in real life) This game does have blood and gore but it is real n ot that bad compared to some games. Great multiplayer game, just a great all around game. It may be free but their is a shop to buy new items in the game and it is really tempting not to go buy something. I have used like $20 on this game so be careful I give this game a 4 out of 5 stars.

review: 60's-70's action movie feeling? Sounds badass! An eye-catching exceptional graphical style resembling somewhat Pixar-esque? Fascinating. Lots of gratuituous ,graphical and humourous violence? Oh yes! Gameplay, which emphasises teamwork and is most fun when you man up with your mates - in addition giving a big middle finger for the opposing team by showing them how their collective effort sucks compared to your valuable, well-forged plan? HELL YEAH! It's Team Fortress 2! Even though it lacks the charm of grenades and insane leet tricks which you were able to perform in Team Fotress and TFC (my old love~), the TF2 works as a brilliant spiritual successor for its grandfather games I loved to play too. Get your hands on it - try it out, and see if you like it or not - for it's FREE!

As long as you've spent money on your steam account (at least 99 cents+) and you can progress in the game just as much as anyone else. The only bad part I would say is the TF2 Supply Crates, just because its $2.49 a key and you usually don't get anything good. But regardless, Great Game.

review: Don't base games on graphics. I did this to TF2 - I played it, but I still did it. Now, what is this game about? An FPS with a great community (generally) and even better gameplay, which is totally unique (more unique than your generic FPS, e.g. CoD/Combat Arms). There are constant updates (at least for a F2P game (   ) ), no pay2winning, and best of all, it's free. Also, hats. Hats are great. You love hats and will do anything to get hats. TL;DR  game don't play 10/10 - IGN

The community can get kinda rude at times, but 99.9% of the time, the community is so helpful and is a great game to play when you're feeling down. Over 800 hours for me, and this game has given me so many friends that I am so thankful to have and trust. This game is free, so anyone that has no money on steam, this is the only game you will ever need.

review: 8/10 This game is so good & there is too much content to see it all, but after a while it gets too repetative & you find yourself putting hours into a game which will not end. Even though you have spent a week on sniper for instance there will be someone better than you & will beat you. Believe me i spent 2 years on this game & it is a must have but dont expect to spend your life enjoying every moment. For now i will leave you in peace & thankyou for reading my review.

review: The game was very fun for all my buddys at school a year ago but after a while gets a little dull, so we joined servers with different game modes like arena. BUT alot of people in tf2 im guessing about 60% just play for items to sell its very annoying while playing a game. All people do is try to offer there items out to other people and then sell what they got in return. Soon youll join with the trading side i give 1-3 months till your obsessed with hats and trying to get alot to sell and trade. So overall basically gameplay is good WHEN PEOPLE PLAY. so i recommend this game just stay away from trading and youll have aBLAST!just trade weapons if ya wanna STAY AWAY FROM HATS N CRATES AND DONT BUY KEYS btw dont buy a item from store,unless you want more space just buy a 50 cent weapon and then never buy weapons again trade people for them. ONLY WEAPONS

review: This is the best game i have ever played. very good graphics, audio and maps. I also enjoy the wide variety or weapons to find.
game-hours: 2992.6
review: Very fun game, with a very fair f2p model. A very large community as well. Gameplay The game has nine different classes, each requiring different strategies to play. The use of specific items can change these strategy, adding more customization. Hats are fun too. Has a wide selection of game modes, with even more mods. Community There are many communities who run servers, and different people reside in different communities. Some communities, such as my favorite, Saxton Hell, have a very large diversity. There's a large modding community, large gaming community, and there's always a server out there. Difficulty Has a fairly steep skill curve, especially with more difficult classes. Some classes are easy to learn, however, such as soldier or heavy. Mann vs Machine A very different game mode compared to all the others. Weapons that were once situational or gimmicky become kings, and weapons that used to be amazing become useless. It's like a whole new game. There are some random kickers, however. Not as many as Left 4 Dead 2, luckily. Very fun game, strongly recommend. Very good f2p model, and VERY fun with friends.
game-hours: 269.6
review: Each class has their own play styles, and more can be learned from the other classes. For example, i used to suck as the spy. i didnt know the maps very well, and my skill with the revolver was non existant. After some time with the scout, i learned the maps better. Some more time, as the sniper, and I refined my aim. I am a decent spy now. Another strong point for the game is the weapons. While not upgrades, each weapon can change the enjoyment you get from one of the classes. Dont like how slow the heavy is? Put on the Gloves of Running Urgently. Want to heal during combat as the soldier? Meet the Black Box. Liking the demo but wanting to go medieval on someone? give him a sword and sheid and unleash the DemoKnight.

review: Team Fortress 2, a masterpiece in online entertainment. What I like most is there's no pressure, few flamers, and a laid back environment to shoot people. There is no better bonding between friends that hitting a Heavy with a baseball bat. Guaranteed fun, but if your computer is slow, the game will be practically impossible to play. Need quick reaction, and a steady mouse. What's more... it's FREE!

game-hours: 1422.2
review: This game is unfathomably good. I don't even like first-person shooters, and not only do I still like TF2, it's actively my favourite game of all time. There are 9 classes, each with different playstyles, and each with a bunch of different weapons you can use to fine-tune the class to how you want to play. It's impressive how balanced the game is - each weapon has benefits and drawbacks compared to the stock weapons you have when you first start the game. There are a few whose benefits outweigh the drawbacks and vice-versa, and a couple that are literally direct upgrades, but you never feel like you're at a huge disadvantage by not having certain weapons. The fact that the game's around 7 years old and they're still updating it is incredible. The Mann vs. Machine update added a new game mode that's a sort of tower defence game. It could have been its own $20-$30 game, but nope, Valve gave it to everyone for free. There are some advantages premium players have over free players, but none of them directly affect gameplay - Premium players can keep more items and trade. Trading makes it so easy to get weapons and Premium can cost less than a dollar, so I really don't see any reason to not upgrade yourself to Premium. I guess at some point I have to talk about hats. They seem silly, right? Why bother making so much of the content have no effect on gameplay? But that's exactly why they do it! A new weapon isn't just about modelling and scripting. You have to make sure it's balanced and can't be exploited in any way. But hats and other cosmetic items can't possibly be 'unbalanced', so of course they can add a hundred hats easier than they can add one new weapon. Maybe they could focus more on weapons, but there are already so many as it is; you don't want to make it impossible for new players to catch up. So obviously TF2 is amazing. 10/10 would play again and probably will this afternoon. There are, however, a few drawbacks. TF2's normal devotion to balance makes it all the more glaring when something isn't balanced. The Soldier has so much versatility in his weapons that it's pretty easy to call him /the best class/ in a game that's supposed to be about teamwork. It's pretty easy to see Valve playing favourites with the Soldier. If some class has a weapon that players are favouring over the other options, most of the time Valve will nerf the over-used weapon (ex. the Spy's Dead Ringer). But for the Soldier, they'll just buff the under-used weapons (ex. The Concheror and Battalion's Backup). Giving the Soldier extra upgrades in Mann vs. Machine also reeked of favouritism when it's the Spy and Pyro who needed the help. One other drawback is that the store's prices on weapons has absolutely nothing to do with how rare / common they are. This isn't really Valve's fault, but it makes a lot of things in the store complete rip-offs. Suppose you want a Phlogistinator. It costs $10 in the store. OR you could buy four Keys ($2.50 each). Each key is worth, in the trading economy, about 100 Phlogistinators. I'm not exaggerating. (Phlogistinator: 0.05 - 0.11 refined. Key: about 8.66 refined.) Basically, once you know a little bit about the economy, you feel like you have to REALLY get into it so you don't get ripped off. Or maybe that was just me.

review: The game is fun. The community is normally SO much better than that of Cod's or BFF's. The micro-transactions are good too. You can get almost anything from item drops in-game. And there are so many different gamemodes! You have the default ones, Doomsday, CTF, CP, but then you have community made ones (that I think some should be real ones,) Freak Fortress 2, Arena, X10, all very fun! It's also very easy to record, as you can easily set up events, give yourself a challenge, or simply shoot at things! All the classes are very different as well, and can help eachother on the same team, (Medic + Heavy) or can destroy eachother on the opposing team, (Sniper + Spy or Spy + Pyro.) Anyways, I recomend this game to everyone, even if you dislike FPS games, because to be honest, this game will never be normal. It's to late to go back.

review: A great game that you become addicted to the minute you play it. Just don't fall into the temptation to buy hats or weapons, because once you start you cannot stop, it is like a drug. But other than the incredible amount of things you can buy it is a great free to play game.

With a diverse amount of game modes and classes. A great amount of fun- if you want to be good it takes practice (then again so do most things). I would also recommend watching gameplay videos from other pros just to get an idea of what or not to do! A good community, I've had plenty of laughs on this game and most of my steam friends I first met on TF2. May not be everyone's cup of tea, but it's free, and if you love playing online- this is, without a doubt, woth a try! Also hats; HATZ, U GOT HATS? PLLSSSSSS!!! I NEEEEEEEEEED HATZ, DON'T WANT A COLD SCALP... Sorry about that- hats do things to you :p In all seriousness a definite recommendation!

review: This game, right here, basicly is the best multiplayer first person shooter Ive ever played. There are many events/things that you can do in this game. From trading, to gambling to making friends and even just having a good old time. This game has taught me many things as well. Things like marketing, trading, and how a basic economy works. There are many different minigames/major events in this game. Like Valve's masterpiece of an idea: Mann Vs. Machine. Team up with friends, beat endless hords of Graymann's robots, and collect loot! There is even a major event for halloween. So much fun! Battle the demoman's huge eye, the sinister Headless Horseless Headsmann, Marasmus the wizard, soldiers old roommate; and help the Mann Brothers settle a dispute once and for all! Overall, this is the best online multiplayer game I have ever played yet. Totally get this!

Now free to play, don't worry, you aren't going to get jipped into buying a million things you don't want to just to have a fair chance or feel un-noobish. You can still receive weapons and items for free, though the stock weapons really are the best for balanced gameplay. Oh yeah, and there's hats. And guess what. You can pay ten cents (literally, ten cents) and get a hat for free, and opening up the opportunity to have more free hats. It's definitely worth it. Hands down it is probably one of the most developed communities and enjoyable multiplayer experiences I've seen.

Did you know that Team Fortress 2 is the world's best, most realistic and most fun Hat Simulator in the world? That alone should be why you play this game! Well, in the end the gameplay is still fantastic and now we've got a bunch of silly weapons that either induce great rage in your opponents or induce dance parties. I just don't even know anymore. Play this game.

review: I seriously, cannot get enough of Team Fortress 2. It's the only game I've played where people seem to care more about the hats you wear more than the actual game. Yet I still find this game extremely fun. Fast paced action with tons upon tons of humour to help it. The 9 classes are all diverse with thier own personalities and weapons. With the game constantly updated with new items, hats, weapons and recently, new taunts, the game is just so enjoyable to play and I definately recommned it to everyone. TL;DR Hats, Taunts, People doing the Conga instead of playing the game. 11/10 obligitory " hat similator" joke goes here.

review: A great game. I havent found anyhackers and have passed 30 hours for game record. my only problems are 1-I dont find many items and when i do they are ones i already have, 2-you come against people who have way better stuff then you because they spend real money to get ahead and 3-Crafting, i smelt weapons into metals and when you get enough for a weapon it says you need blue prints-HOW DO YOU GET THEM!!!! i like the gameplay style and there aredifferent servers and gamemodes to suit any one. all in all, i think it is a great game to kill time adn is enjoyable. 8/10 stars

And this game basically stole my money, and it was worth it... This game is a load of fun, and it will never get old for me, so if you haven't played TF2, but your thinking about it, you should definitely do it! It'll be worth the time.

review: At first, this casual first person shooter may look like a nice little time waster. But stop right there! You haven't even scratched the surface. Team fortress isn't about teams defending a fortress at all. This game was developed by Valve to toy with human desire itself. Hats. That's the real game. The classes, the maps, the weapons, none of it actually matters! But the precious hats are what keeps everyone coming back. Do I recommend this game? Would you recommend heaven in the form of hats to your friends?

review: There are nine classes to use in this game, The first one runs up to people and shoots them point blank, the second one is overpowered and can just shoot a full clip of rockets at stuff to destroy it no matter how hard you try to stop it because they made a weapon to stop rockets but they nerfed it for no reason, the third one sets you on fire that kills you after you kill him and you can't stop the fire because your stupid teammate took the health when they didn't need it and you can't get a medic to help you because they just pocket the heavy who isn't doing anything helpful, the fourth one forgets the grenade launcher and just uses the stickybomb launcher detonating the stickies before they hit the ground, the fifth one always get attacked because your team doesn't help you except for medics who won't go away, The sixth one has stay permanantly in one area or his stuff gets destroyed, the seventh one either only heals one person or doesn't heal anyone and tries to kill people, the eighth one bodyshots people, and the ninth one abuses the dead ringer and uncloaks in front of you. None of this matters though because you just need hats to have fun the problem being people will try to take hats from you and offer little in return. The way to stop them however is to change your name to something offensive and then they will avoid you. 20/10 wonderful game

review: This is easily, by far, 100% the best game I've ever played. The balance is perfect (mostly). Unlike a lot of FPSs these days, the mercs have massive, intertwining backstories. The weapons and mechanice are the strangest things in existence (Medigun, rocket jump anyone?) but still come together to create a perfectly balanced game. Sure, there are some horrible people out there, but the TF2 community is the most open to new players out of all the FPSs. TF2 is the only place you can get the rush of pouring bullet after bullet into Major Crits (that ), trying to blow him up before he deploys the bomb. Whether you're playing MvM or just a normal match of 2Fort, you'll find the nicest, most helpful people. TF2 really emphasizes the "Team" aspect of video games. 12/10 would play forever.

review: For a free to play game, this is almost perfect. First of all, it can run on my terrible computer, so we're off to a good start. Second, it's free. I'm usually low on funds, so that's awesome. Third, there's tons of items EVERYWHERE. With the variety, it's almost impossible to not find a working combination to use. And don't complain that you have to pay for items, because you don't. If you play in random boot camp servers all day, you are guaranteed at least ten free items. Granted, they could all be the same thing, but that's what community market is for. Forth, and most overlooked, there is an offline practice with bots mode. I have a laptop, and my internet is terrible (I call it NL for negative latency). This mode ensures I can at least play PvP mode. Five, for the most part, the community doesn't suck like other communities *cough* call of duty *cough*. Sixth, Valve is always updating it with new content. And lastly, this is the best hat simulator you will ever play. EVER. NO EXCEPTIONS. ALL OTHER HAT SIMULATORS WILL BE LABELED AS POSERS. My one concern (or complaint) is that several of the Ghost Town servers have map rotation on. You do NOT do that to people. Ghost Town is not a normal MvM map. If people choose the Ghost Town server, they should have a dedicated Ghost Town server. If I wanted to play another map, I would have chosen another map. Since most of the MvM Ghost Town servers aren't directly managed by Valve, I can't hold it against them. But we seriously do need more Ghost Town dedicated servers. 10/10 Would visit Pyroland again.

review: Good ol' Team Fortress 2, a very good game with built in sqeakers, try-hard snipers, and rage heavies in my opinion it is still a very good game. In-fact its the first game that i actually spent money on and before this game I've played over 20 games and didn't want to spend money on them. I recommend this game to all my friends with cool class classes such as mischievous spy, kamikaze soldiers, and who can forget the all round ADHD scout. Oh almost forgot to mention, you might have spent only 10 cents on the game but by the time you quit you will have a good $40 in your pocket.

review: Ah, Team Fortress 2 It was a beautiful day outside the birds were chirping and the sun was shining until... There was a notification it popped up telling me that I had found The Rainblower and the Genuine Tough Guys Toque. I was so happy I jumped out of my seat with excitement. So I joined a lobby on Capture The Flag and I loved The Rainblower it didn't do anything for me but I loved the Genuine Tough Guys Toque the same way Until one day I abused my power I got carried away and I used an item hack Then it started Raining and shortly Lightning struck as I went to the kitchen to put my fishsticks in the toaster I opened the freezer to get my fishsticks but then The Great Gaben came out from the freezer and said to me ' I shall ban you from ever playing TF2 again for using HAXXX!!! ' And I said no!!! And he said yes so I accepted the ban and never played again. (True Story) 11/10 Would Play Again.

It focuses a lot on teamwork and objectives, allowing players to work together and achieve a certain goal, and at the same time make new friends with players from both teams. Also a great platform for friends to have lots of fun together on random maps (official and non-official). Game mechanics is awesome with hilarious stuff (voice responses, ragdolls) that I never get tired of. Overall a great game that has brought endless hours of entertainment. Would recommend everyone to play.

review: PC Gamer called it "the most fun you can have online!" That's probably the most accurate review there is. This game is incredibly diverse, you can get into the trading community and make your way to unusuals, you can be the best player in the world in the competitive environment of TF2, you can show your artistic skills with Source Filmmaker, destroy endless amounts of robots in the always-chaotic Mann vs Machine, and of course, you can always just screw around in a public server. No game is perfect, but Team Fortress 2 isn't far from it. I wholeheartedly recommend this masterpiece to any gamer worth his/her salt.

review: This game is slowly consuming my life. My grades are dropping, my family never sees me, and I'm beginning to have trouble differentiating this game from reality. I go to stores to buy things, but I find that my metal is not accepted. This is a plea for help and the beginning of a movement. Valve, either start giving free treatment to those hopelessly addicted souls like myself, or make Scrap, Rec, Ref, Bil, and Buds the world currency. 15/10 would snort.

review: You know those games that no one will shut the  up about, well that was how i thought of team fortress 2, as another bland fps to add to the collection, but jumping into this game led to more then i could ever want from a game. Hilarious charecters and weapons, yet this stupidly funny game also has some of the most solid and complex gameplay ive seen come out of a fps. With unique weapons and strategies to each of TF2's nine classes, this game is sure to keep ANYONE intertained no matter what your favorite playstyle is, like being sneaky?, use the spy. like support classes?, try the medic or engineer.Like going in  rambo killing everything?, choose the pyro,heavy or soldier. by the way, there actually isnt a single class that's bad, the game is beautifuly balanced in that department, no class feels better then the other they all are the best in certain situations. Oh, and how could anyone forget the RIDICULOUS personalities of the classes, whereever its the balls to walls insanity of the soldier, the obnoxiousness of the soldier or the laid back sorta, gentle nature of the engineer. Now the weapons, MY GOD ARE THERE SO MANY WEAPONES, like jeasus christ, you can make a pokemon game out of these weapons, to not waste time i wont explain the weapons cause that will just be like writing the bible in a steam review. to wrap it up in a nice pumpkin spiced scented bow this game is free and money is only needed to buy the weapons (if you are too lazy to find them) and hats, if you want a game with enough hats to fill country then this game will snuggle nicley with you. while not having any buffs, there is something satisfying about dressing the spy as doctor who or the medic as a captain. This game is heavly multiplayer and will supply endless hours of fun with its humor, great gameplay and a whole stockpile of content this game is well worth the download but remember, spys are everywhere.

game-hours: 1869.1
review: Great game, I'd say nice people, but that isn't always the case. I know Valve is trying all they can to make TF2 a better, safer experience, but it'd really help if they added some sort of, kick-from-tf2 thing. To give hackers a better idea of what will happen if they keep doing what they're doing. I like the hats, keeping in touch with my friends, but most importantly, I love the unique-ness. Most Free to Play games are not entirely invigorating, but Team Fortress 2 breaks that line. Team Fortress 2 is the best Free to Play game I know, being it has great community, makes great animation partnered with Source Film-maker, and most importantly gives me something to say to others, "Yes. I play Team Fortress 2. Got a problem?" I am a proud player of the game.

Also there are different kinds of guns like stranges and festives which are pretty much a status of wealth anymore. To put the cherry on top there are different hats/miscs which change your characters appearence! So really with the guns, and the cosmetics there are over 20,000 different combinations for all nine classes. All in all i believe that this game is a perfect 10/10 score. 10/10

review: Team Fortress 2 (TF2) is the sequel to the game that put class-based, multiplayer team warfare on the map. TF2 delivers new gametypes, a signature art style powered by Valves next generation animation technology, persistent player statistics, and more. Unlike other "class-based" games that offer a variety of combat classes only, Team Fortress 2 packs a wild variety of classes which provide a broad range of tactical abilities and personalities, and lend themselves to a variety of player skills. Play as the flame-throwing Pyro, the room clearing Heavy, or the Spy, a master of disguises. Other classes include: Scout, Sniper, Medic, Engineer, Demoman, or Soldier. TF2 features the most advanced graphics of any Source-based game released to date  and the most exciting class-based action ever created. [Valve]

(when force is aplied and objects move like they would in real life) This game does have blood and gore but it is real n ot that bad compared to some games. Great multiplayer game, just a great all around game. It may be free but their is a shop to buy new items in the game and it is really tempting not to go buy something. I have used like $20 on this game so be careful I give this game a 4 out of 5 stars.

review: IGN asks, "What it is Spam, you've played this game for over one-thousand hours, whats the dealio , tell us what antics youve been up to over in dustbowl and 2fort?" Well I says, I've been too heavily immersed in TF2's cocaine graphics and aesthetics, sophisticated hat geometry technology and of course I absolutely must give credit to Valve's implemented economy that is so stable that even Greece and Spain can't handle the amount of jelly. Also, I almost forgot to mention the corrupt  who came up with the idea of a spreadsheet, I would be honoured to  in their toilets for their ingenuity in creating something many people strictly ing follow and dont want to deviate from because they think it's the new testament. 10/10  IGN, because we give honest reviews.

review: I have to say, TF2 is a very awesome and entertaining game. As long as you've spent money on your steam account (at least 99 cents+) and you can progress in the game just as much as anyone else. The only bad part I would say is the TF2 Supply Crates, just because its $2.49 a key and you usually don't get anything good. But regardless, Great Game.

review: This is probably my favorite game on Steam. Trading, all different maps, tons of weapons, hats (Can't forget those) and frequent updates that get better and better each and every update. The community can get kinda rude at times, but 99.9% of the time, the community is so helpful and is a great game to play when you're feeling down. Over 800 hours for me, and this game has given me so many friends that I am so thankful to have and trust. This game is free, so anyone that has no money on steam, this is the only game you will ever need.

review: Simply put, one of the greatest competitive multiplayer games ever created. Having played almost everything in the online FPS genre from the classics to the modern hits, Team Fortress 2 is the single game of the bunch that has kept me entertained years later; six years and counting thus far. The look and feel to the game and its characters ooze charm and personality. The plethora of different looks and loadouts keep the game fresh, with more new things coming out all the time. The gameplay itself is easy enough to pick up for immediate gratification, yet deep enough where it can take hundreds, if not thousands of hours to master any given playstyle. Whether you just put in spare time over a weekend, or dedicate several hours every day, TF2 has a way of making you feel constantly satisfied and rewarded as the years go by. Having adopted an extremely fair free-to-play business model now, there's no reason to not give it a go.

review: *WARNING SEREVERE SPELLING/TYPING MISTAKES INSIDE* I have waited long enough to write a review of this game, today is the day as i am bored out of my mind. To start off, this is a first person shooter game which succesfully grabs hold of a player and drags them away to a colourful and eccentric world where two companies/corparations fight each other endlessley with 9 specially selected mercanaries. The scout, The soldier, The pyro, The Demoman, The Heavy, The Engineer, The Sniper, The Medic and The Spy. All of these classes have their strenghths and weaknesses, such as lets say the sniper, he can very easily get 1 hit kill via headshots but as he is a camping unit he is especially weak to the spy's 1 hit kill backstab (unless you have the razorback which will more likely kill the spy) but then that spy is sucestible to the pyro's flames as he can "Spy Check" his team. This series has been so popular it has sprung a massive community of gamers, designers or even gamers who design the wepons themselves, it's even got itself a healthy succesful De-Make, Gang Garrison 1 & 2, this really does show how this game has become a pillar of valve's fans as it is a free to play game but with many in-game purchasing options. This brings to one the only things i have against this game. Those Danm Mann Co Crates. They are very good if you have the money to spend on keys but if you don't, well it clogs up valuable backpack space and basiclly prompts you to trash or buy a key to open the item. But all in all his is a great game beautifully made in a cartoonish bloody war type of fashion. I'd Recommend it to most players who have access to steam or the gearbox ill give it 0.8 out of 1 (as /10 is overused).

review: One of the best first person shooters, in my definition. The weapons definetly add a layer of versatility to the game, instead of everyone blasting their enemies with the same stock weapons. You don't even have to play the team-based TF2, if you don't want to. You can be a prop, hiding inconspicuously from others, face the CEO of Mann. Co, and even play short fast-paced minigames WarioWare style! I still marvel today at the intensity of the TF2 market, with hats bearing special effects going for hundreds of real world cash. Overall, a definite 10/10

Today I will usually just buy it too play the zombie/alien maps on console :).

review: This game, more than any other, rewards creative, stupid thinking and punishes being a joyless tryhard. Fun is built into the game's engine itself. It costs as much as the next breath you are going to take does, and will entertain for far longer than that bland mixture of gasses will. Stop breathing and play TF2 today!

review: This is so in my top 3 favorite video games of ALL TIME! It's like you took awesomeness with guns and BAM! You get tf2. This game took the original or "classic" and this game uses it as toilet paper after it ate a mexican burrito. The gameplay is diverse and intresting. There is also user created modes that even allow more fun and awesomeness. just good. But there is a cost to all good things (full metal alchemist reference). This game sometimes will having u going the hulk when there's a spy, engineer, or sniper really well placed. And there is the apocalypse of tf2, the squeakers (don don dooooooooon). They are ANNOYING, There was one time this one kid was honest with me and told me that he was 7, dear lord, parents, get more strict. I mean teens and adults are cool to play it because it involves a lot of guns. In the end, it's just fun and a really big awesome game that everyone, (except squeakers) should play. All in all 9.5 out of 10 :)

They are all douches about differnt things. Trading, age, how good you are, stuff like that. But all you gotta do is find a server with no banning and tell them to just shut the  up. Problem solved.

review: I Swear to god this is the best multiplayer game on the planet. Extremley well balanced. The graphics are simple (That's a good thing) and the art style is fantastic. You can go p2p for as little as 50 cents, which makes it pretty cheap. The trading economy is great. It requires alot of practice, though so I would only play with patience. Never really get boring, unless you are getting spawn camped (Spawn camping usually only lasts up to 3 minutes or less.) or getting destroyed byt the other team (I mean like getting punched by chuck norris destroyed). My favourite multiplayer of all time.

review: I enjoyed this game. The cartoonish style as well as the humurous dialogue gives this FPS a sort of charm you wouldn't find others. Frustrating at times for new players but after while you'll get the handle of it. Not alot of weapons but heaps of cosmetic items to keep your character sharp. Valve constantly updates the game for thier fanbase with no sign of slowing down. All in all, if you enjoy gore with a cartoonish style. You'll enjoy Team fortress 2.

review: This game is amazing. I just wanted to get that out there to begin with, but now I will tell you why. To begin with it is free, when ever a game looks interesting and is free, I would recomend you try it, and considering team fortress 2 is one of the more popular free to play shooters out there, I would highly recomend you check it out because a lot of people find it interesting and you might as well. secondly, team fortress 2 has a great core, and what I mean by that is that it has great concepts, good characters, and replayablity what with the expanding content. thirdly TF2 is adptable to your style of play with many different ways to play, be it agressive or passive, support or damage dealer, and there are many HUDs that may cater to your specific desire of what a first person shooter should look like. Finally there is a good community, with user submiited content which gives fans a way to give back to the community, and the facinating TF2 econmomy which is constantly shifting based off active user imput the game has a life and viatality that sets it aside to many other games I have played. On the whole I would rate TF2 5/5 stars, I truely belive that this game has so many amazing elements that are done right and I have no desire to stop playing anytime soon.

review: This Game stands out to it's name. Yes:It requires teamwork(Unless you are a selfish "Pro" player) The teamwork:It teaches you to respect others,the whole team must use teamwork and fast co-ordination to win a game,not only does it make your team Great but it also makes it easier for new fps players to learn. The Only dislikes:Underestimation from COD and solo-multiplayer games that dont require teamwork cod does teach you to do stuff alone but it makes you self-centered and selfish,Team fortress 2 has alot of customization options and is more friendly to computers with bad specs, only 21% of the squeeker population are from tf2 and 66% from Call of duty. Come to think of it tf2 introduces more violence than COD because of explosions that make you shatter into 7 pieces and also blades that can chop your head off,You cant say that tf2 is for young children to play.The reason why some young children slip through is because of their parents no keeping a good eye on them. Call of duty has 0% gore and is a child friendly shooter. For People who under-estimate tf2 are probably thai s and call of duty players. In team fortress 2 there is a wide range of things to do. :You Can Shoot a rocket under your feet and still fly in one piece. :create custom maps and mods. :Play on a no kill server and still have fun getting drunk and doing fun things. For people who only care about graphics:For the last time, good graphics and crap gameplay=99.9% bad game. Its not about the graphics but its about the heart and emotion you put into the game. A game doesnt need good graphics to be fun. Look at all the poor people who dont have enough money to get a good graphics card and cpu and etc. they need to expierience fun too.

review: Team Fortress 2 is one heck of an FPS. This game has no campaign mode, no in-game information regarding the story, or anything along these lines. However, it doesn't need these elements. The multiplayer is the only thing it needs, and it excels at this. TF2 offers an extraordinary amount of diversity. The most obvious of which are the nine classes. Each class requires an incredibly different playstyle than any other, all being unique with their own roles to play. The Scout can run around and distract opponents, while the Heavy tanks hits like no other. For this reason, the need for a team becomes obvious. Each class has distinct weaknesses that can be covered by the other classes. Thus the name, TEAM Fortress 2. However, there's more than just the nine classes to add to the diversity. Each class also has a slew of weapons that, while functioning similar, have enough of a difference to each that they can completely change the way you play a class. For example, the Direct Hit rocket launcher of the Soldier punishes the usual tactic of using the splash damage of the rocket in exchange for a powerful hit when connecting with the opponent. Each class has quite a few options with how they can play. TF2's reliance on your team makes each game play differently. Being on a heavily offensive team is much different than being on a team full of Engineers or Demomen. This requires the player to adapt and constantly need to adjust to fill any holes on the team. This is not a game where you can just fight individually and expect to succeed. This involves far more strategy and thought than the gameplay would initially have you believe. Speaking of the gameplay, it is simply fantastic. The controls are smooth, logical, and can fit any level of desired precision. There is, on a full server, a constant level of action from spawn up until death, and there's never a boring moment. TF2 is a game that must be experienced to understand just how excellent it is. This game is addicting, and never becomes dull like other FPS games. Since it is now free, there is no reason to not at least give it a try.

review: A review for a 7 year old game is not something i would usually write. But i figure after playing 1500+hrs of this game its time to actually give a fair review of this. Where to start? Well Team Fortress 2 (or TF2 everywhere else) is a humorous FPS game made by the wizards at the huge gaming company Valve (who made the very platform you're reading this review on). It involves the "story" of two teams (R.E.D. and B.L.U or Reliable Excavation Demolition and Builders League United) of their control over wastelands, gravel pits and dustbowls. The teams are made up of 9 playable types of Mercenaries or Classes which include the Scout, Soldier, Pyro, Demoman, Heavy, Medic, Sniper, Engineer and Spy. Each class has their own set of unique abilities skills which players can master including the Scout's double jump, Demoman and Soldier's ability to jump through the air with their own explosives (known as Sticky/Rocket Jumping) and the Spy's ability to disguise as other members of the enemy team in order to trick them into thinking they're friendly and then subsequentely backstab with his trusty them for an instant kill (a painful way to go i might add). Each class has its own purpose and function which at some points can prove to be crucial to winning games. The game modes themselves include a simple Capture the Flag mode in which one team must protect their own intelligence while trying to capture the other teams intelligence, a King of the Hill mode, a payload mode in which you must push a cart all the way through various checkpoints while the other team tries to stop you and many other modes as well. There even includes a mode called Mann Vs Machine in which waves of robots try to deliver a bomb to a point which you are trying everything you can to protect it which includes having to use upgradable abilities for each class which enables you to do huge amounts of damage to the robots themselves. There exists Halloween Modes with which you do battle with ultra powerful (if not obnoxious) wizards, giant flying eyeballs and a Horseless Headless Horsemann which can decapitate you instantly (Valve normally add a new boss every halloween as well so you never know what to expect). As with most First Person Shooters you have the capability to customize your classes, but the sheer amount of items you can customize your class with is unbelievable, from new weapons (which include killstreak weapons that count how many kills you get in a single life and stranges which count how many kills you get with that weapon), hats (which can include ultra rare Unusuals) and jackets, shoes and other humourous accessories such as teddy bears, voodoo dolls and so much more. There is so much content in this game you can find i cant even put it into words. So performance of this game? Well depending on what sort of pc you have (i have a decent laptop with which to play on) the game can run smoothly in places and badly in others (you may have to fiddle with settings a bit to find the best performance). But that doesn't mean this game is badly connected, in fact its very solid throughout after playing two years of it. As you can see as well, this game is Free to Play (forever) but you may have to consider spending a bit of money at least in order to access the full features of the game (such as crafting more things, having a bigger backpack and getting better item drops) but by all means you can play for free, its just that you cant access everything this game has to offer which can sometimes alienate players. The community for this game is fairly friendly (with the occasional player taking it too seriously) but i find you just ignore these kind of players you will always have fun with this game (That's what games are for right?) There is also a strong trading community within this game, with community made maps just for trading on and the trading is endless with this game (but always be aware of scammers, they exist, just keep on your toes). There is a competitive base for this game as well, with many tournaments and lobbies that exist for this game (and trust me, they're good players). And although this game can get frustrating at times, when you lose at the last hurdle or get dominated by someone multiple times, it immeadiately evens it up with satisfactory revenges and even winning games. Just keep a mind on the time because you're likely to spend a lot of it playing this game. So overall this game has endless content (even at Free 2 Play level I must say) a good variety of modes and challenge, smooth performance and an eye catching art style which is sure to grab any gamers attention. For free? This game is an absolute must have. Scores: Originality: 9/10 Fun: 9/10 Challenge: 10/10 Variety: 9/10 Performance:9/10 Overall: 9.5/10

review: When someone asks me why i like so much this game, i really don't know where to begin... It's funny, it's addictive but at the same time it's not easy as it seems. Every time you change class it's a new experience. A the end of the round, you will feel that sensation that you really helped your team. In fact cooperation is a HUGE factor in the game and that's pretty awesome. With the MvM update they added a whole new experience, so i suggest you play it with your friends. This game is FREE... what are you waiting for?! P.S. There are hats...

Why look like the average petty squabble like you do in Call of Duty, and Battlefield along with all those other games, when you can pick 9 distinct classes and make them FANCY*! You get to kill people with a Gun, Kill your enemies with a gun, Kill your friends with a gun, kill your friends enemies with a gun, kill everyone with a gun, kill yourself with a gun. All while looking FANCY*! What is there not to like? There is nothing to dislike! So go play Team Fortress 2, You peasant! * = Opinionated.

review: the game that has made me, laugh and had fun through most of my time on steam. this game is one of the best games ever made, customanization of your classes funny, weird and awsome hats, same with the miscs, tons of weapons and many taunts. they game is one of the best games to play if you need to let off some steam ( haha steam joke ). finding weapons take a while but it doesnt matter from all the fun you have inbetween. 8 plus gamemodes, halloween events that will astonish you and amazing custom maps. one of the best custom gamemodes is saxton hale, instead of just saxton you have a few more, including the easter bunny. smalls knives to golden miniguns. humans to giant robots, samurais to clowns with guns. this game is one of the best made and funniest games i have played in a long time. in halloween you can fight a giant flying eyeball that shoots smaller versions of it that explode. the headless horse man himself! an evil wizard called merasmus, he can spawn the king skeliton that will summon more smaller skelitons. want to make an item and put it on the workshop for an update? sure, steam will look at all of the items made and choose what one will be good for the update, then it will be put into the game. this game also promotes other games, like left for dead? get it and you will get bills hat in tf2, like left for dead 2? you will get ellis's hat, this game is deffinitly worth playing, its you simply cannot fall inlove with this game on first sight, sure people dont like this game but thats their opinion, this is my opinion, so if you liked what i said, get the game, oh and its FREE! sure you can buy stuff with real money ingame but it doesnt force you to. this game deserves a 99/10. enjoy the game, play it as much as you like. enjoy

review: Call of Duty: Modern Warfare has a cousin named Team Fortress 2. They're both from the FPS family. Except CoD was always the popular jock in town, and always had the looks, the brawns and the money. Team Fortress 2 on the other hand is that guy you wanna be friends with, get drunk with, party with, and/or cause a riot in town with. It's that FPS family member that you can always count on to not take business too seriously, and have fun with it. Team Fortress 2 has that cartoonish style, flair, and hilarity to it that even the most popular FPS games cannot compare to. And guess what? It's free. So grab your guns, your melee weapons, and your friends cause it's gonna be one hell of a ride with Team Fortress 2. Download and enjoy whenever you can.

review: I'll be honest here: I don't like First Person Shooters. It feels like 99% of them have dull graphics, uninteresting Michael-Bay-esque plots and vapid gameplay. When I first started up Team Fortress 2 I didn't expect much, given my past experiences with the likes of Call of Duty, Halo, Battlefield, etc. (which all bored me in about two minutes). Team Fortress 2, however, feels dynamic and refreshing. There are nine different classes. From the Soldier to the Medic, to the Engineer and the Spy, they all offer a unique style of gameplay, so it's likely you will find at least one that you have fun playing as. The characters that each represent a class all have quirky personalities and humourous lines, and I have come to love every one of them. I think everyone who has played TF2 has their favourite character. Teamwork is a big focus in this game and it's the key to victory. You can't roam around killing people on your own like in CoD because each class has their weaknesses that they rely on other classes to help mitigate. Deathmatch and Free-for-All aren't even game modes; all game modes involve completing an objective, so if you aren't willing to contribute to a group effort, you are doomed to face defeat over and over and it's as simple as that. This is a very positive gameplay trait and promotes a somewhat more friendlier and social experience. The likes of Call of Duty and Battlefield aren't nearly as co-operative as Team Fortress 2. Team Fortress 2 is easily my favourite FPS I've ever played. If you haven't tried it yet, I highly recommend you do. There's bound to be something you will love about it.

review: After I started playing TF2, I couldn't stop. One night, I was unable to sleep, and I was restless in bed, and I saw something appear through my window. After seeing the sillohete, I realied it was the Heavy, HE BROKE INTO MY HOME, AND TOLD ME THIS: "BUY MORE HATS, PLEASE MY MINIGUNS" And that day, I bought 69 hats, and then those hats multiplied into more hats, until the hats became sentient and started to attemt and kill my family. I praised to my lord, shrek, "Please stop making these hats appear!" But nobody responded, then GabeN told me, "TEAM FORTRESS 3 CONFIRMED" I cried. 11/10 GOOD GAME.

More Like Portal 2.

review: This is the best hat simulator you will ever play; it even has fun multiplayer for when you get bored of collecting hats! I honestly don't know anyone on Steam who doesn't have it, or want to have it. PS: You will never be as awesome as my Demoman with PINK SHADES AND GIBUS. It is scientifically impossible.

Oh, and if you wan't to really get into the game, the tf2 trading community will support you a freaking lot. So whatever, play this game or die, mkay? Hugs and kisses Roasty

Its very challanging because there are always players that are better than u so its hard for noobs but ive been playing for 4 years so there arent that many people who are better than me. Its funny to kill people and its just as funny to die to the characters really make the game to what it is today and if the characters wernt there it wouldnt be the same

It is a lot of fun playing with a range of other gamers (some of which are really good teammates). Also, I love that you can join a friend's game at any time during their gameplay! I would recommend this game to anyone just wanting a good, free multiplayer game. ;)

review: TF2 was the first game I played on steam and It is my favorite besides TorchLight and Terraria. I wouldn't recommend this game to kids younger than 12 because it does contain some mature content with strong violence. Even though it is only for 18 and up it does have some content that is humorous and occasionally comical to middle schoolers and people younger than 18. In videos for the playable classes most strong course language is bleeped out. The game play is simple, you play to achieve your teams objective which may be to capture a control point or capture their intel. In most cases the other team is trying to do the same and stop you from doing so, which is where part of the strong violence comes in. The other part of the strong violence is for the many ways you can kill your enemys ,rockets, flame-throwers, automatic guns and remote detonatable bombs. Part of the humer may be the classes back grounds and how they act. If TF2 is not the ideal game for you there are other games with almost the same game play of TF2 such as Ace of Spades. In conclusion TF2 will provide addictive game play for days ( and yes ) nights to come.

review: The game was good until they made it free-to-play which subsequentially caused a rush of hat collectors to flood the "player" numbers. It's still worth playing as it's one of the better free-to-play games but don't expect too much from it.

review: If you like hats, get this game. I for one love hats, and this is what this game is about. Hats. But really, this game has great support, is still being developed and improved and is pretty balanced, despite all the hats. And the name is game: TEAM fortress. If a team has 4 spies and 3 snipers, you will falter and fail and have to hear the others complain about how you are a noob. Do not listen to them, you can be the change you need. Simply choose a class that can alter the playing field. Teams is full of heavies? Spies and snipers, sure. But what about demomen and soldiers? Try pyros and heavies. Annoyed that you are stuck in a crucial area of the map? One or two medics with ber and all is forgotten. It is a simple process of rock, paper, scissors and you simply have to see what the other person's hand is and change accordingly. If you remain a rock, people will plaster you with paper.

review: The community for this game is pretty great. Most of the people on here are willing to teach you how to play any of the classes and make recommendations on which weapons to use, play style, etc. It's really easy to change the key layout so you can use a gamepad or other controllers. Matches are pretty short too, which means you can come home and play a quick game rather than having to devote an entire day to the game. There are also plenty of weapon drops, so you don't absolutely need to buy upgrades to have a chance to play better. Overall, pretty great game!

review: the bots have no real cone of view or anything and can turn around and shoot you in the face on the drop of a really heavy thing that falls fast, people have no idea how to fight, nobody uses melee weapons because you do more damage with a gun, scout moves 2fast2quick, heavy moves as fast as melting ice in the arctic, snipings hard, shotguns don't do much damage, medic is op, vita saw is worthless, ubersaw is amazing if you can hit something, everyone only cares about hats, not weapons or skill and they think conga is the best taunt in the world. 420/10 would bread again

review: Thanks to internet accessibility and micro-transactions gaming has embraced a new generation of nerf gun-toting, haxor-screaming, mountain-dew drinking pre-schoolers. Unfortunately, due to the advent of trick-shots and no-scopes intellectually decimating these junkies is no-longer a fun hobby. TF2 succeeds in bringing about new ways to annoy these delinquents in imaginative ways, whether you're w+m1ing an angry scotch dude or spy-sicling a circlejerker, TF2 caters for all of your trolling needs.
game-hours: 108.8
review: An increibly fun multiplayer fps that is still fun 7 years after it's release, no doubt because of constant updates from valve and fun class based gameplay. Dripping with personality and style, there is a certain wit and humour that is hard too find in other online fps's. It's great fun and I highly reccomend, not to mention it's free
