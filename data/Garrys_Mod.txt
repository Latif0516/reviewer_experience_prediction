review: Garry's mod is one of the best sandbox/community driven games on PC and possible in Gaming. If you are going to buy this, you should buy CS:S with it since many game modes use those textures in it. Sandbox mode is nice, you can do many things in that but many people also love to play on game modes, I would recommend TTT as a nice game mode if you find a good server but the sky is the limit in Gmod gamemodes(actaully it is the engine but eh). There are so many things to be said about this game and this review would go on for pages if you were to explain every single custom gamemode that is on garry's mod and you will get you 10/5/2.5 euro or whatever the price is out of it since there is constantly new content developed on servers. A great game with a good community if you know where to look.

review: Do I really have to write this review? I am just one in thousands of people who wrote a positive reveiw for Garry's Mod. Chances are, this review will never convince someone to buy Garry's Mod. It'll just be lost in the 100,000 positive reviews out there. Well, here I go anyway. "Where do I start?" This is the question asked by anyone playing Gmod for their first time. It's also my question that I ask about this review I am writing. Hmm... _The gameplay...the gameplay...hmm... Well, there's singleplayer sandbox. You can do...uh, whatever you want really. Just addon a few addons, and you can be entertained for hours. Battle NPCs, make cool scenes for cool screenshots, explore maps, be a superhero (spiderman addon!), and much, much, much, much- you get my point, right? Almost all content is user-generated. Make your own content! Multiplayer. In Multiplayer Gmod you can roleplay. I'm talking normal RP (DarkRP), Military RP, Star Wars RP, etc, etc. In multiplayer Gmod, you can battle, prophunt (yay), hide 'n seek, and much, much, more. _Graphics? I'll rate the graphics...drumroll please... 7/10. This game is and older game. Came out in 2006. I guess the graphics are good for 2006, and people enjoy the game and don't complain much about the graphics, but I'm not gonna lie, they are outdated and look old. It's not 2006 anymore. _Hear the bullets flying. The zombies growling. The people chatting. The boxes jumping... The sound in this game is great! Every sound is loud and clear, and there are a varitey of sounds. _Play this game. Play it again. Play it some more. Play some now, and play some later. Play it over and over. Play it as long as you want. _My Personal opinion. Get this game. Now. Get Gmod on sale or not. I'm not gonna stop playing it for a while and I'm already at 50+ hours of playtime. I love this game! WAIT! Before you go and buy this, then you wonder why there are all the missing maps and errors in most games, get Counter Strike: Source, so ALL the textures are supported. You need it to play MOST multiplayer games. Gameplay: 9/10 Graphics: 7/10 Story: N/A Sound: 8/10 Replayability: 10/10 Overall 8.5 Even though, this is one positive review on Garry's Mod, out of the thousands of positive reviews that have been submitted Garry's Mod, I hope this one convinces you to buy...

review: Source... always gold, wonderful and realistic game engine which's created by titans Valve. None modern engine, leastwise, can't boasts such flawless game physics. Well, have you ever thought about such absurd and strange things as: Deadpool on the Moon; picking up Titanic with help of balloons; bathroom awheel (RV, yo); meeting Gabe Newell with Gordon Freeman; Yoda from Star Wars playing on bass; or Mad Max's car, which's driving by Zoindberg? I guess, on these inadequate ideas and dreams couldn't throught even Uwe Boll. "What did you say? We're going to make Garry's Mod!" - said Facepunch. Garry's Mod - is boundless (in the most wide meaning of this word) physics sandbox, which striking mind and imagination of each player. It's should to understand two different meaning between 'open-world' and 'sandbox'. So the first gives possibilities to explore open world without any changes in it's basic concept (examples: Grand Theft Auto, Far Cry, Fallout and others). But 'sandbox' it's something bigger and grander. That game genre allows to player to make own the only and unrepeatable world. If you don't want to create all by your own hands - take prepared in Workshop! W-shop made Garry's Mod brilliant. The graphic side of game the same as anothers games based on Source - common. Actually, nothing wrong. 'Cause Source wasn't created for amazing visual style (but in it's ages it did graphic revolution, I think), but for accuracy happening. Garry's Mod is unique videogame giving unlimited gameplay possibilities. It's pleased for all kinds of gamers, even the most fastidious. The game for centries.

review: Despite its release date, this is still one of the best games out there, where only your imagination is the limit to what you can do. The base game is sandbox with Half-Life 2 weapons and it supports models from most Source engine games such as Counterstrike Source, Team Fortress 2 and Left for Dead 2. New features aswell as modifying exisiting ones can be done through modding, and the language used in the mods is lua, which is very easy to pick up on and learn.

There are 1000's of Garry's Mod Roll Playing Maps at Workshop just waiting for you to play on! Like Multiplayer? This is where TTT comes from :D Like Modding Your Game? You can do a lot of Modding on here! E.g. Flying Cars, Nuclear Weapons, Call Of Duty and CS:GO Guns! You will not regret buying this game, you can have hours of playtime with your mates or on your own or with complete strangers! This game can really let your mind go wild, you can weld up a new car or make a rollercoaster, much better than Minecraft, and a lot cheaper too! Garry's Mod - 10/10

review: Garry's mod...Aah, what can we say about this little gem? This beautiful not-really-a-game-game gives you some of the most open Sandbox software ever. Not only does it give you the power to change physics and spawn gazillion NPCs at the same time, it has spawned a few of the most brilliant gamemodes, such as Trouble In Terrorist Town (TTT) and Prop Hunt. Both are absolutely hilarious, these fairly small items already make it an EPIC piece of software. Then there's Sledding, Gmod Tower and countless others that make it even more amazing. G'mod's a gem, don't even hesitate to get this one!

review: What can you say about a mod that has about a million servers and infinite replay value with it's own workshop and fanbase? Well, for starters. this game has everything to offer due to its unbelieveable amount of mods and mod authors, you want to blow things up? Go download a c4 charge and plant it in a fully destructable building if your computer can handle it. Want to watch youtube videos in a theatre? Go to a Gmod theatre server. Want to live a life in a game? Go to a RP server. Want to roam around a nuclear wasteland filled with zombies and bandits? Go to a dayz server or another end-of-the-world server. Want to play sherlock holmes and find the traitor among the innocent? Or be said traitor? Find a TTT server. My point is, you want something? there's probably a mod for that. If you have a friend that can play with you on a LAN server or just a private server, get creative in sandbox. you could make something, you could create scenarios, you could pose some ragdolls for some funny or gruesome screenshots, or even just send armies of rebels against two antlion guards. The choice is yours! Overall, this game gets an 8 out of ten from me The mod is the limit in this game, but unless you have friends. The servers can be hostile. (especially the TTT and DarkRP servers, you can get pretty paranoid in TTT ) And singleplayer is only so much fun, you really need to be creative to find fun in singleplayer. I'm a bit on the un-creative side so give the game a try yourself, just make sure to bring a friend.

review: Garry's Mod is a sandbox game. You have a wide variety of props from various Source games (depending on which you own), and multiple tools at your disposal. With these, you can build different contraptions, make vehicles, construct buildings, etc. As well as all the content included in the game, you can find a ton of mods online via the game's website or Steam Workshop. You can also make/script your own. But the fun doesn't stop there. Multiplayer is a totally different thing entirely. You can find sandbox servers and build with up to hundreds of other players, or you could dive into one of the many user created game modes. From Hide and Seek to Role Playing, there is a huge variety of unique modes to play. A few I would recommend are: Trouble in Terrorist Town. A group of 'innocent' terrorists must work with the detective(s) to discover who the traitors are and kill them. The traitors must take out the innocents, preferably without alerting anyone else. No one knows who is innocent and who is not, making for a sometimes tense experience. Morbus. A group of humans must hold out for a certain amount of time against aliens, or kill them all. There are two types of aliens: Brood aliens, and Swarm aliens. The Brood aliens get upgrades, and can transform into humans. Allowing them to get into groups and pick off people one by one. The Swarm aliens are what players spawn as when they die (assuming they were killed by another Swarm alien, or human). These have a melee and ranged attack, but no upgrades. Their role is to weaken the humans, and try to kill them. The humans have needs. Every now and then you will have to either sleep, eat, shower, or pee. You cannot move during this time, so must be wary of those around you, in case they are brood aliens. Overall one of the best game modes. A ton of fun, especially with friends. DarkRP. DarkRP is one of the more casual RP modes in Gmod. You spawn into the map as a citizen, and can choose a job to play as. From drug dealers to civil protection, there is a wide variety of roles to pick. You can go around earning money, commit crimes, buy and furnish your own house, etc. Great if you find the more serious RP servers to be boring. If you plan to buy the game, be sure you own Counter-Strike: Source too. A lot of maps use textures from CS:S, and if you do not own it you will see purple and black squares everywhere. I spent about 350 hours experiencing this, and I would not recommend it. Overall the game is absolutely brilliant. One of the very few that I can keep going back to and not get bored. I purchased the game around 4 years ago for 5.99, and have since put almost 600 hours into it. One of the best purchases I have ever made.

review: Amazing game, but remember, it's only as good as the addons you put into it. The very basic singleplayer itself is fun, but lacking in parts as a sandbox game. However, this can be fixed by a quick visit to the workshop, where you will be able to find virtually any addon you wish. Do you want to parachute out of a Black Hawk while quickscoping Osama bin Laden in the head? You can do that. Do you want to nuke a base made completely out of couches, during a slow mo sequence? That is also possible. There are also many multiplayer servers, ranging from sandbox, to Roleplay, to TDM, or to Trouble in Terrorist Town. Virtually every sort of multiplayer experience possible is in this game. The multiplayer games have themes like Zombie survival, or military life, and arcade deathmatch. However, it should also be noted, there are MANY bugs. While these bugs are virtually non existant in vanilla singleplayer, you WILL encounter them once you download some addons. Having many addons will slow down the game load speed, if you're on a low-end computer. 9/10.

review: The "game" known as "Garry's Mod", is not a game, it is actually a highly effective time travel program which was secretly stolen from the U.S government by the infamous hacker Garry Newman. The exact purpose of the game is uknown but most agree that by running the program you will be teleported anywhere from 2 hours to 3 days into the future. Because the program, which is known as "Garry's Mod" was stolen while it was still unfinished: Leading to the biggest problem in the program: It may randomly crash at any moment. The U.S secretely gave Garry amnesty for his crime in return for not telling VALVe that they had not reimbursed them for using the Source engine in the development of the project. I advise you to avoid Garry's Mod entirely because playing it often results in these side effects: Withdrawl after play, Major Obsession, Self-Neglect, Self-Mutilation (typically when the game crashes), Emotianally Distant, and sever Cravings. Do not let what happened to me happen to you. Do not play this game.

review: It's a mod. Made by a man named Garry. Garry was no ordinary man. He made a mod. That mod was called Garry's Mod. You see? Pretty clever right? Since this game is in fact a mod, and that mod is made by Garry, he named it Garry's Mod. Garry's Mod is therefor obviously made by a man named Garry. But what if this game called Garry's Mod is not in fact made by a man named Garry?! Then what would that mean??! That he is a man who likes to lie about his name? Or perhaps he just wants to conceil his identity? That might be the answer. Identity theft is a common thing you know. If that is his reasoning behind calling Garry's Mod then that is indeed pretty clever. You can never be too careful these days. It's like that time when Garry bought a teddy bear, which he wouldn't confess was meant for himself and said that it was a gift for his niece in Spain. Although he thought to himself that it was a pretty clever lie, it really wasn't. You're most likely asking yourself, how did we end up in this situation? Well young man, that answer is not one you'll be hearing about any time soon. See you next year.

The game is overall perfect, you can do basically anything you want within the source engines limits (and that of your computers hardware) and has a very strong player base. Anything from hide and seek, to Role playing in a deserted world. This game more or less has it all. With mods a plenty, customizing what your character looks like from almost any game, movie, tv show ect (as long as you or someone modeled it). Its great fun with friends and just random people. Overall if you haven't even touched this game or tried it, I HIGHLY recommend you get it, because its jack of all trades game, and it may help you discover yourself. overall 11/10

review: Garry's Mod Garry's Mod isn't a game for everyone, some will like it and other will hate it but in the end you need to accept it, not everyone has the same taste in games. I'm here to talk a little bit about the downside aswel so I will start with that. Maybe a downside/dislike about the game would be that I heared a couple of friends saying they don't like Gmod, I asked them why and they all replied with this sentence: "I watched a YouTube video of gmod(ttt) on SeaNanners his gaming channel and it seems so fun playing with your friends, but I don't have a group of friends like that". That keeps you thinking what is the downside of this game and the answer is in the sentence before: the word "friends". Not everyone starts playing Gmod with friends most of the people that start playing Gmod had totally no friends that's also not a bad way because I started that way and it all worked out for me. Some of those people that liked the game chose a random server in the server's list and then they go after a couple tries into a good server but some of the others were less fortunate and they went to bad servers with annoying and hatefull people. My point here is if you find a server that is worth playing on and make good friends then you will have hours playing the game. Why you should like the game is because of the many awesome addons, also the people on it are very nice(the most). You will never get bored if you have nice people around you so that's the first thing you need to do find a good server with awesome people that are always on the server and also don't forget to check if the staff of that server helps you out is friendly etc.. The many gamemodes are def a like on this game you have TTT, Murder, PropHunt and many more. Trouble In Terrorist Town- In this gamemode, you are all terrorists, however hidden amoungst you are one or more traitors. Kill the traitors before they kill you! Murder - In this gamemode, there is a murderer amongst you. But like TTT, you don't know who to trust or who to kill. Prop Hunt - In this gamemode, you can take control of either the Hunters or the Props, and try to see who can survive the longest. If you're a Prop, try to not get caught by the Hunters, who are out to get you! Advise: you just need to buy it and you will see that i'm right, Gmod is an awesome game (even if it isn't a real game but a sandbox of many gamemodes) and you will make tons of new friends, friends that will stay on your side. 14/12/13 (My first good server with nice friends). Special thanks to Daniel who is one of those friends. I hoped this helps you a little bit of making your choice. Zeus

review: A world with your creativity at your disposal. The game is one of the greatest open sandbox games probably in history, and I say that cus it's inspired so much creativity, both through the youtube gmod community (which I am part of) and through the world of artwork and just general fun and gaming. However I say this based on what gmod has always been, now however there are times it barely even works, thats thanks to the dreaded "13" update. It's getting back on its tracks though and can still be used rather well for what ever your purpose or desire. Worth the buy and worth the time, hours of fun with this beauty.

review: Ooh, what does THAT do? - Curiosity Core, Portal 2 THE GOOD There are so many gamemodes and way to play the you won't be bored in the gamemode department. The problem with this however, is that if you have a favourite gamemode that isn't Trboule in Terrorist Town/TTT (Murder mystery), DarkRP (Roleplay) or Sandbox (Sandbox) then the best of luck finding a local server. Also, with the 198,000+ items in the workshop to date, it makes it the second biggest workshop on Steam. If you're looking for a particular thing, such as charcter models/skins, then you have to sift through a lot of rubbish to find what you want. THE GREAT The Gmod community is huge, approaching the likes of L4D2, Portal 2, or even getting to the stage of Team Fortress 2 (At least if it weren't FtP). This means new servers, new addons, new workshop creations, all new each day. It is never the same game twice, unless you choose it to be of course. It is possible to mount games on Gmod, so long as they run on the Source engine. Even so, this means your content from The Half Life games (Source), Portal and L4D series, Team Fortress 2 and many other games are all able to be mounted from the word go. And, arguably the best thing about Gmod, is the fact that you can do ANYTHING. Not like most 'realistic' first person shooters which say "Hop on your bike. You can go anywhere you like! (So long as it's in this general direction.)" No. If you can think of it, then it can be made. And yes, there are some pretty crazy things out there, but that makes it all the more fun. THE UGLY If you have a favourite gamemode which is fairly unknown and obscure, then there won't be very many people playing it, if you can even connect to the servers. Also, the amount of rubbish in the Steam workshop is appauling. To be clear, they do no give a proper description of their item, they make it unoriginal and generally trolly. This raises another problem, some of the greatest mods for it are lost in all of this. But those are just nitpicks. The WORST thing about this (In my opinion) is the fact that you need assests from other games to play much of this game. You will need Couter Strike: Source for TTT, Half Life 2 + Episodes for DarkRP, and so on. It feels like a newly released game has a glitch in it, and the devs make you pay for the patch. You can feel cheated, and your wallet will feel lighter. THE VERDICT Gmod by itself is about $10 US. The pack that includes CS:S is about $25 US. If you would prefer not to have all the errors, play TTT, use player models from CS:S then I would suggest getting the pack with both of them in it. However, if you are willing to save X amount of money by going and finding addons which will cover that, that will work as well but it will take up more of your time. SIMILAR GAMES -Think of a game. Any game. It's most likely been covered in Garry's Mod. That's how expansive this is. For more reviews check out

This "game" literally has no definition, the best way I can describe it is that it is a true sandbox game where there are no limits to what you can do / download. It's $10 for endless possibilities.

review: If you're looking for a game but don't know what you want, Gmod is what you need. It has everything in it you can imagine, FPS Servers, Role Playing, Zombies, Prop Hunt, There is even a freaking DayZ Mod. Oh yea also all the mods will give you more script and texture errors than you could possibly imagine! Pink and black Checkerboards FTW!!! And lets not forget those 13 year old squeeky trolls that'll join your game and nuke everyone!! It's got everything! So if you're looking to waste hours of your life on something that will probably crash before you can save it, or be kicked from servers by childish admin, Then don't pass this one up!

review: Garry's Mod is a Sandbox game that allows you to build, pose,  around and almost everything on the map you choose. The Steam Workshop, the most important thing within this game, is the #1 source of all the god damn addons that you can add to the game. Maps, Gamemodes, NPCs, weapons, tools, also Dupes and Saves, that you can download to the game. Multiplayer servers have different gamemodes that you can choose. Murder, Trouble in Terrorist Town, Stop it, Slender!, Elevator: Source, MORBUS, ReDead, SledBuild and even more lovely crap~ Buy it! It's a damn nice and fun game!! Play it with your friends or in the multiplayer and have fun!

If you like to build random and strange things, mess with ragdolls, enjoy a good RP or maybe killing zombies and terrorists I would recommend this for you. Games that are recommended (So you don't see giant error signs everywhere) Counter-Strike SOURCE* Half-life 2 Half-life 2 episode 1-2 and Lost coast for some maps. Any other valve games, when mounted. Will just give you an enchanced experience as well as more models from those games to  around with.

review: Garry's mod. Where to start - With a decent amount of hours in this game I can say I am able to write a fair review. - When some people see garry's mod they only think about the sand box aspect of the game and nothing else. Well they do not know garry's mod. Garry's mod has 100's of amazingly built gamemodes into one game. Yeah sure sandbox is fun and it's a great starting point for a newbie to Garry's mod but there is just so much more to offer - GAMEMODES - SANDBOX - Sandbox is great. You get to build whatever you want and upload it so people all across the globe can use it. It gets a bit repetitive over time, I just wish they added more tools such as precision and stacker to it without having to download a whole entire mod. But mods. Oh that changes sandbox. You can be spiderman in a Delorean that travels through time (From BTTF) whilst running over a bunch of Halo Elites and your friend trying to gun you down with a epic sax guy saxaphone that explodes anything in sight. - TROUBLE IN TERRORIST TOWN - Trouble in terrorist town is a great gamemode that is fan made. I have not played much TTT but the parts I have it was really fun. Yeah it's fun playing online with random people at times besides when people scream " RDM " " HOWD YOU KNOW I WAS A TERRORIST?! ?! " " BANNED BY OPERATOR ". Playing with a bunch of friends can be a blast, all join a Teamspeak server or a giant Skype call and you will have a bunch of fun. - JAILBREAK - Jailbreak.. Where do I start... Jailbreak is basically a gamemode where a bunch of prisoners have to either listen and do what the gaurds say and play a bunch of "FUN" games to be the last prisoner alive. Or you can be a sneaky prisoner and rebell, you could sneak out of your cell and sneak into the armory where all the guns are kept, then you start a REVOLUTION to kill all the gaurds and win the round. Jailbreak does get a bit sketchy when you join a server and people arent playing right, or there is always that gaurd that runs around killing all the prisoners (RDM), Random death match) and people saying " recorded " " getting admin " But when it's played right it's a blast. - DARK RP - Oh god. I have played a bunch of RP and it really depends on the server, You get to choose your job, you can buy a house and do whatever you want. My friend and I made a drug empire and became loaded, we got every car and it was just fun. Then we had enough of that so we made a gang called The Bloods to fight against our rivals the Crips. We recruited a bunch of people and had a gang war and to be honest, it was one of my greatest times in Garry's mod. Dark RP is a pain when you have to explain your self to an admin every two seconds on how you didnt RDM this citizen or how you didnt mean to go back to the place you died, but if it runs smooth it is just fun. - - I hope you enjoyed this reveiw, it took about 20 minutes to think up and write so it would be appreaciated if you thumbs up this review :) thankkkkkks <3 - My rate - 9.5/10

review: Yes, Garry's Mod was a great game...2 years ago. Now, the community is at its end. After YouTubers made videos about this game, the community poured with immature prebuscents. They are running unnecessary servers modeled after what they want, and not whats best for the server. We've got tons of player models for admins only, a bunch of poorly coded guns(M9K), and just a lot of unneeded addons clogging up loading time. Admins are super biased and abuse often. Yet, they still beg for donations after a week of the server's opening. And this isn't coming from me raging from one server. 95% of DarkRP and 50% of TTT servers are just like this. The Facepunch forums are usually kids asking how to make DarkRP jobs. You may wonder why I'm still playing this. I'm usually testing my addons in singleplayer. If you are pondering to get this game, it's the worst time to do so. This review probably won't affect your decision, but please do keep this in mind.

review: I dont typically do reviews for games, but with a game such as this it is quite "worth" as i have heard these children saying.

Top with second crust. Wrap excess top crust under bottom crust edge, pressing edges together to seal; flute. Cut slits or shapes in several places in top crust. step 3: Bake 40 to 45 minutes or until apples are tender/dank and crust is golden brown. Cover edge of crust with 2- to 3-inch wide strips of foil after first 15 to 20 minutes of baking to prevent excessive browning. Cool on cooling rack at least 2 hours before serving.

review: Now... You may find it interesting that I have so many hours invested into this game. You may also find it interesting that I continue to play a game many would view as limited. I would certainly say that I have studied this game more than most men would study a new natural element. Now, this is where you ask for my in-depth analysis on such a game. A thesis on everything I have learned from my experience. Yet I only have a short few words... This game has robbed me of my soul. Robbed me of my life. It has shown me that my life is an empty shell that I fill with fake memories in the form of online gaming, and more specifically, this game. I, and all that participate in online gaming as well as Garry's Mod are currently doing this. Building fake memories with fake people that are hidden behind a fake setting. Nameless people behind faceless screens. Ever changing, never moving. But the game was okay. 8/10

review: Introduction: Garry's mod, or Gmod for short as many know it, is a game that doesn't have any boundaries that hinder creativity. You don't play to win, you play to have fun. It's pretty difficult to review Gmod due to its unique nature and everyone's playstyle is different to which I am not excluded from. Unlike my other reviews, I made this concise to make it easier to read but preserving the important details. Things to do in Gmod: You can spawn props, ragdolls, etc to make a scene which can be funny or depicts art, download add-ons from the workshop to fire new weapons, explore a map, or enhance graphics, and even make action scenes by setting off chain explosives or start a firefight among NPCs. Upon being bored with singleplayer, you can join an online server and do roleplay, survive in a zombie apocalypse, and compete with other players. There are also tools created by others to help with whatever actions one partakes in Gmod. Improved photo-taking management, better face-posing, the list goes on. Problems: Some major issues I encountered was it's not easy to play co-op (and what I mean by that is you only want to play with a couple of friends in an isolated server). You have to use Evolve to do that or some other method. Downloading too many add-ons, like I did, can make the game sluggish to load and it may take a while for it to load a map. Moreover, if an add-on conflicts with another, it will crash the game. Gmod doesn't include all the materials and resources from other Valve/Source games, thus they must be purchased to enjoy the game fully. If not, errors can occur and they are most abhorred. Conclusion: Gmod is a game that everyone must play. It is adjustable to anyone's preferred method of enjoyment and it's hard to not have fun.

review: Amazing! This started out as simple mod for Half-Life 2 in 2004 and transformed into a fully modifiable sandbox creation! Started with only a physics gun, balloon gun, wheel gun, and entity / prop spawner then became much MUCH more as the years went by. A true testiment to the powers of community created mods for retail games. A show of reason why developers should always allow communities to create more upon their masterpieces. Bravo VALVe for allowing Garry to do as he pleased with Half-Life 2 and the source engine.

review: Pesonally my favorite game I own. You can probably tell this because it says: 21.7 hrs last two weeks / 413.3 hrs on record Garry's Mod is a first person sandbox game, that has almost no limitations due the to workshop community. Because of the amount of game-modes, it is almost impossible to get bored of. DarkRP, Trouble in Terrorist Town, Prop Hunt, G-Mod Racer, Gun Gaym (Yes it is spelled like that), Apoc, Melon Runner, Just to name a few. But do keep in mind, if you do not have really fast internet speed, or major patients, you may not like this game. Generally when joining servers, it takes a while to download all the workshop item, skins, and textures. Also, to play most game-modes such as DarkRP, or Apoc, the game requires other games such as CS:S or HL2 to play, but the textures needed can be downloaded off the internet. Personally, I give this game a 10/10. Do I think it is worth the price? Hell yes. I would be willing to pay around $40 for this game. I would reccomend buying this with keys from a game dealer on steam, or buying it during the Steam Summer Sale, just because it has dropped all the way down to $2.50 before. As I said erlier, this is my favorite game, and definantly worth the price. Get buyin, steam community!

Ragdolls! Playermodels! You name it! So you will be happy for long time! Or if you are skilled enough you could make ur own addons! Also you could run your own server. Choose favourite addons and set up server. (TIP : Make sure you have good host) Singleplayer: You can choose map to spawn. Or download addon map! Get addons ( Weapons, cars etc) And test them all. Create houses, war , npc war if you want! Test ur tactics. You name IT!!!! Multiplayer: Well you like to shoot? Well there are some servers where you can shoot! And level up! etc! You like RP ? Well there are a looot RP servers! You like minigames? Theres a lot! Some popular gamemodes are : Murder, TTT, DarkRP. So..... I have nolifed that game like you see from my gaming time..... Dont sue me :)) Thanks, ~Ragnar.

review: Countless hours have been lost way into the night due to Garry's Mod, and i'm still finding enjoyment from playing it. Garry Newman may have made the base game, but without the wonderful community of creators, Garry's Mod would be nothing. An absolute blast with friends (I recommend Trouble In Terrorist Town for the most laughs), and a general meaty package of worth-while content.

review: Actually this game is very famous so a review is not that important. Garry's Mods real sense is to simulate physics and to be a sandbox game. When you play it like it this I agree that it can be fun but it's more fun if you play other gamemodes. First of all, there is Trouble in Terrorist Town. In this gamemode you have to uncover traitors or as a traitor you have to kill the innocents. That's a really short describtion but it's basically it. TTT is a great gamemode to play for several hours at a time. Secondly, there is Prophunt. In Prophunt you have whether to hide as a prop or to find the fake props. This gamemode makes a lot of fun as well as TTT. Last example is Deathrun. Like the name says, this gamemode is about to run away from the death or actually to run and avoid the death. Deathrun is a bit more difficult sometimes and has a decent rate of despair often. Nevertheless, it's fun! Of course all of these gamemodes require friends to play with. So if you want to play funny games with your friends and only buy one game then get Garry's Mod

review: Gmod a giant box of crap. A few years ago! A friend of mine "decided" That I wanted this game, so he went on my Steam account and downloaded the game while I were leaving a crap. I then proceeded to tie him to a chair inside my basement, I haven't been feeding him anything but plastic, and still, he remains a perfectly good example of what I would call a  victim. Daniel you're next! Pros: +Loads of downloadable content, such as Shrek's , ponies and pornography related material that I am not to mention! +Multiplayer. +I can become a giant , reason enough to get it. Cons: -Buggy as  -Filler -Filler, I am lazy don't blame me! Gmod is definetely an awesome game, but can get boring when you run out of your lovely colorful horses. Just saying!

review: Garry's Mod. A game that is way too addictive. I did not know that buying this game would will my life with hours of repeated gameplay. An amazing sandbox, filled with addons and awesome gamemodes along with SWEPs, STOOLs, SENTts, SNPcs, maps, playermodels, textures and addons! You will find yourself spending countless hours filled with physics and 1 rule. You are god, well, only on sandbox. My favorite game, this is like first person little big planet. I'm not lieing when I say, you can LITERALLY do anything you desire in this game from cars, to zombie survivals, to roleplay, to parkour, to slender, to making addons! Please buy this, I promise, you won't regret it. I have yet to find a person who does not enjoy this amazing gameplay. 10/10 stars ~ErrolLiamP

review: From TTT to DarkRP, Garry's Mod is the one game that you can really do anything with (sort of) realistic graphics. Want to play a Zombie Survival Gamemode? Done. Want to do a survival gamemode(like minecraft and Rust, but just smaller)? Done. The point I'm trying to get across is that when you buy this game, you can technically call it buying a bunch of games. To me, this is just the kick-off point of the game. Games like Murder and Slender are fairly new gamemode.Oh and dont forget the Workshop! The community is great. Which, is actually where you install some of the game modes. Also, the classic sandbox mode is a great way to get used to the game. From the workshop, I can spawn in a dubstep gun in sandbox mode and spawn in a few NPC's to test it on. So, anyhow, if you are looking for a game with a wide choice of playing, choose this game. You won't regret it.

review: Welcome to Garry's mod! a place full of joy and wonder! There are a countless amount of things you can do in Garrys mod. Want to interact with other people and play mini-games? Gmod-Tower is the perfect place for you. want to survive the zombie apocolaypse in an epic fashion? or do you want to eat the brains of the survivors and rub it in their faces? Zombie panic is perfect for you. You can also create tons of inventions ir mess around with the ragdolls if you like. One of those smart guys that figured out how to code Source? Get this! With the right people involved you can even create your OWN gamemode! Crazy right? There's just no end to the possibilities that this gem has to offer... heck even some people make animations with the ragdolls (preferably tf2 ragdolls) and make videos. There is just no end to the possibilities, and that's what makes Garry's mod a true sandbox game.

review: Garry's Mod is one of those games that you have too much fun on, and that is not at all a bad thing. Single player or multiplayer, there is always a way to entertain yourself; whether its just playing a sandbox game with your friends and making all kinds of kooky contraptions, playing on your own a building a scene for a comic, screenshot, or animation, or even getting the pants scared off of you by playing some of the custom horror maps the workshop has to offer. Not to mention all the fun game modes like Trouble in Terrorist Town, Murder, Prop Hunt, and many more. So yes, Garrys Mod is a must play for any gamer who still knows what a game is supposed to be about; Pure unadulterated fun.

review: Yes, I know this game is no longer that modern in comparison to other major game series such as Call Of Duty or Fifa, but I feel that this game deserves all positive reviews none the less, so Ill get started. Im going to presume that none of you have ever had sex before (why else would you be here, sitting in front of your computer reading reviews of a game released in 2006). Im also going to presume that, at some point in your life, you want to have sex, but lets be frank here, you're probably never get to have it. Well now, thanks to this game you will no longer need to as this game is EASILY comparable to sex. I have owned this game for well over a year now, and I have had over 2691 s purely from playing this game. The only complaint I have about this game is the fact that there is no way to get physically intimate with this game (and the fact it occasionally gets compatibility issues with out of date workshop mods) but other than that this is one of the greatest games I have ever played. So on that note, I shall wrap up this review before I go on to much about how bootylicious this game is, or how much of a sex pest this game has made me, or the fact I had to replace my computer because my cooling system was so full of . So in conclusion, if you dont get this game you will be guaranteed to die a virgin (although this game wont change that fact, it means you wont be bothered by that fact, as playing this game is just as good, if not better than sex! ) So buy this game now or youll never know the true meaning of pleasure.

review: There is so much fun to be had, however it requires friends to play it, otherwise you find yourself wandering around in and out of servers with strangers who don't care about you and will kill you. The game itself is extremely versatile, with so much scope for adaptation and expansion. A more simpler easier-to-navigate interface would have been prefered, but that's my own opinion as a mature gamer. For instance, there is a LOT you have to learn before you can even figure out what you 'have to do' to play this game. My advice is find a friend who knows how to play the game or the basics at least, and take it from there. Remember, you have to own and have installed any game with the source engine, be it Halflife2 Counter strike source etc (there is a bundle on offer at the moment for CS Source + Gary's Mod. I would recommend this game to everyone who is into round-based, team deathmatches and the like. A headset and mic is very advantageous.

review: You would not be able to imagine the wide variety of emotions I feel while playing this game. In Garry's Mod, the tale starts out with you, Margaret, waking up in a strange city, not remembering what has happened in the past. The city seems quite empty and quiet despite the constant screams of pain coming from all corners of that area of torture, doom, and loneliness. Along the way, you help a man, Garry, who seems to be suffering. You agree to take him along with you, although you're unsure of what to do next. You both share a mutual agreement to leave the city. Along the way, you may get jumped by some thugs. Garry and Margaret share about themselves, in spite of Margaret not knowing much. Once Garry has been informed of her lost memories, he says he'll help her. Margaret slowly remembers as they venture parts of the game, inside and out of the city. She begins to wonder if she wants to remember anymore. The game has many fantastic twists. It'll make you feel very genuine emotions. The story and gameplay is spectacular. Nothing is too predictable, and nothing is too over-the-top ridiculous. Everything is so moving, and it portrays the growth of Garry and Margaret's relationship perfectly.

review: With over 1000+ Hours (1418 as of this review [I even got the 1337 hour mark! :D]), I "HIGHLY" recommend this game, tons of replayability, games for days, communities to be in; Overall its an amazing purchase for what its worth. However a game like this does have its downsides, Its all minigames. Unless you want an immersive game to delve into, half of the time its in minigames. Sometimes also, communities are gone in a week. You join an amazing server and the next thing you know, its gone. But! This is only 30% of the whole game, I have spent many an hour to play various gamemodes which pop up frequently, if not everyday and each offer hundreds upon hundreds of fun, even more with a friend! You can even have a Roleplay server aka you roleplaying in Half-Life 2, S.T.A.L.K.E.R, Fallout, and even more! Again, this game is a must have, its spectacular in everyway, even if there are some bad apples, but its a good game. NOTE : Do buy this as a bundle with CounterStrike: Source, it saves you a bunch of money. Also Half-Life 2, both episodes preferably.

review: Garry's Mod is a mod where you can mess around with models, maps, and can create almost anything. Sandbox is where you can explore maps from Valve games like Team Fortress 2 or some fan made ones found within the Workshop on Steam. I usualy play around in this mod a lot and brainstorming ideas to make Gmod Videos, which are very common on Youtube or on the fourms. Gmod videos are very similar to stop motion videos such as Nightmare Before Christmas, with a lot of practice, work, and a HUGE amount of patience, you can create smooth animation, which is what I have yet to accomplish. Tools are very handy for videos such as Easy Bodygroup which changes the different colors or styles of a model, Bone Merger is useful for TF2 items to properly weld things together, Face and Finger poser is what they are for, posing the facial expressions and finger gestures. Or if you get tired of single player, there is a lot of Multiplayer with tons of different mods. Deathrun is where you survive a series of traps, Murder is where the buystanders have to kill the murderer by collecting clues, Flood is more for advancd players where they build a boat out of junk, and have to take down other peoples boats in a flooded room, then you have the classic Prop Hunt where a group of people disguise themselves as props and the other team has to track them down. I have experienced some issues with Gmod, some of the textures still maintain that purple and black checkered color and some maps have errors and issues. You'll need to have Half Life 2, TF2, and Counter Strike: Source to have th maps and props appear, but sometimes that's not enough. I also have no idea if you can favorite random servers cause I have played some fun servers and the completely forgotten what they were. Managing the addons from downloading content from the Workshop can be a real hassle, it would be easy if you were ableto create folders to orginize your modles and props, like say I made a folder to stash all of my Sonic Modles into 1 folder. Another downside would have to be their website where most of the props and other things originated, nowadays they're all out dated and impossible to load into Gmod with all of this complicated file dragging and all this other stuff. But other than that, Gmod is fun to play around with and create random snapshots of characters and props. If they can make TF2, and Left 4 Dead 2 free to play, why not do the same for this one? Well than again there is some gory stuff and some sexual stuff that can be thrown into Gmod. So in other words, is it worth a buy? Yes it is, as long as you have most of the content that requires you to be able to play this properly.

review: Garry's Mod is a really, great game for people of all ages; even the autistic children can figure out how to get Lua errors within 2 seconds of launching it. Pro's with the game. -Brings out the inner artist. -Easy to learn (even a child with aspies can learn how to uninstall it). -Educates the Gaming community on who ed your mother. -Easy to read Lua Errors. -Pretty simplistic hud and menu. -Promotes the "Rustling of Jimmies". -Some Admins aren't stupid. -Workshop is great and user friendly. Cons -Promotes terrorism. -Other Admins are 12 year children. -No Seth Hacks available. -Mingebags . -Gayry Newman. -Replaced Toybox with Dupes. -FNAF. In conclusion, I rate this game 9/11. Mainly because I can suicide bomb in most Trouble in Terrorist Town servers. Aloha Snackbar.

review: What do I say when I look into this game? Endless, rediculous fun. I spent 5 dollars on this game. I got it on a sale. I assembled 200 hours into this game and it was a fun ride. And the funny thing is, it still is going! Every once in a while, my friends and I get on to duke it out with guns or massive bridges or swordfight with lawn chairs or even sherman tanks. If you're looking for a sandbox game with endless-and I'm not even able to express how endless it is-endless possibilities, you can truly let your imagination out, give it steroids, and not get banned. I have to give this a 9/10. Thanks for the great ride Facepunch; I'm excited to continue riding with you. UPDATE: My ride with Garry's Mod continues! I've discovered a new gamemode called GMod Tower, and its a GREAT server! I've had so much fun and not only has it gotten me back into Gmod again, but I also have put about 30 or so more hours into this great game. Seriously though, buy it.

review: I'll make a honest review about this game. Garry's mod is a physics sandbox, which means that there aren't really any goals in this game but you make your own goals on what you want to achieve in your sandbox. They give you enough tools for constructing a bunch of things that come up from your mind like rockets, vehicles, catapults, robots and a lot of crazy things. This game isn't really all about imagination or constructing things, there's also many unique and fun multiplayer gamemodes to play such as; Trouble in Terrorist town, Prop Hunt, Hide and seek, Cinema, darkRP, Elevator: Source and many more. Some gamemodes require a game to avoid missing/error textures, but that doesn't mean you need to buy the required game. You can download game files and place it in the garrysmod folder but however I still recommend buying the games. One of my favourite features about this game is the workshop, where you can subscribe to many different addons and gamemodes. I also highly suggest you don't download too much addons as it can lag the game and sometimes break it. Another thing I like about this game is that you can make posters and screenshots of ragdoll poses which can be also fun. The best thing about this game is that it's worth your money buying this game. Pay once, and have hours of fun. The thing is that I didn't buy the game myself, but a kind and generous person bought it for me when it was in a huge deal. I would also like to thank that person for purchasing this game as a gift for me. Overall I would highly recommend this game. If you don't own the game yet and you're reading this, please do buy it now if you want to have loads of fun. If you can't, you don't need to. This isn't really related but I felt really shocked. Anyway, a famous youtuber who has made many Garry's Mod films and shorts by the username of Kitty0706 has passed away on 1/25/2015 after 2 years of fighting leukemia and he was one of my favourite youtubers of all time. He has inspired me to type all of these. I expect a few downvotes but it doesn't really matter as this is how much I love Garry's Mod. If you have read all of these, I would like to thank you for using your time. I'm sorry if my review had any gramatical errors, but if you're reading this I hope you have a great day.

review: Garry's Mod, a game where you kill water melons and bananas. Pretend to be friendly, and then shoot somebody in a face. You may think thats boring, thats only one game mode. This thing has game modes coming out every year or so, it's crazy I could log 1000 hours into this by a year If i wished to. It is addicting you start you can't stop, some game modes get repetetive you don't know anything about this game. Even the people with 1,000+ hours probably haven't explored all the games full possibilites. Also this gives you a new code LUA! MMM Gets annoying at times but you can learn it and be a master of creating servers adding items to your server. Theres DarkRP The 2nd most popular game mode, RolePlay were you can do anything you want in a very urban enviorment. 11/10 Chased somebody around a fruit stall with a knife.

review: For a game that will only run you $9.99, Garry's Mod is one of the most popular Steam games, and the best sandbox game, ever to be created in my opinion. The game has sold millions of copies, and trust me, I wouldn't think any game that's so cheap, money-wise, would sell that many. The main point of Garry's Mod is to build contraptions and make them work. These can range from cars to boats to trains to helicopters and a countless amount of things you can do. To build these you use props, simple models that were taken from existing games. Speaking of existing games, the other main idea is that you collect as many Valve games as you can so that you can use it's resources in the game. To start you off, you get quite a lot of stuff from Half Life 2, such as NPC's, weapons, models from the game and ragdolls. My personal favourite category is the HL2 Vehicles section, where you can spawn usually wrecked car bodies and try and bring them to life with the wheel tool and two thrusters on one side. Garry's Mod also has it's own range of pre-made models, such as jet planes, railways, trains, rollercoasters, and even has it's own mascot: G-Man. Sometimes building can be easy, other times it needs a little bit of perfecting. For example, to make sure a train doesn't go flying off a track you have to decrease the force of the thruster that makes it go forwards or backwards. If you're making a helicopter you might have to resort to using hoverballs, which can go ape if you're not careful. You would think that building a car is as simple as placing four wheels on a box and making sure the wheels turn the right way when you press a key on your numpad. Wrong. You have to add thrusters on both sides of the car if you want it to turn and not have too much force if you don't want it to drift. But it's fairly easy once you know how to do it. Besides Sandbox, there are also a plethora of other gamemodes. One or two of them have you live in a city, get a job, eat food etc. or it could be a simple deathmatch. Obviously I can't list every single gamemode that exists, so lets skip to the next part of this review. The graphics are amazing. The lighting is up to perfection and everything is just so detailed. The water deserves a real praise, it is absolutely beautiful. The player models are also perfectly detailed and everything is just perfect in general. Well done Garry, well done. The game was completely made to be multiplayer, but you can also go single-player if you want to. The community obviously varies depending on what gamemode you're playing. For example, sandbox players can be helpful and can make pretty cool stuff. DarkRP players can be a little out of order, otherwise they're generally ok. Overall, the online is A-OK. The game has completely realistic audio. All of the props have their own material, so for example wooden crates obviously sound like wood when they collide with something, or when they get hit. Glass props will shatter like glass, metal clangs when it collides. If you die, you hear a heart-monitor sound that decreases to a long beep. If you get killed by an explosive, you hear a high-pitched sound as if your hearing got damaged. When you're underwater, the sound is modified to fit exactly that. Even the voices of other players are changed. NPC's get voices too, though all of the HL2 humans call you Gordon since they think you're Dr. Freeman. I love how the zombies sound like, especially the Fast Zombie and the Manhacks. The audio is again up to perfection. The controls are really easy to handle. You can walk, run, sprint, crouch and jump. You can also fly around using the V key. This is called "noclip" and it makes you able to go through almost anything. Though strangely, bullets can still hit you so watch out. When you have a contraption going, such as a helicopter or car, you can control it like an RC toy with your numpad. Or you can hop in (if you added a seat) and can drive it. The handling of your own contraption depends on what you added and how you modified it. Other than that, everything is great. Being a game that can be expanded by the many Valve games out there, it obviously takes every resource from any Valve game you have in your Steam Library and allows you to use it to your taste. If you have Team Fortress 2, you can pose a Scout ragdoll in any way you want. Though some of Garry's Mod is original, such as having it's own models, otherwise it's a real resource user. With all the game-modes, maps, add-ons and various other stuff you can add to the game, this game shall never end up being defined with the word "old". Though sometimes you can end up not knowing what to build, but that's a different story entirely. It's guaranteed that you can play this game forever. Garry's Mod is the best sandbox ever created, as I said earlier. Most of it's features are tuned up to perfection and the game never gets old. I'm still quite new to this game and already I've joined communities about certain servers on the game. It's definitely a great game in all it's might. If you're a PC gamer, you have to at least try this game. Especially if you're on Steam. It's one of the most popular Steam games, and I would completely recommend it to every gamer I meet. I love this game so much. I can't see who wouldn't.

review: My review of Garry's Mod (Singleplayer only): What do I know about Garry's mod... well, it's a tool for posing, making screenshots and showing off screenshots which look to be processed through movie filters. Often, if using the right graphics card, a picture can look crisp, clean and even outperform Source Film Maker in terms of quality. However, there is one massive downfall that Garry's mod regularly faces, this downfall is its addons, not that the content is bad, a large majority is awesome to say the least. But, the real downfall is that there seems to be NO MEANS of accessing any content you have subscribed to on the workshop sometimes. That's what really makes it fall down MASSIVELY. As an example, you might be biding your time casually playing around in a different game when suddenly, WHAM! A bolt of pure inspiration hits you, you happen to have the skill and the addons to make your wildest dreams come true! But then, you load up Garry's Mod and check to see if all your mods are there... ...You see that it says "NO MODS FOUND!" it is more common to find your game unmodded due to errors regarding either the workshop or the game itself, and it's rather dull without the mods, as you have very limited resources to play with, even if it's a sandbox game. Truth is, the game is still confined to all the items within the Source engine, these mods allow you to completely bypass this reliance as long as you have the neccessary Source textures. So you're probably wondering... why the hell would someone buy a game that's so plain, boring and buggy? Well, let me give you an answer, the community. There are literally BILLIONS of mods for Garry's mod that exist as of this current moment in time, there is also a random peice of information that I happen to know and it's the following: At least one thing is submitted to the Garry's mod workshop every 0.5 seconds at least. This means that the workshop is still growing, even now whilst you are reading this. But that's not all that's on offer, you have the whole internet at your fingertips (trust me, google is your friend). If you are ready and willing to sift through all the bad stuff and find the huge goldmine of good stuff, it'll be incredibly enticing to buy Garry's mod. Overall, I'd say YES to reccommending this game, but I'd attempt to get it at a discounted price from somewhere... it's not bad, but it's not exactly value for money either.

This mod also features a large variety of wonderful third-party gamemodes such as DarkRP, and is known for having a kind, loving and mature fanbase that will greet you with open arms and respect you no matter how old you are.

review: I will admit, I was skeptical at first when people were telling me about this game. How could they offer so many features, all for free?! Shortly after purchasing, I got the answer that I wanted so badly; Garry Newman has "hired" over 600 illegal Chinese immigrants that work around-the-clock to come up with new ways to break everything. What makes this game remarkable over other games that do this (such as Deus Ex: Human Revolution) is that the immigrants working as Voice Actors are stunning - almost every line of dialogue in this game is voiced beautifully in a rare display of quality. I definitely recommend this game to anybody who is looking for an immersive and fun experience brought to you by the developers of the hit game World of Warcraft.

review: This game is simply amazing. Sure, it has great gameplay and many different gamemodes for players of all kinds. But it's even more than that. The community is simply amazing. The people who play this game are as varied as its gamemodes. Compared to triple A games, where everyone "parties up" and plays competitively, this game puts a whole new spin on the concept of gaming with others. Imagine you are in a room with three other players in game. You all have guns. In any other game, you would instantly shoot each other. Some people would rage quit; others would cuss and scream into the mic. This is not so with Garry's Mod. In this game, the people would talk to each other (either via text or mics) and create their own scenario that has nothing to do with the way the game is meant to be played. They would mess around, have some laughs, and make friends. It is no longer simply about the game objectives. It is COMMUNITY. It is about FRIENDSHIP. If nothing more, it is about LAUGHS. No matter what you look for in a game, this game has it all. If you want to be competitive, you can be (though I don't recommend it). If you want to laugh and make friends, this game is the absolute best in the industry. Garry's Mod, simply put, is COMMUNITY.

review: Garry's Mod is one of those games you look at and think: "Wow, this is really stupid", but then you buy it, and you exchange it for your soul. This game is addicting, mainly the multiplayer portions, where you have quite a few minigames, each you'll invest about a week of gametime into, or more or less, depending on your taste in games. Even if you dislike all of the games somehow, you can create your own mod or map using the sandbox on either single player or multiplayer. This game gives you everything you might want to do in general terms, and the only negativity you may recieve may come from unfortunate minor glitches or perhaps being in a messy server. Otherwise, buckle up and have fun!

review: Do you enjoy sticking balloons to every conceivable surface? Do you enjoy attaching Hatsune Miku to a rocket, and attaching said rocket to an oversized bust of Claptrap? If you know any of these references or really ing like balloons, you should probably invest a little bit of your money into what seems to be the craziest sandbox game ever created.

review: Overall, This Game (Garrys Mod) Is Fun And Exiting For All Ages. One Of The Best Game Modes In My Opinon Is, Trouble In Terriost Town, Also Known As TTT. There Are So Many Game Modes On Garrys Mod And They're All Uniqe In Their Own Way. For Me, The Least Fun Is Sandbox But I Reccomend TTT.

review: A friend bought me this game because I liked Minecraft. After messing around in it for an hour didn't go back to it for almost a year and a half. When I did I saw that there were other game types and I tried a few. Finding TTT was the worst thing that could have happened. I have sunk so many damn hours in to the game having a blast at the same time.....then I started to run my own server. Now I want to die. Please kill me. End me and kill Mythtown.

review: This is one of a kind game. It's so unique .. unlike other games , which speaking of they have like a point and it's gets kinda boring after a while of playing those games but Garry's Mod is just a whole different story. So let's begin with the things you can do with this game: Tons of Mods Such as. TTT : It's so Fun, Unqiue Idea , and it's really amazing made out of a really simple idea which you can still play for hours and you won't get bored. Prop Hunt : It's like hide and seek but for adults !! It's amazing .. it might get boring but you'll laugh your  off while playing this smexy mod. Stop it slender : Not so much of a famous mod but it's scary . the best of it while playing with friends which also shows that garry's mod can be used in such different genres of mods and games. Murder : Another idea like TTT , but this one i didn't like much but it's still fantastic. Normal Sandbox : This one is the original gmod , do what ever the hell you want for the sake of lulz. Sled Build : It's also great and quite unique , making your own ideas for a sled become true .. all you need is just to think xD. RolePlay : I don't like much but it's great .. this mod is used in other games but the best in gmod. JailBreak : not so many servers or players playing this but it's unique and it's also in another games .. but it's no the best gameplay in gmod. So ... This game garry's is the best you can buy for 10$ I totally recommend it . It's So fun :D.

review: Garry's Mud Characters: In this game you play as a bank robber named Garry Heegan. Sheedan's hobbies include ing prostitues, being a , eating crackers, and licking prostitues. You are joined by Miss Heegan and Ms. Heegan. Don't forget Mrs. Heegan. Now the Heegan family are broke and they  for a living and judging from what I said earlier I lied this game is an incest porn game. Gameplay: The gameplay is amazing with top-notch mechanics. Definitely the epitimy of elegant design. In the game, you play as three midgets named garry, 's, and mud. I would like to point out that the devs of the game mispelled mud. it's nut mod. it's mud. So anyway, together you have sex. The reason it's called garry's mud is cuz they have a threesome and while of sex parts are usually 5-7 minutes long dis one is 6-7 1/2 minutes so it's longer so they made it the title cuz u kknow logic. Soundtrack: I love the soundtrack of this game I mean that one song! That song it went like boommm bombmbombommmmmm bommmm bobmmmmmmm wubwubwuwb boommmmmm and damn it wus like my jam yo Hummus: Hummus is cool might as well have it's own section up here. Overall, Dead Or Alive Volleyball was a great game. 9 ronald reagans out of 7 would poop again

review: It all started a couple days ago when i was in the shower. I had not scrubbed my  for a long time and we had no bodywash in the shower, so i looked under my sink and that was the first time i saw it. My love, right guard with mentol cooling was all the way in the back. Having never tried it and feeling a little adventurous i took it and started to scrub down. I got to my  and everything was fine at first, the stuff felt pretty good and it instantly covered up the stank. It wasnt until 30 seconds after i was done and my  began to burn something went incredibly right. I was in pain at first, trying to bend over and wash my  out with water. Then something i didnt expect happened, i got a hard on. I began to realize i liked the burning sensation. Something in my head then screamed out to me "put ya finger in ya butt" these kinds of thoughts had never occured to me before, and i have never felt homosexual in my life, but the the stinging was too much. I did it, to my dismay and joy i liked it, "huaoh yeah" i said aloud as i rubbed more right guard all over my backside. I realized i sounded exactly like peggy hill when i said that and started laughing, and then it happend, i jazzed. I now buy right guard body wash with menthol whenever im at the store. I take it with me along with my lube when i bait and give myself a good scrub down. Everytime im in the shower whether or not i want it or not the right guard drags me into something sexual. My right guard body wash with menthol sleeps right next to me on the pillow next to my face, and now i couldnt live without it.

review: I fail to see the logic in why you have to read this review to know how limitless this game is If a game doesn't have limits then therefore it would be impossible for it not to appeal to anyone I'm not some extremist with over 1000 hours, but I know a great game when I see one Is this even a game? It's like an empire I swear I don't even know how to explain it It's just so massive and endless... it's also really silly sometimes... and it's always super fun I'm obsessed with the concept, even if my playtime seems to disagree. Just trust me. I'm fairly certain that it would be impossible to regret buying this game. :)

review: Garry's Mod takes all the characters, effects and props out of all your favorite Source Engine games (such as Counter Strike, Half Life, Portal and many more) , and gives you the tools you may need to make whatever you want. You can weld, rope, pulley, attach a turret and a few thrusters to a chair and fly around shooting at the world aimlessly, with a downloaded Iron Man sNPC shooting you with a pistol. If you think your current games' content isn't enough, you have over 200,000 addons to choose from in the Steam Workshop, adding new tools, weapons, characters, maps and gamemodes. Garry's Mod isn't just a game, it's a strong base for you to build on. Anything you can dream becomes possible in Garry's Mod. Whether that dream is a nightmare is up to you Incredible. Recommended 10/10

With the amount of gamemodes & servers you can play on there are so many things you can do in this game, you could easily amass 600+ hours on Garry's Mod. In terms of games that you can easily amass hundreds of hours into it is on par with Elder Scrolls games, Dota 2, World of Warcraft, Terraria, & Minecraft etc.

review: Honestly, it's about time I make a review for this. This is a sandbox game like no other. You can create pretty much anything you could possibly imagine, pose ragdolls, and.. well.. there's just so much! There are thousands upon thousands of addons available on the Workshop to customize your experience in the game, from ragdolls to models to weapons to multiplayer mods, and even more addons that may not be in the Workshop. Most of the time I've invested into this game was from making screenshots, which I enjoy doing, and continue to do. Others may do the same, or build contraptions, play multiplayer, or just plain messing around. Get this game, download whatever you desire, and let your imagination roam free. Highly, HIGHLY recommended.

review: Probably the best sandbox physics game I've played, and it has an extremely active community so you can expect constant (and fun) mods to play around with. My favorite mods as of current has to be the Trouble in Terrorist Town mod and the Firearms: Source 2.0 mod. I also enjoy Prophunt and messing around with NPCs. The only downfall to the game is that not only do the mods take up a lot of valuable harddrive space, but playing singleplayer gets lonely very fast. I would recommend this to all my friends, it's a really nice game. 8/10

review: "We give you the tools and leave you to play.." I'm not even sure where to begin with this game. It's 2014, the Youtube is full of your silly or memorable Gmod moments and SFM-crafted movies, it has become a phenomenon on the internet AND not to mention how much of a reliable platform it is for talented programmers and scripters to try out experimentations. It's a ridiculously-enriched game with endless possibilities. Newcomers can either create their own insane world or hop on one of the many gamemodes they find on the internet and enjoy their time. It's addictive, user-friendly, simple for the beginners and just what the game nerds need to make a difference. Although the gaming community is marred by immaturity, Gmod's workshop showcases the presence of an ever-active "user-contribution" factor. While sandbox gaming has emerged as being highly popular in the last two decades, few games falling under the "physics sandbox" category can match the open-ness of Gmod.

review: One day I bought this because it was on sale for about 2.99. I didn't think much of it but then I started playing. I couldn't believe how addicting it was. I started losing sleep and skipping meals. It started to show on my physical health. My family started bugging me about it and even considered putting me into a rehabilitation center. Let's just say they won't be bugging me anymore. But now I dont have the funds to maintain an internet connection. I've sold everything I have just to play. I can't even go to starbucks and use their wifi because I sold my clothes and apparently they dont accept nudity. So basically I'm writing this review from my phone on top of a bridge. My life isn't worth it without this game. Yet it seems to have ruined my life. Goodbye world.

Zombie survival is good, allthought beeing the first zombie or beeing the first to die is pretty boring, 1942 Rp is good, ppl will lt you do your think unless you walks in to a KoS restricted area. Dark Rp, Havet figured out why I cant make Casino machines even though Im a casino owner eeh..lets see... oh yes! The vietnam war, Pretty nice (same damn map all the time as far as I know) Zworld Afterlife is good, reminds most of DayZ where you have to salvage and and craft your stuff. (be wary of players) Im forgeting something... *snaps fingers* (x3) stopitslender is good dont play it very much. *(Ey, I run head first with a assault rifle in City Rp running from the cops, so dont call me a coward)* Jailbreak is fun to some extense, but the kid warrans are make or break. I hope you "like" this recommendation and gives all mentions above a try. Hey, I had to put up with  music from next door while doing this, So i deserve some credits. *hint* The list above is not ranked after my favorite list.

review: Garry's Mod; my single most played game for many reasons. For one, I'm a creative person myself, and Garry's Mod is where you can most certainly show your creativity to the public, or share ideas with the crowd. Garry's Mod is for the creative, thoughtful, and the open-minded. It give you total freedom in anything you want to do, and you have no practical limits. It is entirely up to you on what you create and share, and in the end, you'll simple hone in your creative skills, and get known in the community. At first, Gmod may seem rather difficult to understand, it does have a learning curve, but once you've mastered the basics, you can start moving onto the more advanced fields, and slowly enhance your skills in whatever it is you like to do. Garry's Mod is about Building, Coding, Talking with friends, and just plain having fun with others. If you don't own Garry's Mod, then I highly suggest it to you, no matter who you are. You've got a large, friendly, and creative playerbase waiting to greet you in this world of infinite creativity. So what are you waiting for, come see Garry's Mod for yourself!

review: Garry's Mod is a spectacular and original game. It is probably the most addicting game that I have played so far. However, like all games, there are some downfalls. This review will review the ups and downs of Garry's Mod. Sound: 8/10 The sound quality is loud and sometimes scratchy, but they are good sounds. Gameplay: 9/10 The gameplay is probably 100's of hours of fun. There are a ton of gamemodes (some popular, others not so much), enough to keep you occupied. The objects in the game are, however, ripped straight from CS:S, HL2, TF2, and other games. But there are people who make new content in the workshop so you can never get bored from the items in your "toybox". Graphics: 6/8 The graphics on this game are somewhat outdated, however I believe that graphics do not in any way affect the quality of the game. These outdated graphics actually somewhat adds to the game's "personality". It adds to the game's "charactor". The graphics themselves may not be attractive, but it does add to the game in ways. Controls: N/A It depends on the way you set your controls. Latency: N/A Some hosts are in Canada and some are far away from where you live. It depends on the server location. Overall: 8/10 That is my review, but these are not facts. They are simply opinions so dont go on my profile and start saying "YOU SUCK AT REVIEWING! YOU CANT REVIEW FOR S***!!". Reviewing is a skill and it also requires observation and critisizim.

review: A really fun game if you have a creative mind. You can create and build to your hearts content. There is a lot of content and option in the game to play around with so that you will never get board. The combinations to what you can build and play with are endless. The game uses physics which is entertaining when playing with friends and killing the AI that you spawn in the game. The graphics are crisp and great to look at. People can get addicted to this game rather quickly when you get the hang of everything this game has to offer. The online portion of this game is very active and fun to play around with friends. There is a single player mode were you can get used to building so that you don't look weird when playing with friends online. This game is highly recommended for the great gameplay and endless possibilities to use your mind and creative side. Build, create, and enjoy the mind for its imagination.

review: GARRYS MOD --------- This game is a pretty well done game it's graphics are alright it could use with a buff. This game has loads of gamemodes the most popular ones would be - Trouble in terriost town - DarkRP - Deathrun - Prophunt - Murder - Sandbox Those are just some of the popular ones that most people play and enjoy. -------------------- Trouble in terriost town TTT is a very popular gamemode were you have a Traitor, Detective, and Innocent The Traitors aim is to eliminate the detectives and innocent's one by one. But the innocent's can fight back. The detectives job is to use there DNA Scanner to find who killed an innocent that just died. The innocent's are just there to kill and call out the traitors. --------------- Sandbox You can download many maps But the deafults are large, and flat. So you can create and build you're absoulte heart out. Create anythink going from tanks to jets! flying pigs and fun mods! Very straight foward and halirously fun :D. ---------------- DarkRP A open world were you deal guns kill people, roam the street's and get jobs to make cash so you can buy more guns. and have aton of fun with your friends! --------------------------- Deathrun There are runners that have to run thought dangerous trap's why there are people called deaths activating deadly spikes/lava pits and all other cool stuff. -------------------------- Prop hunt You are a chair to table to coffe mug to tv to mouse to computer running around and screaming for help while humans chase you! to destory you and you're prop friends. ------------ Murder Oh no theres a murder on the loose we only have 3-1 guy with a gun what are we going to do. *I heard he has a knife* *I heard he can run super fast* -------------------------------- That about wraps up garrys mod if there are further questions you want to ask just PM me. There is no DLC for this game... HAVE FUN!

review: If freedom is your thing, this is probably your best bet. If newbie friendly is your thing... Run. Garry's Mod is possibly #1 in endless content. (If you know what you're doing.) However, it's very buggy. And this game will crash on you more often than you can say banana. And this game is very user content heavy, and a mod of Half-Life 2. In which it NEEDS a 17+ player base. But 3/4ths the players you will meet will be little children screaming into the mics and trying to wreck everything you do. Basically; Buy it. Just don't expect anything to work, and don't expect to have a good time. (But you never know, you might find a place to be in this game.)

review: Garry's Mod is a physics sandbox game from Valve. Garry's Mod is a complete sandbox game. There are no objectives, storylines, goal or something like those. You're a free to do anything, you can mess around in it, make something, build something, make funny of something and much more everything from Valve best titles. You can pose some ragdolls from any Source games such as Half-Life 2 or Counter-Strike: Source, creating your own battles or just play any game modes that available on this game. Make a funny screenshots, blowing everything you create, making a war or battlefield, all of this you can do with your friends or the public. The best part is the Workshop, you can download even more user created content, game modes, anything or even create your own stuff and share it with everyone. Garry's Mod using the same Source Engine used in Half-Life 2 series, Counter-Strike: Source and Day of Defeat: Source with the same content from those game. It's not a copycat game, but rather something to play around with stuff from those games. With the same physics effects you can throw stuff or body around, or you can even construct something from your mind. Garry's Mod is good when you just want to mess around, especially with friends. I recommend this. Rating 9/10

review: Garrysmod has been with me since the beginning of 2014, and it has been a great game to play. You can go on servers and socialize with others and get to make good friends, I had made already 6 new friends this year alone (2014) just playing Garrysmod. You can also add addons to make the game even more fun for you, which you can use in Singplayer but also servers might have the addons you have so you can play with others using those fun addons! Also you can make Pacs which mean Player Appearance Customizer, using this tool, you can make a great appearance for yourself which can wow others. Also there are gamemodes you can use such as Murder which are fun because if it was just only Sandbox which is like a gamemode in which you make things and just hangout it would be boring but with these other gamemodes such as Murder it makes the game very fun. Even though there are some downfalls such as people being rude and things just try to ignore it and have fun doing what you want to do.

review: Garry's mod is wonderfully made, and is a staple for any Steam owner. The many gamemodes allow you to figure out what you enjoy doing. Don't like TTT? Try Dark RP. Don't like Dark RP? Try elevator source. There's so many, it's literally impossible to get bored with this game. Not to mention many, many laughs had in multiplayer. I would reccomend the multiplayer more than the singleplayer, just because it's that much more fun with other people. When you start out, though, just mess around in single player to figure out the controls and such. If you get bored with the regular content, there are thousands upon thousands of mods to download! This is a great game, and is getting better all the time.

review: This game, or rather this software is a PURE GEM!!! This sort of gaming creation framework lets your imagination run wild! And for people whose primary skills aren't design/conception, many (I mean, REALLY MANY) excellents crafts made by community build original, audacious and generally addictively fun multiplayer gamemodes. There are probably more than a 100 mods. All are not equal, but you're sure to find at least half a dozen mods that will entertain you for dozen hours. Among my personal favourites: Prop Hunt (1 team incarnate daily-life objects, other team has to find and destroy them), Trouble in Terrorist Town (x terrorists, >1 traitor, many possibilities), Melon Bomber (exhilarating Bomberman clone), Bomber Barrel (1 explosive barrel hidden among many, infinite spawn, has to kill all humans in imparted time -killed humains become barrels too), Deathrun (try to run to exit while avoiding traps), Stranded (like Rust or DayZ), Stalker (one powerful alien against marines team) etc... Some gamemodes even propose some "serious" (aka time-investing) roleplay. All of this juicy, thrilling, exciting and foremost unique experience for a mere few bucks. And it's Linux-compatible to boot. Really, what are you waiting for? Join us in the fun already!!

review: *IMPORTANT*: Must have Counter Strike to have texture and files or else you will experience black and purple hell. Garry's Mod is sandbox game that enables you to spawn stuff to play around with and go wild with your imagination. You can spawn characters from your favorite games to mess around with your friends or even play solo. Not only that but the steam workshop allows players more stuff to spawn to play around with! It not only has sandbox mode but a variety of other modes such as the famous Trouble in Terriost Town (TTT), Role play, Zombies, and much more! Gary's mod provides countless hours of gameplay and fun so what are you waiting for? Go buy this game now especially if its on sale. One of my personal most played games on steam.

review: If you look at my profile you will AKA WILL!!! see that my profile pic is made by me by using the same thing you are reading about right now............no,no not TF2 dummy Gmod 13! (Garry's Mod 13 as you will) is a game with no end, no objective and absolutely no point howeverrrrrr you CAN make a point you CAN make an end and you CAN make an objective all by using the things the game supply you with/chuck in your face and say "Here you go now DO A THING!!" orrrrrrr you can just make EPIC PICTURES (like me) and post them for ALL OF STEAM TO SEE!!!! (theres a way to upload them to facebook aswell!) Also you can play multiplayer! (duuuh) theres alsorts of things to do rather then just building a fully destructible building or killing random NPCs with a boombox by playing THE WOST MUSIC EVER!! you can play game modes like prop hunt, RD (Role Play) ,stop it slender!, zombie survival or the famous TTT (trouble in terrorist town) and many MANY MORE! the only downside to this game is the fact that you need HL2 (and its all its eps) to play and you need CSS (counter strike source) to play most of the game modes or you will get the dreaded ERRORS lucky you can get things that will stop this or just get the games! so if your looking for someing to destress yourself with instead Kittins then Gmod is there! (unless your building a giant robot...then it is not...)

The wide variety of game modes and addons bring more hours of fun to the game. The funnest game modes for me were Stranded, Deathrun and Dark rp which is where I spent the majority of my Garry's Mod time. There are also servers that you can relax on, such as the Cinema servers, and watch what you and those around you are interested in. If you have yet to play/buy this game, I would really recommend you get this as I would describe it as a necessity for any PC Gamer

review: Whilst I've never really seen the appeal of the creator aspects of this game I've had lots of fun playing and trying out the things that other people have created. From things like Trouble in terrorist town, Murder and Prophunt and to something more crazy like The Elevator Mod. This game is great if you play with friends and whilst it differs from person to person what they enjoy you can find lots of different gamemodes always coming out and it will make sure you'll never get bored.

review: What can I say? Amazing sandbox game with unlimited possiblities on end. Become this, do that, destroy this, build that, kill him, resurrect her, do whatever you wish. Most immersive sandbox game I have played in awhile. Add on the fact with all the Steam Workshop Mods, as well as FacePunch Forum Mods, this game is neverending with new things to discover, and new things to build. Great thing is, you don't have to do it alone. By default, there are two gamemodes, sandbox, and TTT (Trouble in Terrorist Town) where it goes from building to proving the guilty, proving your innocence, or even killing ever last living soul. Would play again.

Ever since gmod 9 I have been building various interests of the mind and playing so many different gamemodes that this game should be considered multiple games in one. Although the community isn't as strong today as it was, there is no better place to make a server with friends and build random creations to the hearts content. (or until one of your "friends" blows your  up) I should also mention the better part of the online community now is made up of rp'ers or people playing trouble in terrorist town.

review: This game is just amazing, it's an Sandbox game which is creative like Minecraft but it's like FPS-shooter game, you can build stuff, play with friends play horror mode and play some other fun gamemodes! Here is some popular gamemodes: Trouble in Terrorist Town (TTT) Facts: (Traitor Role) In this gamemode there is 1-4 traitors depending on how many players there are on the server and how much the server is limited, probably most normaly it's 3 traitors, they need to work and kill the innocents before the time runs out, they can't just make a massacare, they need to teamwork and silently kill the innocents, traitors can buy only traitor items, which are useful when it comes to killing surviving and more, traitors must kill the person silently, otherwise if one innocent see that an traitor killed an innocent, the innocent will start to attack the traitor. (Innocent Role) As an innocent you don't know which to kill and which to not kill, and that means you can't trust anyone untill he is proven by killing an traitor, but you can't just random-kill people, because then you will get banned mostly, because you need evidence, proof that he is the traitor, but, you need to make sure you don't kill an innocent person when you think it's him, the main role for innocents is to survive the round and not make any mistakes. (Detective Role) When you are detective you are a detective, you can buy only detective items like the traitors but detective ones, the detective ones gives you an ability to detect stuff, and you can buy an Health Station, to regen your innocent comrades, but there will be traitors too that is using it, you have an special item called ''DNA SCANNER'' that is an item that you scan for DNA, if you see an dead body, use the DNA scanner to find an figure out who killed him, you will see that the DNA leads to a person, if not the DNA got expired or the victim got sniped and didnt leave any DNA from the killer, so the main role of this is just to figure out who the traitor is, but beware, the traitors are taking you down first! So you need to make sure you don't trust any traitors! This game is so worth it! My favourite gamemode is the Trouble in Terrorist Town (TTT) The game is really cheap, you should check it out, give it an try! You will 100% like it!

review: A truly wonderful game which has almost unlimited possibilities. Sure, there are the FPS-style modes like TTT, but if you just want to play at a much slower pace there are modes such as Cinema and SledBuild. Also, if you want to dedicate a lot of time into it, you can pose character models from, say, TF2, and create a stop-motion video. Garry's Mod satisfies a large variety of gamers with its different modes, and that makes it something special.

review: Garry's Mod. What can I say? A mindless, enjoyable game where you are basically God. At first it bugged me that I only had 2 maps, but then I subscribed to more and I have 4 now. I really like that you can be killed by the larger ragdolls (realism) and when they land from high above there is a seismic wave and everything. I don't like that sometimes you spawn in places you weren't meant to spawn in after you die because you can't move out of them. I also don't like that you get stuck in the ragdolls. But it is still a mindless free play that, if you learn to like it, is awesome (like me :3). I definently would say that if you're interested, play this game. You can do almost anything (literally). Thumbs up for this game!

review: Amazing game. Garry's Mod gives you the most hours of fun of any game, because there is so much to do. I personally like the Gamemodes more than Sandbox, but Sandbox can be quite fun with friends too. When you are done messing around with planes, tanks, Gordon Freeman and a refridgerator in Sandbox, you can play Trouble in Terrorist Town. When you are done with that, you can go and do Prop Hunt with some friends. After that you can do Zombie Survival, some Roleplay (which is one of the worst gamemodes in my opinion, but who am I?) or another gamemode of the many you can choose out. And afterwards, you can repeat the process! I definitely find Trouble in Terrorist Town with +/- 20 players the most fun of Garry's Mod, but pretty much anything on this game is fun! Highly recommended, this will give you a high playcount. 255 hours for me so far, many more to come. 9/10.

I've wasted hour upon hour playing Trouble in Terrorist Town and Deathrun, along you can be sure to find something you like yourself. Aside from the community gamemodes, it does offer Sandbox mode, which allows you to use a massive array of interesting tools, including ones you can easily download from the Workshop to make everything from the most complex of machines to a bath with wheels.

review: Garry's Mod is a modification for a Source Engine which gets you ability to create, destroy, build, connect, guide, fight, pose, construct, and mess around. You can do crearly ANYTHING. Gameplay On a spawn, you've got a set of standard weapons for HL2 (crowbar, gravity gun, pistol, 357, smg, ar2, shotgun, crossbow, rpg, grenade) and a special Physics Gun, which makes you able to manipulate props, people and whatever. You can spawn content from all (installed) Source Games and even download custom models/maps/sounds/saves/weapons/etc from a Steam Workshop. Playing multiplayer is as fun as playing alone. Crazy addons makes it even more fun! Multiplayer Well, its more fun than singleplayer - I just lied to you, sorry. In multiplayer you can't only build with people.. you can play random gamemodes like Prop Hunt, Trouble in Terrorist Town or Cinema! You can be a prop and hide from everyone; you can be a terrorist and act like a innocent man; you can watch YouTube videos with everyone... there are even gamemodes for racing and talking in public! Workshop It gives you very big ability to download and share your creations with others. Like I said: files/maps/models/textures/sounds/npcs/vehicles/helicopters/weapons and much much more makes you spend 15hours a day in a freakin Gmod. So... GMod is one of the most creative games I've ever played. Nothing more to say - this game is worth its price. 9.5/10

review: Personal Rating: 9/10 What is there to say about Garry's Mod, it's a creativity tool for starters. It has a wide community ranging from Terrorists to Homeless People and all in all I have great fun messing around and throwing couches at people. The amount of servers and variety here is truly amazing, for example, one minute you could be roleplaying as a chef in Germany, switch to another server and boom, you're a Terrorist. The workshop is magnificent too, I mean, the amount of stuff on there is amazing. The only problem I have is I can't play single player. Seen as though when GMOD switched to GMOD 13, it changed files. So, that means you would have to disable then enable all of your addons. Bit of a problem for me seeing as though I have 25+ pages of addons and the amount you get when connecting to servers is huge. One last note, buy the Counter Strike/GMOD pack, maybe 90% of maps and props used on servers have Counter Strike on it, the other 10% is Half Life 2, Episode 1 and Episode 2 so be careful.

review: This game brings joy and love to all. With an infinite amount of things possible, what's wrong with this game? Aside from the Garry's Mod 13 update, the ragdoll bugs, sound bugs, and fire bugs. Not to mention that weird sound of water when you spawn. To be honest, that's not a whole lot of things. Now I'm done ing, on to what's good with the game. First off. The Steam Workshop. This makes life easy for players to just download and play. And you have a mega s*** ton of weapons, maps, game modes, dupications, weapons, NPCs, and much more. If you don't at least think this game seems interesting, you need help. It's fairly easy to get started. Having trouble with a nonstop zombie noise screaming at you when you are 150% sure you deleted everything on the map? Go into your console and fix that, you see? Half of the things wrong with this game are gone. Mind you, this game is only $10. Get it. It's fun. You feel that sandbox is boring? You want to play with someone on a server? Play the many game modes shown in the server menu. If you want to be a Traitor on your best freind, play the mode; Trouble in Terrorist town. Feel like you miss Half-Life 2 due to the Source engine Garry's Mod uses? Play HL2:RP. Want to just kick it and watch some things with complete strangers? Yes. You can go to the movies in Garry's Mod. I want you to buy this game and forward the cause of science by 40 years. Thank you for your time.

review: If you look at my profile you will AKA WILL!!! see that my profile pic is made by me by using the same thing you are reading about right now............no,no not TF2 dummy Gmod 13! (Garry's Mod 13 as you will) is a game with no end, no objective and absolutely no point howeverrrrrr you CAN make a point you CAN make an end and you CAN make an objective all by using the things the game supply you with/chuck in your face and say "Here you go now DO A THING!!" orrrrrrr you can just make EPIC PICTURES (like me) and post them for ALL OF STEAM TO SEE!!!! (theres a way to upload them to facebook aswell!) Also you can play multiplayer! (duuuh) theres alsorts of things to do rather then just building a fully destructible building or killing random NPCs with a boombox by playing THE WOST MUSIC EVER!! you can play game modes like prop hunt, RD (Role Play) ,stop it slender!, zombie survival or the famous TTT (trouble in terrorist town) and many MANY MORE! the only downside to this game is the fact that you need HL2 (and its all its eps) to play and you need CSS (counter strike source) to play most of the game modes or you will get the dreaded ERRORS lucky you can get things that will stop this or just get the games! so if your looking for someing to destress yourself with instead Kittins then Gmod is there!

review: Garry's Mod is a modification for a Source Engine which gets you ability to create, destroy, build, connect, guide, fight, pose, construct, and mess around. You can do crearly ANYTHING. Gameplay On a spawn, you've got a set of standard weapons for HL2 (crowbar, gravity gun, pistol, 357, smg, ar2, shotgun, crossbow, rpg, grenade) and a special Physics Gun, which makes you able to manipulate props, people and whatever. You can spawn content from all (installed) Source Games and even download custom models/maps/sounds/saves/weapons/etc from a Steam Workshop. Playing multiplayer is as fun as playing alone. Crazy addons makes it even more fun! Multiplayer Well, its more fun than singleplayer - I just lied to you, sorry. In multiplayer you can't only build with people.. you can play random gamemodes like Prop Hunt, Trouble in Terrorist Town or Cinema! You can be a prop and hide from everyone; you can be a terrorist and act like a innocent man; you can watch YouTube videos with everyone... there are even gamemodes for racing and talking in public! Workshop It gives you very big ability to download and share your creations with others. Like I said: files/maps/models/textures/sounds/npcs/vehicles/helicopters/weapons and much much more makes you spend 15hours a day in a freakin Gmod. So... GMod is one of the most creative games I've ever played. Nothing more to say - this game is worth its price. 9.5/10

review: Personal Rating: 9/10 What is there to say about Garry's Mod, it's a creativity tool for starters. It has a wide community ranging from Terrorists to Homeless People and all in all I have great fun messing around and throwing couches at people. The amount of servers and variety here is truly amazing, for example, one minute you could be roleplaying as a chef in Germany, switch to another server and boom, you're a Terrorist. The workshop is magnificent too, I mean, the amount of stuff on there is amazing. The only problem I have is I can't play single player. Seen as though when GMOD switched to GMOD 13, it changed files. So, that means you would have to disable then enable all of your addons. Bit of a problem for me seeing as though I have 25+ pages of addons and the amount you get when connecting to servers is huge. One last note, buy the Counter Strike/GMOD pack, maybe 90% of maps and props used on servers have Counter Strike on it, the other 10% is Half Life 2, Episode 1 and Episode 2 so be careful.

review: This is a great sandbox game, however it is much more than just a sandbox. There are thousands of multiplayer servers spanning different game modes, including DarkRP, Zombie Surival, and Parkour (DON'T FORGET TTT). The singleplayer sandbox servers are a great way to let out your creativity, (besides Source Film Marker, of course) allowing you to make artwork, or videos / movies if you wish. All the user-generated content in the Workshop is MOSTLY good. Another good thing about the UGC is that you can download it into your game via subscribing them. If you are considering on buying it, I strongly suggest that you do! (TIP: As with most other non-free to play games, I suggest that you buy this game during the Summer Steam Sale or Steam Holiday Sale.) More recently, I've found this game to be great for making posters as well, but most people would just SFM for that. However, graphics modifications created by users can increase the quality of Garry's Mod screenshots, and even help you create SFM-esque art. 10/10 Highly recommended for when you've some cash.

review: In all honesty the factor that you even have to read the reviews to decide whether or not to purchase this game is suprising to me. This is one of, if not the most amazing game I have ever played. It is quite difficult to explain what this game is, but the best I could say is it is a game that works as a basis for games to be created and played on. So right now you may be thinking your not a fan of these creator, non story line based games. But G-Mod is so much more than that, it's a community of people who absolutley love to play and create things together. It is a community of individuals who enjoy coming together to create something that I have never seen done in a game before. And so much more, I can't explain every "Game Mode" in G-Mod, but let me just throw a few out there. One being a little game called "Trouble in Terrorist Town", probably the most fascinating and enjoyable FPS game I have ever played, then there is the likes of "Prop Hunt" a truely wonderful little Game Mode that is really one of the first Hide n' Seek type games I have ever seen work well. But these are just 2 of the big Game Modes in Garry's Mod, there are so many other Game Modes that may not have the same recognititon as the ones I have discussed, but have the same wonderful communities. This truely is a game where you come together with others in order to just have a good time and enjoy simply playing the game. I have never had a game where I have made so many friendships with individuals who simply enjoy the same random little game mode I do. To ignore G-Mod and to blow it off as just another "creation/god" game is criminal to say the least. So if by now you haven't already pick up the damn game, do it; and join in on a one of a kind gaming experience.

review: Gmod is a sandbox game sorta like Terraria Minecraft TF2 and HL2 mixed in one. The controls are the same as HL2 but some changes since it was realesed 2 years after HL2 but its good. The physics are like the ones in TF2 and Terraria when your player falls. The newbies and mingebags are the real problems there having a hard time getting used to it so teach em! Garry's Mod creator is really hard to play with him because he normal spends time in singleplayer or whitelisted servers so "Yes im the real Garry" acheivment is sort of impossible to get so dont bother trying to get it. The Rating is over all of a 9/10 to me and removing toybox was a bad idea, we all knew a month ago the addon menu got messed up and i lost my addons too so shut up about it its fine now! So the physics are meh but creation of gmod was the first start of an animation carrer. BUY DIS GAME OR BE LEFT OUT OF ALL THE FUN!

review: Imagine a Sandbox, but instead of sand you got dolls and guns (actually a lot more than those 2). In a better perspective it's still a sandbox game without sand and what to put it in the "sandbox" is in your command. The power of lua simply drives this game forward with a lot of gamemodes more than just putting doll in a doll house or rather you becoming a doll having a gun shooting another doll that is your friend or...someone else in a public game. Have a crazy random idea about something? Put it in this game. Wanted to have a game that does not limit what you can do? This is the game. Want to create 3D animation without a complex expensive software? This is the program. Want to get money by writing a couple lines of code that turns out to be a epic game inside a game? This is how you get them. Garry's Mod let you create your own sandbox with 0% mess, and it's cooler inside (the house).

review: Garry's mod is one of those Rare games that you can play again and again and never really bore of. You can find other games, and invest hundreds of hours into them, but at the end of the month, you find yourself wishing you could just play some more Garry's Mod. I don't have over 356 hours into it for nothing, and, compared to some of the people I've met and talked to over the internet, that's not even that much to invest into a single game. It's setup into different gamemodes. There's classic sandbox, where you can build and screw around on any amount of maps, with NPC's and other Mechanics. There's Trouble in Terrorist Town (TTT), where a few people are randomly selected as 'traitors', and try to kill the other players on the server, while 'innocents' and 'detectives' are trying to figure out who the Traitors are. I owned a Server for TTT, and I have to admit most of my hours are into asmuch. A few things to note; First off, it's not a very fast game. I've run my thing at the lowest Graphics possible, and still found that it takes multiple minutes just to load the game, let alone make or join a server. I also remember playing on a server called Serious Roleplaying Hell (SRH). While it was a really fun DarkRP server, which, btw, is another Gamemode, it was really laggy, which to a large degree is just how the game was made. I've also found that Garry's Mod has crashed periodically for no particular reason. While my computer might not be the best, I'm sure it could still happen to you. Another thing to keep in mind is that it has Workshop support. Maps, NPC's, Models, Ragdolls, Machines, Weapons, and loads of other Misc. Content fills Garry's Mod, and has been on the second page of Workshop contributators for a while, if not the first one. Overall, between the content, the Price (especially with the Summer Sale going on right now), all the dfferent gamemodes (Besides Sandbox and TTT, there's DarkRP, Prophunt, Murder, a DayZ Spinoff, and countless others), it's a great game that's totally worth it. Cheers!

Unfortunately there is some problems with this game, for starters, some of the textures won't load and you have to download some to make the textures come back. Without downloading these textures that server/game is glitchy. Also, when joining a server, it takes a very long time. But overall, I highly recommend this game!

review: This game is quite fun and can be very enjoyable though it has numerous problems. This game is extremely un-user friendly. Missing textures, missing maps, 1 hour load times for servers. I would say 20% of my Gmod play time has been loading screens. That is not an exaggeration. A positive of the game is that it is essentially an engine where many other games can exist, so while I have played this game the most out of any other game I have ever owned in my Steam library, it is really a game with many smaller games inside of it so it never gets "old". For it's price it is an amazing game which you will play for years to come but after playing this game for over 1000 hours I can begin to see it's faults. If your friends have this game and you don't...well then you better go buy it and join in on the fun!

review: the game by itself is good with the many addons but, the multiplayer is for an . like 99% of the time the servers you'll join have billions of crappy useless items like 900 my little pony shitpacks for a gta online server that will take you 100 hours to download until you finally join a half- server with  players who insult you when you ask where you can buy cars due to a crappy introduction text or slenderman servers that require you to download useless helicopter addons and , an usual server joining session takes like 16 days for about 2 minutes of fun before being killed, humiliated and finally banned out for not being french or russian (i thank hotline miami for allowing me to release my anger on em and release these ers' adams apples with a simple push of a button) and downloading an addon takes like 5 minutes because it freezes when it starts the download and freezes when it ends it. i cant say that i liked the experience of this game in any way and unless a mod comes out where you can smash russian and french mobsters heads in with baseball bats im probably not going to touch this  again. the game by itself is good but honestly who the  enjoys singleplayer

review: Garry's Mod is the best sandbox game ever. You can do anything in it, from building in sandbox to messing around in other gamemodes made by the community. Garry's Mod itself can be boring but it will never get boring with the all of the addons made by the community. You can do anything you can imagine, you can download a roller coaster save in a map & have fun in it with friends, you can survive zombie hordes in zombie survival gamemodes, you can watch videos with your friends in Cinema gamemode. It's so addicting & fun, Garry's Mod will never get boring as long as the workshop of it is alive. This game is pretty fun & funny with friends. It's fun while playing solo too. A must play for any gamer. Note - You'll most likely face a lot of texture errors (pink & black) & error signs in multiplayer because most servers use Counter-Strike: Source content. So it's recommended to buy the CS:S+GMod package/bundle. But if you don't have money, you can download the content for free. Recommended source games for the best experience in multiplayer : 1. Counter-Strike: Source 2. Half-Life 2 3. Half-Life 2 episode 1 & 2 Rating - 10/10.

review: It's an interesting game. It will require a lot of harddrive space as there are lots of addons and you have to download more when joining many servers. I have lots of time in the game from just screwing around in DarkRP. The game has lots of gamemodes but most get little attention as the game is mostly spammed with terrible DarkRP and TTT servers. Garry's Mod server admins are some of the worst people I've ever played with in games. When you do find a good DarkRP or TTT server it can be very fun to play. I'd overall give the game a 7/10.

THIS COMES FROM A GUY THAT WASTED 1K HOURS ON THIS SHlT i had to put that i recommend this shit even tho i dont, or else the fanboys would downvote at all costs without even reading if you downvote this review you probably are a little faggot bitch which i could easily beat with no trouble probe me wrong cunt

review: Garry's Mod is a physics sandbox. Unlike regular games there aren't any predefined aims or goals. The game's makers give you the tools and leave you to play! You spawn objects and weld them together to create your own contraptions -- whether that's a car, a rocket, a catapult or something that doesn't have a name yet -- that's up to you. If you're not too great at construction -- don't worry! You can place a variety of characters in silly positions.

review: Tons of fun with friends. You literally laugh for hours with your homies. You know those good rare times when something really hilarious happens and you laugh so hard your belly hurts? This game has that every 2 seconds. Expands creativity, has lots of community addons, playermodels, all that kinda stuff. Wanna make a stop motion movie but you suck at SFM? Try Gmod. Wanna just hang out with friends but you got no game to do so? Try Gmod. Oh but what are you saying? You don't have any friends? Worry not! There are plenty of online servers to choose from, ranging from Sandbox to community game mods like Trouble in Terrorist Town, Prophunt, Murder, Stop it Slender! and even Jailbreak! Building is very advanced and you can do all kinds of cool stuff. Even a driveable bathtub. I'm serious. Truly a master piece of a game.

review: I went here with my nakama (that means "friend" in Japanese) the other day. I asked for ramen but they didn't have it so me and my nakama had to eat this weird cold fish stuff instead. We came for Japan food but ended up having to eat some fish thing that's probably French or something. It doesn't matter though because we could see Naruto-sama everywhere we looked and we could shout "Dattebayo" (that means "Habeeb it!" in Japanese) and everyone knew what we meant.

review: Garry's mod is a game based from half life, counter stike etc. within the game there are numerous gamemodes. (The most popular being trouble in terroist town, also known as ttt.) It is very enjoyable and as there is nearly always something for everyone, it is one of the most popular games on steam. i think everyone should give this a try and if you are not sure just wait till a steam sale. At some point it nealy always is. other gamemodes include Prop Hunt, Murder, Stop it slender, and many more. If there is still doubt as to whther to get this game or not. Check the channel of Seanners who has become one of the most popular youtubers in the world for his daily gaming videos ( mainly of gamemodes within Garry's mod)

review: #Ivespentover3700hoursonthiscursedgame. It's such a fun and entertaining game... however, it really depends on what you're doing in it. Ever since I got Garry's Mod, I've mainly administrated servers. With a little managing, developing and other things on the side. I've put in over 3,730 hours. Most of it's from managing communities or doing random stuff. Like exploding dozens of nuclear bombs and watching the wonderful glow of radiation. Or, massacring balloons. But, eitherway, I've mainly always administrated, managed or own something to put my time into. Sometime early 2014, I came to a community and started working on that. After a bit of time, it went down due to a corrupt owner. After that, I went distant but was later retrieved by someone I knew from there... He and I, would then work together on the community he owned and we would build it to be pretty decent. For about a year, ( I had taken a break for a few months ), we worked and fixed up his server. Recently, I've resigned from there and now am setting my sights to help others. And during my free time... I've had loads of fun due to it. Garry's Mod is simply amazing and 99.98% of my friends are from communities I either played or administrated. I can say without a doubt, this was the greatest gift I've ever gotten. To be able to meet people from around the world and actually get experience you could potentially use in Real-Life situations, such as, handling people in a decent, professional way... depending on where you're at. A lot of mentally challenged morons play Garry's Mod and ruin servers, however there are many greats havens where they've cleansed the idiotic disease and work to prevent it. It's rare, but they're there. There's many types of people on Garry's Mod. Some are nice, some are rude, and some deserve to die on a lego bed. Find the right server for you, and you'll most likely have a great time. If you're a good sport about it. The End.

review: Garry's Mod is a sandbox game which revolves around mods and the modding community. What kind of mods you ask? Gamemodes, weapons, maps, vehicles, npcs, tools, effects, player models, server content and more! Better yet, the game goes really cheap (2.49 usually) during sales so pick it up then, but I personally got it in a pack with Counter Strike but do whatever you want. tl:dr great game go buy it

review: I started to play Garry's mod thinking I would have fun with creative new game types. I was wrong. If you love children and people with Autism well then this is the community for you! Every server and I mean every server! Gets so pissed off and talks like their mom smoked crack while she was carrying them in her stomach for the 9 months of pregnacy OR you get kids that were literally just born 6 weeks ago. If you are going to get this and play it make sure you get 20 of your friends to remind kids to go back to playing Call of Duty and Skylanders. Oh and the ones with Autism can I guess just kill themselves. They have seen to much thanks to them having access to the internet.

review: This game is an awful pile of bison , I can't even begin to describe how terrible this game is, it made me judge and re-evaluate my entire being on a primal level because of the time and effort I put into downloading this horrific nightmare some call a video game. Truly I advise anyone with common scence or mental stability to avoid this heeping stack of vomit from both a recreational, and medical standpoint. I now take part in hours of counselling just to subside my constant, seasless, agonising desire to end my own life due to what this game had to offer. For any reason you wish to play this game, wether it be some kind of challenge for you or just morbid curiosity, I'm pleading you to not download this game. 10/10 must buy!

review: Garrys mod is a fun game but there is some problems with the game. First off all when your trying to download addons its just slow and glitchy. Then when you try to play the game after downloading the addon it like lags or glitches out completly and yes crashes. 2nd of all why do we need to get addons can't it be like when we first got it and its just in the q menu its so much easier. 3rd is that the admens in role play and stuff dont even do their job or get mad when someone actually puts them in jail because they broke a rule in role play. And i was watching this youtube video where there was a admin recording himself and he was just lazy. other wize this game is pretty good i guess. So i guess 6.3/10. What should i reveiw next? Maybe The Sims.

review: Garry's Mod is a game for 2 types of people. The first type, is people who like creating things. You can create nearly anything in the source engine, with the right addons, and if you aren't very good, there are youtube videos on it all. I got into this game after the main yogscast channel showed off the addon pack for making space ships. I spent hours in this, and using the base creation tools, before I found out how awesome the multiplayer gamemodes are. I am not sure how many are made by Facepunch studios, but it is through their work that so many are able to easily experience projects made by single people, or budding indie devs of the future. The other types of people are those who spend all of their time on Trouble in Terrorist Town, or Murder, or Prophunt, or any of the main game modes. Heck, you and your friends can walk into a virtual cinema and watch all of SeaNanners's and the yogscast's videos to learn about them! This game has everything apart from what you can imagine. All you have to do is make it.

review: Gaben is love, Gaben is life As a child i always lived PC games, i used to beg my Dad to buy me games, i would pray to LORD GABEN at night, hoping that he would grant me sales. Gaben would always give me sales usually 75% off. I had all the Valve games and would constantly trade and open cases. Keys were expensive. My Father could hear me praying to gaben, he came in and smashed my computer against the wall, i was crying over the smashed up parts crunched up on the floor. I started on cry over the loss of my Gaming pc. I knew my Dad was jealous for my devoting to Gaben. I start to fall asleep. I feel a strange presence enter my room. I quickly woke up to find Gaben. standing next to my Bed. "its gaben" i loudly though to myself". I am so happy to see him. Gaben then uses his powers to lift up my broken pc and repair it with his mind. I am so thankful that he did such a kind thing. Gaben then proceeds to walk up to me. He then whispers in my ear," this is my hat", i threw my Ghastly gibus at him, he rejects it and bends me over the bed, he enters my his fat fingers into my pants. but went for my pocket instead and takes out my wallet, he uses his magic to grant me 95% sales on all the games on my wishlist. Then penetrates my wallet and takes $10 out it is expensive but i do it for gaben. it is uncomfortable. He then proceeds to take out a $50 note, in the irritation i scream out "Fluttershy is best pony, not pinkie". Gaben is furious now and throws me against the wall, which reveals a secret wall safe. He walks over to the safe and takes out all my money, then begins to penetrate my tight butt hole, it hurts but i do it for Gaben. The noise attracts my dad to the room. My dad enters the room and finds me bent over in the corner in tears of joy and pain, while he sees gaben thrusting my hard. Gaben turns to my dad and looks him dead in the eye and flies out the window and says his last words 'Gaben is love, Gaben is life', followed by, "you will never resist my sales". i am now nearly unconscious in satisfaction as drool flows out of my mouth and i am still curled up in a bent over position.

review: One of the very few games that provides endless, and with that I really mean, ENDLESS, fun. It just simply can't get boring. The Workshop is full of oppertunities to keep the game fresh and due to its many gamemodes you have a wide range of playstyles for Garry's Mod. Absolutely a must-have for the average PC gamer.

review: Garry's Mod is a physics sandbox. Unlike regular games there aren't any predefined aims or goals. We give you the tools and leave you to play. You spawn objects and weld them together to create your own contraptions - whether that's a car, a rocket, a catapult or something that doesn't have a name.

review: Well everyone knows and loves this game, but for those ( Few ) who don't here are some things about the game. It have single and multi player modes. it has gamemode like RP ( RolePlaying ), DarkRP, TTT ( touble in town ), SandBox ( Main Gamemode ), Jailbreak and may more. In single player there are a lot of thinsg to do ( Without Mods ). First you can make a house out of dushbins and sinks. Second you can put ragdolls in as people, but if you want you can put a NPC in or AI player which will follow you. But if you are looking for a War then you can add Combine NPC which will try to kill you and normal NPC's. Now to some mods. Have you every wanted to fly tons of planes the WAC is for you its is the best Mods making for planes. Now How bout some good guns, well the i recommed all gun mods because there awsome. Now for a ride look for Scars Slim, Basic, Extra for great cars, also Garry Mods on Wheels and TDM Car. But i give this game a loved... 10/10 - LOVE IT OR DIE

review: welp, 1,122 hours played... now I can properly review this. Looking at the date this has been redone by 19/01/2014 and not 5th august 2011. Now that I have got that out the way, this is garrys mod the great sandbox game? I'm sorry but this is NOT a sandbox game. This is a special game in the way of HEY HEY DUDE LETS GO JAM A MILLION ADDONS ONTO THIS GAME AND MAKE IT CRASH WHEN WE SPAWN IN SOMETHING!!!11 That is sadly what I do now, but this game is great seriously. Look at the pictures jesus it already looks good... and then you buy it. lets hope that you own EVERY SOURCE GAME EVER well, any by valve or a mod thats gone mainstream (zombie panic etc.) because trut me. all the mapmakers love their assets not included within the files. I can't go into the mechainics either because this game is what you want it to be! Well to be honest their are a few things. PHYSGUN: the thing you use for moving 'props' and 'ragdolls' and it wouldn't be garrys mod without the thing. TOOLGUN: you get to do stuff... you've possibly seen it in the screen shots with the derpy faces. ENTIRE HL2 ARSENAL: umm... do I need to even speak about the stuff? also if you haven't played HL2 yet then uh, don't kill yourself and buy it. And now for uh... Lingo Buster 9001!!! SANDBOX: its a sandbox, do whatever you want in it, crap in it for all I care. (ITS ALSO THE DEFAULT GAMEMODE FOR THE POSING N STUFF) ADDON: a fancy way of saying mod but it isn't exactly a mod. For example a addons adds something new but dosent change a few lines of code. MODELS: you'd know what models are if you looks at the banner, screensshots etc. and this also segways into! RAGDOLLS AND PROPS: ragdolls are basically things that move when you move them around and you also pose them to do uh... things that are innocent and the complete opisi-UGHRRR GROSS while props on the otehr hand are things you can't pose but can move around and stick to each other and do some pre-tty cool stuff with. SCARY G-MAN VIRUS: RUN, RUN SO FAST, TURN OFF YOUR COMPUTER NEVER GO ONTO A SERVER THAT SAYS... Gmod tower server 2 on sandbox on the map flatgrass?! or atleast anything with a  name. For example DUUUUHH I LIKE BUHTS and FURRIES FTW. This game gets a ?.?/10 because this game is anything you want it to be like i said a million times and you can cause the game to crash. It's all up to you in mod-gameish of the year 2004-93819823612783512734512412572648 (no but seriously how many version of garrys mod are there!?!?)

review: Garry's Mod is Minecraft on steroids. The users can build literally anything and put it into this game, shall they have the skill. You can download things from the steam workshop in seconds, and the things you can download are either clever and creative, funny and weird, random and silly, or stupid and pointless. The tools are hilarious from face poser to inflator. The gamemodes, such as TTT and DarkRP (I could have a review for each and every one on their own and probably take more than one read more) are so great that I would pay more than I would have to play for all the valve games for each one in it's own game. It comes with great amounts of ragdolls, props, NPC's and more. The "example", as I call them, face and finger poses are great. The only thing I can think of that would be wrong with the game is the frame rate on crappy computers such as my own. 10/10.

review: Garrys'mod is a great Sandbox game for people to enjoy. Especially everybody who played the Half life series, Counter strike series or types of Valve Games. You can spend tons of hours in creating whatever you'd like with your friends and play hundreds of player made gamemodes while you're at it
game-hours: 282.4
review: I mean, how could you not like Garry's Mod? If you don't like Sandbox, play TTT. If you don't like TTT, play an RP server. If you don't like that RP gamemode, find another RP gamemode. If you don't like that, there's GMod racing, Deathrun, Prison escape, survival, and zombie gamemodes. Hell, there's a gamemode dedicated to bunnyhopping.

review: This is the best game I have ever played, possibly the best game in the world. You can do absolultely everything you have ever dreamed of! Garry's Mod can sometimes help you with other games, something not many other games can do. Steam Workshop has many wonderful addons to enhance Garry's Mod, making it simply amazing. Busy multiplayer servers, great singleplayer, it's a must have for anyone, whether you wish to play seriously, or just have some fun messing around. I cannot recommend it enough, it's absolutely fantastic, simple to learn, impossible to master. 10/10

review: What is there to say about Garry's Mod. It's like 100 games in one, and it's fantastic. Will you bunny hop your way to victory, play detective in TTT and Murder, or hide for your life in Hide and Seek? Maybe, get dangerous and play some Deathrun as well. I highly suggest getting this game if you're on a tight budget, as it'll give you a lot for the price.

review: Gary's Mod is one of the most well-known games throughout the whole Steam community. This is due to it's limitless oppertunities. Garry's Mod provides players with numerous items and tools to use to create virtually anything the player wants. This is also supported by player made items and structures that are available for ingame use. This adds even more depth to the game with the singleplayer and multiplayer. The multiplayer has hundreds of different and unique game types ranging from parquor with a twist (Deathrun) to fighting pirates on the seven seas (Pirate Ship Wars). Although this game was made inlate 2006, Gary's Mod seems to have not aged but become wiser and more advanced. However, this does mean that the game has quite a few glitches but that doesn't matter as most of them make the game funnier and a better experience. Pros: - Hours upon hours of gameplay - Infinite options of what to create/do - Vast amount of game types and maps - Amazing community - Player-made content - Great value for money - Easy controls - Next to everything is customisable Cons: - A few minor glitches Overall, Garry's Mod has earnt it's place as one of the top Steam games of all time. This means that I will give Garry's Mod a very well earned 10/10.

But other stuff like prop hunt is fun, though i wish I could disguise as a  and hide im your moms room. LOL, that is funny. Anyways, you should buy this game unless you dont have Counter Strike Source, cause then, your game will be purple and crap, and error will be the only word you know.

Sick of being on Singleplayer mode, why not go multiplayer online play with your friends in TTT (Trouble in Terorist Town), or GMod Tower. Also play some Prop Hunt, Murder, and tons of other fun game modes. Come join the fun with Garrys Mod

review: This game is amazing. Its fun for just making screenshots, Sandbox, or laying the variety of gamemodes. I haven't known one person in this game without atleast having 5 mods. The mods are a huge part in this. There are mods for about anything you can think of, more gamemodes, more items, exclusive DLC, and many many more. I am hopefully going to put some more hard worked hours and money into this. These games : Counter Strike : Source, Half-Life 2, DoD Source (Day of Defeat), any of these games are needed. For better experience, buy all of those games. It adds more gamemodes, and more items to mess with. GMod Tower is my favorite out of all the gamemodes. Simply, if you are in a down mood, or simply just in a SILLY MOOD. This game has so many things to experience. This game, it takes skill to master. Put a good 200+ hours or so into it, and you will know your way around things. DO NOT buy this game for the full $10. This game goes on sale alot and for a long time. $2.50 is the normal price to see it, or 1 key in any game that has anything to do with Trading, or keys, or uncrating for items. Even if someone has a copy of this game, they are usually selling it for a key, because of it being on sale so much. The highest you will see this game is 4 keys inTF2, or more. If someone sells at this price, tell them to lower it. It would just be something good. If you plan taking my suggestions or anyone elses, get ready to put countless hours and your hard earned money to donating to your favorite servers to keep them running. Sandbox, its uses are endless. I give this game a 10/10, with "Pineapple Seal Of Approval" depending on how you see it.

review: I LOVE GARRY'S MOD. There is so much to do in it. Whether you are building some contraption or playing a gamemode with your friend (or a mix of both, in some situations), it is probably one of the best games I have ever played. You can lay round with what you start with when you first install the game, trying to build something with the tools you're given, or you can go the Workshop and download a ton of props, SWEPS, Gamemodes, Tools, Scars, and more. The controls are simple and easy to learn and the stuff you can do when you overcome the basics is amazing. Although you may come across some missing textures or errors, you can buy CS:GO (Which is only like $10 or something) to fix it. I love Gmod in all its glory and splendor. 10/10 Would play again for the rest of eternity.

review: Garry's Mod is less of a game and more of an interactible physics engine with extensible scripting. Because of this, the vanilla game is only as fun as your imagination can carry you. Build a house. Build a car. Throw dynamite everywhere. Put ragdolls into sexual positions. Once you've matured enough to stop putting ragdolls in sexual positions, you'll find the amazing number of custom gamemodes available, coded by the players, for the players. First, there's Trouble in Terrorist Town. In this gamemode some of the players are assigned as "Traitors", and have to kill everyone. It's a great game, especially with cooperative players, but some random kid can get bored of his ragdolls, come one and randomly start shooting everyone (This is called RDM, or Random Deathmatch). Your enjoyment of TTT is largely dependant on the server Then there's RP. There are MANY versions of RolePlay available, but they all have the same idea. You live in a town. There are law enforcers, robbers and more, and that's really it. It's a bit like Second Life in a way, but with guns and RDM. If you can get into a good community it can be extremely fun, although that depends on your preference. If you just want to build stuff, you can join a build server. Here, people build things, just like in vanilla singleplayer. Let your imagination run wild, ask for help with some things, and make something cool. These servers are unfortunately juicy targets for RDM McSexyragdoll and his pals, so watch out. You've already noticed this, but the only thing that lets Gmod down is it's communtiy. It's attracted a horde of underage. immature squeakers who just want to troll and be "le funni". Good servers keep them away, but bad ones don't. Another thing you might want to stay away from is the Workshop. All the good things are drowned in a sea of sexual ragdolls, "epic cars" and other useless crap. The only good thing the Gmod workshop has going for it is the lack of "ADD THIS VALVE BECAUSE ITS EPIC" and "THIS IS BOB COPY PASTE HIM EVERYWHERE SO HE CAN TAKE DOWN GOOGLE +" Another thing to keep in mind is that you'll need Half-Life 2 and Counter-Strike : Source to get the best experience. Many custom gamemodes use CSS stuff, and they won't work without it. Also TF2 might be required in some servers All in all Gmod is a great game that's plagued with "trolls". Get some friends together and have fun, or find a good server. Just watch out for the kiddies trying to be cool and you'll have a nice time tl;dr : GET THIS AND CSS AND PLAY TTT WITH YOUR FRIENDS

review: This is Garry's Mod (hence the name). A game where everything's controlled by you, the player. There's countless ways to enjoy this game, be it just building things, shooting stuff, or just messing around. You are the one who decides the way the game is played. To play this game you must own one or any of the source games since it uses them to get the textures, models and whatnot. Theres's also the steam workshop (recently added for this game) which replaces the Toybox and it lets you easily download and install "addons" such as more models, weapons, maps, gamemodes, etc. So overall, if you like to mess around with friends, enjoy various game types, or just want to create things, then this game is well worth your time and you will most definitely like it.

review: Garry's mod is the best sandbox game ever created. You can do whatever you want with the insane amount of mods for it. Think of it as the game that has a bit of every game incorporated into it. Wether you want a shooter, puzzle, rpg, etc. Garry's mod has it. This game is a must have in everybodies steam library.

review: This game. I have put so many hours of my time into it mainly because of the communities I have been apart of. The actual game can get very boring. But it's the people there (besides the overall group of very annoying people/children who are very immature) that keep making me come back. I've loved most of my time in it because of them. I have met some very amazing friends who I hope I can have for a large portion of my life and yeah. 5/10 For the actual game 9/10 for the people that you can become friends with.

review: Garry's Mod is Minecraft on steroids. The users can build literally anything and put it into this game, shall they have the skill. You can download things from the steam workshop in seconds, and the things you can download are either clever and creative, funny and weird, random and silly, or stupid and pointless. The tools are hilarious from face poser to inflator. The gamemodes, such as TTT and DarkRP (I could have a review for each and every one on their own and probably take more than one read more) are so great that I would pay more than I would have to play for all the valve games for each one in it's own game. It comes with great amounts of ragdolls, props, NPC's and more. The "example", as I call them, face and finger poses are great. The only thing I can think of that would be wrong with the game is the frame rate on crappy computers such as my own. 10/10.

review: Do you like sandbox games? If so, this is for you. Don't get fooled by its appearance, this "mod" is a true sandbox where you are only limited by your imagination and ability to have fun. Build your own contraptions using a variety of objects available, do your own little diorama and fight scenes, take screenshots or even fool around with your friends, if you are that sort of people. If you already own any of the older Valve games like Half Life or Counter Strike as well as the free Team Fortress 2, load them up as well, as you can use their assets, too. Thanks to the Steam Workshop implementation, downloading mods: maps, weapons, models, tools, etc. for this game has never easier. This game also includes the fun multiplayer "minigame" known as Trouble in Terrorist Town, a fun little game based on playing police, murderers and did we forget you, oh Civilians? You would need Counterstrike Source to play that, so I recommend that you buy them as a bundle.

review: For many people this game is like few games (gamemodes) created by community packed into one game. For me only true potential of this game is sandbox, but not the vanilla one, because there's nothing to do without any modifications. At first you should take a look at Wiremod, most basic and commonly known addon.

THE GREATEST PC COOP FOOL AROUND GAME EVER!!!! would recomed that you have 8 or more friends when playing, 4 is also fun when playing specific types of gamemodes. my personal gamemodes would be TTT, prop hunt, murderer and sandbox, but there is much more to explore within the game. one of my top 10 pc games without no doubt. 10/10

review: Who is Garry and why are we playing his mod? That question won't be answered in this review instead I'm trying to take the piss out of it by saying that this game features a terrible community which is totally the game's fault. You can create your own scenarios using this but no one cares anyway because people instead play the mods in Garry's Mod. There are a lot of mods in Garry's Mod however only a handful get played. You have roleplay servers where you don't roleplay but kill as many people as possible until an Admin bans you, try to beat your personal best! We also have TTT which is deathmatch with a cop and robbers theme, very original. This game attracts wonderful people that do not sniff used pampers. 68/100

review: Garrys mod is a fun game but there is some problems with the game. First off all when your trying to download addons its just slow and glitchy. Then when you try to play the game after downloading the addon it like lags or glitches out completly and yes crashes. 2nd of all why do we need to get addons can't it be like when we first got it and its just in the q menu its so much easier. 3rd is that the admens in role play and stuff dont even do their job or get mad when someone actually puts them in jail because they broke a rule in role play. And i was watching this youtube video where there was a admin recording himself and he was just lazy. other wize this game is pretty good i guess. So i guess 6.3/10. What should i reveiw next? Maybe The Sims.

review: A great game with a huge amount of potential. Due to there being lots of gamemodes out there, this is mainly focused on the DarkRP, TTT and Hide & Seek gamemodes. I find all three interesting and just plainly fun, in all i've probaly used half of my gametime on TTT, then a good third on DarkRP and the rest on H&S. You should realy check them out as they're awesome. DarkRP if you're into roleplaying and "acting", so per say. H&S stands clearly enough. TTT can be fun at times, but also a complete mind buster if you're new to it, even experience players find it hard to keep track of everything. In total i'd say this game is worth exactly it's price. Other than a few bugs that never gets fixed it's a safe bet on lots of fun hours.

review: I have never had so much fun on a simple, sandbox game like this. This game is simply brilliant, it's relatively cheap and can keep you entertained for hours, Gmod also offers different game modes as well as sandbox to make the game even more interesting such as Prop Hunt and TTT (Trouble in Terrorist Town) If you play with your friends a lot or even on your own, then I highly recommend Gmod, there are so many different types of game modes to choose from and you can pretty much do what you want. The game overall is pretty damn good, if haven't already got this game, I'm afraid you are missing out...........a lot.

review: 9/10 Wow. If you are looking through reviews of Garry's Mod because you haven't bought it yet, I hope by the time you get to my review you decide to go ahead and purchase it. This game has a HUGE amount of things to do. Seriously. Like ponies? You can get ponies. Want to uncover traitorous activities in your town of terrorists? Help yourself, because this game has it all! Using the source engine, this game can snatch you in and before you know it you WILL most definately have hundreds of hours in this game. Honestly, I really can't sum up the randomness and spontaneousness this game has to offer. The only way to experience the explosive personality this game has is to just go ahead and purchase it yourself. Go ahead and get this game, and be prepared for the blast it will give you and your friends!

It allows creativity and the fun of just playing around with games that are mixed together like My little pony with Call of duty black ops. The choices of gamemodes are amazing like Dark roleplay or Stop it slender. Its workshop shows that the community and creativity of the members is amazing and that people will never stop supporting and creating mods for the game. My Verdict on this game is that it is Amazing and it is worth playing.~Grey Zarcovski 11/18/2014

Feel free to visit Flaming crystal which is the server I usually play on, it is a deathrun server (deathrun is a mode in which you have to get to the end of a course whilst doging the traps set off by a "death") the server has jukebox so you can choose music to put on and plenty of skins and trails. I have happily spent over a hundred hours in Gmod and I will carry on to play for a long time!

review: I LOVE GARRY'S MOD. There is so much to do in it. Whether you are building some contraption or playing a gamemode with your friend (or a mix of both, in some situations), it is probably one of the best games I have ever played. You can lay round with what you start with when you first install the game, trying to build something with the tools you're given, or you can go the Workshop and download a ton of props, SWEPS, Gamemodes, Tools, Scars, and more. The controls are simple and easy to learn and the stuff you can do when you overcome the basics is amazing. Although you may come across some missing textures or errors, you can buy CS:GO (Which is only like $10 or something) to fix it.

review: This game is fun because in TTT, someone kills you but then you kill someone and get vote kicked for RDM. WTF, that is so stewpid yo. But other stuff like prop hunt is fun, though i wish I could disguise as a  and hide im your moms room. LOL, that is funny. Anyways, you should buy this game unless you dont have Counter Strike Source, cause then, your game will be purple and crap, and error will be the only word you know.

review: This is a really great sandbox type game. You are able to create your own contraptions and bring them to life. Everything you can think of can be brought to life in this game. Sick of being on Singleplayer mode, why not go multiplayer online play with your friends in TTT (Trouble in Terorist Town), or GMod Tower. Also play some Prop Hunt, Murder, and tons of other fun game modes. Come join the fun with Garrys Mod

review: THIS IS WHAT THE GAMING COMMUNITY CAN DO IN IT'S GOLDEN FORM Please don't be fooled by what it looks like this game is brilliant with it's community pushing it, Anything can be done. Want to go back in time to germany and be Hitler himself? Well 1942 Roleplay is for you. Want to play it simple and be a Mayor? Welcome to DarkRP. Wanna be a terrorist and betray your comrades? Trouble in terrorist town. The large community lights up this game for being more than making half life 2 characters make funny faces. This game is one of the best on steam the possibilitys are endless this is the biggest sandbox game there is and the best community there is don't compare it to Minecraft this is far superior and ahead of it, Anyone who disagrees has not experienced Garry's Mod the correct way. Why are you reading this review? You know you have this in your library already and if you don't what's wrong with you? Now get off your Minecraft and your DayZ and your Dota 2 kids and explore the thousands of hours of fun this game can offer to you.

review: This game is amazing. Its fun for just making screenshots, Sandbox, or laying the variety of gamemodes. I haven't known one person in this game without atleast having 5 mods. The mods are a huge part in this. There are mods for about anything you can think of, more gamemodes, more items, exclusive DLC, and many many more. I am hopefully going to put some more hard worked hours and money into this. These games : Counter Strike : Source, Half-Life 2, DoD Source (Day of Defeat), any of these games are needed. For better experience, buy all of those games. It adds more gamemodes, and more items to mess with. GMod Tower is my favorite out of all the gamemodes. Simply, if you are in a down mood, or simply just in a SILLY MOOD. This game has so many things to experience. This game, it takes skill to master. Put a good 200+ hours or so into it, and you will know your way around things. DO NOT buy this game for the full $10. This game goes on sale alot and for a long time. $2.50 is the normal price to see it, or 1 key in any game that has anything to do with Trading, or keys, or uncrating for items. Even if someone has a copy of this game, they are usually selling it for a key, because of it being on sale so much. The highest you will see this game is 4 keys inTF2, or more. If someone sells at this price, tell them to lower it. It would just be something good. If you plan taking my suggestions or anyone elses, get ready to put countless hours and your hard earned money to donating to your favorite servers to keep them running. Sandbox, its uses are endless. I give this game a 10/10, with "Pineapple Seal Of Approval" depending on how you see it.

review: Garry's Mod, or more comonly refured to as 'Gmod', is a game that is solely for the imagination, it uses the Source engine and thanks to this we can enjoy many games inside the world of Gmod. If you enjoy having 'brain children' this is your kind of game, with its open sandbox modes on many free map packs that you can download or even create using the Steam Woorkshop. The maps box is the limits.... well some times.

review: G-mod is a creative game with different kinds of modes and DLC modes. The modes that you start with are Sandbox,and Trouble in Terrist Town. Sandbox is what the name impliys it`s a Sandbox. BUT, it has very famillyer games by Valve like...Team Fortress 2,Half Life,and Portal. And you can choose stuff from the dupes minu wich has community builds and some of them can be AWSOME and others... wat.So ya. TTT is a game mode were sombody is the traitors and their job is to kill the enimeys with out being noticed and when they kill everybody then they WIN! The freandlies job is to kill the traitors and nobody knows who is the trader and who is a freandlie so this makes for a iteresting gamemode My over all rank for this game is 7 physis guns/10 I hoped that you enjoyed my review of, Garrys Mod

review: I have played garry's mod for a very long time. Warning right now if you are going to get the game you will NEED counter strike soruce unless you want to play only singleplayer. You can still play multiplayer without css but you will have no textures and you can't even see where you are. This game combinds a lot of the soruce made games like half life series along with counterstrike soruce with some portal. This can be fun for doing endless asortment of things on sandbox like screwing around with the charecters the physics like changing the gravity to installing addons or gamemodes that have a huge effect on the game. This reminds me of minecraft in a way because minecraft once you get board of it you can just mod it to turn it more interesting. Game still has not gotten old to me and I personaly think it is the best game I have ever played so far. I highly recomend this game the only downside I can think of is when you are going on servers with a lot of addons like darkRP sometimes how they interact with your client/game can make it glitchy and cause problems. This is easy to fix usauly just some lua errors. Deffinitly have to buy this game if you are considering it. I have somewhere around 558 hours on the game.

review: If you like to use your brain a bit and create odd machines out of random scrap or if you just want to make some silly screenshots using props and characters from other Valve titles then this is the game for you. At its core, Gmod is a sandbox style game where you are given various props, characters and construction materials and you are given the tools to place and fuse them together in a variety of ways. With those tools, you can make odd contraptions and vehicles or you can just place objects and characters to make silly scenes for screenshots or videos. Want to slap some car tires on a bath tub and have a race with your buddy? No problem. Want to construct a massive robot out of refrigerators and washing machines? Possible, if difficult. It is all up to you really. However, Gmod can be as complicated as you want it to be. With extensions like wiremod and other mods you can really get in-depth with the engineering/coding and design things like automatic machine gun turrets. Some of the built-in construction materials also lend themselves to building rather complex machines and structures. Gmod also has rather good integration of the Steam Workshop and you can use it to share your own creations or to check out other player's stuff. Gmod is most assuredly a game for the creative mind to express itself in a variety of ways.

review: Garry's-Mod is a game with so mods such as: Jailbreak, Dark-RP and TTT. Those kind of games are filled of all kinds of game idias, here is an example. Dark-RP - About going into a city, finding a job, make a gang, sell drugs, arrest people, install camreas, sell cars and more.. As you can see this game is a really inpressive game. If you want to enjoy more then 20 well made gamemodes / game subjects. If you think that you ran out of mods your wrong. there are just so much mods.

review: One of the best sandbox games around, Garry's mod allows users to freely create their wildest dreams, then destroy them. The base game itself has interesting mechanics such as NPCs and the total freedom to do anything! On top of that, you have addons which have models from many favourite games, comics, books and films! You can add new textures, weapons or even an entire new world and they're all free! The servers are also decent with roleplay, murder and the famous Trouble in Terrorist Town (TTT). However, a downside is that the game ships with very few things alone and unless you own ALL the source games from Valve... well enjoy headaches from staring at pink and black squares (Missing Textures). Not so expensive, personally I was lucky enough to get it in the 75% off sale for 1.50 without knowing what I was buying. But I am now very glad I bought this amazing Game/Mod. THEN AGAIN - This game went from good and running well to Taking 2 minutes to load then crashing 5 minutes in. 7/10

review: Hello peoples (Yes I said peoples,  you). Today I shall tell you a story. A story of wonder, adventure, and a lot of young sexual content. Stick with me, its not that bad. So, one day, Mrs.Creativity was cutting her wrists because no one liked her anymore. Her sexual life was a mess, she had not been "tickled" in years. So she went for a walk, trying to decide which building she would jump of. BUT, MY CHILDREEN, Something unexpected happend! She was kidpanned by a very evil man named Garry. Garry had really weird sexual fetishes and he was a wanted man. When Mrs.Creativty woke up, she was all naked locked in a room. She looked around and she saw two men. One of them was called Imagination and he had a strange feel to him. Like if anything was possible. Then the other man had an aged look. He was called Physics and he seemed really strict. The two man ware naked and they made sweet love () to creativity, while Garry told them what to do. In the end, criativity got pregnant, and 9 months later, when she had gone to all post--stress help groups, a beautiful thing was born. Criativity called it Garry's Mod for who the  knows why. And she decided to make clones of her baby and sell him on a really dodgy company called steam. Everyone loved the clones and used them as sex toys. They are dirty cheap but they are damn good sex dols. Buy YOUR garrys mod now! It will be worth it! I promise! (Feel free to intepretate this stupid  in any way you see fit)

The makers did a magnificent job of making a SandBox game that combines the creativity of making large, magnificent things and making it so it can be distributed to other creative players looking for inspiration. From it's wide variety of gamemodes to it's amazing Mod community, it just go's to show that people can truly do anything and everything and put it in one game.

review: I've played over 300 hours of this game!! It is a very easy setup with clear ideas. The game is very popular among a few youtubers. (VenturianTale)... This game involves lots of different ideas, one example being that users can make things called addons. When you go to the Garry's Mod Workshop you can see all the cool and popular builds... The addons are downloaded within 30 seconds top. Then when you start up your game, it's already completely downloaded and ready for your liking. Also the multiplayer setup for users and their friends are very easy to make... Within 1 minute you can have 20 friends on one server!! It is truly amazing, when you get used to the game, you really understand life... I can guarantee that you will have lots of fun. Thank you for reading! Have a good day! -Dinoworld12

I won't go in depth on what the game modes are about, but I will list A few more. One of the other modes is murder, and another is DarkRP. Sandbox is a game mode where you can do whaat ever you want, and on sandbox if you have the correct addons you want, you have endless or infinte possibilities. the only way to not have endless possibilites is lack of imagination, so it is really fun and that will conclude this review.

You can add the addons fast and easy. Eventhough the multiplayer is a bit slow (for me and alot of my friends) i'd still give this game 9/10, and highly suggest it!

This game is simply brilliant, it's relatively cheap and can keep you entertained for hours, Gmod also offers different game modes as well as sandbox to make the game even more interesting such as Prop Hunt and TTT (Trouble in Terrorist Town) If you play with your friends a lot or even on your own, then I highly recommend Gmod, there are so many different types of game modes to choose from and you can pretty much do what you want. The game overall is pretty damn good, if haven't already got this game, I'm afraid you are missing out...........a lot.

review: This game is literally everything I ever dreamed of. You can do anything, anywhere, on any planet, in any world, in any universe, with anyone, anything, and anywhoknowswhat. If you are one of those guys that just loves screwed up stuff, and loves a great laugh, this game is all you ever need. Infinite amounts of weapons, NPC's, Maps, Gamemodes and Vehicles. The ONLY downside to this game, is that whenever you want to join a server, you have to wait for about 20 mins to join. But beside that, by GOD it is a great game, and I highly recommend it to anyone interested!!! -Koopa

review: OVERALL: 67% Gameplay & Controls: 4/5 s Graphics & Visuals: 3/5 s Music & Audio: 3/5 s Part of Garry's Mod's lasting popularity stems from just how many things you can do with it. The number of game modes available is absolutely astounding, even more so when you realize that all of them were created by members of the community. It's an incredibly vibrant game, and if time has proven anything, it's that its players are capable of just about anything. -Gameplay & Controls- Your experience will change from server to server, depending on game mode, but among the most popular modes are Murder, Prop Hunt, and Trouble in Terrorist Town  or TTT, as it is affectionately referred to by its many fans. The first plays out more or less like a virtual game of Clue, while the second is a bout of hide and seek where those who are hiding can transform themselves into a copy of one of various items hidden around the map. TTT, meanwhile, is similar to Murder except everyone has weapons to defend themselves, and players cooperate to attempt to inform each other who the traitor is in their midst. Other game modes can range from a full-on clone of DayZ to human battleship, a testament to players ingenuity. The only thing stopping me from giving the gameplay of Garrys Mod a five is the same aspect which can make playing it so much fun: the community. While many members are quite engaging and friendly, there are always some others out there determined to ruin the experience of everyone else they play with. Whether through hacking their client or harassing other players, this small minority can easily wreck whatever game mode you happen to be playing, and good luck trying to get an admin on to do anything about it. -Graphics & Visuals- Garrys Mod runs on Valves decaying source engine, and, while powerful, its age is becoming increasingly apparent. The visuals dont necessarily detract from the experience to be had, and some players have made an effort to introduce custom player models and textures, some of which look quite nice. Again, however, the engine itself is dated, so please be aware of that before you play. Something else of note is that this game cant really be run unless you have a Valve-made source engine game installed in your library. This is because, as the name suggests, Garrys Mod is in fact one giant mod that pulls all of its textures and resources from other games. There are (illegal) ways around this, but the truth is that unless you get the necessary files on your system one way or another, youre going to be missing the majority of the games textures. Which is Valves way of saying pony up the extra cash, unless you enjoy everything in alternating shades of black and pink. -Music & Audio- Most of the tracks and sounds in the game are supplied by source, though other songs are supplemented through Garrys Mods ever-expanding Workshop. Most of these end up collectively as taunts in game modes such as Prop Hunt, and they honestly make up the greatest part of the experience. However, sounds such as those are often limited to certain game modes, with others being almost silent except for the sounds of your fellow players mics, which is rather unfortunate given all of the sound effects that have been added to the game over the years. -Final Thoughts- Honestly, its a good game, especially when youre playing with friends. It can really be a lot of fun, and its always something to do if you dont have anything else to do. The sheer amount of game modes is perhaps the greatest selling point, though considering the fact that you have to own a source game in order to properly play, I really dont think its worth $9.99. Itll often go on sale around the holidays for a fraction of that price, so if you happen to see it drop below $5.00 I would definitely pick it up if you get the chance. Just beware of the trolls hiding in the communitys crevices.

review: I have played garry's mod for a very long time. Warning right now if you are going to get the game you will NEED counter strike soruce unless you want to play only singleplayer. You can still play multiplayer without css but you will have no textures and you can't even see where you are. This game combinds a lot of the soruce made games like half life series along with counterstrike soruce with some portal. This can be fun for doing endless asortment of things on sandbox like screwing around with the charecters the physics like changing the gravity to installing addons or gamemodes that have a huge effect on the game. This reminds me of minecraft in a way because minecraft once you get board of it you can just mod it to turn it more interesting. Game still has not gotten old to me and I personaly think it is the best game I have ever played so far. I highly recomend this game the only downside I can think of is when you are going on servers with a lot of addons like darkRP sometimes how they interact with your client/game can make it glitchy and cause problems. This is easy to fix usauly just some lua errors. Deffinitly have to buy this game if you are considering it. I have somewhere around 558 hours on the game.

review: How do you review this? This is Garry`s mod, and the game can be whatever you like. As the game`s titel states the game is about modding and chainging whatever you fell like, this game has no rules and no boundires, you can do whatever you like. Let`s talk a bit more specific. You can put down any item person or ragdoll, from games like half life, Team Fortress 2, Counter Strike and more, from there you can make these item`s do whatever you want to, put them togehter animate them, make new mecanics, and so on. Whatever you choose to do, you can always film it, or make an item and put it out so the public can use it. There has also been build mods to Garrys`s mod, there have been quit pupular, such as Trouble in Teorist Town, and Prop Hunt, but many more mods and idears are out there, and maybe you can even make your own. This game is a game you want to play, if you have friends that you want to be a bit random with, or if you are creativ so you can make great items. This game is a fenominom, and everybody has either heard of it, or have the game. How can I not give this game a thumps up? It has everything! 7 out of 10

Sandbox+Sex=cash. so for anyone look to get cash into your paypal make a sex-rp server. My even going to help by giving you names G-, Thirteen life or Garry's  pounders 13. now you may be asking were does the cash come from well... models like a anthropomorphic animal (to get the yiff fans like myself),all MLP characters and Vocaloid characters (also put holo the wise wolf for me :).) If you make them pay $1 for each character you make and have like 50peps thats like  of cash. The only peps who are going to join this are people who want to do this , thus less trolls. 3) Do not buy this game for the Single player.

review: Garry's Mod is a great game with many fun things to do. You'll probably start out by playing the singleplayer sandbox mode and gradually move onto other gamemodes such as Trouble in Terrorist Town, which in my opinion is one of the best. When buying Garry's Mod, consider getting the bundle that contains Counter-Strike: Source, as it's used for many textures and models in gamemodes other than sandbox. My personal rating is 10/10.

review: Garry's Mod is a sandbox game where a player can basically to anything they want. That's right, anything. A player can spawn NPCs, build creations, design weapons, create enviroments, or just do what you want. This game is prepared for a majority of what the community of this game has in store for it, so it can take a lot of big things. However, it is prone to crashing (exiting the game without you doing it) unexpectedly. But one the bright side, this game allows players to have fun doing whatever the heck they want to do. One can position ragdolls in funny positions will comedic faces. Or one can go up against a zombie horde and try to survive with a certain loadout of guns. The possibilities are about endless! Now, if one gets bored of doing anything they want or is just not into positioning ragdolls, there is another way to having fun with this game. There are gamemodes out there in Garry's Mod that people can play with other people in a fun (and sometimes intense) server. One gamemode is called Trouble in Terrorist Town (TTT). In this game mode, there are a cartain amount of innocent terrorists in a certain map. Now, in this band of innocents are traitors. The traitor's mission: Eliminate all the innocents. The innocent's mission: Eliminate the terrorists. Seems simple, right? Well, not really. No one knows who the traitors migh be. It could be anyone, it could even be the player itself! No one knows at first...until the chaos begins. You see, the traitors have some weapons that the innocents don't have at first, such as a knife, silent pistol, traitor sniper, C4, or a jihad (suicide bomb). The traitors will stop at nothing to kill the innocents and win the round. One might be walking with it's friend, looking for the traitors, when BAM, you're killed by your friend, who just happens to be the traitor. No two rounds of TTT are never the same, with different people being traitors and different ways of ending up dead. TTT is just one of the many different gamemodes of Garry's Mod. There are so many gamemodes out there that this review would be too long for people to read. I haven't experienced even near close to the full amount of randomness that Garry's Mod has to offer. Which is why I fully recommend this game.

review: Although it is a "mod", Garry's Mod feels like a stand alone game as it just uses basic resources of CS:S, HL2 and TF2. With a sandbox single player and an exciting multiplayer, you will never get bored of playing this. It is a stable game, but feels as if it is always in Beta as lag and long loading times will occur with any pc system you use, but you can get used to that. Some times crashes but all in all still a great game. Make sure you purchase CS:S with it and if you don't, you can download the textures it uses anyway for free. 8.8/10 Needs to be a bit more stable. Would Recommend.

review: "Lonely game" -> that's what I think about this "game" -> Is it really game? Of course not, its a multipurpose game, where you can do everything, build, drive vehicles, play multiplayer with other players (TTT,CW,DarkRP, Sandbox, Prophunt, ...), theres really lot of servers where you can see lot of fun. Also you can make and share your stuff via Workshop (R.I.P. Toybox), same as download them and enjoy them, like new Non-Player Characters, Weapons, Vehicles, and other stuff here. This game is not fun with Singleplayer, you can spent here over 1 hour and then you get bored, but if you have friends who can play with you its really fun. Also this game is development tool, whinch you create custom entities,wepons, vehicles and lot of stuff, where you using LUA(Jit) scripting language, to play with game engine. You can make here machinima as well. (After SFM release, rip GMOD) There's a lots of tool and stuff here, thats, why I calling this game multipurpose.

review: Probably the best Source Engine Sandbox you can find. Offers lots of ways to experiment with the engine's physics, allows people to learn and understand how the engine works and it's pretty much the only game where people can create anything imaginable. With the appropriated addons such as Wiremod or SProps or ACF, a lot of building related tool addons, people are able to learn to build replicas of existing vehicles, to simulate realistic physics, to simulate aerodynamics, create their own games (I myself have a hologram-designed chess in GMod.) or, as seen on many youtube videos, create animation videos with ragdolls. I only have to warn about the majority of the Sandbox community. Don't expect most of the people being mature, calm and firm. They are far from that. The rather small building/coding-community however, is the exact opposite of what people nowadays see running around on GMod servers. GMod basically is the place where you can create bikes, cars, planes, boats, jets, helicopters, quadro/hexa/octa-copters, pixel-artworks by aligning tons of cubes, spend your time on Lua because GMod's workshop offers three major lua sandboxes (Expression 2 in Wiremod, Expression Advanced 2 on Github, Starfall on Github). If anyone wishes to see some impressions, people are free to visit my friends Jackpody, Rucamad, Damianu on YouTube, visit the Wiremod forum or look for servers where builders can be found on.

review: best building game ever! you can do sandbox or ttt (the game's games).what can you play that is NOT the game's game,that is what is called,gamemodes.the most played gamemode i think is darkrp.you can modufiy sandbox with addons.the most cilcked addon is wires mod.some peaple make gmod movies but more peaple jest do photo shop instead.alot of gamemodes need two or more player to start like zombie survival,in zombie survival one player playes as a zombie and 1 other player playes as a person.the person go hiding,blocking or attacking.the zombie,attack.if you are thinking that "i sot you sed this is a building game NOT a game/game/game/game!". the building part of the game is in sandbox and that is the game's mane and the first gamemode for my that makes it a building game.i sey you shoed play this game so you know all the stuff that comes out of this game.(p.s all my friend have garry's mod XD).

review: It's filled with people who think they're geniuses, children who think they're original, a majority of the people think they're comedy gold, a whole lot more strive to kill anything above them, and even more of them just want to enjoy the game, but can't because of the previously mentioned people. The problem with Gmod is that there's no unifying base behind it, so the community is left to create their own game, the result is modern day Gmod, at the end of it's life, about to completely fizz out, on life support by the veterans who are determined to see it through to the end. I'd still reccomend this game to anyone who wants to build stuff of  around with coding and modeling, just don't get into really involved stuff like HL2RP, it'll cause you more drama then one person should ever have to endure.

review: A great game overall. There's literrally nothing you cannot do.. Except fix the errors and missing textures (legally) without spending 20$ for CS:S. I made the mistake of not buying it with the game, thinking it wouldn't matter if there were a few missing textures... I was so wrong. TTT maps are mostly missing textures, any map with cs_ before it is full of errors and missing textures. But if you get CS:S with it, it looks great, and sandbox almost always is fun. Overall, I recommend it if you can pay the 30$ for both games. Oh, and 95/100.

The formatting and the ease in finding servers are other positive attributes. But, my very favorite aspects to gmod are the community and communication with other players. Whenever I play, I look forward most to talking to friends and having a great time!

review: There is no way that you can truly dislike Garry's Mod. Since the game is mostly based off of the Steam Workshop, it can be whatever you make of it. The possibilities are endless in GMod, so I highly suggest this game. Like every game though, the somewhat childish community is the only negative.

review: Garry's mod... Oh Garry's mod. You are the most played game in my steam library, the best Valve game I have ever played (sorry half life and portal fans), and your addons give you litteraly endless possibilities to make my day. Garry's mod, made by Valve itself, is seriously the most addictive game I have ever played. The combination of the thousands of free addons and the huge range of gametypes makes this a game you will never get bored of. Even the variety in the servers within the game types makes the game a new, enjoyable experience every time you load it up. Garry's mod also suits any kind of gamer, whether you are a casual player with 10 hours on record or a die hard gamer with thousands of hours on dota 2. This half life 2 mod does, however come with some bad points. The crashes are somewhat annoying especially as the can be so frequent. The bugs can also sometimes be annoying but on the most part are actually quite funny. All in all it is the games originality, outstanding replayability and its overall incredibly fun gameplay have made me award it a 9/10

review: Such a good game. If you have ever felt the need for escapism then its here in Garry's mod. With such a proud and dedicated mod community its hard to find something bad in this game because you can do a lot in Garry's mod. Also with online functions the game really shines in its multiplayer modes such as Trouble in terroist Town and Prop Hunt, playing these with your friends is a blast and really enjoyable when you are trying to find something new to do. So yeah, this game is definitely worth its price, although I reccomend the Counter Strike Source pack as that allows you to use its features a lot better.

review: Garry's Mod is a sandbox game where a player can basically to anything they want. That's right, anything. A player can spawn NPCs, build creations, design weapons, create enviroments, or just do what you want. This game is prepared for a majority of what the community of this game has in store for it, so it can take a lot of big things. However, it is prone to crashing (exiting the game without you doing it) unexpectedly. But one the bright side, this game allows players to have fun doing whatever the heck they want to do. One can position ragdolls in funny positions will comedic faces. Or one can go up against a zombie horde and try to survive with a certain loadout of guns. The possibilities are about endless! Now, if one gets bored of doing anything they want or is just not into positioning ragdolls, there is another way to having fun with this game. There are gamemodes out there in Garry's Mod that people can play with other people in a fun (and sometimes intense) server. One gamemode is called Trouble in Terrorist Town (TTT). In this game mode, there are a cartain amount of innocent terrorists in a certain map. Now, in this band of innocents are traitors. The traitor's mission: Eliminate all the innocents. The innocent's mission: Eliminate the terrorists. Seems simple, right? Well, not really. No one knows who the traitors migh be. It could be anyone, it could even be the player itself! No one knows at first...until the chaos begins. You see, the traitors have some weapons that the innocents don't have at first, such as a knife, silent pistol, traitor sniper, C4, or a jihad (suicide bomb). The traitors will stop at nothing to kill the innocents and win the round. One might be walking with it's friend, looking for the traitors, when BAM, you're killed by your friend, who just happens to be the traitor. No two rounds of TTT are never the same, with different people being traitors and different ways of ending up dead. TTT is just one of the many different gamemodes of Garry's Mod. There are so many gamemodes out there that this review would be too long for people to read. I haven't experienced even near close to the full amount of randomness that Garry's Mod has to offer. Which is why I fully recommend this game.

Alos, Sandbox isn't the only gamemode, there is a wide variey of gamemodes ranging from TTT (Troouble in Terrorist Town) to Hunger Games. I'd reccomend getting TF2 and CS;Source before buying this game as it bring in a lot of new resources to GMod. Overall, this is game i fantastic. ****

review: To be honest one of the funniest games on steam, it's funny ,great game and such a good deal, The game does not have any objectives really. The game consists of making maps and objects at your disposal, this game gives you the props from source games to then make you own wacky inventions and so on. The game is full of servers that you can play, for example there is a cinema server where you can watch YouTube videos on the big screen with 30 other people! another is Death Race, this is a game mode is where you must reach the end without dying, pretty self explanatory really. If you have done your research you can probably tell that allot of videos are made using Garry's mode, well you right, allot of funny videos have been uploaded and made using the Garry's mod record system that makes it easy to understand. recommend 10/10

review: One of the best sandbox games around, Garry's mod allows users to freely create their wildest dreams, then destroy them. The base game itself has interesting mechanics such as NPCs and the total freedom to do anything! On top of that, you have addons which have models from many favourite games, comics, books and films! You can add new textures, weapons or even an entire new world and they're all free! The servers are also decent with roleplay, murder and the famous Trouble in Terrorist Town (TTT). However, a downside is that the game ships with very few things alone and unless you own ALL the source games from Valve... well enjoy headaches from staring at pink and black squares (Missing Textures). Not so expensive, personally I was lucky enough to get it in the 75% off sale for 1.50 without knowing what I was buying. But I am now very glad I bought this amazing Game/Mod. THEN AGAIN - This game went from good and running well to Taking 2 minutes to load then crashing 5 minutes in. 7/10

Sandbox is mainly where one uses creativity to build and goof around for entertainment. TTT is where one uses deception and detective skills to win the game. Then there's Prop Hunt where the Hunters must find and eliminate the Props who are hiding, taking Hide and Seek to the next level. And so much more game modes to explore!

Just add some thrusters and your dreams come true. Garry's Mod also has a wide selection of multiplayer gametypes also; Some famous ones are TTT, Murder, Prop Hunt, Hide and Seek and many others.

review: Garry's mod takes off where halflife 2 ended. You play as the cool guy named Garryman and you have to shoot at everything. Probably the best part about this game is the storyline. Garymans wife was stollen and he has to saver her. I wont spoilps the rest of it though. Garryman is the best game since Obama so if you have the 10$ you should probably not get it. butts/10

review: You. Need. This. Game. There are countless gamemodes and sandbox addons, you're guaranteed to have fun. Especially with games. TTT (Trouble in Terrorist Town) is one of the best game modes. You just need to find a good server that doesn't have 12 year old admins. I recommend City Mayhem's TTT servers.

review: This is one of the best sandboxs out there due to its wide range on creativity in this game. You can build cars and buidlings or play it like an fps. Please note that this game is screwed without counter strike source so i recommend you get the package. Please also nite the more vaulve games you have, like portal half life improves your compatibilaty with online game servers. I give this 9.5/10

review: Garry's mod is one of the best sandbox/community driven games on PC and possible in Gaming. If you are going to buy this, you should buy CS:S with it since many game modes use those textures in it. Sandbox mode is nice, you can do many things in that but many people also love to play on game modes, I would recommend TTT as a nice game mode if you find a good server but the sky is the limit in Gmod gamemodes(actaully it is the engine but eh). There are so many things to be said about this game and this review would go on for pages if you were to explain every single custom gamemode that is on garry's mod and you will get you 10/5/2.5 euro or whatever the price is out of it since there is constantly new content developed on servers. 9/10, a great game with a good community if you know where to look.

review: Garrys Mod is one of the best sandbox games currently out on PC. There are no other games like it, once you start playing and find a game mode that you like then you will never stop playing.

review: Garry's Mod is a Sandbox game based on Half life 2's source engine. The game's content is mostly player made, including the gamemodes you can play, the models, weapons, textures and other script-based entities written in Lua. Examples for popular gamemodes: 1. Sandbox Creatvity is the only limit here, build giant houses, warmashines, spaceships or even complexer stuff out of models and constraints and for the advanced builder out of simulated chips that allow you to create little programms. for example a flying spaceship, a minigame. 2. Trouble in Terorist Town The players are devided in two groups: the innocent and the traitors. the traitors have to silently murder the innocents, while the innocents have to follow clues they find on victims found by a detective with special tools like a dna scanner, which is a player aswell. It's like playing werewulf or cobs and robbers, just online and with more action. 3. Prophunt The players are in two groups: the props and the hunters. The props can turn into any prop they find and must hide in maps like cs_office or custom maps while the hunter searches for the prop and has to kill it to win. 4. DarkRP It's a roleplay gamemode for multiple players, where you can be a cop, citizen or even a major. Start a gundealer carreer if you like.

But it was the first time a had seen or even played Gmod 13. The new spawn menu and all the other new things they added. Now by far to me it's the best game ever. Now I only play sandbox because of the things I create. But this game is ment for anyone and with all of the other gamemodes other than sandbox you can do anything. So I would recommend this game to anyone out there. Ps. You can spawn melons

review: One of the must have games on Steam. There are alot of addons and gamemodes to play and the game never gets repetetive. But to get the full experience of the game you need Counter Strike:Source. Everyone likes this game or else they should burn in hell, because this game is a masterpiece and there is no other game like it. In my opinion it's better than GTA V and it's one of my favorite games to play.

You can build all kinds of things ranging from flying cans to Giant Super Destruction Bears using the tools provided! Your imagination is the key to sandbox! On the other hand, there are a number of amazingly fun multiplayer servers with game modes like Prop Hunt, Trouble in Terrorist Town, and many more! Pick up this game while it's on sale, while it's on regular price or whatever works for you! The game is great fun and you will not get bored with it! And if you don't buy it....

review: I do recommend Garrys Mod. Out of all the hours I have played this game, not once could I reject this game for anything else. The concept, well, there is no concept. Just build! Or if you get tired and wanna just hang around, play some DarkRP, where you can grow weed, sell it for money, and raid people's bases. There are always new things coming out, new friends to meet, and new exciting things to do! This game is on sale a lot, and does require lots of games to see most of the textures on lots of custom maps. So, go to .era.ee and get CS:S stuff, HL2 EP 1 & 2, and download TF2 from Steam. Just get it. Its really worth it.

review: Many people go into Garry's Mod thinking it is the pinnacle of customization. It's not, it is a buggy mess that is very poorly coded. This may be true, but Garry's Mod is still a great customizable adventure, with hundreds of different mods, and a large community of many people. There are a lot of great features, and a lot of bad ones (Official games like Trouble in Terrorist town are great). The community is made up of a large fanbase of either A. children. B. Members of a Fandom. or C. Mature intellectuals. I recommend Garry's Mod, but I don't think it is the greatest game/mod for customization ever.

review: I never thought I would like to play this as a primary game, but after playing a little bit I realised it is far more than just a building game, that people make ragdolls go crazy or twist their faces around. I host a "Trouble in Terrorist Town" server on Garry's Mod and I love it! The game starts up and it randomly selects 25% of the players to become traitors, and their mission is to kill the innocent players. It keeps you on edge and forces you to logically deduce who the traitors are and who you need to kill in order to survive. There are also Role Playing gamemodes that you can drive a car around and live a crazy life. Garry's Mod has the potential to play anything: BHop, TTT, RolPlaying, Prophunt, Jailbreak. Basically anything that people can think up. It is an extremely moddable game.

review: Fairy's Mod, The Unrelenting Force of bugs. This game has alot of bugs and lags on Online servers, which I hate.. I will put GOOD Points and BAD about this. Good: -Classic Graphics -Alot of Addons and things to do -Interesting Items -Nice movement [easy] -Okay Controls -Nice Ragdolls -Nice Mods [Prop hunt, cinema...] Bad: -Glitchy -Laggy -Glitchy Multiplayer -Buggy Multiplayer -Servers take forever to load -When first time joining the game, if you have 30+ addons/mods, It will take you 1h to install all them so you can use them. -Only 2 default maps -No legs [Lol] -Buggy Ragdolls [sometimes] -Some Controls not working -Sometimes items' menu not showing up As you can see, there is much more Bad things about this game, but still, I recommend this, since I have 40+ hours on this, Have fun! :)) Rate: 10/10

review: Meh..best marketed thing on Steam. Gotta hand it to the developers though. Making millions off the Steam Workshop and Valve for their marketing prowess with this game. If you don't feel like reading a bunch of BS about how to use this MOD, then don't bother buying it. You're just pissing away money on something you don't understand, and didn't look into before you bought it. Don't buy it just becaue EVERYONE else owns it. They only own it because Valve has marketed the ever loving s*** out of it and everyone just bought it at some point because you can't go anywhere without seeing it on sale. Don't forget to buy the other 15 gmaes you need to play most of the crap on here to sling racist terms around with 12 year olds and throw turds around. :)

review: Honestly this game is a must have if you would call yourself a PC player over a console player. It is just a game everyone has as it is... well... Garry's Mod! It continues to always be updated with new gamemods and items, and there is a ton of variety on the several hundreds of servers per gamemod. I don't like saying something is a "MUST BUY" because it just seems cheasy and fake, but honestly I would find it surprising to find a single person who playes on this platform that dosen't have Garry's Mod. If you want any cons the only ones I could think of is the dumb way the originized server browsing where servers are constantly jumping around. I suppose maybe the graphics is another con, but honestly no one plays this for graphics. They play this for the originality.

review: game, totally worth the money spent (if not a little underpriced). Its sandbox mode is pretty cool, because of all the gameplay possibilities (even making movies... wow). Also has tons of gamemodes on the workshop, thus it never gets boring. The only con is that some gamemodes and maps require having counter-strike's source installed, or else your whole gameplay gets messed up, with missing textures, etc.

review: This game I've played for years & I still do, I paly Mostly RP & Sandbox But great time waster when you're feeling bored Sometimes may be a bit buggy But At the end of the day It's money well spent. Only Issues I've always hated Is the fact you've got to get certain games for the textures etc, It should really be put in rather Us wasting a bit more money on other games to get the textures. But overall 9/10

review: This Game is a must have, it's what started my steam collection. There's like 100 diffrent gamemodes, and there is more still coming. There are also mods, add ons, and countless hours of fun with you friends. There is millions of maps, from professional creators, to amatuer creators, to the creators of the game. There is one downside, which is you need a source game to play some of the maps, or at least to see some of the textures, a game that fixes almost all of that is Counter Strike: Source, which fixes about everything, but it's also a fun game! So all of that put together i say its a great deal for it to be 10$, and is totally worth it.

review: Garry's Mod, Published by QuickScope Studios, is an RPG, FPS game. You play as John Hardwood, a man travelled back in time by his physics teacher to face his greatest enemy, 'Faze Clan'. You journey through endless maps, ranging from an open jungle - to a snow mountain. The story is set in a western theme, with cowboys and indians chasing you through the landscape. The Qui2CkScope Engine runs this game very nicely, with clean, hardcore 3D polygon models for a bit of eye candy while playing only makes the game that much better. The real gameplay flys in when you reach the alpha stage - also known as the Trickshot 420 Stage. The stage involves you trying to hit a 750 noscope double tap yy to semtex cancel 420 snoop lion blaze shot, when there standing infront of you, Faze Clan. The ending was quite thought out and well done, with you finally taking the last hit and teabagging the Faze clan. Overall a must have for any hardcore noscopers out there! - 10/10

review: It's basically everything you could possibly want in a game. For $10. Just make sure you buy the CS:S + Garry's Mod Bundle to get them both at a discount (since Counter-Strike: Source is required for most things). Also get Half-Life 2 and the Episodes, because those are required for a lot of stuff too. Anyways, buy it as soon as you can. Or wait till it goes on sale for $4 during one of the Steam sales (but that's basically highway robbery). Either way, well worth the money. This game has nearly everything you could think of on its workshop, not to mention various other sites where you can find even more addons. My only complaint is that this game is somewhat poorly optimized for Macs (imagine waiting 1 hour to get into a normal server and then crashing upon loading in). And my Mac works fine with every other Source game I own, with super quick loading speeds and everything, so it's a problem on the game's end. Fortunately, there are some things you can do to make it run faster, like verifying the integrity of the game cache and uninstalling and fully deleting old addons. Anyways, 9/10.

review: Garrys mod is a game where you cant lose and cant win. You can play singleplayer and fly around in a jungle or just load up Flatgrass and build stuff. Also, You can play multiplayer servers. On multi player you can choose between 112 Gamemoeds and over 1 million servers!

review: This is no game. Anyone who argues to the contrary is not actualy thinking.. this is an experiment. it is a show. it is a picture. it is a game. it is a movie. it is a simulation. it is whatever you want it to be, but its not just a game. look at my hours on this. i have cried playing this. i have died laughing. literaly, i have died laughing. Garry didnt make this, he started this. This was made by everyone. everyone who made they're own little bit. i have yet to meet the man garry, for some reason... but i still love him for entertaining me for weeks on end. i had spent 2 days on my computer with only the occasional break to go to the restroom or eat/drink. yes i recommend this, but its no game. if anything, its art.

review: "DUS GIAME IS DU AWSSSEEOM3 SRYSLY BR0" -RandomForumsWebsite ^That was the short answer^ For people who already know about this game, read this: But really, this game is awesome. I play this game on a daily basis and I really enjoy it. With fun gamemodes and multiplayer, this game is unbeatable, no game can be better than this. The popular gamemodes like JailBreak and DarkRP, or even CW:HL2RP (If you're wild) are the ones I play, and personally recommend. For people who are about to get it or just getting started, read this: If you don't have this game, BUY IT NOW, it is awesome. But if you already have this game and just getting started, I recommend playing multiplayer and simple gamemodes like TTT or Prophunt, those are ones I started out with. Then when you are used to the controls and used to everything and want to start exploring, try maybe JailBreak (I recommend LifePunch JailBreak), or even CW:HL2RP (again, if you're wild). Keep playing and exploring new gamemodes and have fun. I know this is more of like a guide, but I tried my best. Thanks for reading, Karim

review: What do you want to do? Don't bother thinking, just blurt it out. Right, I don't even know what you just half-said half-slurred at your computer screen just now, but I bet you $10 you can do it in this game. Speaking of $10 that's how much this games costs. Funny how that works. Wait wait, hold on to your  - you own Episode 2? You got EP2  in here. Portal 1? Portal . Ever played TF2? It's in here. HL2?  you don't even need to own that one, it's in here. Got a favorite Sourcemod? Most of the popular ones are available to use in here. Now don't let go of those  yet. That's not everything you can possibly have. I'd rattle it all off but I'm convinced that the list would take up a whole gigabyte of Steam's server space. Yes. A whole gigabyte. Of plain text. That's a lot of . GOD DAMN IT YOU LET GO OF YOUR BOOBS DIDN'T YOU. I didn't even get to the part about how the community is constantly making more, ...as well as the fact that there are umpteen gazillion tools PRIMARILY for MAKING YOUR OWN DAMN  INGAME.

review: I admire Gmod couse its One of the Best sandbox Games there is ! In gmod you can do alot of fun things in multiplayer with your friends or just have rest from them by playing some fun offline maps or being creative and building whatever you like. You can play alot of cool gamemode like: 1942 RolePlay Dark RolePlay SandBox TTT Murderer Hide&Seak And More. I have 0nly good experience from this game and I think Everyone should have this one [And its super cheap!] Think of this You buy Minecraft for 20$ and all you get is some multiplayer with no voice chat and simple building an surviving its fun but its not the cool exeperience you will get from Gmod where you can Voice chat / RolePlay /Survive zombie apocalipses / Murder some folks / Have a pirate war / Build a pirate ship / Build ... I Could continue all Day just writing down this list. Also there is a workshop feature to this game and it supports all ''Valve'' Games ! You will need Conter-Strike source to get the full experience from the game but you can allways use workshop to fix this by downloading css content packs ! In overall I think this game is Amazing and everyone should have it and it would be the perfect present from some gamers !

review: Garry's Mod is the craziest stuff you can get from Valve . Just try to think : What game allows you to create rideable toilet that can even fly and kill zombies or other players ? What game developer can say that they created game,that have another games inside ? You can play Sandbox,Troubles in Terrorist Town,Pirate Ship Wars,Base Wars and many others ! Even better thing is,when you can enjoy Garry's Mod with your friends.You can create your stuff or share stuff,that other people created ! Not interrested yet ? OK,let's mention some,but definetly not all things,that you can also do in Garry's Mod. You can fight with players or aggressive NPCs.Fight alone or with friends!Make your own server and enjoy online parties,pvp fights and even more !Create some crazy stuff,others will like it.Show your imagination to everyone.Surprise them with huge machines you make,forts,house,TVs.Secure your house with cameras,kill every intruders . Garry's Mod is game without limits . Tired of Alyx ? Shot her in her head with a rocket ! Want to spawn almost everything from every game that Valveand other developers developed ? Garry's Mod is right choice .. What are you waiting for ? GO and GET IT ! *Fun guaranteed.

review: As a player for around 23 hours of playing at the time of this post, I would so far recommend this video game to those in possetion of at least a decent computer. I suffer from a few crashes here and there, although, on the other hand, I have a lot of enjoyment before they take place. The gamemodes are interesting, the gameplay varies from them, there are tonnes of maps to play on and a whole community for you to share this fun with! Rated 4/5.

review: Been playing Gmod since the beta days. A great way to burn off some steam. Loads of fun really. Imagine being able to use any and all props from any game you have installed. Load counterstrike: source or team fortress 2 maps. Multiple weapons, characters, & more! It was well worth ten dollars. I've had as much fun on Gmod as I have at a teen dance night. BUY IT!!

review: Very good game. Flexible, fun, and simple enough to settle down in a special community that you might stumble upon in the game. It might seem bare at first, but that is where the "Mod" comes in. It lets you swap and add in new things for you to toy with, and the modding community seems to have no end in creating wonderful ideas to play around in.

review: garrys mod is pretty undescribeable but ill do my best its basically a game in which you are given the ability to entertain yourself any way you wish and the beuty of it is that if something you want isnt in the game you can make it i have spent hours (as it shows above) on this game and can definately say it has what alot of games dont. the players full imagination as the driving force to play the game.

review: This game is a great physics-sandbox game made by the mind of the intellectual Garry Newman. Here's some things that you should know. To start off as a noob at this game, it doesn't look like much. It's just a bunch of props on a menu. But WAIT. There's this thing called the Steam Workshop where you can download all kinds of awesome crap. 100 or more mods + GMOD = One of the best games of all time. You can seriously have a lot of fun in this game. You can mess around with ragdoll people and do whatever what comes in your mind to them. There is also NPCs. They're EXTREMELY fun to mess around with, but don't mess with the wrong ones *cough* Metro Police *cough.* If you find some gibs on the Steam Store, get it. It will add an extra-gory mess to your ragdolls and NPCs, which makes it 100x more fun. Three great maps for first-timers are gm_apartmentcomplex, Freespace 13, and gm_tornadovillage. In gm_apartmentcomplex, you can just go running around in a realistic apartment, either robbing people or causing a massive siege with NPCs. The only downside to it is that the map is relatively small, and you can't really drive or fly that much. In Freespace 13, the name says it all. In gm_tornadovillage, it is just OUT OF THIS WORLD fun. It has a large open map, and not only can you commit drive-bys and blast away destructible homes, you can chase tornadoes while you are at it with the cars add-on SCars. I guarantee you, it will provide you hours of fun, but you need a somewhat good computer to play it, otherwise there will be LOTS of lag. Three great add-ons for first timers are M9K weapons, SGMcars/TDMcars, and SCars. The M9K weapons are your basic weapons. However, if you get all the packs, you can have the ultimate server battle or the ultimate standoff with the Metro Police! With the SGMcars/TDMcars, you will be AMAZED at what these guys did! The cars have the ultimate graphics, and basically, they're from the same engine source. However, they are not good with the tornado maps because they have a LOT of weight on them. Last but not least, there is the SCars. They are cool, reliable, and fast. They are perfect for any medium-sized to large-sized map, if it is roam-able. They are the PERFECT add-on if you want to be a GMOD Tornado Chaser. Unfortuantely, they are a tad too light, so it will be easy for a GMOD tornado to pick up your car. Otherwise, the SCars are the way to go. In conclusion, this game has endless possibilities. This game is perfect for anyone, and in MY opinion, I think EVERYONE should get it. If you don't get it, you're missing out BIG TIME. So fork out only $9, and go and play one of the most critically acclaimed Indie games of ALL TIME. Believe me, you'll be glued to this game every day! 9.8/10, 97/100

Everytime there is something completely new and fun to do, you can join multiplayer servers, which is a blast! Or you could also host your own GarysMod server for free, like a do. You can install hundreds of thousands of mods for this game, no joke, or you can make your own with a little time! If I had to give this game a rating I would give it a solid 10/10 for sure. I think i found the love of my life!

review: Well, It's about time I sat down and wrote a review. Garry's mod is a game that is all about playing online and all the creative user made game modes! Or you can download the mods you want, set up a single player game, and make your own story. Such as place about 100 zombies in a building, rush in with an assault rifle, and try not to die. There is no story mode in garry's mod so if thats what your looking for in a game, this is not for you. Also Garry's mod is not perfect, it often crashes and has alot of bugs. It has moments where your sitting there laughing and dying, and others where your ripping your hair out trying to get somthing to work. The other bad part about this game is that alot of those fun game modes need other games to work. Most common is counter strike and half life, but others include buying games like day of defeat and left 4 dead. I have played almost 1300 hours of this game and love it! I give this game a solid 8/10 Its not perfect but it is amazingly fun!

There's always new content in the forms of addons and even new gamemodes (different unique games that differ from the base sandbox entirely), and thousands of different servers to try them all out on. Some people say it's a dieing game, but it's growing everyday, and new things just seem to show up weekly.

review: This is possibly one of THE most creative yet destructive games I have ever played. When it comes to multiplayer, you and your friends can do anything! From taking on a horde of combine soldiers, to leisurely relaxing and building something of your imagination. BUT! This game does not only have sandbox mode, it has plenty of others, all of which are very exciting. Trouble in Terrorist Town is a game where you use your wits, skills, or your weapon to kill the traitor or the innocents. Prop hunt is personally my favorite in Garry's mod, you can disguise yourself as a prop in the map, and the "hunters" will have to find you. But be careful, you only have 30-25 seconds to hide. There are plenty of other things to do in Garry's mod, but I am afraid if I list them all, I can waste your time explaining it to you when you can be playing it! Consider getting Garry's mod. -Alucard Hellsing approves of this game and message-

review: This game is Amazing. There's hundreds of gamemodes and you never get tired of one gamemode.I am disapointed in one thingh though, without Counter Strike Force, the games almost useless. Almost ever model involes Counter Strike unfortunatley, so if you plan on getting the lengendary G-Mod, then be sure to buy the Package of Counter Stike Force + Garry's Mod.

review: Sandbox game with a ton of stuff to do, especially with the creativity from the modding community, it can become a mess around game, or a serious battle, or even a co-op building game to build the best ship and fight other people.

review: It's a really great game! :) I highly approve it for people who prefer sandbox games, or games that you can alter/modify. Sure, I recommend this game because I have a bias. But, hey! That's what that little button's for. I really enjoy this game because of the other modes, and the multiplayer mode. I also admire that you can download High QUality mods, and they still turn out that way. It goes the same way if you have a lower quality model. I really recommend this game for people starting out on Steam, or starting out with any genre of games as well. Have fun! See you in game! <3 AnimalGalaxy

review: Garry's Mod is a sandbox game. You have a wide variety of props from various Source games (depending on which you own), and multiple tools at your disposal. With these, you can build different contraptions, make vehicles, construct buildings, etc. As well as all the content included in the game, you can find a ton of mods online via the game's website or Steam Workshop. You can also make/script your own. But the fun doesn't stop there. Multiplayer is a totally different thing entirely. You can find sandbox servers and build with up to hundreds of other players, or you could dive into one of the many user created game modes. From Hide and Seek to Role Playing, there is a huge variety of unique modes to play. A few I would recommend are: Trouble in Terrorist Town. A group of 'innocent' terrorists must work with the detective(s) to discover who the traitors are and kill them. The traitors must take out the innocents, preferably without alerting anyone else. No one knows who is innocent and who is not, making for a sometimes tense experience. Morbus. A group of humans must hold out for a certain amount of time against aliens, or kill them all. There are two types of aliens: Brood aliens, and Swarm aliens. The Brood aliens get upgrades, and can transform into humans. Allowing them to get into groups and pick off people one by one. The Swarm aliens are what players spawn as when they die (assuming they were killed by another Swarm alien, or human). These have a melee and ranged attack, but no upgrades. Their role is to weaken the humans, and try to kill them. The humans have needs. Every now and then you will have to either sleep, eat, shower, or pee. You cannot move during this time, so must be wary of those around you, in case they are brood aliens. Overall one of the best game modes. A ton of fun, especially with friends. DarkRP. DarkRP is one of the more casual RP modes in Gmod. You spawn into the map as a citizen, and can choose a job to play as. From drug dealers to civil protection, there is a wide variety of roles to pick. You can go around earning money, commit crimes, buy and furnish your own house, etc. Great if you find the more serious RP servers to be boring. Overall the game is absolutely brilliant. One of the very few that I can keep going back to and not get bored. I purchased the game around 2-3 days ago for 1.99euro, and have since put almost 24 hours into it. One of the best purchases I have ever made.

review: Its a great game, there's so much to do and you'll never get bored. Its pretty cheap too, so its amazing for its price. There's hours of content in the workshop and already in-game content that can have you hooked for hours. There are many game modes to try out and you'll just fall in love with one of the game modes. Some of these game modes just never get boring, kinda weird actually..but awesome at the same time! This game is waaayyy more fun playing with friends, but its just as great messing around in sandbox by yourself. If you like to experiment and mess around. Definitely try out sandbox first, there's loads of workshop content and in-game content to mess around with as i said before. Even if you don't like that sort of stuff, there's still some fun and exciting game-modes to play, such as TTT and Prop hunt. Its a must buy, and you dont have a reason not too. Its cheap, fun and exciting! I hope you guys come to your senses and buy this game since its probably one of the best games on steam. 10/10

review: Garry's Mod is one of those games perfect for a specific audience. Although Garrys Mod is also a extremely modable game allowing the game to expand to people with different interests. Garrys Mod simply started off as a sandbox for people who love goofing around like most sandbox games. But like most good games to date the modding community took over creating quite the load of mods ranging from simple and fun addons to entire gamemodes which completely changed the game. For example on garrys mod you can do the usual sandbox and just play around or you can explore the vast majority of gamemodes that range from roleplaying servers to terrorists killing eachother. Without the modifications of the modding community to date this game wouldn't be impressive at all but with the power of modding community this game is extremely fun and time consuming, It never gets boring due to the extensive gamemodes each one reviving the game and only giving you more to do. This game is one of my favorite games on steam 10/10

IT isn't always sandbox cause there is always gamemodes made for unique gameplay, basicly several games in one!

review: I bought this game to play Prop Hunt, but I became addicted to Trouble In Terrorist Town. The communities are fantastic, on the whole, and they make you feel welcome. All in all, a great online multiplayer experience. Counter Strike Source is recommended too, for extra textures and content. I have yet to play with the actual Sandbox properly, but I will leave that to the pros. I am having too much fun with what's already out there.

Pros: - Many gamemodes to play online (Prophunt, Murder, TTT, and many more!) - Great community workshop that has many mods from your favorite games - Easy menu with a search bar for your props and such - Very cheap for the price, especially on sales (2.49 - 4.99) - Can build anything you want and adjust their physics - Face Posing and Noclip!! Cons - Doesn't come with required textures from CS for some gamemodes like Prophunt (though you can find them online) - Sometimes crashes such as freezes or just closes the whole game out while loading in servers or changing maps You definitely get what you pay for and I have had a lot of fun with this game :D

review: This is actually a pretty good game. You can mess around with random objects on random game maps, or even play some Prop Hunt or Trouble In Terrorist Town. :) But to load the maps correctly, you're gonna need some source engine games such as: TF2, L4D2, HL2, CS:S, and Portal (most importantly CS:S) in order to play Prop Hunt or other mods or you'll have errors around the whole map (you can still play tho). In sandbox mode (messing around with items), you can always load the map. 8/10

Also Gamemodes like Trouble In Terroist Town, Prop Hunt and many others makes the game what it is. The freedom you have on this game also makes it surprising fun and lets you have a great time with friends. I would suggest this game for anyone with and gaming ability! Definatly worth the price too!!! Enjoy :) xx

review: If you're one of those people who are more like casual gamers and LOVE messing around and creating random things, this game is for you. Lots of derping and no goals, and there are even many custom, fanmade gamemodes available if you get bored. The game, obviously, allows for massive mod support, allowing you to use almost anything from whatever popular show, game, etc. in the game as long as it is in the workshop and is up-to-date with the latest version of the game. You can, for example, fly planes and helicopters, drive Need for Speed cars, interact with scripted (re-worked) NPCs like a Pikachu, and so on. One thing to note about this game though, the community sucks . Interacting with it can give many headaches. Most of the Gmod players are kids, so be prepared to mute players (IF the server lets you, which is another small let down).

review: Garry's Mod is one of, if not THE, best game I've ever played. It has one of the best communities I've ever seen in a game and pretty much where-ever you go you'll find friendly people. The amount of variety and things you can do with this game is unlimited as the gamemodes in multi-player range from Roleplay to Deathmatch to Hunting to Survival to whatever! Even if you just enjoy a game for it's single player, being a sandbox game, you can do literally whatever you want and if you take a few minutes to browse the workshop for addons then you're guaranteed to have a 200% better time. TL:DR You can launch exploding babies from a rocket launcher. 11/10.

review: Garry's Mod has to be the best game ever. At just $10.00, you have a variety of gamemodes consisting of Trouble in Terrorist Town, DarkRP, Jailbreak, Deathrun, DayZ, Prophunt, Murder, Minigames, and many more! There are many unique players that play this game, as well as many chances to become a moderator/admin on your favorite server, if you live up to the expectations! Create a base and go out to mug people and steal, or build a gun shop with guards defending it! Sell drugs and illegal guns, or be a SWAT and bust into the criminal's house to put him behind bars! I currently have spent well over two years on this amazing game! I recommend it to anyone and everyone! Give me a friend request, and we'll play together!

review: I don't really know where to begin with Gmod. At it's core, it's nothing more than a sandbox to play in, no goals or points or leveling up. Just a gravity gun and an arsenal of crazy crap to spawn in. The interface feels a bit clunky to me, it took a while to learn even the most basic menu navigation keys, but once you get the hang of how to work your way around, you'll realize that the user generated content for this "game" is astronomical both in quality and quantity. I absolutely love Trouble in Terrorist Town and Prop Hunters. I'd reccoment picking up Garry's Mod just for those two game modes :D

review: Would rate 1000000000/10. Very satisfying sandbox mode, along with a game where, along with others, you play a very werewolf like trust game, a game where you can pick up cans, cars, computers, and even a cow and turn into them, and many other literally endless gamemodes to enjoy.

review: Garry's Mod is a very creative and fun game. I find it different from any game really. Garry's Mod Vanilla lets you build contraptions and structures out of props from Valve liscensed games. And for people who think that isn't enough, there are about 50+ gamemodes to choose from, and who knows how many addons and duplications there are to download from the Steam Workshop. Garry's Mod, in my opinion is very good game, only contridicted by the occasional squeaker noobs that mic spam.
game-hours: 108.1
review: Do you own Garry's Mod? If the answer is no, then what are you waiting for? 5.99 will get you much more than just a silly sandbox tool for messing around with HL2's props and ragdolls. Garry's Mod is much more than that. Garry's Mod is a hub for a vast number of games. Buying Garry's Mod, you don't just get Garry's Mod. You get Pirate Wars, you get Trouble in Terrorist Town, you get DarkRP. You can't really go wrong with the silly sandbox either.

review: The amount of hours I've played speak for themselves, but I have to still say this: Gmod has something to enjoy for everyone. You may have to spend a bit of time looking for it, but it's there. The biggest downside to this game besides the bronies, is that you must own Half Life 2, both episodes, TF2 and Counter Strike Source in order to get the full experience and see the content used on most servers. But really, is that a downside? Who doesn't own those games?

game-hours: 2559.7
review: The best and most realistic 3D sandbox I know so far. Source engine provides quite realistic physics (not enough for a simulator, though), which when combined with the tools in GMod and many addons available for it, give you a huge ammount of possibilities- from making a car, boat, plane or a spaceship with oxygen, energy and fuel limitations, to a working cannon, radar, hologran, or even a primitive computer. You can program microchips by a simplified C-like language or wire several sensors, buttons and gates together. And you can enhance your contraptions with these things to make your very own sentry turret, autonomous drones, alarm system etc. Perfect for understanding how computer-stuff or programming works! However, the physics usually spaz and lag on complex contraptions, no matter how strong your computer is. Keep in mind that this is a HL2 mod, and in HL2 you pretty much can't find even 2 boxes welded together and to make a huge spaceship, you can probably say good bye to destroyability, walking around on-flight or realistic weight-management. Maps are also quite limited in this, it's enough for police chases or heli fights but definitely not good for jets or for simulating a B737 flight (you wouldn't even takeoff probably). And the complexity and diversity of this game also means that there are some bugs and performance issues, however the community is big enough to help you with pretty much everything (on Steam or Facepunch forums) GMod is not only about building and doing aimless things. It gets way more funny when you invite friends and do some deathmatches, derby races or just mess around together- a perfect Friday afternoon time-waster! But what I wanted to say is that it has many gamemodes, such as TTT (Gaben's most favorite game), Roleplay, Zombie Survival where you can even nail props together to barricade yourself, Prop Hunt, ZMod, Stalker, Sledbuild, Slender and many other things which you can freely get from the workshop when you get bored by one and want to play something else. So if you love playing around with physics, building cars, submarines, trains, planes or other vehicles, programming complex things which doesn't waste several kilometers of free space like in Minecraft, doing funny poses and taking screenshots or making in-game movies, arresting some bad guys, playing a survival, shooting zombies/terrorists or just to crap your pants with friends on horror maps, then GMod is a game for you (if you have enough time to learn all this of course).

review: Everyone should own this. You would be a r3tard not to. It isnt just some silly sandbox game where you put models into silly poses, it includes FULL differnet gamemodes that make it worth it.

review: Ah, Garry's Mod. What else can be said about this beauty of a game that hasn't already been said before? Whoever had the idea to take Half Life, Team Fortress 2, and every other Valve Source-based game and packing it into a cheap little package is one brilliant guy. This game offers an endless amount of playtime, given the vast amount of gamemodes. Hell, you could get hundreds of hours out of a single mode. Don't feel like building crazy stuff in sandbox? Then hop on over to Trouble in Terrorist Town. Had enough of murdering your fellow terrorists? Prop hunt's always a blast to play. The community is where this game shines, creating some truly amazing addons to the game. If you don't have this game already, get it. I guarentee you won't be disappointed.

review: Garry's Mod (GMod) is quite a fun little indie sim, that requires you to do nothing and allows you to do anything! A love this game to bits and the community is pretty nice also. My only complaint: This game is pretty much useless without a Source game like Half-Life 2 (Ep 1 and 2) or Counter-Strike:Source. But other than that, I would recommend this game to anyone who is bored of the mind-numbing money grabbing games and just wants to have fun!

review: A must have for those who just need something they can make by themself, so they can make an epic battle the way they want it, or make a weird contraption. Make a picture of a Rebel Vs. Combine fight, or make a picture that will make anyone go "WTF LOL!". The best part? if you get bored with what gMod has to provide, vist the workshop and get some new addons for endless entertainment, because there is an addon for everything. If you get bored making things by youself, play with friends, or enjoy one of the many multiplayer gamemodes gMod has to offer. The possiblities are endless, and thats why I give gMod a 10/10 rating. It's worth it.

review: One of the best sandbox games ever. The amount of mods is simply astonishing, and I wouldn't even think twice about getting certain mods. On the performance front it isn't as good however, it can be very annyoing on slower computers, and even the more powerful ones are sometimes having problems. 8/10, purely because of performance issues.

If The Answer is yes but you have not played Garry's mod, You should se a pyschologist. Anyway, This game is a sandbox modification of Half Life 2, designed to....well, you design it! You define what is logical, practical, or physically possible. With props from most source games used to define your world, This game is limitless. If You love designing, user friendly programming, or just beating everything senseless with a ragdoll this game is for you!

review: This game is literally the only reason Half Life is selling any ing copies as of right now. And, honestly? It's worth it. If you love sandbox games, and this and Half Life 2 are on sale, just buy the darn game, along with Counter Strike: Source. You will not regret it, when your game is free of purple and black error text. This game is the game for those who are bored, you will ALWAYS find something to do here. Whether it's building, Prop Hunt, Zombie Survival, or the famed Trouble in Terrorist Town (TTT), you will eventually find your places here, and use it for many years to come, as I and MILLIONS of other users have. Enjoy. :^)

review: Garry's Mod is an incredibly fun game, the amount of possiblities are endless, akin to the popular game series, Scribblenauts. This game has an already fully equipped arsenal of goodies to enjoy, as well as downloading player-made addons. Garry's Mod seems to be built off other Valve games; you should learn to expect long loading times and errors. The general gameplay is easy and smooth, despite the severe lagtime for slower computers. I have fully enjoyed this game and I think you, the reader, would enjoy this as well.

Garry's Mod can go from being Slenderman and killing a bunch of Dr. Breens running around with cameras to being a zombie and infecting an entire team of camping Gmen.

review: Basically, if you want a game that involves all sort of sillyness, death, laughs, and just plain goofy gaming, but this. There are so many game modes (and always more coming into existence) that you never have to be bored. If you enjoyed Minecraft, Roblox, or legos, you will like sandbox. If you ever played that game "Mafia" as a kid, prepare to love Trouble In Terrorist Town. If you think you are a hide and seek master, play some prop hunt. Not to mention, it often goes on sale! Hope you love it. -jacbo44

Want to ride a bathtub on wheels? You can do that. Because in Garry's mod, there is no limit to what you can do. If you want something to happen- make it happen. There's just some assembly required, and that's your job.

review: Its almost  how much fun you can have on this game. There is just so much to do in the land of Garrys mod, it is insane. From making a robot out of melons to building a bath tub car to show off to your friends. From building some kind of worthless contraption to convincing everyone youre innocent and quite literally stabbing them in the back. From settling down and getting a job and an apartment on a role playing server to becoming a drug lord and running a gang to notoriously rebel against the police. From building snowmen to impress the ladies to- Ahem. I think you get what I mean. There is a lot of weird stuff to do on this game, and it is a lot of fun. So many mods and different kinds of things to try, Its a pretty awesome sandbox of opportunity and awesomeness.

review: "I'm happy knowing my hypothesis of Steam users being functionally autistic is accurate." Positive highlights of my great time spent on Garry's Mod: -Getting two children banned from a DarkRP server -Killing everyone innocent and traitor in TTT without evidence and stating over the mic "I had DNA." -Killing off a HL2RP community that circlejerks over eachother with their dark and edgy characters/usernames -Dealing with admins with superiority complexes -Hearing the cries and lamentations of children as I RDM them senselessly -Building "Outer Toll Gayt Heaven" in conjunction with a fellow friend -Meeting new friends and restablishing old friendships with those who know how to have fun -Roleplaying as a white supremacist -Roleplaying as an abusive cop -Becoming a space marine and having everyone laugh at your toned upper body -Becoming a whale hunter -Learning how to be a better father Cons: -Admins -Community -Screaming children -DarkRP -Trouble in Terrorist Town -Half-Life 2 RP -Waiting two months to join a server -Bronies -Furries -Stoners -Youtube celebrities turning this game into more of a daycare -Friends becoming addicted to Garry's Mod 5/10. It's okay. The community and lack of new gamemodes really make this unreplayable after a while.

review: What can i say about garrys mod? Well it's the kind of game that you find yourself putting in countless hours of your life into. This game is very fun but if you wish to play multiplayer like TTT, or prophunt you also need other games like Counter Strike: Source, Portal , and Half Life to get all of the textures to play. So if your wondering about buying it you should i give this game a 10/10 by far.

review: I'm not going to say this is the best game I've ever played, but this is one of the best games I've ever played. Aside from brutally amazing destruction and gore games which also have a plot and even sometimes multiplayer, this game is amazingly fun alone, if you like, or with friends and strangers. It's major variety of game modes and its friendly interfaces and idea of building upon itself with other games is superiorly amazing. I suggest you buy, it's not too expensive and pretty easy to use. Also, I suggest buying the games it supports for its addons, and their DLC. This game gets a 10/10 for me even with less graphics than expected, it's ability to change what it is in all cases makes up for anything, even glitches(which can be funny as heck anyway, except for when you get stuck.) Kudos to the creators.

I myself have spent far too much time laughing, exploring, and goofing around playing the game, and the many gamemodes that go with it.

Wether just in the sandbox fooling around, or trying to figure out who is the traitor among you, This game will have you hooked like a fish. Although I must throw in a disclaimer as well. If you don't have Counter Strike: Source in your list of purchased games, then you will find yourself staring at a map convered in a checkered patter and objects showing up as an error sign. NOT FUN. But I would still play this game true or not.

review: One of the best sandbox games I have ever played. This game was a success when it first came out and I'm not surprised at all. The only problem is that it causes me alot of viruses on my laptop and crashes my system. Only one downside with this game, everything else is just pitch perfect. I realised a couple of days ago that it also teaches you programming when it comes to scripting. One of the best Indie games I have ever played. Thanks, Valve! Eddy Nolan

review: If you are looking for a multiplayer game with game modes and possibilities you cant find anywhere else, this is the game for you. Garry's Mod is the one of the only games that is simple and easy, yet keeps you wanting to play. From your first traitor win in Trouble in Terrorist Town, to your first death kill in Death run, youll continue to come back. Strongly recommend.

review: Garry's Mod is been started since 2005. Now update after update. It became Gorgeous. Even More. Even some more that I can ever imagine. With the workshop, its a whole lotta better. Its a better, cheaper version than Minecraft. I have not much words to say. Final Verdict - +Garry looks good +Workshop makes it whole lotta better +Cheaper and better version of Minecraft -Please don't sue me Joe.

review: Garry's Mod (GM) is a virtual world developed by Linden Lab launched on June 23, 2003, and is accessible on the Internet. A free client program called the Viewer enables its users, called Residents, to interact with each other through avatars. Residents can explore, meet other residents, socialize, participate in individual and group activities, and create and trade virtual property and services with one another, or travel throughout the world (which residents refer to as "the grid"). Garry's Mod is for people aged 16 and over.

review: Where to even start? Garry's Mod really has to be my favorite game on Steam. Garry's Mod offers a variety of user built game modes that any player can really find anything to enjoy. You may prefer jailbreak while others prefer trouble in terrorist town or prop hunt. For player wise, you can find something that you will enjoy. For developers this game uses lua coding engine so you can make your own custom scripts for your server or for others. Garry's Mod really is an amazing game, if you don't own it, GET IT NOW!

review: garry's mod is a sandbox game where there is no linear path. really there isnt anything specific you have to do, you can do whatever and the multiple game modes for multiplayer make it more then that. you can do sandbox and just build random stuff, or you can play TTT and compete to find who is going to murder everyone, or you can play jailbreak which is basically alot like jailbreak servers on counter strike. the possibilities are litterally endless, and with steam workshop support you can not only add even more extra stuff to the game, but you can even see what your friends have made too, and this game never ends at this point with so many new gamemodes, playermodels, weapons, character skins, npc's, and so much more. i definitely say garrys mod is worth the 10 dollars you pay, and is worth by CS source to use part of it which is about 25$ which i can safely say that this game is worth.

review: Garry's mod has to be the best mod of all time. The things you can do are countless. I've put more time into this game than I'm proud of. If you are wondering if it's any good, get it. If you really want it, get it. If you can't afford it, commit suicide and hope you can play it in whatever your equivalent of heaven is. I strongly recommend you GET Half Life 2/CS:S before buying this, or you will have little to no textures. Everything will be errors or random colors. When you get bored, install mods. When you get bored of those mods, go on a server and play one of the countless game modes like TTT, Murder, Prop Hunt, and lots of other great game modes. And you can blow stuff up. 10/10

On the performance front it isn't as good however, it can be very annyoing on slower computers, and even the more powerful ones are sometimes having problems. 8/10, purely because of performance issues.

review: Garry's Mod is an incredibly fun game, the amount of possiblities are endless, akin to the popular game series, Scribblenauts. This game has an already fully equipped arsenal of goodies to enjoy, as well as downloading player-made addons. Garry's Mod seems to be built off other Valve games; you should learn to expect long loading times and errors. The general gameplay is easy and smooth, despite the severe lagtime for slower computers. I have fully enjoyed this game and I think you, the reader, would enjoy this as well.

review: I'm not going to say this is the best game I've ever played, but this is one of the best games I've ever played. Aside from brutally amazing destruction and gore games which also have a plot and even sometimes multiplayer, this game is amazingly fun alone, if you like, or with friends and strangers. It's major variety of game modes and its friendly interfaces and idea of building upon itself with other games is superiorly amazing. I suggest you buy, it's not too expensive and pretty easy to use. Also, I suggest buying the games it supports for its addons, and their DLC. This game gets a 10/10 for me even with less graphics than expected, it's ability to change what it is in all cases makes up for anything, even glitches(which can be funny as heck anyway, except for when you get stuck.) Kudos to the creators.

review: For a game with almost no goals, the possiblities are only limited to your mind (and Garry's Mod's capacity to work). I myself have spent far too much time laughing, exploring, and goofing around playing the game, and the many gamemodes that go with it. Even if your not interested in the particular gamemodes, sandbox mode still is a great feature to play around with. Great game, funny people, win win situation with CS:S

review: This game is a highly addictive gaem to play around with. Wether just in the sandbox fooling around, or trying to figure out who is the traitor among you, This game will have you hooked like a fish. Although I must throw in a disclaimer as well. If you don't have Counter Strike: Source in your list of purchased games, then you will find yourself staring at a map convered in a checkered patter and objects showing up as an error sign. NOT FUN. But I would still play this game true or not.

review: I think this game is great. It has all the fun ragdoll physics of the Source engine and a bunch of wacky stuff you can do. All Source games add content to Garry's Mod and even if you don't have any Source games, you can download tons of content off of the Workshop. I love this game.

review: If you're one of those people who are more like casual gamers and LOVE messing around and creating random things, this game is for you. Lots of derping and no goals, and there are even many custom, fanmade gamemodes available if you get bored. The game, obviously, allows for massive mod support, allowing you to use almost anything from whatever popular show, game, etc. in the game as long as it is in the workshop and is up-to-date with the latest version of the game. You can, for example, fly planes and helicopters, drive Need for Speed cars, interact with scripted (re-worked) NPCs like a Pikachu, and so on. One thing to note about this game though, the community sucks . Interacting with it can give many headaches. Most of the Gmod players are kids, so be prepared to mute players (IF the server lets you, which is another small let down).

Load counterstrike: source or team fortress 2 maps. Multiple weapons, characters, & more! It was well worth ten dollars. I've had as much fun on Gmod as I have at a teen dance night. BUY IT!!

review: Very good game. Flexible, fun, and simple enough to settle down in a special community that you might stumble upon in the game. It might seem bare at first, but that is where the "Mod" comes in.

review: Ah, Garry's Mod. What else can be said about this beauty of a game that hasn't already been said before? Whoever had the idea to take Half Life, Team Fortress 2, and every other Valve Source-based game and packing it into a cheap little package is one brilliant guy. This game offers an endless amount of playtime, given the vast amount of gamemodes. Hell, you could get hundreds of hours out of a single mode. Don't feel like building crazy stuff in sandbox? Then hop on over to Trouble in Terrorist Town. Had enough of murdering your fellow terrorists? Prop hunt's always a blast to play. The community is where this game shines, creating some truly amazing addons to the game. If you don't have this game already, get it. I guarentee you won't be disappointed.

You can even do a pixel game in this gmod game, I recommand you getting counterstrike source with it cause you need textures/props. I've playin this game for 1829 hours, and im continueing! It has million gamemodes, the best one i like is TTT, DarkRP. Darkrp is Realstic Roleplay, I hope you saw this review helpful, thanks for taking your time to see this =)

review: A funny, friendly (in some places) game. With the most famous part of the game, Sandbox, making your own scenarios with the models from CS, TF2 and Half Life 2, or choose which one's you like from the workshop. Not to forget all the brilliant gamemodes like Trouble in Terroist Town, GMoD Tower and many many more. GMoD is that game you will always come back too. Even with some annoyances and bugs, it gets a 9/10 from me. A best buy (don't sue me) for any fun steam players. Good one Garry.

review: I've been playing GMod 9.0.4 from 2006 and Gmod 10 from 2008. That's effectively 8 years of playing Garry's Mod. ...and I don't see myself stopping anytime soon. All I do is build trains, I get bored but then I carry on and have fun with others; the game just never seems to get old in the end...and I've not even started to explore the gamemodes properly yet. I really should. With that; TTT is great, one of the best gamemodes I've ever seen. You'll have the tough traitors and detectives and smart players, but in the end...traitors gonna trait. Prop Hunt is almost as good, with a few tweaks to the GUI it would be perfect like TTT. Sandbox, same as ever. Build your stuff, and mess around with it. Pirate Ship Wars, fairly buggy but with a dedicated team to refine it, it would arguably rival TTT. It unfortunately isn't really worked on (the gamemode itself), thus boats, GUI, and animations can get a little glitchy. But otherwise a fun gamemode.

There are so many things you're able to do, including building your imagination, and creating everything you like. I love the game-modes that are available for players to play, for example: DarkRP, or TTT. For everything there's a addon, and that's also one the things that keep Garry's mod so interesting, and so fun to play.

review: Garrys mod is a game where you can do any thing up to youre imagination. Garrys mod is a sandbox game where you can spawn charecters from youre favourite Valve games or diffrent games in general. You can build stuff and do stuff if youre bored. Apart of the awesome singelplayer theres also an Multiplayer mode thats even more awesome. It adds awesome modes like Trouble in terrorist town, Prop Hunt, Slender, Murderer and tons more to name. There are some minor things. First of all this game has a steep learning curve you will have to learn the hard way and then of course the infamous texture problems which some times annoys the living hell out of me. But overall the game is amazing and if you dont own it by now buy it immiadetly. I give Garrys Mod a 9/10

The guys who made theese are genius with working phisycs mechanics and customizabile everything deserves the nuber one sanbox game spot. If you didint buy this game allready go sell some lemonade and buy it. It's a ton of fun and I found myself playing this for 3 days straight without break . Its got multiplayer wich is ADDICTING and I really mean it. When you start playing Dark RP or Trouble in Terrorist Town  gets real. Come on just give Garry a cookie. Well im not telling you to buy it but : BUY IT IT'S WORTH IT! BUY IT IT'S WORTH IT! BUY IT IT'S WORTH IT! BUY IT IT'S WORTH IT!

review: Ever experienced a game with over 100 different mods with hundreds and even thousands of people playing? Garry's Mod, also commonly referred to as Gmod has many different modifications with one of the largest growing steam community workshops out there full of fantastic creations made by the community, for the community. Now you may think that this is just another game like minecraft but I can guarentee this isn't, it doesn't have the best community out there but somewhere in the crowd there are always people willing to help out and have fun! The game itself is a 1st person styled game which can only really be described as... 'interesting' this game is built up from the community and not so much from the developers, so you can obviously tell it has a large input from what people want instead of what the developers want instead. With hundreds of different modifications out there full of people playing, you'll never get bored of what may be in-store the next time you start up this game. And if this simple review isn't good enough for you, maybe the different picture everytime you start up Garry's Mod (Gmod) may interest you.

review: Garry's Mod is a good game, even if you're not good at the construction. I personally enjoy exploring the servers created by others and seeing what they have innovated. You may want to consider buying the Counter Strike: Source package, because even though both are great games in my opinion, there is no doubt that CS:S will provide a full online gaming experience.

review: No game can exactly compare to Gmod. It is incredible. You can do so much and it is so fun. Whether you are sandboxing or playing Trouble in Terrorist Town, you will have lots of fun. This game has many pros. For starters, the incredible physics engine of Source combined with a sandbox game makes for some fun times. This game can be used for making animations, by spawning in ragdolls and positioning them where you want, and finally snapping a picture. You also get a lot for your $10 worth. Not only do you get sandbox (which is fun in itself) but you also have other games by the modding community build for Garry's Mod. These are games such as Stop it Slender, Trouble in Terrorist Town, Murder, Prop Hunt and many more. However, this game isn't perfect. This game has a few minor cons that are worth talking about. Firstly, if this is your first Steam purchase, or your first Source game purchase, you may run into a few problems. See, you need to buy a Source engine game. While that wasn't an issue for me (I personally got Steam for Portal once, now I use it much more) others may find themselves not being able to play GMod. Secondly, many of the games require Counter-Strike: Source. This was a problem for me, because I didn't want to pay $20 for CSS. I was able to get the textures off the internet (legally!) and mod my game so this was fixed, however many users may not want to do this. Finally, when you first play this game, you may have no idea what it is exactly, and just play Sandbox, which can get very boring. There's no guide or help to tell you there's anything else to do. To summerise, GMod is a great game that will keep getting better as it is updated and as the community of modders and other Workshop creators alike grows. However, because of some minor issues, this game deserves an 8.3 out of 10. I recommend this game, and you should definately buy it.

review: If i had to choose a word to describe this game it would be amazing.Although there is no legitimate goal to the game it is nice to screw around with friends and people you dont even know.There is so much to do and so much more with the addons you can install.The downfall to this game is that you have to get other Source games to get more gaming content.I understand that but its just kinda annoying when most of the addons in Garry's mod requires other games like Half Life:2 Episode 2,Counter Strike Source,Counter Strike:Global Offensive,and on some occasions Day of Defeat:Source.Even with those drawbacks Garry's mod is a game that I would play at least once a day.

review: Garry's Mod is a game to play when your feeling sad or down, Its really nice to play it when you have Valve games installed, its nice to pose things and make things, like a flying car, a giant roller coaster, just about anything you can think, you can take screenshots to show off your skills or put something on the workshop to share with other people! Its also fun to play the multiplayer when your tired of singleplayer, in multiplayer, you can play with friends, play the gamemodes that people make, Or just mess around in the spawn menu! You can also make really funny poses and spawn in really silly stuff. Installing addons in the workshop is really nice if your making very professinal scenes or poses. Garry's Mod also has a really fun community with some very intresting achivements. If you would like to earn them. Remember! Your imagination... Is the limit!

review: While Garry's Mod is one of the most fun games I've ever played. The gamemodes is where all the fun is. From Trouble in Terrorist Town to Darkrp. There are so many things to do even if you get bored with the base game. In my opinion it get's a 10/10

review: This game is the sandbox game of all games. You can make literally whatever you can imagine, with the right tools that is. There are a host of online servers with various gamemodes that you can try out, such as Deathrun, DarkRP, CityRP, Trouble in Terrorist Town. LIterally no two servers are the same! Ranging from a ton of various, custom content to try and make theirs stand out, so it's really just up to you to find one with a good community!

review: Probably one of the best PC games of all time, forget those default modes, like CTF or Free for all, this game, right here it the king of game modes. Although when buying this game, I recommend buying other valve games like CS:S, Half life 2 and TF2, just so your games is smooth without any graphical errors. This game is fun and addicting, I've played over 1000 hours on this game, and I'm still going. 10/10

review: What is Garry's Mod exactly? It's not exactly a game since there is almost no objective. That is the beauty of Garry's Mod. Garry's Mod is what the title says it is. A mod. It allows players to create anything and do anything. The sky is the limit. Pros - Garry's Mod is a sandbox game. You can create anything and do anything. Garry's Mod's graphics are based off of Half-Life 2 and is okay for a sandbox game. I find the time passing by whenever I play Trouble in Terrorist Town or Prop Hunt. Garry's Mod is highly suggested to buy and play with you and your friends. Cons - Sometimes, the audio chat might be a bit overwhelming and irritating. However, there is an option to mute the annoying people. The lack of music really makes the game feel... empty. As you play with yourself, you hear nothing. You can turn on your radio and listen to your own music. Overall, Garry's Mod is addicting and really fun to play. The minor cons are easy to fix. Now, I have carefully calculated everything such as graphics, gameplay, lasting appeal, music, and sound. I came to a total of 9/10 which just explodes to you saying "Great game and HIGHLY recommended to buy".

review: Garry's Mod is an interesting tool that uses many different mechanics and is unlike any other sandbox game i played before but if you play with friend the fun continues with many different gmes modes such as Sandbox, Trouble in Terrorist Town, Zombie Survival and more. The game has another interesting factor such as downloading various games on steam and using them on Gmod like Team Fortress 2, Counter Strike and lots of other games as well.

review: If you are planning to purchase or recieve this game, then you should kiss the next few years of your life away! In Garry's Mod, you can pretty much do whatever you want! There are tons of mini games such as Trouble In Terrorist Town, Murder, etc. Garry's Mod is hands down the best sandbox game I have EVER played! At first, I didn't think this would be a game for me. When I discovered that you could download content on about anything and play tons of mini games, I fell in love with this game! This game is totally worth the $10. I promise you that you will not be bored when you get this game!

It is a life time supply of bacon and Kit Kats. It is a puppy and kitty offspring that looks cute. It is Grumpy Cat if Grumpy Cat were on acid. It is a lucid dream in which you are swimming in a pool of Nutella with Kate Upton and it turns out this lucid dream is real. It is Unicorn  (wonderful). :)/10

Garry's mod will fulfill the derp in your life. I recomend Prop Hunt, Trouble in Terrorist Town, Death Run, Gmod Tower, Murder, and sandbox if you get the hang of it.

review: Garry's Mod. A game created for thy gods. A simple mortal may look upon Garry's Mod and say to theeself, "Yo this gaim sux". However, with only a simple glance at the surface of this gaming miracle, it is logical for one to assume that the game is lacking content or any point at all. I, Crusty Bumnuts, beg to differ. All my life I have been searching for purpose. For a destination to bring myself to. I have questioned reality and mortality. I hath searched far and wide, beyond the limits of human imagination. It was when I had stumbled upon a beauty of virtual glory know to mankind as "Garry's Mod", that I had finally found my life's purpose. My eyes hath been opened. I saw heaven, I saw hell. I saw life, I saw death. I saw myself in the stars and in the earth, among my people, among the gods. Life was revealed unto me, and I saw for the first time in eternity, I saw what words could not be gathered to represent. I saw the line between reality and another world. I saw Garry. And Garry saw me. Together, Garry and I, forever. Forever in the land where grass is flat, and the sun was high, and the props flew throughout the land, and the sky fell into the earth, and the earth flew into the world, the world of life and the world of death, and into myself, and into Garry. And I smiled.

review: ( Sorry for my ENGLISH) If you asking me "What is the best game in the world" I would like to say "Garry's Mod" !! It's a game of creativity and fun I feel like I pay only at 9.99$ but what I"ll get is more than the price , I"ll feel like I buy multiple game at one time but in truth I only buy one Because of it has "ALOT" of gamemode such as 1.SANDBOX 2.Prophunt 3.Troble in Terrorist town 4.Zmod 5.DarkRP and alot more but this is what I found most enjoy and NEVER get bored and I feel like I'm buying Bioshock Infinite , Halo , Call of Duty , Mass Effect , ETC because of STEAM WORKSHOP that can make your dream possible. Garry's mod also not only a sandbox but also ACTION , HORROR , COMEDY , ETC this game also supported STEAM Workshop so you can GRAB ANYTHING YOU WANT FROM IT FOR FREE !! Just you pay once and the game NEVER ask you to pay more ( As long as Garry doens't make a wrong move) To gameplay section For singleplayer if you are playing alone you might just getting bored easily if you don't have much of a STEAM Workshop Item and stuff to play around. Singleplayer make me feel like a littleplayground which is fun for me (Because of STEAM WORKSHOP Item that raise Garry's Mod From 4.GB To 13 GB now) which most of a Steam workshop Stuff is pretty good and useful But when I'll move to multiplayer Trust me you will become an Garry's Mod Addict because of a friendly community and varions of great moment ! I'll have alot of friend's because of this game still alot of server are up and kicking Gamemode that I would like to recommand DarkRP If you like a lifelike roleplaying , This is for you (And me too) I believe this game will last forever as long as humanity still exist !! as long as the Garry's Mod Community still live If you still consider if you gonna buy it "STOP THINKING AND BUY IT" I BEG YOU THIS GAME IS A MUST HAVE FOR ALL STEAM USER Oh I'll nearly forgot It has Achievment too and Steam trading card Is there any game that better than this ? free stuff , good community , great moment , cheap price , ETC And when you buy it do me a favor GO play it and make a good community or make a name for yourself on YouTube. Whatever just buy it bro !! ........... ...................__ .............//'...'/` ........../'/.../..../......./\ ........('(.......... ~/'...') .........\.................'...../ ..........''...\.......... _. ............\..............( BROFIST ...........

Want to ride a bathtub on wheels? You can do that. Because in Garry's mod, there is no limit to what you can do. If you want something to happen- make it happen. There's just some assembly required, and that's your job.

review: This is a great mod to burn time on; It is full of different types of games - like trouble in terrorist town, or zombie survival. Not to mention countless ways to experiment with items and grav-guns. However, the only downside is if you buy it without counter strike source be prepared for half a dozen ERROR objects.
game-hours: 133.0
review: It's buggy, it's awkward, but really it's anyone's game. The appeal of Garry's Mod is that it really stretches the limits of the Source Engine that can lead to moments of creative inspiration, failure to achieve it, which leads to an even better idea. The fun of the game is really up to you, whether it's admiring custom aesthetics created by hundreds of talented or hardworking people, animating stop-motion style with what you have, or just bending the world to your will with an assortment of things to spawn including Half-Life 2 characters available by default. A very interesting and sometimes under appreciated addition to the sandbox genre.

review: I've played this game for a while now. Started back in 2011. This game has provided me with hundreds of hours of content. I've been everywhere in this game. From TTT servers, DarkRP, Deathrun, HL2RP, and mostly every other major gamemode. Though, after 800 hours, I've drifted towards Half Life 2 RolePlay and hardcore roleplay servers in general. Since I have more fun there and I seem to have a knack for narrative based gameplay. So yeah, if you like to customize, push the Source engine to the limit, and play custom gamemodes that are challenging and time absorbing, I believe GMod (Short for Garry's Mod) is worth your hard earned $10(Base Game) - $25(Counter Strike Source + GMod) - $99(Valve Complete Pack) It's one of those games that you will keep coming back to over the years to play and check for new content. 10/10. I'm serious.

review: Best game ever, weather you want to play sandbox and make stuff, or make competitons with friends, to hiding and running from hunters in as a prop prophunt, to being puzzled on who to thrust and who to kill in TTT, to roleplaying the life you want in DarkRP, there is so many gamemodes that the game is made for everyone. An 9/10.

review: The best sandbox game there is for a rediculous cheap price. You can do almost anything in this game, because there is so much community content that let's you play for many hours. Be sure to also get other Source games like Counter-Strike: Source, this will give you even more textures and model to play with in Garry's Mod. You can even play the Half-Life 2 story in Garry's mod with access to all the stuff you downloaded from the Garry's Mod Workshop.

review: Great game that brings your creativity out into the open. A sandbox game developed for teen and mature players. However, there seem to be a lot of kids in this game and some people may find this annoying. If you're into sandbox games, roleplaying, etc, then you'll like this game. This game has many gamemodes that keep growing everyday. You can write your own gamemodes if you wanted to, but that would take quite a while. There are many fun gamemodes out there like DarkRP, TTT and Jailbreak. Get this game and you won't regret buying it, it's quite a cheap price too with the current summer sale going on! You might want to get CS:S along with this, because there is a lot of content that uses CS:S. HL2:EP1, HL2:Ep2 are also great games that go along with this.

review: where to begin. have you ever heard of the movie, ratatoutouille. WELL WATCH IT. That movie is like a cake, that inside is a bomb just so badly wants to explode and give everybody the surprise of dying on a birthday. This game literally rips the words out of my mouth. Though defining words would not give you anything since a "word" is acually a form of human communication. well whatever. in the movie there is a rat, that rat is totally not named rat a tat tat tat touille. this game however is the greatest thing that mankind has ever seen. except for blind people that is. disney acually filed a copyright complaint against this game for being... their exact words ' this game is too awesome and that it should be removed or our maids who clean our hotel rooms and get secretly paid below minimum wage, wil cry. not just any cry, no, these laughters and happiness's are acually part of a secret organization called in my butt. they specialize in GM vehicles. that is so off topic, any way this game is so bad hta ti think that need to be water with my pee ' it was very hard to get all that information out of the guy. i hope that next time i go to tinker winker dinker finker thisinker is getting oldinker. if you find any kind of carnival, go there i am there and i will sell you this game for 1000$. that is a 990$ rip off! i was once at a store and my sister was bitten by a mouse. this game is got the top notch characters. when there are acually no characters!

review: I love this game. There's so much to do, so much possibilities. I've always loved this game, because it have no real objective. Singleplayer is really fun, you can spawn ragdolls and pose them to make a scene, or tie them to horribly-made cars and make the car fly off a ramp. You can download new maps to explore and customize, or make a house for no reason! You don't have to be good at making proper-working things to have fun in this game, for goodness sake you don't even have to be creative. If you can move your mouse and click, then you can play this game! You can do whatever you want, you can make a monster out of chairs, you can make rainbow melons, you can milk carton fireworks if you'd like! It gets even better with the addons button. Just go to the menu, click on the "Addons" button and you have another whole world of inventions, ideas, creations, and craziness! Do you want a tool that will turn things and yourself into a melon? Then get the addon for that! (It's called the Melonificator!) Do you want a working piano that you use to play song with your keyboard? Then get the addon for that! (Playable Piano) Do you want ragdoll Pokemon? Then get the addon for that! (Pokemon ragdolls pack). There's so much more addons, which means there's so much more possibilities! Now, with all of that, it's definitely worth $9.99! (American Dollars!) But there's more- mulitiplayer! Multiplayer opens up the world of other people's ideas and creations. Do you want to watch YouTube videos in a movie with other people saying if they like it or not? Then go on 'Cinema' mode. Do you want to pretend to live another life, get a job, live in a house, and interact with other people who are pretending to be 'neighbors?' Then go on Roleplaying mode! (There's lots of types of roleplaying modes, be careful on which one you choose!) There's Sandbox mode, TTT mode (Trouble in Terrorist Town) and lots more, I can't even name them all! Now, I know this has been a long review, but if you think this is all you can do if Garry's Mod, then you are dead wrong! I haven't named much of anything compared to all the possibilities in this game. But there are a few errors- 1. If you're new to the game (which you probably are), then the instructions and tips are very confusing to follow, I had a tough time getting used to this game. 2. Very hard to create things like houses, or put up doors, and most of the time the game with glitch and you'll likely have a hard time achieving what you want to do. 3. The controls were confusing for me. That's all I need to say. :-/ There are a little bit more problems, but then there's the main question you're likely asking. "OK, so is this game worth $9.99?" (Again, American dollars) Well, in my honest opinion, yes! If you don't buy this game, you have no idea what you're missing on! I give this game 9.5/10 stars.

review: Although personally I dislike the sandbox mode of this game, it really shines in it's multiplayer game modes. Trouble in Terrorist Town, Murder & Prop Hunt are just one of a few many mini-games that have been created by the community, for the community. Although for these game modes you need the CS:S textures, you can download them for free from the 'Tools' tab in Steam itself. It's definitely worth the $5 that it is currently; and once you discover what Garry's Mod can do, you'll never be able to stop.

Anyone who argues to the contrary is not actualy thinking.. this is an experiment. it is a show. it is a picture. it is a game. it is a movie. it is a simulation. it is whatever you want it to be, but its not just a game. look at my hours on this. i have cried playing this. i have died laughing. literaly, i have died laughing. Garry didnt make this, he started this. This was made by everyone. everyone who made they're own little bit. i have yet to meet the man garry, for some reason... but i still love him for entertaining me for weeks on end. i had spent 2 days on my computer with only the occasional break to go to the restroom or eat/drink. yes i recommend this, but its no game. if anything, its art.

You know, the huge community building and crafting different type of game modes, which allows player to use their imagination to contribute the world. It's a fun game to play, I often play Garry's Mod now instead of other games. If you're a gamer who don't know which game to go for, I definitely suggest this game to you.

review: What do you want to do? Don't bother thinking, just blurt it out. Right, I don't even know what you just half-said half-slurred at your computer screen just now, but I bet you $10 you can do it in this game. Speaking of $10 that's how much this games costs. Funny how that works. Wait wait, hold on to your  - you own Episode 2? You got EP2  in here. Portal 1? Portal . Ever played TF2? It's in here. HL2?  you don't even need to own that one, it's in here. Got a favorite Sourcemod? Most of the popular ones are available to use in here. Now don't let go of those  yet. That's not everything you can possibly have. I'd rattle it all off but I'm convinced that the list would take up a whole gigabyte of Steam's server space. Yes. A whole gigabyte. Of plain text. That's a lot of . GOD DAMN IT YOU LET GO OF YOUR BOOBS DIDN'T YOU. I didn't even get to the part about how the community is constantly making more, ...as well as the fact that there are umpteen gazillion tools PRIMARILY for MAKING YOUR OWN DAMN  INGAME.

review: Garry's Mod, Published by QuickScope Studios, is an RPG, FPS game. You play as John Hardwood, a man travelled back in time by his physics teacher to face his greatest enemy, 'Faze Clan'. You journey through endless maps, ranging from an open jungle - to a snow mountain. The story is set in a western theme, with cowboys and indians chasing you through the landscape. The Qui2CkScope Engine runs this game very nicely, with clean, hardcore 3D polygon models for a bit of eye candy while playing only makes the game that much better. The real gameplay flys in when you reach the alpha stage - also known as the Trickshot 420 Stage. The stage involves you trying to hit a 750 noscope double tap yy to semtex cancel 420 snoop lion blaze shot, when there standing infront of you, Faze Clan. The ending was quite thought out and well done, with you finally taking the last hit and teabagging the Faze clan. Overall a must have for any hardcore noscopers out there! - 10/10

review: Garrys Mod is great as a multiplayer experience. It's fun to mess around with friends, build contraptions, and battle each other. Exploring and manipulating content from your favourite supported games is great too. There are also lots of gamemodes that you can play, which arguably turn Garrys Mod into a number of smaller games in their own right (i.e 'Murder' which is basically like a violent first-person Cluedo). To say that Garrys Mod is a one-size-fits-all roleplay, shooter, building game, etc, etc is pushing it a bit. You can do all of those things, but often in a watered down way... to get the most out of the game, drop any expectations and go with the flow. Embrace the wacky physics, open freedom, and virtually endless user-created content. It's the best, and at times, iest game you never knew you needed. It's the quintessential Steam sandbox game.

review: Garry's Mod is a spectacularly fun game. A sandbox game derived off of a mod of Half-Life 2, it lets you express your inner silliness and creativity. That point stands out even more so with all the varied workshop content available, ranging from various weapons and tools to props and ragdolls of characters from cartoons and tv shows and the such. Overall, Gmod is a fantastic outlet for the creative mind, and it's definitely worth your time if you like to waste time doing silly things.

review: For having 650+ hours on this game I can fairly say my opinion without any bias's. It's a great game as long as you know who you're playing with and the server owner that you play on. Really that's it. Pros: Amazing amount of selection for the cost, so many servers to try you're bound to like one. Cons: You must have cs:s to play correctly without errors *Unless you download homebrew textures or resources which I would not trust. Really that's the only one.

The workshop system is overflowing with neat new mods and maps you could screw around with and online mods that are an abundance of fun. I can see myself playing this game for many, many hours to come. It was worth the money.

review: Garry's Mod's a pretty good game. Lot's of things to do, and I do mean LOT'S. There's always new content in the forms of addons and even new gamemodes (different unique games that differ from the base sandbox entirely), and thousands of different servers to try them all out on. Some people say it's a dieing game, but it's growing everyday, and new things just seem to show up weekly.

review: After playing this game for 4-5 months, I've really enjoyed it. If you enjoy sandbox ( building whatever you like for fun), try single player and/or multiplayer servers. If you like other gamemodes such as Roleplay or Trouble in terrorist town this is also the game you should get. Overall I've really enjoyed the features of the game. Worth every penny in the long run.

review: Garry's Mod. I can't describe the possibilities that come out of it. It's an endless game. If building is your fancy, just select a map in Singleplayer and use the materials given to you to build what you like. If you are into mystery based gameplay, try Trouble In Terrorist Town. Maybe you are one of those guys/gals who like to roleplay anywhere, anytime, and with anyone, DarkRP is made for you. Coming from Counter-Strike Source with all the Surfing, B-Hopping, and Deathrun? There is all of that and more compacted into this game. 2000+ hours of my life has been spent on this game and I don't regret any of it. This game's rating deserves a 10/10 no doubt. Buy the game now and experience everything you could imagine!

review: This game is amazing, you can do absolutely ANYTHING.Build a flying bathtub with thrusters, kill endless hoards of zombies, pose whatever the hell you want, and crash hl2.exe.Now I will be listing the Pros,Cons, and Both. Pros: +Graphics are VERY good on high. +You can build absolutely anything. +Addons from the workshop can be downloaded and used. +A variety of starting tools such as an emitter and duplicator. +Optional mounted content for other downloaded games. +Very nice community, the amount of trolls are very small. +Achivements for those who probably just want them, or to show off. +Very easy to install addons. +Simple menu that is easy to use. Cons: -Slow loading time, takes like 10 minutes to even load 1 map. -Slow loading time for servers. -Menu crashing (Shift+Tab overlay workshop) Both: -+Hl2 glitches are still in the game (Propclimb, Abh, etc) -+Physics system is glitchy but still good with hitboxes. This is game is great, it gets a 9.3 out of 10.I still adore this game even if it is infested with FNAF fans.The physics glitches are quite funny if you can get them to happen.But no offense to the FNAF fans, just don't hate on us for not liking FNAF.The loading time is sometimes quite long so I recommend to watch videos or do something else while its loading.I was gonna say something else, but I can't remember so...END.

review: One day I was playing xbox in my room and having fun. Then I got a boner out of no were so I started to jerk off rapidly and then the worst thing happened. A en guy  mother en gorilla fly is through my window and is laying on the ground in front of me. And well  I came before I could hold it in and it landed right in his face. He stands up and looks at me with his balls and  hanging there. I was scared out of my mind because he looked at me like he was going to  me in the  hole. Then out of no were Mickey Mouse came flying through the window and hit that  in the face. Then the gorilla started ing the  out of Mickey. I backed up in the conner as those two trie to  the other in the . Grab my shotgun and was going to waste the  out them but then he showed up uncle en grandpa. When he came through the window he said good morning and we all just stared. And I aimed and shot is small little balls off Micky and the gorilla was freaken out. They both went in the corner and was shacking like es. Uncle grand pa was holding his balls or should I say hole. I took my cup and  in it hard core and make that mother er eat it. He cryed on and on when the. When it was down his throat I took my boots and smashed the  out of his face. I saw the brain and ripped it out of his en head and ate it. Micky and the gorilla was crying like es. So I blow off mickys head and pulled out my knife and stabed that gorillas but hole so my  could fit in it. I ed that monkey and made him . Then mist walked in and I cut of that gorillas balls and shoved it down mist throat. The I took my knife and cut that s head off and shoved his head up the gorillas . The what u call a ed up fivesome.

There are tons of mini games such as Trouble In Terrorist Town, Murder, etc. Garry's Mod is hands down the best sandbox game I have EVER played! At first, I didn't think this would be a game for me. When I discovered that you could download content on about anything and play tons of mini games, I fell in love with this game! This game is totally worth the $10. I promise you that you will not be bored when you get this game!

review: Garry's mod is a great game for both casual and hard-core gamers, with plenty of game modes and its well-known 'sandbox' feature it is pretty hard to become 'fed up' of this stupendous game. Although this game is currently priced at a very respectable 5.99 it is much more expensive overall, for instance "missing textures" is a big f****** nuisance in this game (pardon my French), to make things easy this game requires you to have certain games installed in order to not see 'bright purple' and black' checkered squares everywhere or the well know "Error" instead of your desired 'object' in game. So to overcome this you may need to buy some of, if not all of Valve's games. Yes from CSS to HL2, as the game does indeed run on the 'Source engine'. Negatives aside this game is extremely fun, especially with friends. Inviting a group of friends and then just spawn killing them with 'duplicated dynamite' or crushing them with the random prop is freaking hilarious and oddly amusing. And of course the odd immature player that spawns in Barney and the Metrocops in, the relentless anal sex posturing with Alyx Vance. Aside from that, Gmod consists of 8 game modes and dozens of others that are made by the almost infinite online community, 'Trouble in Terrorist Town' (TTT) and CityRP being my favourites of most of the game modes. Building may look pretty 'daunting' at times and trust me it is, but with practice it becomes a subconscious feat. But not to worry making a pretty basic and cool looking 'build' that can easily impress or annoy your many friends can only take a few hover balls with the stay 'upright' feature on and a 'muscle' rope that can move in all directions, and "Shabam" you got a pretty easy build right in front of your eyes. And for all the lazy buggers out there Garry kindly added the 'Dupes' button which allows you to spawn and use other people amazing "creations" that can kill and impress the people around you. Overall this game is a must buy and I recommend it highly to anyone who just wants to have a good time with friends or the vast community... Opiziite - 9.7

review: Limited only by your imagination, garrys mod gives you a lego bin full of video game peices from as many video games as there are out there. With these peices and a large colletion of fun and interesting tools, GMOD lets you run wild from the start. Blow things up, make a giant robot out of road cones and washing machines, make a helicopter out of a lenght of rebar and toliet. if you can think it up and make a plan for it, you can very likely make it in GMOD And if the virtually limitless potential of single player wasnt enough of an insentive, there is a truely massive online store/workshop that allows you to increase you parts/ props/ models/ npc characters/ and everything for one low price of memory. Everything is free ( save for the game ) And on top of that, there are many many many multiplayer servers where you can mess around with others and have funs of goofy crazy fun. Just remember, with multiplayer, people can and will be moderatly insane/crazy. Afterall there is no social ettiqute, so you never know how one server will be when you first get in. But dont worry. If one server is full of rude people, or children screaming at one another. there will allways be another hundered to check out.

This Game/Mod is so great just make sure you buy counter strike source to have the textures down. So many things that you can do with this game even if you are playing by yourself. I would say this is the best PC game and i switch from ps4 to pc for like 7 months straight cuz i was addicted to this game.

review: Another Steam Necessity, anyone can find enjoyment in this game, from simply using it as a way to practise fighting enemies or for creating complex and exciting contraptions with the large and expanding toolset provided by Garry and the countless modders taking advantage of the handy LUA system that has been implemented into the game. With countless gamemodes, maps and things to do this won't get boring quickly. The recent changes have made installing mods much simpler and possible within the game so big thanks to Garry for continuing to maintain this excellent game.

review: This is overall a decent game . You can literally do anything you want, and there is no story. You can put in any props, ragdolls, and npcs. You can create your own levels, funny animations, mess around, make race tracks, among thousands of other options. It also take elements from every source engine game (Half-Life 2, Team Fortress 2, Portal, and Counter-Strike to name a few), and implements them into the game. You can totally mess up Half-Life and Portal this way, which is extremely fun. The graphics are the same as just about every other Source Engine game, which are awesome. Also, if all of this wasn't fun enough, then there is also a Toy Box. Basically the Toy Box allows you to download user made creations while you play the game. These can be new maps, weapons, and entities. Overall it's fun to play !

review: You have so much freedom in what you can do in this game. It's basically a sandbox with no limits. Either you can sit back and create a little animation using ragdolls, or play on some of the various gamemodes downloadable. I highly recommend trying this out.

review: Garry's Mod has to be the best game ever. At just $10.00, you have a variety of gamemodes consisting of Trouble in Terrorist Town, DarkRP, Jailbreak, Deathrun, DayZ, Prophunt, Murder, Minigames, and many more! There are many unique players that play this game, as well as many chances to become a moderator/admin on your favorite server, if you live up to the expectations! Create a base and go out to mug people and steal, or build a gun shop with guards defending it! Sell drugs and illegal guns, or be a SWAT and bust into the criminal's house to put him behind bars! I currently have spent well over two years on this amazing game! I recommend it to anyone and everyone! Give me a friend request, and we'll play together!

review: I don't really know where to begin with Gmod. At it's core, it's nothing more than a sandbox to play in, no goals or points or leveling up. Just a gravity gun and an arsenal of crazy crap to spawn in. The interface feels a bit clunky to me, it took a while to learn even the most basic menu navigation keys, but once you get the hang of how to work your way around, you'll realize that the user generated content for this "game" is astronomical both in quality and quantity. I absolutely love Trouble in Terrorist Town and Prop Hunters. I'd reccoment picking up Garry's Mod just for those two game modes :D

review: Would rate 1000000000/10. Very satisfying sandbox mode, along with a game where, along with others, you play a very werewolf like trust game, a game where you can pick up cans, cars, computers, and even a cow and turn into them, and many other literally endless gamemodes to enjoy. Reccomended server: Creepy's villa TTT

review: This game..it's not just a sandbox game..no it's a new world where you can become a murderer and stab people just because, it's a place where you can be a detective trying to solve a murder which the murderer is right next to you waiting to shoot you in the head when you turn away, its a place where people turn into objects to hide from murdererous hunters trying to kill them....This is no game...It's a new life , a new world all for you to make change and live in...Just remember to have a clock around and you will understand how somebody can waste as much time I have in this game Thanks for reading My rating- 100/100 :D

review: I don't get why no one would like a game like Garry's Mod, it's cheap it's fun and filled with alot of content, and you too can post your own content! I'll start by saying this game is a TON of fun, loads of servers loads of addons...Although there's some annoying things like having to sit and wait for about an hour depending on the content and your speed to download files, if you don't then well...errors aren't that bad to live with i guess... Also about half of Garry's Mod's content and fun is creating everything, A toilet that moves, A tower that moves and so on. So you need to learn the basics and the complex stuff and start making all the random things you can ever think of! That sounds fun but i'll admit, it can be abit difficult sometimes. Even if you don't wanna make anything it can still be fun to just nuke everyone and everything (via a weapon addon obviously) or just join a server where you really don't have to make anything, so there's a thing for everyone. It IS abit of an annoying thing that you need to have alot of games that are made by Valve and a few that aren't in order to get a fully functioning Garry's Mod, so make note of that. I wouldn't say THAT's needed, but alot of addons and textures and props and so on use stuff from other games so it feels like half the game just got taken off and the rest is given to you. I'd say if you have alot of time to kill and feel like making random crap everywhere or just mess about then this is the game for you, and it's only for $10 so i'd say it's worth it. It's worth it to just have this game and play it from time to time just to mess around or build serious things or hell make your own addons, There's basically a thing for everyone. And while i'll admit it has it's share of annoying things like every other game, it's still fun overall, I'd give it a 8.5/10.

review: Multiple ways of playing this game you can: Build a huge tower with watermelons, play TTT with some friends, play Prop Hunt (One of the best gamemodes for fun in my opinion), and other multiple gamemodes. Garrys mod or Gmod for short opens up a new perspective for gamers who just want to have fun creating crazy new things from Catapaults or Nyan cat Launchers. However you always get that pesky little bugger who always tries to wreck the fun.

Playing with friends is fun or you can play on a server (if you want one join me and my friend's server 23.88.247.249:27016). This game is full of destruction, balloons, dead stuff, guns, bombs and lots n' lots of stuff you can download from the workshop. (gotta try the nuke addon, just don't do it on a server or you will end up getting banned from there lol). If you find it expensive you can wait for the sale and it will be at 2$-ish.

review: This was my first time playing. Joined a roleplaying server. I was a hobo. Gun dealer wouldn't give hobos guns. I Dropped a fridge on him.(Against Server rules). The revolution agaisnt the 'goverment' began. I gathered up almost three quarters of the server to join the fight. The good fight. I printed illicit money (Against server rules) for people to buy pistols and assault rifles with (Against server rules). We made a banner. Some of us swore.(Against Server rules). We stormed up to the police station demanding all sorts of stuff. Gay rights. Free money. Roofs over our heads. This was met with silence. AND WE MET THEIR SILENCE WITH GUNFIRE.(Against Server rules). Scores of police officers were dead but we all had been sent to prison. I pleaded to my captors, begging them for rights for hobos. About 3/4 of the server was in prison. We hatched a plan. A plan to kill the governor. (Against Server rules). We killed him. (Against Server rules). The server restarts. I become the governor. Perhaps the power got to my head or the events I had witnessed were too much to bear. I punched a guy. (Against Server rules). The admin finds me and threatens to ban me. I call his rules "Stupid". I am banned. So. The moral of the story is when you Roll-Play on a garrys mod server feel free to start a revolt but don't punch a guy.

review: This is one of my favourite games out there. I've always like garry's mod because facepunch studios made the game in such a way so it would be very easy for people to mod and create addons for. The community are constantly creating addons for this game so it's hard to become bored. I've always said that garry's mod is really good because its the kind of game that you could re-create any other game in with some time and effort. I would reccomend that people buy this because of the low price and the hours of fun that can be had.

review: Garry's mod is one of the best sandbox/community driven games on PC and possible in Gaming. If you are going to buy this, you should buy CS:S with it since many game modes use those textures in it. Sandbox mode is nice, you can do many things in that but many people also love to play on game modes, I would recommend TTT as a nice game mode if you find a good server but the sky is the limit in Gmod gamemodes(actaully it is the engine but eh). There are so many things to be said about this game and this review would go on for pages if you were to explain every single custom gamemode that is on garry's mod and you will get you 10/5/2.5 euro or whatever the price is out of it since there is constantly new content developed on servers. A great game with a good community if you know where to look.

review: Thats how it all begun, all the machinimas and millions of videos on YT. It's sandbox mode is absolutely amazing, you can do almost everything (except liquid physics? :D). Want to make a rocket from your toilet? THERE YOU GO! Wanna make races of watermelons? NO PROBLEM! The other gamemodes are awesome too, yet you will need to download LOTS of addons you probably don't need and won't use anywhere except on the server you are playing. Multiply this by the amount of servers and your GMOD folder can quickly become bigger than your porn folder (if you happen to have one). Also the pings and QoS of the servers can be pretty low, AND THE  HELIUM-VOICED KID ADMINS- those things can break the fun sometime. The developers can be quite a b*otch too, like every 8-th or 10-th update will FU*K UP 20 things and repair 1 or 2 and every 100-th update fu*ks up whole game and modders have to code everything from scratch and upload stuff with pre-alpha-like programs. Ofc you will realize that something is/will be broken from the comments- developers will sometimes post a small note about the update on some  site, located at the edge of the internet .. BUT, if you are just a simple player, dl'ing addons and building vehicles, or want to try faceposing, you should try it. Not playing this classic is like, i dunno, not trying the minesweeper on windows? It's something everyone knows and everyone should try! 9/10 - 0,5 (for server issues) -1 (for "I dun care" devs) = 7,5/10

review: Im no critic when I say get the game alright... After a total of nine hours playing the game, NUMEROUS mod testing and observations I`ve come to conclude that this game is meant for ANY type of gamer. Lots of ideal game modes, game maps, mods for extra weapons and the above. I really like how skins just make a whole diffrent experience while gaming in a new world as one of your favorite characters by Valve and etc. Lots of sick block busting weapons call out to you when subscribing to mods at the workshop. I highly recomend to check out what I am subscribed to (thanks to a little someone) and to TRY out the parkour mods. Adds realism to the already fictionized game world. This universal game gets you addicted after you finnally load that level, whether or not your online with peeps or just experimenting on your own blank canvas. I highly recomend a decent computer video card (NVIDIA if i spelt it right! Or anything that can run Fallout 3 - Elder Scrolls IV - Oblivion (Bethesda) ) and at least good internet to get a good ping. Most of my friends play Team Fortress 2, and my ping level to MVM servers or regular comunity servers is at your standard 69 -70. Not all bad, especially for Gmod, but besides some lag spikes and frozen computer screens you need to close down immediately with the task mannager, the Game is not that all a PAIN! I really like weapons and the maps, umm... Not really much to say now but to thank again those who also recomended Gmod to me, thankyou! Im just passing down the torch to one of the BEST FPS of all time! Side Notes - I may add more to this if i find more stuff out but so far besides how my PC handles it, its fine. Its worth the $9.99, but sometimes they hype down to $4.99 or one time: $1.99 on the market. But really all togethger just get the game!|

review: Ah Garry's mod. The game with most under 14's since call of duty. Garry's mods possiblities are pretty much endless as their are tons of mods out their, and more coming everyday. This allows for good filmaking or just plain diccking around. The multiplayer is something to be wary of as there is pretty much a pre pubesent child in every server going around killing people or deleting everything your trying to create. Some servers try to restrict this by allowing no killing or deleting but this can also lead to other types of trolling like someone puting a fence over a door so no one can escape. Its pretty much a lose lose situation. Just be prepared to deal with these problems or make your own server with a passcode so you save yourself the brain tumors that are the trolls. Another problem you might face is the downloads on custom servers that will take 10 minutes and might not even work. Mind you this is only one mode of the multiplayer. As the name gives away Garry's Mod is pretty much a modders wet dream. Their are mods galore. Some of note are TTT-Trouble in Terrorist Town (best played with friends), Murder and Prop Hunt. These are game mods that add a whole new gameplay experience but you can also get mods for guns, cars, people...pretty much anything you can think of, its in the workshop. The singleplayer for Garry's Mod is pretty much for testing out your mods or just having fun with them by yourself. It allows you to set up scences or build awesome contraptions without any interference from the high balls. All in all Garry's Mod is a good experience with some friends in the multiplayer and is a good tool or filmaking and fun, the communtiy more or less is pretty cool, where you can find some pretty humorous blokes aye. I give Garry's Mod a 9/10! Just bring ear protection....

review: Garry's Mod is an essential for the creative (or destructive) mind to enjoy, In its vanilla state, GMOD provides many opportunities and tools to express your desire to create toilet submarines, or explode about 50+ NPC's with the RPG. GMOD is a hugely flexible (and sometimes unstable) sandbox when you mess around with the possibilities, including adding things like Wiremod to unlock the possibilities (or confusion) . GMOD, however, is not stand-alone, and requires a source engine game to power the experience, which shouldn't really be difficult to achieve, especially with TF2 being F2P. The game is also not only a sole experience, but an amazing multi-player world where anything can happen, which isn't always a good thing! The multi-player world is a interesting one, and some addons would be needed to avoid people messing up what you make. Maps, game-modes and infinitely more pieces of content can be added at your leisure, but performance will take a hit in most cases. As a flexible, sandbox, you would probably expect to be able to do almost anything, and GMOD pretty much does just that. For a measly few pounds or dollars, you can unlock a unique world that has almost no bounds to your creativity, which is what a sandbox is all about. Highly Recommended. Rated: 9.7/10

review: Hi i gonna review the so called "Garry's mod" ah, i remember when i bought this.... about 1.5 year ago i bought this game for 10 euro! no regrets! its like a new game everytime you download a new addon! as a PC veteran i think its a really well made game with a few glitches, not many! this game is one of those "must play before i die" game... this game was a mod in the beginning... A MOD FOR HALF LIFE 2? this is one of the best games i everplayed and you wont regret buying this, the sandbox mode is what i play the most, i love to play alone and make up scenes where im a soldier and im in a war between the rebels and the combines! buy this instead of that... what is it called? goat simulator or the stopid bad rats! 10/10 -Spy reviews!

review: Extremely fun and addicting, with non-stop gameplay, as there is allways SOMETHING new! It is for those constructive, those who want to make some funny stuff, those who want some awesome combat, and everything else! This game can be whatever you want it to be, and when done right, you can make some of the most hilarious stuff! With a great community, a large array of gamemodes, tons of addons, and cool stuff to play with, the game is never old! You could be a constructor and build maps, or you can be someone who just enjoys killing monsters with friends, you can play around in a hilarious game of prop hunt, stay tense in murderer, play with friends in a deathmatch, and anything you can imagine! If you look up on youtube people like kitty0706 or Das Bo Schitt, you can find some really hilarious stuff, made in gmod! So go on, its worth the money, really!

To get around the bullys some tips and tricks 1. If you have a 'Squeaky voice' Type Instead. 2. Follow the rules 3.Dont be a minge.

review: This game started being a HL2 Mod, now it is a seperate game, Buying this game is like buying 50 Games in one, Some don't even feel like your playing the actual game, G-Mod for example like TTT. Theres many different gamemodes and workshop items you can choose from, like TTT, Murder, Sandbox, DarkRP, Stalker, and more gamemodes you can play! Sandbox you can build or create or fight or invent whatever your mind comes to. TTT, is another gamemode as known as Trouble in Terroist Town. (Yes I know I spelled that wrong.) Where this a T (Traitor) has to kill everyone and not get caught or killed, I (Innocents) have to see who the Traitor is without just killing everybody, they need proof, and if you test or get tested, you will be proven which means everyone knows you are Innocent. D (Decective) Has a DNA Scanner to see who killed who, but they will decay the time goes fast when it decays. {Traitors and Decectives have a shop to buy items} Murder is a other gamemode, Where there is a murderer, the murderer CANNOT get caught, but still has to kill everyone. The "Secret Weapon" Person has to find the murderer, and kill it, unless the murderer kills the person with the gun first. DarkRP is just pretty much RP with jobs, and etc, mugging, thief, gundealer, etc. S.T.A.L.K.E.R is pretty much The Hidden but without the 1 hit kill and you dont have a knife.

review: This game requires thinking, logic, physics, etc if you want some super-cool machine. However, if you want to just mess around, like spawn something and attatch a bunch of rockets and zoom around the map, you can also have fun with that, too. As for multiplayer, I have played on quite a few of them. Many of them have mods from freeze tag to team deathmatch to zombie survival, or just plain custom maps with a few extra tools. Anyway you look at it, Garry's Mod will be there to entertain you for hours at a time.

review: A great game to play with your friends. You can do pretty much anything in there which makes it even more fun. That being said, there are loads of different mods to choose from, so everyone is able to find something to play here. You don't really see how time passes while playing this game, so that's another plus when trying to kill time on your own.

review: One of the most strangely addicting games I've ever played, I've had it for 1 or 2 weeks now, and with the help of friends I was able to learn the ropes relatively quickly. I've had it for a short amount of time and have already logged 172 hours on GarrysMod. It's so fun its rediculous. When I first saw this, I thought it was so sketchy, and didn't even look fun. But I broke down out of boredom and bought it. This $14 (now $10) was probably one of the best $14 (or $60) I've ever spent on a game.

review: It was a cold saturday night. My friends and I were very bored so we decided to go onto a DarkRP server in garry's mod. I scrolled through the jobs. Theif, Cop, Pet, Etc. Nothing was interesting until.... I saw it. 'Cult Member'. I knew what had to be done. I chose that job and bought a building and created my church. My friends soon followed. This was known as the "Cult of RevoMods". My friends and I went out and started asking people to come with us. Then we saw him. He was in a female vessel but we knew... I knew... It was him. The Champion of RevoMods. We captured him and locked him in the back room of the church. We took people who attended our sermons and locked them in there with him. He devored the corrupt souls of the world. However, He soon became corrupt. We sent him back to the heavens to live with RevoMods. Only... he came back. Stronger and with a cleansed soul. We kidnapped and locked more and more mortals in the name of RevoMods. Our church grew larger and larger. People did not like how large we were becoming so they constantly raided and killed us. Then, RevoMods came down from the heavens to help us! He dropped a 15 second bomb in the church. I locked the door. People screamed saying "Let me out! Let me out!" One guy was carrying the bomb in his hands. There were no survivors. RevoMods granted my friends and I another vessel to do his bidding. We moved the church and that's when we fell... The Champion was no where to be found. However, there were several murders around the city commited by him. The mayor was one.... Then came the raiders yet again. Everyone dying screaming for help and crying for it all to end. So it did... The Church of RevoMods was disbanded and never seen again. I checked the server lists for the server however, It was not there... I don't know what happened to it... but it was a crazy night. Praise RevoMods! Praise DarkRP! (RevoMods was the owner of the server)

The guys who made theese are genius with working phisycs mechanics and customizabile everything deserves the nuber one sanbox game spot. If you didint buy this game allready go sell some lemonade and buy it. It's a ton of fun and I found myself playing this for 3 days straight without break . Its got multiplayer wich is ADDICTING and I really mean it. When you start playing Dark RP or Trouble in Terrorist Town  gets real. Come on just give Garry a cookie. Well im not telling you to buy it but : BUY IT IT'S WORTH IT! BUY IT IT'S WORTH IT! BUY IT IT'S WORTH IT! BUY IT IT'S WORTH IT!

review: Ever experienced a game with over 100 different mods with hundreds and even thousands of people playing? Garry's Mod, also commonly referred to as Gmod has many different modifications with one of the largest growing steam community workshops out there full of fantastic creations made by the community, for the community. Now you may think that this is just another game like minecraft but I can guarentee this isn't, it doesn't have the best community out there but somewhere in the crowd there are always people willing to help out and have fun! The game itself is a 1st person styled game which can only really be described as... 'interesting' this game is built up from the community and not so much from the developers, so you can obviously tell it has a large input from what people want instead of what the developers want instead. With hundreds of different modifications out there full of people playing, you'll never get bored of what may be in-store the next time you start up this game. And if this simple review isn't good enough for you, maybe the different picture everytime you start up Garry's Mod (Gmod) may interest you.

review: Garry's Mod is a good game, even if you're not good at the construction. I personally enjoy exploring the servers created by others and seeing what they have innovated. You may want to consider buying the Counter Strike: Source package, because even though both are great games in my opinion, there is no doubt that CS:S will provide a full online gaming experience.

You can do almost ANYTHING there are about 100 avaliable game modes to play on 3 of the most popular are: SandBox, Trouble In Terrorist Town, DarkRP. My personal favorites are the RP (RolePlay) servers. Because you can be the president, a officer, A criminal its almost like real life roleplay with all the custom content the server owners purchase. I definitaly recommend this game. 9.5/10

(- much time required to download ressources...) + you can use it in many different ways, for example to make a little movie/advertisement through funny images/cuts you can create (but for this reason, I'd recommend "Source Filmmaker", this one requires some time to learn how to use it, but it s way better to create a movie thorugh the Source-mod) + very good price-preformance ratio, reduced = instabuy - if you dont want to get vision problems/ eye cancer through missing textures, you practically have to install many Source-games, like CS:Source, TF2 or Half Life

review: Wow, this game really changed the life of Ken Snyder. I have so many fans that play this game and they all sent me messages saying "Oh man, Ken bro dude man bro you gotta play this game!" And since my good pals Rob Schneider, Willem Dafoe, and Bob Saget were already on this beyotch I got naked and hopped right on this sexy celeb gang bang of a video game. This game is love, this game is life. Sometimes while playing on the Golden Boys TTT server I feel tingly feelings down below. One time on here I saw a beautiful lady so I had on my fuuuuucking fedora and I kissed her. Then the golden boys and I all got together with her and we smoked a little meth and gang banged her. I really have to say not only has this game made my already mad beyotch game stronger, it's broughten me closer to the only men I could ever love. So thank you Gmod, you've made my life for the better. I wish I could write for hours, but I have more Gmod to play with the Golden Boys. If you think you have what it takes to be a Hollywood Golden Boy hit me and Rob Schneider up. <3 8=====D With love, Ken Snyder <3 8====D~~~~

review: This game is really fun! You can do really much with this game. You can make stuff that's either wierd and fun or you can make big constructions etc. But this is just a little part of it. When you buy the game you have different game-modes like Trouble in Trerrorist Town, Prop Hunt, Sandbox, Stop It Slender, Gmod Zombie survival (something like that) and more! And you can play alone if you feel like not playing online. !!(But to get most of the textures you need Counter Strike Source, The Half Life series, TF 2 and I'm not sure but I alsow think you need some textures from Left 4 dead 2, but again I might be mistaking. But if you don't want to spend more money you can find some of the textures in the workshop)!!

review: If you don't have it get it. Now. You will first start a new game and not understand a thing, probably spawn some crap and fling it about. They are two things you will do at this point, you will quit or you will waste your life on it. The people who did the latter of the options explored the many different gamemodes and servers on it (that almost appear hidden to new players) and found one they liked. The people who play for ages probably found a online community based around one or more of the game modes. The people who quit played single play sandbox or tried a single server. If you explore it watch as your life disapears and this game takes up your life.

I would recomend this game to anyone still, this game has been through alot, and i have stuck with it for a while. This game does not really get old. The are many diffrent things to do here. However, i think this game has its limetations, and i have no clue what they are :). I hope to see many great things to come. P.S : I am very tired of seeing Five Nights at Freddys dupes. Yes we know there is a new teddy in the workshop, no need to dupe it if you must install the addon- bla bla bla. And dont get me started with the 6-10 year olds. I mean some of them are quite nice, but 9/10 times there anoying little- well there "idiots" who think the world revolves around them. somtimes i actuly request an admin to ban them just for breking one rule. I do somtimes meet friendly kids, and i reward them for being friendly. Im not going to say what it is, but they like it.thats why i hate playing multiplayer on this game on the weekends, i do somtimes, but still. I blame PewDiePie. Millions of kids want to copy him or somthing. Thanks.

review: Garry's Mod -- the all-in-one sandbox game. Whether it's movies, screenshots, or just mucking about in general, Garry's Mod should keep you (and others) entertained for a long time. Also, it's $10. Instead of pirating it (like I know a bunch of other people have), just don't buy that pizza you wanted today, and you should have enough for it.

review: "What is it?" is probably the most frequently asked question about G-Mod. This ever changing game has left many with that question unanswered. Today we seek to have that question answered. Today we will leave that question unanswered. Welcome to Garry's Mod. I suppose I should start with the gameplay. That is just the unique thing about G-Mod though. It has no one set gamemode. The whole point of G-Mod is to test, create, and try out the many different gamemodes you can download from the Steam Workshop. They are fun and there is a great variety to chose from. The game also comes with two preloaded gamemodes. Trouble in Terrorist Town and Sandbox. Sandbox is basic build/do whatever you want gamemode, while Trouble in Terrorist town is a murderer/detective style gamemode. Both are fun and intuitive. The sandbox gamemode gives you more freedom, but has a bit of a larger learning curve. The Trouble in Terrorist Town gamemode is a bit more for those who are accustomed to games like Unreal Tournament or Counter-Strike. I personally prefer playing on the Sandbox gamemode as it allows you to build anything you want via the tools provided within the Source Engine. You might still be wondering: "What exactly do you do in Garry's Mod?" Well to answer your question, just about anything you want! That is what makes Garry's Mod so amazing...the freedom limited by unlimited boundaries. Now as for the graphics. They are good. The Source Engine does an excellent job of creating a beautiful, fluid, and realistic world. For being an engine almost 10 years old it still does not falter in it's quality. The sound is anything but a disappointment. It is loud, powerful and moving. Because this is primarily a Sandbox game it gives the user freedom to add on their own sounds or sound effects from the workshop. I cannot tell you how many times I have been playing on some kind of a Horror Map and the key element was the loud and pulsing sound. A screech coming from behind, sounds like a real screech from behind. Ok, now for Lasting Appeal. Ummmm...hmmmm. About as unlimited and ongoing as you want it to be. Simple as that. All in all, this is a great game for Minecraft lovers (14 and up :) and Source Engine developers alike. Why? Well...cause it's G-Mod of course! And what is that exactly? Well, let's not go down that road... Overall Rating: 8/10 Presentation: 9/10 Multiplayer: 6/10 Gameplay: 7.5/10 Graphics: 7/10 Sound: 8/10 Lasting Appeal: 10/10 Overall Rating: 8/10

review: A silly game that was no direct goal,mess around with thrusters,face psoers,ragdolls,anything you want.It's not just about the Sanbox either,there are different gamemodes such as TTT,Prop Hunt,and many more.It is also uses many textures,characters,and more from different source games,like HL2,CS:S,TF2,etc.

review: A game of fun and creativity! This phisics based sandbox is a silly little game that you cant keep away from! But the real game is when you start to play online servers and games like Trouble in terrorist town, prophunt or pirate wars just to name a few. But the addons is the best bit! Hunndreds of thousands of fun addons and modifications like new vehicles, ragdolls, NPCs, Modles, skins, wepons and more! Build, fight or silly buggers! This game dos it all! Recommendable to every one and definatly TF2 players as TF2 unlocks a bunch of previously unuseable addons.

review: Garry's Mod is a game that will entertain you for hours and days. With many different game mods that are all created by community, it's damn near impossible to get bored. It's amazing how many people actually play this game. You can kill people with knife in Murder, betray all your friends in Trouble in Terrorist Town, participate in the Hunger Games or try to break out of prison. Play Hide & Seek. Ride the funniest elevator in gaming history! Build stuff. Get chased by a bunch of Pedobears. Defend against hordes of zombies or collect pages and run away from Slenderman in a multiplayer mod. The only downside to this game is that it very often needs to download something. Not only do you need CS:S and HL2 maps and textures to run most of the mods, the servers often have downloadable content themselves. But other than that, this is definitely a game that offers the most fun and diversity that I've ever seen.

review: If you don't have it get it. Now. You will first start a new game and not understand a thing, probably spawn some crap and fling it about. They are two things you will do at this point, you will quit or you will waste your life on it. The people who did the latter of the options explored the many different gamemodes and servers on it (that almost appear hidden to new players) and found one they liked. The people who play for ages probably found a online community based around one or more of the game modes. The people who quit played single play sandbox or tried a single server. If you explore it watch as your life disapears and this game takes up your life.

review: Garry's Mod. A game created for thy gods. A simple mortal may look upon Garry's Mod and say to theeself, "Yo this gaim sux". However, with only a simple glance at the surface of this gaming miracle, it is logical for one to assume that the game is lacking content or any point at all. I, Crusty Bumnuts, beg to differ. All my life I have been searching for purpose. For a destination to bring myself to. I have questioned reality and mortality. I hath searched far and wide, beyond the limits of human imagination. It was when I had stumbled upon a beauty of virtual glory know to mankind as "Garry's Mod", that I had finally found my life's purpose. My eyes hath been opened. I saw heaven, I saw hell. I saw life, I saw death. I saw myself in the stars and in the earth, among my people, among the gods. Life was revealed unto me, and I saw for the first time in eternity, I saw what words could not be gathered to represent. I saw the line between reality and another world. I saw Garry. And Garry saw me. Together, Garry and I, forever. Forever in the land where grass is flat, and the sun was high, and the props flew throughout the land, and the sky fell into the earth, and the earth flew into the world, the world of life and the world of death, and into myself, and into Garry. And I smiled.

review: Look at my hours, that should describe it enough, right? Not only has roleplaying in this game for several years given me thousand of hours of enjoyment, but it also helped my writing skills, and made me the linguist I am today. Not interested in roleplay? How about base building? Base wars? Zombie survival of various flavors? Pirate ship wars? Running through a maze of traps with dozens of other players while three players are determined to set traps to kill you all? Space build? There are dozens more game-modes, and new ones come out every couple of days.

review: With over 1500 hours worth of pure play time, I can say with confidence that this game is one of Garry Newman's (Creator of Garry's Mod) finest. This game will let you do ANYTHING your mind and heart desires. I have spent so much time in this game and haven't even seen half of all the awesome stuff you will be able to do. There are tons of different gamemodes. All from "Role Playing" that you're an average citizen in a small town, to "Parkouring" from building to building, to playing tribute gamemodes in honor of other games such as "Slenderman" or "Attack on Titan", to playing Hide and Seek as props. All I can say is that I would definitely recommend this game to anyone no matter what size or age!

It's also a good first step for those that have ever been interested in modding. It includes a large amount of suprisingly fun spin-off mods that are powered by a community with no sign of winding down. Quite the opposite, it seems more people are playing.

review: Garry's Mod is an extremely fun game, because it functions mostly on workshop addons you can turn it into amost anything you want. However because anything besides the normal sandbox vertion of the game need other textures from games that also run Source you need to own about half the games valve makes. So, if you wish to play Garry's Mod it would be best to own most of the games in the valve complete pack. Normally this is around $100 but goes on sale for $25 every few months. So I would suggest waiting until the valve complete pack goes on sale and buying it along with Garry's Mod. All of the games that I have played in the valve complete pack are extrememly fun anyway so youll want to own them just to play anyway.

review: This is just about as much fun as you can have in a game. Now, if you haven't bought this game, go buy it. RIGHT NOW! Asking why? This is a game that's allmost COMPLETELY user made. If you know what mods are, this game is ONLY mods. Meaning everything you get, do, make, build, spawn in, E.T.C is user made. But, there's more. There are gamemodes. These aren't gamemodes like C.O.D or BF, these are user made. Meaning, there are HUNDREDS of them! And if you've ever been to youtube, you would know all about: Prop Hunt, Trouble in Terrorist Town, Murder, Pirate Wars, DarkRP, and so on! So, this is one of the best games I've played. Sure, it gives you MANY problems, like textures for example. (You need CS:S textures for everything in this game. Get Counter Strike: Source, or just search up on youtube for another way to get them.) So, really, if you have ever owned one of those old VW beatles, you will know what I mean by this next phrase: "This is as fun as your imagination, and yet the biggest pain you will ever have" This is just a beautiful, beautiful game.... I have almost 330 hours when I write this, and NONE of those hours where cause I left it on while I slept. 9.9/10 -TheGamerVii

review: This game is way too addicting, don't play this if you have a job or if you are doing exams, seriously. TIME FOR WIKI SPAM: Garry's Mod (often abbreviated as GMOD) is a sandbox physics game using a modified Source engine, created by Garry Newman. Garry's Mod has been available on Valve's content delivery service Steam since November 29, 2006.[1] In the past purchase of Garry's Mod required the user to own at least one game on Steam based on the Source engine, such as Half-Life 2, Counter-Strike: Source, Portal, or Team Fortress 2,[1] however as of May 2014 the game can be purchased by itself on Steam. It is also commonly used for the creation and publishing of videos[3][4] on YouTube, mainly from Team Fortress 2, Half-Life 2, Portal, Left 4 Dead and Left 4 Dead 2. Garry's Mod was originally a modification for Valve's Half-Life 2, but was later made into a standalone Steam game that was officially released on November 29, 2006 dubbed Garry's Mod 10. The current version, Garry's Mod 14.04.04, was released on April 4, 2014. In February 2014 it was revealed on Twitter by Newman that the game had "just broke" US$ 30 million.[5] As of November 2013 the game has sold 3.5 million copies. Although Garry's Mod is usually considered to be a full game, it has no game objective and players can use the game's set of tools for any purpose whatsoever, although sometimes when playing on a multiplayer server it may have role-play or other types of game modes. Garry's Mod allows players to manipulate items, furniture and "props"  various objects that players can place in-game. Props can be selected from any installed Source engine game or from a community created collection. The game features two "guns"  Physics Gun and Tool Gun for manipulating objects. The Physics Gun allows objects to be picked up, adjusted, and frozen in place. The Tool Gun is a multi-purpose tool for performing various tasks, such as combining props, attaching them via ropes, and creating controllable winches and wheels. The Tool Gun is also used to control add-ons created by the community. Another popular Garry's Mod concept is ragdoll posing. The player can instantiate a ragdoll model from a Source game and pose it using a variety of tools.[7] This is a popular tool for making fan-made videos and machinimas. Garry's Mod takes advantage of the Source engine's modified version of the Havok Physics Engine,[8] which allows players to build contraptions that follow the laws of physics. In winter 2009/2010, a contest was held for Garry's Mod by the game's developers to create the best new game mode using a programming framework called "Fretta".[10] Fretta, Italian for "hurry", allows developers to quickly and easily create new game modes for Garry's Mod with commonly required functionality already implemented so the developers can focus on unique aspects of their game modes. Fretta was inspired by a similar fan created framework "Rambo_6's Simple Gamemode Base". However, for inclusion in Garry's Mod, Newman decided to rewrite it with input and contributions from the original author and other developers.[11] The winners of the contest range from a recreation of the Mafia party game to an aerial combat game mode.[12] The contest winners have been included in Garry's Mod with their own Steam Achievements.[13] Three of the winning games have been shipped, Trouble in Terrorist Town, Dogfight Arcade, and Prop Hunt. On September 7, 2010, Newman added a feature called the "Toybox" to Garry's Mod.[15] It utilizes the Amazon S3 service to download third party content, such as weapons, props, maps, game modes or models, directly to the users' machine while in game. In an interview with GMod news, Garry Newman said that "One of GMod's biggest draws is the amount of third party content. I want to make it easier for people to utilize that. I really want to move away from having to download files from websites and drag them to folders, thats old school. So thats what Im heading towards. Maps, models, saved games etc., all saved on the cloud and accessible with a click. Everything should be accessible from in-game. If it isnt, Ive failed

review: This is by far my favorite steam sandbox game! With the server aspect it allows you to play with all of your friends and have tons of fun with strangers. Personally my favorite gamemode in it is Jailbreak but thats my opinion, theres also TTT which is loads of fun, Deathrun and MUCH MUCH more!!!! I highly suggest this game to everyone who wants to have fun.

review: A Sandbox game created by Gary Newman with Valves Source Engine. It's one of the first games to recieve Sandbox support and one of the most played games on Steam. In Garry's Mod you have plenty of things to tinker with, for instance you can change the color of the skybox or sun, or you can spawn props to create your dream house, car, plane, boat, and if sandbox bores you? Well try out another gamemode made by other people, DarkRP and Flood are two great alternatives to sandbox. If you wanna truly test your imagination this game is a must have. rate 10/10

review: Garrys Mod is a brilliant sandbox which you can make thousands and thousands of things. Garrys mod also has hundreds of gamemodes like TTT (Trouble In Terrorist Town) or Prop Hunt even melon bomber. Garrys mod has an amazing community that is really friendly and helpfull Note you do come across a few horrible people but thats just the way the internet is. Garrys mod uses the workshop to its maximum potential with free dupes (Things people have made that you can spawn if they chose to publish it) mods (Mods are modifactions that make the game better or add things like maps, models, NPC's, vehicles and player models) Garrys mod got me into making things for the community such as this review or my guide on how to change it to night or the hover car I made. Anyway the point I am trying to make is that this is a great game. Thank you for your time and I hope I see you in game.

review: This game is one of the best sandbox games you'll find in the entirety of gaming. Gmod is a game designed to build and play. Ranging from using various objects to create bathtub catapults, office supply sleds, buildings made entirely of boats, whatever you want to build is yours. Not only is there building, there's also playing with a varieity of gamemodes like Gmod Tower (A Big Gamemode Hub and hangout!), Trouble in Terrorist Town (Find the bad players!), Prop Hunt (find the players disgused as objects in the area!), etc., it's one of the best games to play period.

review: Garrys Mod, a very large game by Facepunch Studios. It gives you the power to do so much and yet it always ends the same way, with blood splattered on the walls. To describe Garrys Mod is hard but possible, and in sections is the best way to do it. Garrys Mod is all about creation, it was originally designed as a sandbox game, where you can spawn hundreds of props in, weld them together and make incredible things. But that was a long time ago and Garrys Mod isnt just a game for welding things, now you can use winches, rope, hover balls, emitters, and a very large assortment of weapons. The game requires a few other games to be installed to see everything though. Source Mod games, the minimum amount of games youll need to see the most are the games; Team Fortress 2, Counterstrike: Source and Half Life: Source. The game can still be played without them but is better with them, you can spawn in props and characters from those games too. If you like the medic from TF2 why not rebuild the Meet The Medic video clip. Over the years of people playing around with Garrys Mod extra game modes were born; Spacebuild (original mod removed), Trouble in Terrorist Town, Murder, Prop Hunt, DarkRP, Sled Build, Bomber Man and many more. These game modes change the way Garrys Mod played, from once a game about welding to watermelons together and then blowing them up, to thing like finding a traitor and killing him, running from a knife wielding murderer, hiding as a pot plant in the snow and dropping explosive watermelons hoping to win the game. Apart from the sandbox, hundreds of servers and many game modes; Garrys Mod also has Steam Workshop support so you can share your creations, download others and play with them or even change the way the game plays like getting a tool that lets you change the weight of an object, a tool that makes props larger or smaller, a gun that shoots Nyan Cats and nuclear bombs you can strap to awesome looking cars that have thrusters stuck to its rear and have a big ramp in front of it hoping to make a big bang so to speak. If youre the type of person who likes building things, this is for you. If youre the type of person who likes killing people, this is for you. If youre the type of person who likes running into a war zone with balloons stuck to your ears then this is for you. This game is incredible and fits almost everyones needs; horror, sandbox, building, strategy, comedy and more. If I were to follow my normal rules for reviewing games and rating them out of 10. Id be lowering the rating millions of times over to make it low enough to fit. It is extremely fun and the rating 10/10 is an understatement.

Some of the addons could be: New/Custom Weapons New/Custom Maps New/custom (S)NPC's New/Custom Ragdolls More/Better Tools to help you build! And Much MUCH more!

review: Garry's Mod is a essentially a game where almost anything is possible becaue of the abillity to create your own gamemode and scripts with LUA. You will find that you get more value out of this game ($9.99) compared to another game i.e Call of Duty, which is usually priced alot higher ($50+). I personally think it is a must buy for people who are looking for a game where there are no predetermined goals and where you can do anything due to the large mass of user-generated content.

Well in Garry's mod, the potential for throwing large, everyday household objects at children is redesigning the way we think in everyday life. 11/10 would smash kid with stove again.

review: After playing Garrys mod for almost 2 years, I can say that G-Mod, is an amazing game, with endless possibilities. The game itself is full of SOmuch content, it's insane. But guess what, ALL THE CONTENT IS PLAYER-MADE!! What does this mean? It means that the game constantly has new things to offer, thanks to the workshop. As of December 6th, 2014, there is almost 472 thousand(472,000)entries to the workshop for G-Mod. It is the most active workshop on all of steam. About the game: It is an MMO Sandbox game, with a long list of gamemodes. The most famous of those gamemodes are "Trouble in Terrorist Town" "DarkRP", and "Sandbox". As said before, there is a lot of content, due to the active playerbase creating almost all of the content for Garrys Mod. Trouble in Terrorist Town(TTT): In this, there is the innocent, the detective, and the traitors. Usually, there is only a small amount of traitors randomly selected by the game, and the objective of this gamemode is for the traitors to kill all of the innocent terrorists. Sounds simple, right? WRONG. Everyone looks the same(Usually), and all have guns which are picked up. Guns(Usually)randomly spawn around the map. The detectives also can use tools to figure out who the traitor(s) are. So, the traitors have to be careful to not be caught, be suspicious, or be killed by themselves or the enviroment. DarkRP: In this gamemode, you play a role in a crazy society full of hitmen, drug dealers, police, citizens, gun dealers, and many more. The objective of this gamemode is based on what you want to do. You can build a gun shop as a gun dealer and provide weaponary for police, citizens, and/or gangsters. Be a police and arrest people who disobey the mayor, which creates rules for the city. Gangsters/Mafia members listen to their Mafia leader, or create havoc in the city, by mugging people, raiding houses, or kidnapping the mayor. Sandbox: You create stuff by yourself, or with other players, or destroy stuff, kill each other, whatever you want!! Time for a Pro and Con list. Pro: Always new content; A LOT of gamemodes to suit anyones taste; HUGE playerbase; Always something new Con: The game can be a huge memory killer, taking up a lot of memory due to workshop content(Before I cleaned out my workshop, the game, in totaly, was 52 giga-bytes). In short, I would very highly recommend this game. For being $10, it is severely underpriced for all the content it has.

review: The creators did a fantastic job of NOT including the textures you need to run the game, with the game. The red errors and purple and black checker boards are STUNNING, and truly aid to the overall immersion of the game.

I think that Garry has made a good game here. All the gamemodes are just so much fun to play, whether you are more into rolepaying or being a terrorist or murderer. All the games you want in the one, what more could you ask for?

review: Garry's Mod is the brainchild of Garry Newman, who wanted to create a physics-based sandbox based on the Source engine which also allows other players to create mods for the game too. So the game has a truly MASSIVE amount of variety. In singleplayer, you can build your own NPC arena, populate it with conflicting characters and watch them kill each other. On zombie survival, be a human fighting for your life while a zombie horde slowly infects the rest of your band of survivors. On Trouble in Terrorist Town, take control of a 'Traitor' Terrorist, and collaborate with other Traitors to wipe out all the 'Innocent' Terrorists, either through the use of a suicide bomb or sniping each innocent off, one by one. And in the excellent Dark RP, a multiplater role-playing mod built for the game, you start of as a citizen, but if you wish you can choose a different job, such as a police officer and take on crime head-on, or a mob boss with a gang the size of everyone in the server called 'The Tunnel Snakes' who own the cops through successful blackmail and bribery, or a sadistic gun dealer who's only pleasure is to kill everyone he sees, or a hobo and beg for money, or a hitman charging $100 per kill. Or just be a citizen and build. This game is fantastic!

review: Garry's Mod is what's wrong with America. By giving nearly unlimited power into the hands of Shrek filled twelve year old nerd lords, you create games such as Murder in Prop Town and Trouble Hunt. This game is Satan's spawn and goes against the good Christian morals. As a member of the 1%, this game goes against reality. If you die in the game, you can respond. In real life, I can loot your body and piss on your grave - without getting banned. Horrible game, 10/Donkey, better luck next time Lucifer.

review: In most of gaming, I would say Garry's Mod would be a pretty unique type of game in its own way. Without any singeplayer campaigns, or running off an FPS shooter. This game has made some top notch stuff in its latest years. Players have built giant robots and towers. While others create action scenes, like out of movies. Garry's Mod doesn't have a campaign, but makes up for it with limitless opportunities of playing in the multiplayer world. With it's many unique gamemodes made by perticular developers, or a group of coders. This game is certainly one of a kind. This game isn't meant for people are who love campaigns and are not as laid back. But if you are, this would be the game for you. ~

review: 0/10 I was killed by a box. Pay to win! 0/10 A child roared with his mic constantly (actual terminology is micspam, but this sounded like he stuck his microphone inside a washing machine, then went back to play Garry's Mod) only to be gagged by an moderator. The kid is then ungagged and proceeded to roar again! 100/10 I can spawn melons. In all seriousness, GMod is a great game. Look at my hours. There's modding and online play. And I hate to call it a sandbox, it's like a desert with an infinite amount of sand. Except you can do whatever you want with the sand and still stay cool inside your house with AC at the same time.

review: No game can exactly compare to Gmod. It is incredible. You can do so much and it is so fun. Whether you are sandboxing or playing Trouble in Terrorist Town, you will have lots of fun. This game has many pros. For starters, the incredible physics engine of Source combined with a sandbox game makes for some fun times. This game can be used for making animations, by spawning in ragdolls and positioning them where you want, and finally snapping a picture. You also get a lot for your $10 worth. Not only do you get sandbox (which is fun in itself) but you also have other games by the modding community build for Garry's Mod. These are games such as Stop it Slender, Trouble in Terrorist Town, Murder, Prop Hunt and many more. However, this game isn't perfect. This game has a few minor cons that are worth talking about. Firstly, if this is your first Steam purchase, or your first Source game purchase, you may run into a few problems. See, you need to buy a Source engine game. While that wasn't an issue for me (I personally got Steam for Portal once, now I use it much more) others may find themselves not being able to play GMod. Secondly, many of the games require Counter-Strike: Source. This was a problem for me, because I didn't want to pay $20 for CSS. I was able to get the textures off the internet (legally!) and mod my game so this was fixed, however many users may not want to do this. Finally, when you first play this game, you may have no idea what it is exactly, and just play Sandbox, which can get very boring. There's no guide or help to tell you there's anything else to do. To summerise, GMod is a great game that will keep getting better as it is updated and as the community of modders and other Workshop creators alike grows. However, because of some minor issues, this game deserves an 8.3 out of 10. I recommend this game, and you should definately buy it.

review: If i had to choose a word to describe this game it would be amazing.Although there is no legitimate goal to the game it is nice to screw around with friends and people you dont even know.There is so much to do and so much more with the addons you can install.The downfall to this game is that you have to get other Source games to get more gaming content.I understand that but its just kinda annoying when most of the addons in Garry's mod requires other games like Half Life:2 Episode 2,Counter Strike Source,Counter Strike:Global Offensive,and on some occasions Day of Defeat:Source.Even with those drawbacks Garry's mod is a game that I would play at least once a day.

review: A true Garry's Mod player does posing, animations, building, playing Dark RP and zombie survival. A true Gmod player plays on an online sandbox and keeps to himself but respects others, A true gmod player uploads good dupes and saves, a good gmod player makes workshop content. If you've ever been called a mingebag/minge or have called a minge a "clone" or only played past gmod 12, spawn dupes on servers or makes  sexual themed dupes or play's TTT, or Prop-hunt, you're likey to be a massive thundercunt who should GTFO and go find a completely new game. I do reccomend this game because the amount of good players there are out there seemingly just make the experience a whole lot better. Don't worry about the  mingebags.

review: A real bunch of laughs for everyone who plays it, Garry's Mod is a true piece of art. Whether you are new to this genre or a seasoned professional, I reccomend this game to everyone. You can create wonderful contraptions, glorious views or, if this does not appeal to you, just plain and simple beating the crap out of random objects and NPCs. There are thousands of modifications to the vanilla game, like extra maps, vehicles and weapons. So many weapons. So, in conclusion, wonderful game. The only real downside is that it tends to crash a lot if you have a lot of addons. Despite the downsides, I rate this game an 8.5/10.

It could be a fun RP game, or a Sled building racer, or a Prop Hunt game. I also love all the fun maps that the communtiy makes, its fun to run around a Horror map with a friends, or have a nuclear war in a large desert with lots of secret areas.

review: I think my hours played speaks for itself on this one but in case you're still not sure about whether or not to get Garry's Mod let me help you out. There are a seemingly infinite amount of ways to enjoy this game. So much content for such an incredibly low price. My personal favorite game modes are Prop Hunt and Murder. Not only is it fun to play but it's made for some excellent youtube content. The best Prop Hunt and Murder server I've been on is Lobster Build. I would definitely recommend checking out their servers when you get this game.

review: A real bunch of laughs for everyone who plays it, Garry's Mod is a true piece of art. Whether you are new to this genre or a seasoned professional, I reccomend this game to everyone. You can create wonderful contraptions, glorious views or, if this does not appeal to you, just plain and simple beating the crap out of random objects and NPCs. There are thousands of modifications to the vanilla game, like extra maps, vehicles and weapons. So many weapons. So, in conclusion, wonderful game. The only real downside is that it tends to crash a lot if you have a lot of addons. Despite the downsides, I rate this game an 8.5/10.

review: Where should i start off... well the bad things about Garry's Mod are the dreaded pink and black missing textures. To fix this, either buy the Counter Strike GO game or get the textures online and copy/paste files. That's pretty much all i can say for the cons of G-mod. There are so many good things about Garry's Mod i cant explain them all in one review so here are some of them: There are many gamemodes to play such as Sandbox [Build whatever you want or kill people], Zombie RP [Roleplay with zombies!], Dark RP [Roleplaying for your satisfaction], Prop Hunt [As a prop, hide somewhere where you wont be seen; As a hunter hunt down the hidden props but watch your health!], and so much more. If you dont like the normal Half Life 2 guns or style of it just go check out the wonderful addons for G-mod! There is so many addons such as TDM Cars [Realistic cars], The Slow Motion Mod [When activated makes everything go in slooooooww moooottiiiiooooon], World War 2 Soldiers [WWII soldiers textures, NPCs, and skins], and so much more. So, there is only one question: "Is it worth my money?" And the answer is "Yes! definetely get it!"

review: Now, before this review starts i just want to state a few things. I feel this game is unreviewable because theres no real storyline, no graphics to talk about, nothing like that. Ive read most reviews and all people say is this is their favorite game and that this game is the best. Nothing on the individual gamemodes that exist. Also as another note this game has no ESRB rating (The part of the game where it says rated E for Everyone or rated M for Mature), but yet there are gamemodes that parents would find inappropriate for kids. Thanks for reading this note and now onto the review. If you need some variety of games to do, this game is perfect for you. There are hundreds of different gamemodes to do, for example, the most famous ones being TTT (Trouble in Terrorist Town), Prop Hunt, Murder, Darkrp, and Hide and Seek. While there are many more like Gmod Dayz, MORBUS, and many rps, im only going to talk about the famous gamemodes. TTT is where you and everyone with you are terrorists, but there are traitors amound you. The Innocents must figure out who the Traitors are and kill them before the Traitors kill the Innocents. If you like the Detective/Action/Comedy genres this is the best gamemode for that. Just make sure to watch your back, you never know when a traitor might have a rifle pointed at your head. Murder is a pretty simple game where there are Bystanders and a Murderer, but one Bystander has a secret weapon, a Magnum. Just like TTT the Bystanders have to figure out who the Murderer is before the Murderer kills everyone. Its pretty much same genres as TTT too. So get out there and find yourself a Killer Boys. Hide and Seek, well if you havent played this game as a kid then look it up on the internet. DarkRp is a roleplay where you must follow all rules and pretend to be someone else basically. There are many Rps out there such as Military RP, SovietRP, FalloutRP,and many more. If you enjoy RPs in other games for example you enjoy DayZRP for DayZ then youll enjoy this. Depending on what rp you do there are different genres. So Enjoy being someone else and messing around with the Mafia. Prop Hunt is a gamemode where there are two sides, Props and Hunters. If your a Prop then your job is to find some item like a fish or bottle and either find a really good hiding spot or hide in plain sight. If your a Hunter then you have to find the Props and shoot them in order to win. Great gamemode if you want a lot of laughs. While i have left out my favorite Gamemodes for Gmod (Deathrun, MORBUS and Jailbreak), I hope this Review was helpful and you buy this game and make lots of friends. You can meet amazing people in any Gamemode and you can find people who are jerks. So please enjoy the game and have a nice day!

review: I am the mayor of a small town. I must be honest, life here is rather odd. The hobos are planning an uprising for no apparent reason and one of them seems to be a Taliban supporter. Crime rate is sky-high here, i keep getting kidnapped for that 15 i have stached away in my bank account and the Terrorist group, "Ponysquirts.jpg", want me to remove the law that legalizes money printers and drugs. Also, there's this restaurant which also sells drugs in which sometimes people randomly light up on fire and then speak complete and utter gibberish such as "waaiiit weiaiatt mus tll u bout mikerosuhpht XL". We are also at war with the sewer demons, intent of enslaving us "surface dwellers" by slashing us with Damascus Swords. Luckily, we're able to combat them with our elite SWAT unit led by an 8 year old who is currently running around the fountain telling everyone to "RAISE YOUR DONGERS!  ". I decided to abdicate from mayorhood and look for other oppertunities. I found myself as a security guard in the theatre for my friend who had joined me on the server. I return from having a piss to find out he's turned the theatre into a strip club and the cinema shows graphic, sexual anime scenes. After I saw the video "ME!ME!ME!" up on there, my life changed forever. You know those videos which are so weird and scary that you just can't explain? Yeah, this was one of those. It's even worse than Hentai. That's all I can say really. Also, hobos have taken over the bank and have turned it into "The First Church of Shrek". So, I quit my job as a security guard and became a Police Officer. My friend i mentioned earlier became a hobo and renamed his job to "Yoshi's Pet". The new Mayor (who was swag by the way) granted him permission to be in the PD and even store a printer in there. Unfortunately, it seems the rest of the police force are illiterate. They keep arresting him for being in the PD even though the mayor keeps telling them he's allowed inside. Then, on a fateful night i realise there are 5 armed men raiding the PD. I decide to take action and arrest EVERY. SINGLE. ONE OF THEM. \(^_^)/ Unfortunately, this is when things take a turn for the worst. All 5 of them start yelling "RDA" (random arrest) in the chat and the admin comes along and looks into it. He was obviously gullible enough to believe those boring sods because the next thing i know, i've been banned for a week for "Mass RDA" Oh yeah, the sandbox and trouble in terrorist modes are cool, too. 9/11 All the Admins are horny pre-teens or younger.

review: #YOLO This, comes in mind when you think about everything you can make. Garry's mod is the ultimate sandbox game. It does crash many times because of addons, or you need some source game, other then CSS, you will usually need all source game to be sure to have every single addon to work. You can do wahtever you want, Workshop allow you to add more content to this game, which add more stuff, to maximise your experience of building, roleplaying, Ragdoll posing ( making scenes with ragolls ). You can choose to play with the game itself, the "basic" choice, or add more complex addons like Wiremod, which will introduce a kind of logic to Garry'smod, and this will allow you to make Ingame computers, Automated Contraptions, and even more like holographics fancy stuff ! 9/10 Because of the stability

review: A true Garry's Mod player does posing, animations, building, playing Dark RP and zombie survival. A true Gmod player plays on an online sandbox and keeps to himself but respects others, A true gmod player uploads good dupes and saves, a good gmod player makes workshop content. If you've ever been called a mingebag/minge or have called a minge a "clone" or only played past gmod 12, spawn dupes on servers or makes  sexual themed dupes or play's TTT, or Prop-hunt, you're likey to be a massive thundercunt who should GTFO and go find a completely new game. I do reccomend this game because the amount of good players there are out there seemingly just make the experience a whole lot better. Don't worry about the  mingebags.

But i am making this sound like a horrible game. It is not it is such a creative game but the people who play are mixed. Do you like to RP, build, kill? Well this is a game for you. Now if you came like this "Oh boy i saw seananners play this i think its called prop hunt and ttt seems like so much fun!" Then dont play because the people will tear you to the ground. Let me explain RP. its fun with friends can be even more fun with good people. But minges are everywhere so prepare for them. The worst thing your going to encounter in this game is ADMINS!! These beast are 12-16 year olds who are power hungry or are always angry if your lucky you will find the good admins. TTT: can be fun if you like mystery this is a game for you Murder is like this so it won't get a seperate thing Minges get dealt with quick But admins will perma ban you on a instant for one mistake If you are lucky you will get a good server hard to come by Prophunt: This is the most known one i believe. Haven't played much but haven't seen much badmins. Fairly simple be a prop hide and get hunted. Hide and seek is alot like this so it won't get a thing. That sums it up pretty much. Don't suspect to have fun all the time. The game can be really fun. Good luck and prepare for fun and hardship. Sincerely,Kungpow Chicken

review: This is a fantastic Sandbox game. With several of its amazing features. from ragdoll posing to making a Combine survival. However, the only flaw I genuinely see is that when I have several addons they seem to conflict with my source game material, with a few glitches here and there, its entirely plausible its just my game however, This game will still provide a large amount of enjoyment.

review: Review: Garry's Mod is a physics sandbox. Unlike regular games there aren't any predefined aims or goals. The game's makers give you the tools and leave you to play! You spawn objects and weld them together to create your own contraptions. You can basically turn Garry's Mod into another game, one example is when I joined a intense Call of Duty server. The TTT (Trouble in Terrorist Town) servers are amazingly addictive. My Most Favorite Part of Garry's Mod: I really like how you can basically do anything in Garrys Mod. I really like playing on TTT (Trouble in Terrorist Town) because they are really fun. What I Don't Like About Garry's Mod: There isn't really anything I hate about this game. One thing they could improve are the graphics. Rating: 9.5 Amazing

review: BEST. GAME. EVER!!!! Garry's Mod is amazing. Garry is a genius. Garry's Mod is literally the first game that I never even a little bit regretted buying. This game is amazing. If you like Minecraft, you'll get into Garry's Mod and be like, what do you even do? And then you'll build a vehicle out of bathtub and then make a turret and then get a bunch of mods and then roleplay and then get 500 hours on the game like me. You can trust me on this. Garry's Mod EXPERTISE. I think that's how you spell it... Anyways, best $10.00 I've ever spent! (I actually got it at a sale for $5.00.) Roleplaying in this game is amazing, get some silly playermodels from the workshop and then be like, I'm spiderman! And then you'll want to restart the server because you want a spiderman gun mod. Best sandbox game in the world. Garry's Mod makes me notice how cool source engine is. Especially ragdolls. Once you get the game (as I said, it IS a must get.) you'll start being like, "I got an idea! Let's get Frozen Elsa and Anna ragdolls from the workshop (there's a million Frozen mods so this is the easiest example.) and then fight with them and make epic scenes like Elsa dramatically jumping from an explosion or make Anna's head big and then turn into a spaceship. A lot of sandbox games are like, (read this in a stupid voice) "Oh, in Minecraft the possibilities are endless!" My reaction: Really? In an E 10+ game? All you can do in Minecraft is see pictures and play adventure maps that have EPIC builds and then get all inspired and then you'll be like, I'm going to make the best Minecraft mansion ever! And then you build crap and then you cry. But in Garry's Mod, Garry's Mod Garry's Mod Garry's Mod... you can freakin shoot people, roleplay, make machinimas, (you can in Minecraft too but they're crap unless you animate it.) you can even (as I said before) make a vehicle out of a bathtub! (True story. I did it once.) Garry's Mod is amazing. Minecraft is crap. Oh! I just got an idea. The new name is... Minecrap! Yeah, that's clever... AND WHAT THE HELL?! Minecraft is a freaking like $35.00! I can name like more than 50 games (kind of over exadurating more of like 20) that are better than Minecrap! And the first is Garry's Mod. I bet there's someone reading this being like Minecraft's cool... Well, I ask you this Minecrap Fan. Have you ever built anything in Minecrap that isn't comeplete rubbish? Sorry. This is a Garry's Mod review. Not a Minecrap one. Well, but there you have it. Like 2 reasons I think why I hate Minecrap. And one is a big reason. And if you don't know that by now your probably a Minecrap Fan because you skipped the part about Minecrap.

review: Warning: this game will remove your complete productive life! If you have a job/school/wife/children please don't play this game or you'll most likely lose them! Actually i would call this game a engine, where developers can build gamemodes(aka collection of scripts providing logic and a goal), maps, etc and can distribute their creations with a few clicks in the workshop, and gamers can access creations of developers easy. I call it 300 games for just the price of 1 game! The community behind garrysmod is very active and there's still much development going on. This game is suited for every gamer, doesn't matter if he/she is a casual or hardcore gamer. You can play it like a sandbox game where everything is possible, or you could play it like a FPS in zombiesurvival or trouble in terrorist town. For the spacefreaks there's even a gamemode with spaceships, FTL in 3D :D. and for the roleplayer there are tons of rp gamemodes! The only true way to get the experience of this great game(actually multiple games/gamemodes :P ) is to buy it, get cs:s also as many gamemodes need it. Thousands of servers you may like, hunderds gamemodes you certainly will like.

review: I don't even know where to start with this game... This game you can put in 500 hours and not even play one fifth of the game it's a sandbox which lets people make their own game modes, rules, models, maps, scripts, weapons, structures... Its amazing! It's fun on TTT (Trouble in Terrorist Town) Muder (Basically Michael Myers) Death Run (A very Fun Competitive game mode) Sandbox (Do what ever you feel like doing) Dark RP (A very well Role Playing its very sketchy lead twards the name chosen for it "Dark RP") there is about 100 more game modes that are really fun by this game it's only like $10.00 and get some friends to play it with you it makes it even better :D 5/5

review: Have you ever wanted to play games in a game? Garry's Mod is your game! GMod is a game where you can create your own games, join other games other people build, Have a mic? GMod haves a button to talk with your microphone! Cool, right? Its always fun, and the community.. Well, the community is okay. But not everything is perfect, right? :) And dont start about the mods, they are INCREDIBLE! From Murderer to Prophunt, Gmod has it all! Dont worry about getting bored, that wont happen for anytime soon, i played this for about 11.5hours already, and i loved it all. Community-made games, that is plain awesome! But you can also host a sandbox/mini game, and invite your friends! Lets just say its very good, right? Its worth the money. My rating is 9.5/10

A very intresting and fun game but dont get me wrong there is still a few bugs. Servers tend to be polite and very fun but if you join the wrong type of server then you will be hit with a ton of bugs a graphic problems. I would recommend it but with a caution beware of the bugs and be willing to put in the hours :).

review: With the variety of games and player-base thanks to the community surrounding it, Garry's mod is one of the most fun sandboxes I have ever played. There are still a few issues with the game itself, but once you work around them (given that they haven't been fixed) the entirety of the game is a ball of enjoyment that one would happily waste hours of their lives on. Would recommend to any casual gamer who's looking for a laugh.

review: This review is very short. Garry's Mod is not a game. It is a physics toy and sandbox style tool. In Gmod, you can reluctantly do whatever you want to. You can: build things such as cars, buildings, bunkers, airships, boats, or whatever you can think up, use weapons from other valve games, as well as add-on weapons created by other people, play with physics, kill NPCs with literally anything, drive a world of vehicles, paint, destroy stuff, spawn props, spawn ragdolls to pose and beat up, make a machinima for use on Youtube or other video websites, listen to music, and MUCH MUCH more. There are addons to download, like maps and player models. The maps can vary from Counter Strike to Team Fortress, Portal to Garry's Mod, and Day Of Defeat to Left 4 Dead. A very addicting toy from Team Garry.

The servers iv been on so far are very friendly and dont just stick on the same map. so i give this game 11/10 and 5 stars. iv only been playing on it for a few months now and still have so much to discover.

review: Well, time to try out this new review system; Garry's mod is pretty much the ultimate sandbox game, it is supported by the majority of the Steam community (which people who have been here a while will know is the best community) and has hundreds of hours worth of gameplay added by players every day, the array of gametypes (also made by the community) can give you gameplay ranging from watching YouTube with your friends, to a multiplayer version of popular Unity game; Slender. Though, as the title of the game suggests, this started off as a mod for the Source engine, and though it no longer requires all the original Half-Life 2 content, many gametypes will use content from Source games Team Fortress 2, CounterStrike: Source and Half-Life 2: Episodes 1 and 2, though the fact that you may need to buy more than one title to fully enjoy this one may shy you away from playing, you must keep in mind that these are Valve games, and so will most likely deliver many hours of quality gameplay! (especially CounterStrike!) The diversity of the gameplay, from construction to recreation to destruction, provides at least one thing everyone will enjoy, and if you see a gap, something you find the game missing, learn LUA and get to the Steam Workshop!

review: Garrys Mod, Uhhh where to start. I personally love this game. The physics are just.. I dont know anymoar. If you like humourous creations. And lots of gamemodes, This is the game for you. I dont know what makes this game so funny, Could it be over the 100+ gamemodes they have? Or just the fact that you could build the silliest things evar on here. If I had the money I would buy there company. There income is so great. Just because of this silly game. Its nearly impossible to not laugh while on this game. I enjoy this game so much. I just cant express how well put-up this game is. Which leaves me to say. BUY GMOD BEST GAME EVAR 2K14 720NOSCOPECOLLATORALWALLBANG. !!Gg No re!! All humor aside. Buy this game.

review: There's so much to say about this game, but I'm not going to force you to stay. Garry's Mod is the god amon all the sandbox games, theres so many gamemodes to play and so many ways you can play them, My most played gamemodes are DarkRP and Trouble in Terrorist Town. DarkRP is just roleplaying but theres so may ways to play it in, You can be a thief and raid or mug people or you could be a hobo and beg for money on the streets. Or you could have a Terrorists vs Civil Protection war. And so much more. Trouble in Terrorist Town is a gamemode were three "teams" exists, Tratiors, Innocents and Detectives. The traitors job is to kill every innocent and detective before the round is over, and the funny part is that not any innocent or detective knows whos the traitor. The innocents and detectives are then supposed to figure out whos the traitor. After about 900~ hours of this game I'm still not getting tired to start up Garry's Mod and have fun with friends. This is a 11/10 game in all the ways, even if you break the game you allways laugh becouse it just looks so fun.

review: I think my hours played speaks for itself on this one but in case you're still not sure about whether or not to get Garry's Mod let me help you out. There are a seemingly infinite amount of ways to enjoy this game. So much content for such an incredibly low price. My personal favorite game modes are Prop Hunt and Murder. Not only is it fun to play but it's made for some excellent youtube content. The best Prop Hunt and Murder server I've been on is Lobster Build. I would definitely recommend checking out their servers when you get this game.

review: Garry's Mod, the reason I got steam, the reason I joined the glorious PC master race! Garry's Mod isn't a game in the traditional sense, you aren't put somewhere and given a goal, you are given many tools and pretty much can do whatever the  you want! Wanna build a rocket ship? Go ahead! Wanna create a movie? Go ahead! Wanna create a porno in it? Uhh that's a bit weird... but go ahead! The possibilities are ENDLESS, there's soo much to do, and this is just the single player experience, don't forget the hundreds of Game Modes like DarkRP, Surf, Flood, PirateShipWars, StopItSlender the list goes on, if you can, BUY THIS GAME!

review: This game is for people who like diversity. As in the name, there are many mods in the game like Trouble in Terrorists town, in which you try to figure out who is the enemy, or go on a bloodthirsty rampage. Mods like DarkRP and 1982RP makes it so that you roleplay with many others. Then there is the famous sandbox, where you can create demon zombies, pool parties and even terrorist dinosaurs! I give this game 9 out of 10 stars.

You'll NEVER get bored, it's worth every penny, trust me.

review: This is a sandbox game, so that can probably tell you a lot about this game. If thats not enough for you, just imagine this: Your nuclear bomb is primed, and ready to detonate in 30 seconds as a fleet of Stormtroopers shoot at you. You sprint away as fast as you can, board your V-22 Osprey, and fly away. All of the sudden, your fuel is low! Thankfully, you were right over your intended destination: a fallout shelter! You look at the time...5 seconds left! You enter the shelter, and watch out the window as a huge mushroom cloud shrouds over half the entire map, as everything but your shelter is decimated into oblivion. All of this can be accomplished in-game. The best part: you dont have to have a good computer! My friend has an i3 HP Pavilion, and he can run it just as good as me! It also has a huge fanbase with tons of support pages, with everything being driven by the workshop. Questions? Contact me! I'll gladly help you.

review: BEST. GAME. EVER!!!! Garry's Mod is amazing. Garry is a genius. Garry's Mod is literally the first game that I never even a little bit regretted buying. This game is amazing. If you like Minecraft, you'll get into Garry's Mod and be like, what do you even do? And then you'll build a vehicle out of bathtub and then make a turret and then get a bunch of mods and then roleplay and then get 500 hours on the game like me. You can trust me on this. Garry's Mod EXPERTISE. I think that's how you spell it... Anyways, best $10.00 I've ever spent! (I actually got it at a sale for $5.00.) Roleplaying in this game is amazing, get some silly playermodels from the workshop and then be like, I'm spiderman! And then you'll want to restart the server because you want a spiderman gun mod. Best sandbox game in the world. Garry's Mod makes me notice how cool source engine is. Especially ragdolls. Once you get the game (as I said, it IS a must get.) you'll start being like, "I got an idea! Let's get Frozen Elsa and Anna ragdolls from the workshop (there's a million Frozen mods so this is the easiest example.) and then fight with them and make epic scenes like Elsa dramatically jumping from an explosion or make Anna's head big and then turn into a spaceship. A lot of sandbox games are like, (read this in a stupid voice) "Oh, in Minecraft the possibilities are endless!" My reaction: Really? In an E 10+ game? All you can do in Minecraft is see pictures and play adventure maps that have EPIC builds and then get all inspired and then you'll be like, I'm going to make the best Minecraft mansion ever! And then you build crap and then you cry. But in Garry's Mod, Garry's Mod Garry's Mod Garry's Mod... you can freakin shoot people, roleplay, make machinimas, (you can in Minecraft too but they're crap unless you animate it.) you can even (as I said before) make a vehicle out of a bathtub! (True story. I did it once.) Garry's Mod is amazing. Minecraft is crap. Oh! I just got an idea. The new name is... Minecrap! Yeah, that's clever... AND WHAT THE HELL?! Minecraft is a freaking like $35.00! I can name like more than 50 games (kind of over exadurating more of like 20) that are better than Minecrap! And the first is Garry's Mod. I bet there's someone reading this being like Minecraft's cool... Well, I ask you this Minecrap Fan. Have you ever built anything in Minecrap that isn't comeplete rubbish? Sorry. This is a Garry's Mod review. Not a Minecrap one. Well, but there you have it. Like 2 reasons I think why I hate Minecrap. And one is a big reason. And if you don't know that by now your probably a Minecrap Fan because you skipped the part about Minecrap.

review: Warning: this game will remove your complete productive life! If you have a job/school/wife/children please don't play this game or you'll most likely lose them! Actually i would call this game a engine, where developers can build gamemodes(aka collection of scripts providing logic and a goal), maps, etc and can distribute their creations with a few clicks in the workshop, and gamers can access creations of developers easy. I call it 300 games for just the price of 1 game! The community behind garrysmod is very active and there's still much development going on. This game is suited for every gamer, doesn't matter if he/she is a casual or hardcore gamer. You can play it like a sandbox game where everything is possible, or you could play it like a FPS in zombiesurvival or trouble in terrorist town. For the spacefreaks there's even a gamemode with spaceships, FTL in 3D :D. and for the roleplayer there are tons of rp gamemodes! The only true way to get the experience of this great game(actually multiple games/gamemodes :P ) is to buy it, get cs:s also as many gamemodes need it. Thousands of servers you may like, hunderds gamemodes you certainly will like.

This game you can put in 500 hours and not even play one fifth of the game it's a sandbox which lets people make their own game modes, rules, models, maps, scripts, weapons, structures... Its amazing! It's fun on TTT (Trouble in Terrorist Town) Muder (Basically Michael Myers) Death Run (A very Fun Competitive game mode) Sandbox (Do what ever you feel like doing) Dark RP (A very well Role Playing its very sketchy lead twards the name chosen for it "Dark RP") there is about 100 more game modes that are really fun by this game it's only like $10.00 and get some friends to play it with you it makes it even better :D 5/5

GMod haves a button to talk with your microphone! Cool, right? Its always fun, and the community.. Well, the community is okay. But not everything is perfect, right? :) And dont start about the mods, they are INCREDIBLE! From Murderer to Prophunt, Gmod has it all! Dont worry about getting bored, that wont happen for anytime soon, i played this for about 11.5hours already, and i loved it all. Community-made games, that is plain awesome! But you can also host a sandbox/mini game, and invite your friends! Lets just say its very good, right? Its worth the money. My rating is 9.5/10

I currently have 1000+ hours, and I have met about all my friends on this game, as so as other amazing people. This game has amazing gamemodes like TTT, Deathrun, Jailbreak, GMTower, Minigames, and so much more. This game gives a unique experience you will ever have. It is not like Minecraft or any regular FPS shooter, but it mixes just about everything you will ever play in this. I recommend this game a lot, and you will not regret spending under $15 dollars for this game.

Other than that it is a great game to buy and play with friends

And there's tons of billion gamemodes to keep you interested in game while you didn't know what to make in sandbox, plat Trouble in Terrorist Town and be super suspicious, play RP and life as a citizen, police, robberm gangster, and even headcrabs on some server. Playing alone will get you bored, get a friend and you'll have some more fun, pretty much worth the bucks since this game makes me addicted to it, man I wish i could use wiremod :P

review: I dont know how to write a review. I DO know how to tell you if something is good. This is good. Also, heres a recipe for pancakes (4 servings): First, heres what youll need: 1 cup of flower. 1 tablespoon of baking powder. 1 tablespoon of sugar. 1/2 teaspoon of salt. 1 egg, beaten. 1 cup of milk. 2 tablespoons of vegtable oil A Frying pan/Griddle/Skillet (not skrillex) A source of heat. *now your ready to get baking... or is it cooking? idk* Mix together flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt. Combine eggs, milk, and oil. Add liquid ingredients to dry ingredients, stirring until just moist. Let mixture rest 30 seconds. Spoon or pour onto greased, hot griddle or nonstick skillet. Cook pancakes on the first side until bubbles appear on the upper surface. Turn over and cook until the bottom is golden. You can make a nice variation on these by adding a mashed black banana and 1/2 teaspoon of cinammon to the batter. Yum? 11/10 would burn pancakes again.

review: Garry's Mod is what molded my programming mindset. Being able to code in a 3D sandbox world with LUA is amazing, and I see it as a major stepping stone in my path to becoming who I am today. Although I have grown out of making awesome stuff for hours a day... I really wish I had the time to come back and appreciate what this engine had to offer.

review: The variety of games, plugins, addons and mods this game has is what makes it stand out. The Simple sandbox singleplayer, and the limitless games of multiplayer adds countless entertainment value, for 10 bucks you will be playing, hour, after hour, after hour. Whether being paranoid in Trouble in Terrorist Town, or playing Cops and Robbers, this game is the best mod of the Source Engine to date.

If you are troublesome, ask the doctor or a psychiatrist and they might recommend you to watch Gmod. About the game, it's really awesome. ''Modding at it's finest'' they said. Best modding game/tool, and awesome experiencing. I mean, everything is possible in many ways. Everything is permitted! -Hassan I Sabbah :D

review: Should you buy gmod? Well I will tell you how I became Robin to give you a rough idea of what gmod is like. I hadn't been on garrys mod in a while and needed to uninstall some games so I tried it out. I instantly went online and looked for a new server to join and came across a server known as DerpRP under the DarkRP section of multiplayer. As soon as I got onto the server I was confronted by a rocket launcher wielding Hitler and Batman. I attemtped to pee on Hitler and he responded by pulling a shotgun and demanding I get in his sex dungeon. They locked me in the room for 10 minutes and give me a baby doll covered in blood to play with before executing me. When I respawned I came out into the street to see a large group of people get blown up by Batman and my goal became clear to me. I must... Team up with them and build a bank where we steal peoples printers. Unfortunatly by the time we had finished the bank I had to go so they requested that I left gmod running. When I arrived home I found that Batman and Hitler and stolen all my printers destroyed my base and murdered me before leaving the bank alarm on for all my neighbours to hear coming out of my full volume speakers. Seconds after I respawned I was then mugged by an angry group of hobos who eventually pushed me infront of a train but when it looked like I was going to die again Hitler and Batman showed up wielding swords. The hobos scattered and made dolphin noises as they ran away getting chased by a pissed off Hitler. Batman placed a couch that he had in his pocket on the track and escaped with only a split second to spare. As me and Batman emerged from the underground train station I looked up into the sky and thought to myself damn this is bad  before Hitler reappeared and blew us both up. Garrys mod isnt only a great game its a great game to make friends. To this date me and Hitler and Batman still go round invading french servers which dont have any admins and murdering innocent civilains. But thats what makes gmod so fun. You can do litterlay anything. I would reccomend Garrys Mod to everyone that has a sense of humour and/or a soul. Gmod is love. Gmod if life

review: One of my favorite games of all time. Mainly because it isnt just one game, as there are many mods that turn it into other games. It could be a fun RP game, or a Sled building racer, or a Prop Hunt game. I also love all the fun maps that the communtiy makes, its fun to run around a Horror map with a friends, or have a nuclear war in a large desert with lots of secret areas.

review: "Oh. Okay. G-Garrys mod. Alright, lets do this. ...I don't know. it's a game that isn't always the same game. that's good..i suppose." That was what i said about this game a year ago. Lots have changed. So, I don't enjoy this game anymore. It's just getting to the point where it's painful to play, due to simple boredom. If you haven't played something like it before, great. Go get it. But, i can't play it anymore. 1247 hours, man. Anyway, Recommended it. But, it gets INCREDIBLY boring after some time. Go team.

review: Possibly the greatest sandbox mod to ever exist. Combining Source games with this mod is revolutionary! No mod has ever been this creative. If this game didn't have the Steam Workshop then this game would never be as good as it is now. And the fact that they made this back in 2006 is incredible! If any other company tried to make a replica of Garry's Mod in 2014 I reckon It would be awful. 10/10

review: Garry's mod is one of the best sandbox/community driven games on PC and possible in Gaming. If you are going to buy this, you should buy CS:S with it since many game modes use those textures in it. Sandbox mode is nice, you can do many things in that but many people also love to play on game modes, I would recommend TTT as a nice game mode if you find a good server but the sky is the limit in Gmod gamemodes(actaully it is the engine but eh). There are so many things to be said about this game and this review would go on for pages if you were to explain every single custom gamemode that is on garry's mod and you will get you 10/5/2.5 euro or whatever the price is out of it since there is constantly new content developed on servers. A great game with a good community if you know where to look.

review: Garry's mod is a sandbox game. If your not into sandboxes theres many more you can do. Terror In Terrorist Town, Prophunt, Roleplay, Gmod Tower, ect. The only requirements are source engines. Such as Counterstrike Source, Half-Life 2 or Day of Defeat Source. The long loading is just to load all the big stuff to make you enjoy the game as much as possible. So whats the bad stuff you ask...Just spazzing ragdolls, RDMers, missing textures...Nah. First, Spazzing models are funny. Second, RDMers can be kicked or banned by moderators. Unless you have godmode, heh. Third, Missing models can be stopped with buying the source engines. "bu7 whi doesn7 t7 w0rk in gm0d t0wa" Well, first. It clearly says download their texture packs. Exactly. I give this game 10/10 stars for not being other than good. Well, you saw this. Now go play the game! :D

review: Garry's Mod is a great example of what more sandbox multiplayer also games should be doing! This product is a extremely fun sandbox, that is entertaining. It doesn't compare though to its open community! Garry's Mod's community is great! Because of that it is still rapidly coming out with gamemodes the community is making tons of gamemodes, items, props, etc. From Trouble in Terrorist Town (personal favorite), and extremely recommend to Prop Hunt (another personal favorite)! it has tons of options to do with friends and more. ( Each divided into categories of 5/5 ) +: EPIC Gamemodes 5/5 +: Cheap Price of $10 +: EXTREMELY fun 4.5/5 - : Needs multiple games to work properly TOTAL SCORE: 9.5

review: Garry's Mod is flat out amazing. It is my favorite game I have on steam. I have lots of experience with this game, and I have a little over 100 hours played. I really recommend this game, because it has lots of features and lots to offer. Pros: -Lots of maps (especially if you have TF2) -Lots of selection for multiplayer -Achievements -With a click of a button you can add your interests into this game with addons and workshops -Lots of things to build with -It's popular so more people to play with -You can technically do anything with this game in single player I could go on, but I think that is enough. Cons: -Takes forever to get into multiplayer servers -Multiplayer is laggy -Its one of those popular games so it doesn't have the greatest community Those are the only reasons I can think of, because this game is just so great. I really recemmend this game, its a great price, it's only $9.99. I hope this review helped.

review: The variety of games, plugins, addons and mods this game has is what makes it stand out. The Simple sandbox singleplayer, and the limitless games of multiplayer adds countless entertainment value, for 10 bucks you will be playing, hour, after hour, after hour. Whether being paranoid in Trouble in Terrorist Town, or playing Cops and Robbers, this game is the best mod of the Source Engine to date.

review: Countless type of games modes, a great community and you can even create all sorts of things. It's hard to let go of garry's mod and there's always something new to discover. With friend or on you own, you'll still enjoy this game because you'll always ended up meeting fun peoples and have a blast. The only letdown (even thougt it's justified in a way) is that, to get the full experience, you absolutely need other games sources like Counter-Strike and Half-Life which are sold seperately. And even though it's not that often, i stumbled upon different kind of bugs (like game crashing, lags, bugged/misplaced interface), they make the game inconvenient here and there but not enought to ruin the experience.

review: Yet another Briliant game from VALVE, if you are thinking about getting this game GET IT it is the most addictive game in the history of games TO BE WARNED: #1 As i am in Australia i can not connect to well to american servers, But there are still 100's of communitys out there who play the most common gamemodes. #2 Do not judge the game via the single player, Multiplayer is the way to go with 100's of game modes and 10's of thousands of players every second All the popular gamemodes (as of 31/01/14) Gamemode number #1 Ttt (also know as trouble in terrorist town) is a game were you can be picked to play as 1 of 3 "classes" if you will, they are: Innocent: Were you are to kill all the traitors before they kill you (note do not kill anyone for looking sus) Tratior: You are there to kill anyone with any means possible But do not get caught doing so this will result in people killing you Detective: You are basicly an innocent but with a twist. if you find a dead body you can id it finding the dna of a tratior, You are a huge influance on the game therfore you are a target to the tratiors Trying staying in a large group. (my fav)Gamemode number #2 Darkrp, darkrp is a game all about roleplaying you can become anything from a cop to a hardcore murderer, do make sure you read the rules on this gamemode as there are a lot of way to be banned or kicked on this gamemode Gamemode number #3 Prop Hunt, Prop hunt is a game were there are two teams these teams are: The prop: you can turn into anything you can see, Make sure you blend into the enviroment or you will be found and killed by the Hunters: This class is the class that goes around looking for the props by searching the enviroment for "differences" and then if they feel the need that can shot it, but if they get it wrong depending on how many props they hit they loss 5- 95 health so be warned. So this is garrys mod, i would recomend this to anyone even my grammar! i give it a 10/10. And i see my self playing this sucker for a long time to come :). (sorry for grammar and spelling mistakes i wrote this up in 2 minutes)

This is the thing, Its a 50/50 negative/positive, you see, the game itself is fun because you can do what you want, however, too many minecraft 6 year olds came on and ed the game up with $500,000,000,000 donates just to be able to spawn something. So theres my review, I say buy the game, but prepare yourself for some  people. (DONT EVEN GET ME STARTED ON DARKRP THESE DAYS.)

review: Garry's Mod is with out a doubt the best game on Steam I own. You can spend countless hours playing and still find new and intersting things to do. Almost anything can be created wether you build it in Sandbox, or develope it in LUA, the possibilites are endless. Garry's Mod ships with two default gamemodes, Sandbox and Trouble in Terrorist town. Sandbox is simply what you make of it. The main point to sandbox is to create new contraptions, and play around with them. Sandbox has no real goal to it unless you make one yourself. And the other gamemode, Trouble in Terrorist Town, actually has a point to it. In Touble in Terrorist Town you spawn [randomly] as a Traitor, Innocent, or Detective. The Traitors goal is to try and eliminate the Innocent and Detectives, while the Innocent and Detectives goal is to find out who the Traitor(s) are, and try to eliminate them instead! Garry's Mod also supports customgamemodes. Every other gamemode, besides Sandbox and Trouble in Terrorist town have been made by the community. Gamemode creation takes time, patience and knowledge. There are many different gamemodes that have been created, ranging from Sandbox and Trouble in Terrorist town spin-offs, to roleplay, deathmatch, survival, and more! Finding a new gamemode to play is as easy as opening the in-game server browser and joining a server. Every server in Garry's Mod is run by the community, there are no server's hosted by the games creators. Server's run any gamemode they choose, and how the choose. Server's are able to add addons, created by the community, to make the experience more enjoyable for everyone. Addons are another thing that Garry's Mod shines at. Addons are made by the community, like most everything, and usually help to heighten your overall fun while playing. Thousands and thousands of addons of every sort have been made through Garry's Mods existence. There are addons ranging from roller coaster creators, new and different weapons and tools, new maps, and almost anything you can think of! Overall, I belive that Garry's Mod can be an enjoyable game for anyone. What you get out of playing Garry's Mod is what you make it. Since Garry's Mod has no pre-define goals, you can really do just about anything, and then some. Garry's Mod is worth the amazingly cheap price tag.

review: Not only does this game host a sandbox for tons of possibilities, it holds player-made gamemodes to play for thousands of hours (as you can see by my number of hours played). Once I heard of Garry's Mod, I got it for TTT, but then I found other gamemodes like DarkRP, Spacebuild 3, Pirate Ship Wars, and Sledbuild. These things made me a busy man for a very long time, and that time is still going on right now!

I currently have 1000+ hours, and I have met about all my friends on this game, as so as other amazing people. This game has amazing gamemodes like TTT, Deathrun, Jailbreak, GMTower, Minigames, and so much more. This game gives a unique experience you will ever have. It is not like Minecraft or any regular FPS shooter, but it mixes just about everything you will ever play in this. I recommend this game a lot, and you will not regret spending under $15 dollars for this game.

review: This Game Is A Great Sandbox It Has Realistic Gravity And Its Fun To Just... Mess Around With. Of Course There Is Mutiplayer And Lots Of Gamemodes Even Lots Of Addons I Recommend The Realistic Damage And SCars But You Can Choose What To Get I Have Over 300 Addons That I Found Very Intresting. If You Love To Build You Can Make Your Own Addons And Maps. You Can Even Play The WHOLE Story Of Half Life 2 In Gmod And Use Whatever Weapons You Like! You Can Also Play TF2 Maps And Maps From A Few Other Games. If You Think Gmod Sounds Like Your Type Of Game You Can Go On Youtube To See More Or You Could Buy The Game! I Would Rate It 9/10 Not 10/10 Because Of Errors, Lag, Well Thanks For Reading!

Also, heres a recipe for pancakes (4 servings): First, heres what youll need: 1 cup of flower. 1 tablespoon of baking powder. 1 tablespoon of sugar. 1/2 teaspoon of salt. 1 egg, beaten. 1 cup of milk. 2 tablespoons of vegtable oil A Frying pan/Griddle/Skillet (not skrillex) A source of heat. *now your ready to get baking... or is it cooking? idk* Mix together flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt. Combine eggs, milk, and oil. Add liquid ingredients to dry ingredients, stirring until just moist. Let mixture rest 30 seconds. Spoon or pour onto greased, hot griddle or nonstick skillet. Cook pancakes on the first side until bubbles appear on the upper surface. Turn over and cook until the bottom is golden. You can make a nice variation on these by adding a mashed black banana and 1/2 teaspoon of cinammon to the batter. Yum? 11/10 would burn pancakes again.

review: Where do i even start on this masterpiece i know the fact there is so much to do and so much fun to be had. The charm about Garry's Mod is that you can really do almost anything that comes up on the workshop to subscribe to like a flying bathtub with machine guns. The other thing i like about Garry's Mod is that there are so many servers of different kinds to have fun on with friends like trouble in terroist town (TTT) or deathrun or one of my favouites Gmod Tower on Gmod Tower you can play minigames, get money from that to buy playermodels or hats and even pets to fly around with you, speaking about flying around did i mention you can use a jetpack to get to places faster and if you want to take a break from minigames how about you go to your suite you go and check in and buy stuff to decorate it to your hearts desire or whatever the market has also you can donate to the lovely people who made it happen i am one myself. So my overall rating of Garry's Mod is a 9/10 even better with friends i 100% recommend this game i hope you get it too and have fun.

review: I haven't played much, but from what I've heard on my mums pregnancy chat rooms' "Kids Zone" IRC, this game is amazing. Comments such as: "I built a house", "What does 'q' do" and "Stretching often enhances birthing speed" are just some of the literally seven comments I've heard of it. As an experiment, I put my three year old brother on the game and within 12 seconds he was in control of the entire mafia and running an illegal drug operation out of a shabby 4-walls-and-a-fading-wall house but then the admin came on and said he can't shoot people walking past for being 'over 15'. None-the-less the superadmin came on and banned that admin, before celebrating his 13th birthday with his mum. If I had to say one thing about the game, it would be something really good but I'm not sure what because my 16th birthday is tomorrow and I'm not really thinking. Edit: This game is so  now that I'm 16, I play CSGO I have 23 Knives you can't get knives in Gmod this game is  and gay and you can't shoot everyone Edit: I play this game with my friends sometimes, but I usually just lobby with them for a CSGO match. I don't have much time anymore because I work after leaving school, but this game is okay if you didn't have to put up with the 12 year olds.

review: Garry's Mod is a very popular and active sandbox game, where you can build ANYTHING, and do ANYTHING, no matter WHAT you use. You can download other people's stuff in the workshop, or make your own in The Sandbox mode, one of the best, and maybe THE BEST, mode in Garry's Mod. You should be glad it's only $9.99. I got banned from a server for spawning in a rocket bathtub. 11/10. But really, get Garry's Mod.

review: Modding has never been so pain free and enjoyable. Gmod Provides regular players with the bare bone essentails to create brilliant feats of engineering and allows Advance players to create player models, maps and more and implement them into the game with ease. Running on the source engine, this game can easily handle many assets at one time including whatever specialties added like trails, Thrusters, ect and of course still has the brilliance of the physics engine that can lead to some very funny and unpredicable events. Gmod alone contains two gamemodes, the standard sandbox and the trouble in terrorist town gamemode (TTT) and once you get tired of those, you can easily find a million fan created game modes that are full of enjoyable people to play with, giving this game a extreme amount of replay value for the small price they ask for. Outside of fan modding, Gmod is fully able to literaly rip out the files from other source engine games that are on your hardrive and allows you to work with them instantly without and pain in the  proting files. But I really do recemend that you play mainly with mates or with a community you can visit regularly as a lot of the fun can come from this. Gmod is a very massive and growing game, with a very tiny pricetag. worth the purchase without a doubt.

review: Alot of people attack gmod because they go into it with the attitude of 'I'll join a multi-player server and ask for advice on how to play' and then they cry like a little  because either it's too confusing or people online are 'mean'. Well good for them. Garry's mod is an absolutly amazing sandbox game once you understand it and alot of people don't. If you don't have a friend to guide you like I did, then watch a youtube tutorial or something. For 6 It's fantastic what you're provided with and the amount of stuff you can do. Plus it's got something for everyone (that aren't the morons I mentioned previously). You can build whacky contraptions in Sanbox, play an intense game of Trouble in Terrorist Town, roleplay in... well... RolePlay. The gamemodes vary from being chased by slender in a fast, epic search to find the eight pages all the way to relaxing with your freinds and watching YouTube videos in the Gmod Cinema. Like I said, the game description is a lie, theres so much more to do than just Sandbox, it just takes some getting used to. It really is one of the most addictive games out there! It's such a shame that it was dragged down when little kids started to play. If your'e a child playing this game, for the love of all that is sane in the world,  off and go back to call of duty where you belong.

review: this game is like 20 games. literally: zombie survival, building a sledge or a raft to survive, gmod tower (which is also like 10 gamemodes in 1), cinema's, roleplaying servers, building servers and so much more.. also singleplayer is pretty fun with the amount of addons you can install very easily in the steam workshop. the only downside that this game has is that some models require other paid games which some people dont have.. since this game goes on sale alot you should totally get it

I really recommend right now for its price and you may want to try out DarkRP and TTT. My hours speak for themselves. Also joined in a Pony DarkRP server. Ran around as a Pony and shot some other ponies. Ended up killing two and got banned by a 12 year old admin for 1 month and 2 weeks. 10/10 would get on that server again and get banned again.

Garrys Mod is where you can make anything (nearly) and download thousands of mods to customize your gameplay to the way it suits you. Choose from different gamemodes like murder (which is alot of fun) and melonbomber (bringing back the memories of Bomber Man). I highly recommend this game to anyone who is looking for a good multi-player game. Easily best steam game i have ever played. 10/10

review: Garry's Mod. A game where you can do anything you want possible in the source engine! Originally, all you could do was build contraptions. A flying bathtub? Yep. A rocket propelled cheetah? If it looks robotic enough, then yes. Then, people started modding for the game. Gamemodes like Trouble in Terrorist Town, Dark Roleplay, and Murder came about, with custom maps and models for a more enjoyable game. Even if you don't like building things, either because you can't bother to learn how or don't like doing it, then you'll find atleast SOMETHING that your tastes will aprove of. Nearly anything is possible in Garry's Mod, and the game especially comes together in multiplayer when you cooperate or betray your "friends". All in all, it's a great game. I've spent too much time on it though....

It's only 5.99, and with literally hundreds of thousands of add-ons and custom gamemodes, it's definitely worth the price for the amount of fun you can have on it. You may want to get a group of friends together to play it at first as some of the tools can be hard to use, but after an hour or two, you can make anything you want, with a few Youtube guides maybe.

It started to create more errors, More missing texture and every 20 minutes it crashs. "You want to create a server?" garrys mod 13 asked me, I said "yes, of course!" then garrys mod 13 said "THEN F*** YOUR SELF BECOUSE YOU CANT!". And the loooooooooooooong looading, I need to wait a HOUR, just to open the game. I prefer the old garrys mod not 13!!!

review: Garry's mod is one of the best sandbox/community driven games on PC and possible in Gaming. If you are going to buy this, you should buy CS:S with it since many game modes use those textures in it. Sandbox mode is nice, you can do many things in that but many people also love to play on game modes, I would recommend TTT as a nice game mode if you find a good server but the sky is the limit in Gmod gamemodes(actaully it is the engine but eh). There are so many things to be said about this game and this review would go on for pages if you were to explain every single custom gamemode that is on garry's mod and you will get you 10/5/2.5 euro or whatever the price is out of it since there is constantly new content developed on servers. A great game with a good community if you know where to look.

This game has a huge workshop with +15,000 pages of addons, you will find what you can imagine in there also people created gamemodes that you can play (mostly multiplayer) such as prophunt, murder, flood, darkrp etc. You also have a default gamemode called sandbox and ttt (trouble in terrorist town) sandbox isn't explainable this is a endless gamemode as ttt its a very popular gamemode where there is a certain number of people that are innocent and there are couple of traitors (depends on the amount of people playing) , everyone is trying to figure out who the traitors are and traitors are trying to kill everyone without anyone finding out. Overall its a really fun game that is going to entertain you for houndreds is not thousands of hours, the time just slips by and look at me +600 hours and the most played game, I didn't even know how I did that? Its just goes soooo fast. 12/10 can't reccomend it enough. Its so cheep and worth, give it a try it runs on Source engine which preatty much every PC can run and it still looks great.

review: i dont know why i am writting this reveiw, it is obviously very popular, and my review wont make an impact but whatever. im too lazy to go in depth about this game and all, and i know others have theiir inner critic break out, but not me. all i can say is that if types of games were compared to types of icecreams, this game would be an icecream parlor. literally so many gametypes that make up their own full games that you will likely never play them all. TTT, Attack On Titan, Murder, DarkRP(if thats your thing, go for it), and almost a hundred more. no matter what, this game has more than a few game types you'll like.

review: This game, I just can't recommend it more. You can do anything you want, no, not like GTA, I mean, you're in a big sandbox and you can CREATE stuff from the right tools. You can also get some things from the workshop to help you create what you want. If you're bored with the SinglePlayer, well you got multiplayer and the hundreds of modes it contains! Trouble In Terrorist Town, Prop Hunt, Murder, and more. But beware, if you don't own Counter Strike: Source, the game doesn't give you the textures, so you'll be stuck with playing with purple textures and Errors. To conclude, this in itself is a FPS sandbox game. 10/10

review: Half Life 2 was one of my old favorites back in the day of the N64. But now that it's gone portable, and has been upgraded with minigames, more characters, and more, it's become my favorite platformer of all time. It's been perfect in every aspect of gaming, and it therefore deserves a 10. Story 8/10 Gordon gets invited to the castle for cake by Alyx in the intro scene, and he brings along Barry and Dr. Kliener. Father Grigori is there when they arrive, and they walk inside. After some time, Grigori notices they still haven't come out. He decides to go in and find out what's going on (this means you start playing as Grigori). He finds out Gordon, Barry, and Kliener have been imprisoned behind locked doors, and you eventually free all of them. After you free each one, you can play as that person, and take advantage of each of their special abilities to get all the Power Stars. After that, you must beat Dr. Breen and restore peace to the land once again. Graphics 10/10 The graphics have been upgraded since the days of the N64. The characters are less blocky now, most notably Dr. Breen. He looks awesome now. And the intro is too great to be expressed in words. The file select screen has 5 things apparently floating on water (3 files, options, and Return to Mode Select). Whenever you touch the screen, the point you touched emits a ripple in the water. If you drag your stylus (or whatever) across the screen, ripples emit from every point touched. I stare in amazement every time I do this, especially considering this is on a portable. Control 9/10 The controls in this game are great. You can do the whole mainstream game (not including minigames) with the buttons, except for loading and saving your game. The buttons are well laid out, but the running is a little awkward. You walk normally if you simply press a direction on the D-Pad, but you have to hold a button down to run. This isn't a big gripe until your thumb starts to get sore from the holding the button down. ut that's the only complaint I have. Sound 9/10 No complaints here. The sound are fitting, the music is appropriate, and the voices (which are mostly grunts and yells and such) are clear and loud. Some of the music is not particularly catchy, but that's the only thing that kept Sound from getting 10/10. Gameplay 10/10 I would have given it higher if I could have. If you've ever played the original Half Life 2, you'd know how sweet it was. Now think of it with a crapload of minigames (all of which are not only fun, but challenging), 30 more Stars to collect (bringing the total to 150), and the ability to play as 4 different characters, each with special abilities that are put to use in the levels and the castle. Gaming perfection? I think so. Replay Value 10/10 With 150 Stars, a bunch of minigames, 4 playable characters, and the addition of a wireless multiplayer mode, you'll be playing Garry's Mod for long after you beat it. Overall 10/10 This game was a huge leap up from the original Half Life 2, which was already sweet to begin with. If you have a DS, buy this game now. If you don't have a DS, buy one, if only just for this. If you can't afford a DS and/or this game, well that just sucks for you. Play a friend's if you have to. Then again, you might get hooked, so that may be a bad idea.

Do you want a new game, that makes new games every hour? Or maybe you want a new movie maker to create your dream movie - GMod does all of these things. It's a physics sandbox that mounts content from most Source based games, in which all content is user created and shared. You can do anything you can think of.

This is a great sandbox game, like minecraft that allows you to create anything that you can imagine. You can also create addons for the game, a gamemode for multiplayer, and much more! Different gamemodes such as TTT or Trouble in terrorist town for short, Prop hunt, Murder, and etc.! I truly believe that anyone that buys Garry's Mod will not regret any aspect of the purchase. Enjoy the game!

review: I will admit that this game is pretty good and allows you to utilize your imagination, but the community is so  that it puts a huge- dent in the game. Autistic children, abusive nerds who like a good power rush when they're admin, bronies, ect. Just the absolute clown piss, you're lucky if you find a good server or two. The game is good if you have friends and you enjoy building, but playing without any friends on TTT is horrible. Overall, if you have a displeasure for nerds and autistic children, don't buy this game. PS: I find myself wasting time on this infernal ing game everyday, gotta uninstall this gayme. PSS: Sorry, Garry. I know that you and your community have worked very hard on this game for the past few years, but you're community has been stricken with .

My friends showed it to me and I never quite understood it but the community is great, it's a community driven game. Without the community you're left with a blank slate. The game modes are abundant with players ranging in all ages and locations. So many game modes to choose from that every experience is different.

game-hours: 534.2
review: Yes, it is broken. No, it won't work. Instead, it will crash, it will lag, and it will break every single addon. Alright, maybe I am exaggerating a bit. But seriously, this game is completely, utterly broken, addons will give you tons of Lua errors, physics will spazz out, the game will crash, and it will refuse to start at all when two addons don't get along well. So, should you buy it? Absolutely. No other game has provided me with so many hours of entertainment, whether that means building incredibly complex machines controlled by microprocessors, or just testing how much I can break the game's physics before it inevitably crashes to desktop, only to restart and repeat. And the first time I entered an unrestricted sandbox game online... Oh boy, I hadn't laughed so hard in years. Think hilariousness of broken physics times players. The more, the funnier. Make each other invisible, spawn and break rollercoasters, spam explosives, or just try to fly a plane and watch as you get dragged by three physics guns, stretching your aircraft to every corner of the map. Once you've had a laugh in multiplayer mode, go back to singleplayer and build a massive, unnecessarily complicated machine to do a simple task you could easily do yourself. And of course, if you get tired of sandbox, you can try dozens of gamemodes. All things considered, this is a big, broken bag o lolz. Go buy it right now.

review: Where to start... Ah! I know - this game is amazing. $9.99? Wow. That's cheap for such a fantastic game. Garry's Mod is a game where there are tons of gamemodes that you can play which are like games INSIDE of this game. For example, want to play a gamemode where you are stranded are in struggling to survive? Try out the "Garry's Mod Stranded" gamemode. Want to pretend to be a prop and play hide and seek with friends? Try out "Prop Hunt". There are countless mods inside of this game to play and whether you want to play alone or with others, this game is awesome. You can do pretty much whatever you want. You are given the tools and props and left to your own devices to do anything and everything. I can GUARANTEE that you will never get bored with this game as their are countless ways to have so much fun with it. It is like buying 100 games for the price of one. Definitely worth every penny and tons of fun to play with others, Garry's Mod, in my opinion, is THE BEST sandbox game out there which incorporated the Source SDK engine from Half-Life 2. It is first-person and lots of fun so buy your copy immediately. And I mean now. Graphics - 10/10 Gameplay- 10/10 TOTAL - 10/10 This game, simply put, is a must-buy and is for everyone no matter what your age.

review: i dont know why i am writting this reveiw, it is obviously very popular, and my review wont make an impact but whatever. im too lazy to go in depth about this game and all, and i know others have theiir inner critic break out, but not me. all i can say is that if types of games were compared to types of icecreams, this game would be an icecream parlor. literally so many gametypes that make up their own full games that you will likely never play them all. TTT, Attack On Titan, Murder, DarkRP(if thats your thing, go for it), and almost a hundred more. no matter what, this game has more than a few game types you'll like.

review: garry is a ing  coder, for every bug he fixes he creates 5 more gmod13 is the worst thing since they turned cs go into call of duty tf2 edition the only good thing in gmod13 was the workshop, but even that is  because he got rid of all the actually good  in the toybox, and replaced it with some  thing where 12 year olds upload " ALYX HARD IN BOOTY WTAHC GMAN MAKE HIS PELVIX MOVES" seriously thats the entire front page don't even get me started on nude model dupes "HEY GUYS HERES THIS NEKED ZERO SOT SAMUS BUT NEED TH NEKED ZERO SOT SAMUS MODEL FROM GARYSMODE. U NO ITS JUST THE MODLE BUT THIS WAY U CAN SPAWN WITH DUPE INSTED OF JUST USING Q MENU" also the ing minecraft dupes god damnit seriously if you want a ing box man then go stick your dog in a tv for s sake and for the pickaxe just use a real one, then you can pvp irl with your  friends and natural selection will take it's course and the rainbow box dupes too, seriously its just a gay pride flag with the same color trails that just explode ALSO OMG GUIS 40K IN DARKRP MONEI!?!?!? But even with all this cluster of faggy , it's still a playable game. TL;DR: Workshop is filled with  dupes and Gmod13 is .

review: This game is Perfect i love it. When you buy it you must buy CS:S=Counter Strike Source too because many mods use the CS:S Textures and Models. When you play online try Trouble in Terrorist Town out its a nice mod :D

review: You can pretty much do anything in this game, whether it's by yourself or with others. Finding a server is extremely easy and there are so many gamemodes that you don't have to worry about being bored. I could literally spend the whole day on Gmod and not even realize how much time has passed. I would definitely recommend playing modes like Murder and TTT.

review: Dark RP is full of children screaming RDM and hackers killing everyone with props. TTT is filled with grown men shouting out "KOS <name>!" Prop Hunt is full of children using a small  prop to hide in places that aren't legitimate hiding spots. "10/10, great game." -IGN

review: Trying to explain Garrysmod is trying to explain Charles Darwns evolutionary theory to someone religious... Garrysmod is a game without limitations; If you want to build a giant rocket which flys around making sex noises and dropping  bombs... you can. If you want to run around pretending to be in a triple A fps with better gameplay... you can. If you want to pretend to be in a slender game with friends... you can. You get the point; the game itself is only limited by your own imagination and your willingness to learn... there's communities for everything; "Roleplay, Sandbox/Building, Virtual Lives etc. Even creators can get in the action; with it being open source you can create your own gamemode, entities, weapons and maps. (Check the Garrysmod Workshop for an endless supply of garrysmod content) 10/10 p.s. rustybullethole #garrynewman1stepforward2stepsback

review: One of the best games ever made. Hours of enjoyment(or frustration) lay before you in this game. Good to play with a bunch of friends in various fun game modes on a vast number of servers with games ranging from Trouble in Terrorist Town(TTT), Murder, Roleplaying servers and Combine Control(probably my favorite). Overall Garry's Mod(or Gmod for short) is really an astonishingly amazing game and for it's price which also goes down much lower during seasonal sales it is worth every dollar, but be warned that Gmod will take time to load at times as the game is purely about modding and playing game modes with those mods. All in all Gmod is a very fun game for the individual or for you and your friends so you should get it and enjoy countless hours in the game.

review: Any one with steam should buy this, its cheap, and never seems to get boring. There are always new gamemodes popping out of no where, you can build, roleplay and much much more. There is not really any exuse not to buy this game if you have a decent PC.

review: Yes, it is broken. No, it won't work. Instead, it will crash, it will lag, and it will break every single addon. Alright, maybe I am exaggerating a bit. But seriously, this game is completely, utterly broken, addons will give you tons of Lua errors, physics will spazz out, the game will crash, and it will refuse to start at all when two addons don't get along well. So, should you buy it? Absolutely. No other game has provided me with so many hours of entertainment, whether that means building incredibly complex machines controlled by microprocessors, or just testing how much I can break the game's physics before it inevitably crashes to desktop, only to restart and repeat. And the first time I entered an unrestricted sandbox game online... Oh boy, I hadn't laughed so hard in years. Think hilariousness of broken physics times players. The more, the funnier. Make each other invisible, spawn and break rollercoasters, spam explosives, or just try to fly a plane and watch as you get dragged by three physics guns, stretching your aircraft to every corner of the map. Once you've had a laugh in multiplayer mode, go back to singleplayer and build a massive, unnecessarily complicated machine to do a simple task you could easily do yourself. And of course, if you get tired of sandbox, you can try dozens of gamemodes. All things considered, this is a big, broken bag o lolz. Go buy it right now.

review: 10/10 This game is a very well known history, has the most creative gamemodes of all time, is made from the engine of Half Life 2 making it look like it has been ageing very well to make this game more welcome to people who are a fan of all genres of gaming. Though lots of my favorite features have been removed such as the Toybox, this game never gets old, and at least a person is playing at least a server. That is what make this game better.

review: Garry's Mod is a bundle of fun and extraordinary happenings. Originally a mod for a Valve game, it eventually was made into a full game for everyone to play. If your cup of tea is a shooter, the game is packed with TTT servers and vice versa. If it's a roleplay, look no further as DarkRP has you covered. Just a plain old sandbox kind of guy? That's the game's specialty! It's on the same tier as one of my other favourites, Blockland. Never the less, I recommend this game for ANYONE and EVERYONE. I guess a straight up 10/10!

review: In this review I will cover: Afew Gamemodes (Prop Hunt, TTT, DarkRP, Sandbox and Murder) and also everything else that is great about this game, let's go! PROP HUNT Prop hunt is a gamemode where there are two teams, props and hunters. The Hunters are set to find the props on the map and shoot them with their gun, the props however have to blend in to the map so say the prop was a coffee mug you could blend in by sitting yourself down on a table. You can also switch your model of prop by pressing "E" on the prop you want to turn into, so if you are the coffee mug but there is no table, I could press "E" on a tall lamp and sit in the corner. There are loads of props ranging from Cinder Blocks to Lamps to Toilets to Boxes, there are loads depending on the map, and of course you can also download maps from the steam workshop, which makes it even more fun! TROUBLE IN TERRORIST TOWN (TTT) Trouble in terrorist town is by far the gamemode I have put the most hours into, it is a game of three teams, depending on the amount of people there will be a detective, seven people would equal one detective where as twelve people would have two detectives, so it goes up like that, the detectives can find out who killed who and you'll see what I mean by that in a second, the detectives find out the murderer by using DNA scanners etc. The innocents are innocent terrorists that have done nothing wrong (apart from being a terrorist that is) but they try to stay alive and if they witness anything they must tell the detective straight away, but the traitor is the most fun of them all. The traitor is normally in a group with two or three others, once again depending on the amount of players (but there is always one traitor), the traitors normally go for the detective first, taking him/them out silently and then can kind of go on a rampage if they want, but I much prefer going quietly, if all the innocents are eliminated (detectives count as innocents) the traitors win the round, if the traitors are wiped out then the innocents win the round, of course there are some rules with this as innocents are not aloud to kill traitors without a reason, same as detectives aren't allowed to kill without reason, and of course traitors kill everybody! DARKRP DarkRP is a fun gamemode which normally doesn't involve much violence, apart from the fact that there are S.W.A.T members about trying to catch any drug dealers or people printing money, and there are thieves and terrorists, you build shops in this game for instance drug shops or gun shops or nice shops such as a bar or a general shop. DarkRP is probably my favourite gamemode right now, it's fun, creative and there is so much to do depending on the server. Also servers can have custom jobs so you'll never play a job too much! SANDBOX Sandbox is the normal singleplayer experience, but you can go online aswell, you can host a LAN game of sandbox or use Hamachi or something, but sanbox gives you atleast 500+ - 1000+ resources to muck about with, you could build a boat or a car or a plane, out of a bathtub? Sure! You could turn a bathtub, two doors, a wheel, thrusters and hoverballs into a fully functioning plane. This gamemode is great, and you should definately try this one with friends, and once again you can download maps off of the workshop to play on, which are so much fun. Or you can try getting a custom player model, like a Daedric Armour model or a Japanese Soldier, or even a Doritos packet, the possibilities are endless in sandbox! MURDER Murder is a group of two teams, the murderer and the bystanders, so the bystanders need to stay alive and the bystander with the revolver needs to kill the murderer, while the murderer needs to kill everybody else. There are items with a glowing outline so that you can spot them easy around the map, and once you have picked up five of those you can get a gun, the murderer is so much fun to be, as you can choose either to run in for the kill or to go in sneaky, truely an amazing gamemode. OTHER AMAZING THINGS 1. Custom maps and playermodels 2. A lot of resources to use and muck about with 3. There are loads more gamemodes than these five, so you'll never get bored 4. It's a great game to play with friends 5. You can make a LAN world or Hamachi world to mess about in with friends 6. The possibilities are endless! And for a price of 5.99 this game is absolutely amazing, it's a must have and no steam account is complete without it.

review: What can I say? This game is a lot of fun! It can be funny, scary, serious, silly, weird and just plain random, all in a single game! Tired of fixed, mandatory objectives in every single game you play? This game is a perfect reprieve! Had too much enough of said reprieve? Download and play a different, objective-based gamemode or map! If you do not own this game, right your wrong and buy it! But a fair warning, this game can be incredibly glitchy at times, so be prepared for that when you start playing, and keep it in mind for future gameplay. All in all, though, the glitchiness does not at all overshadow the fact that this is an absolute MUST-HAVE that you will NOT be disappointed by! However, I suggest that if you are going to puuchase this game, that you maybe purchase some other Source Engine titles to go with it. 8/10

review: Whether you want to build a nice community of NPC's and have tea-time with them every Tuesday, or whether you want to create havoc with randomness and weapons, Garry's Mod, commonly known as GMOD, is the one that will make it all true. Garry's Mod choses you fellow players, to get this game. So get it now! Or prepare to be killed by flying tires and watermelon-wielding shovels. Anyway, this is an awesome game! :)

review: A great game, Worth more than it actually is This game consists of "Game Modes" The Major gamesmodes that I am aware of are: -Trouble In Terrorist Town -DarkRP -PropHunt -Murder You may have heard all of these game modes(Besides DarkRp) from YouTubers, SeaNanners for example can show you the very basics of these game modes. Although, You will need to buy Counter Strike: Source to have all of these games graphics. If you are patient enough you can wait for the Garry's Mod, Counter Strike: Source steam sale. This game is awesome, I have spent a tonne of time playing this game

review: This game is probably one of the best games on Steam. It's technically not even a game, as it has no purpose, which is what makes this game so good. You can do anything here, starting from a war with Martians to making Barrack O'Bama  golden bricks.

review: Hmm, how should I start a review of Gary's Mod... Well technicly it's a game where you can do basicly anything you ever imagined, and a very great multiplayer/co-op game. I recommend it to people who love having many great laughs and make fun memories. It has many mods making the game more interesting the more you play it, and there is always stuff to do and new things to try out. I love the game mods, and also i recommend having a computer that can handle connection issues. I give this a 10/10 rating and definitely put it in my top five games! The horror map mods are also interesting and creepy depending on how well people make them. Anyways, if you decide to try this game out, I'm telling you as the reader right away; you will fall in love with this game as much as I have. It's totally a must buy!

review: Garry's mod is one of the best sandbox/community driven games on PC and possible in Gaming. If you are going to buy this, you should buy CS:S with it since many game modes use those textures in it. Sandbox mode is nice, you can do many things in that but many people also love to play on game modes, I would recommend TTT as a nice game mode if you find a good server but the sky is the limit in Gmod gamemodes(actaully it is the engine but eh). There are so many things to be said about this game and this review would go on for pages if you were to explain every single custom gamemode that is on garry's mod and you will get you 10/5/2.5 euro or whatever the price is out of it since there is constantly new content developed on servers. A great game with a good community if you know where to look.

review: This is a game that not only lets you run around shooting each other. This game is about building and using your imagination you can play singleplayer and build by yourself or you can meet friends on servers and build togeather. This game has all types of gamemodes you could roleplay, explore or have fun in the gmod tower where theres games, gambling, fun lobby events or you could spend your money on putting furniture in your suites but theres tons to explore and just remember if you imagine it you can build it.
game-hours: 1160.3
review: Rating: 8/10 The game's okay, but things can go bad sometimes. The community isn't so bad if the server is well-mannered, but I hate RP. The admins are lazy, and they usually don't believe me. And you're always killed. So, I personally don't like RP. But flood, sledbuild, and those other sort of servers are cool though. I like single player the most since there's no limitations on what I can do and spawn. I also noticed that the game's optimization is poor since I can't really get above 30FPS in-game with a powerful PC. But, whatever, 30FPS is better than like 10-20 with my old computer ( GeForce 210). There's really no limitations to what you can do and that's what makes the game cool. You buying it depends on your liking of the game.

review: Probably one of my favorite games. I've had it for about one year now and have played it for about 183 hours. There's so much to do in this game! And, on top of that, if you're not happy with what the game originally has to offer, you can download new content from the workshop. On the steam workshop you can get just about anything you want, although it may take a bit of searching. I even found an HD reskin specifically for the melon. Amazing. Now, it says that it is required to own Counter Strike: Source. This is not entirely true. Although it is recommended, it's not a neccessity. It will just lead to missing textures on some of the objects in the game, meaning they will show up, literally as a big red error or as purple and black design. This could happen to entire maps without it. But some maps do not require Counter Strike's content and will be fine. I was a bit confused as to if the game would work or not with or without it but it does, it just has those missing textures. Another awesome thing about Garry's Mod is the multiplayer.

review: As you can see by my hours, I have played quite a bit of this game. It's just about everything someone could ever need to keep them occupied. This game is the real deal, it has just about anything that you can think of. You just have to make the game your own and if your new open yourself up to the gamemodes, such as prop hunt, TTT, DarkRP, and try building somthing outrageous in sandbox. As I stated before this game will keep you occupied, no matter who you are, no matter what your used to, this is the game for you. Please buy. :)

review: From all the time I spent on GMod, it's been fun. There's the freedom in sandbox mode. Available to play alone or with a friend. The best part is messing with the physics, but that's your choice. :) Not feeling creative? There's an endless variety of gamemodes to play, which adds to the replayability of this game. I just don't know what gamemode to mention because there are so many of them. Most of the games today like Titanfall cost $60 and lack lots of content. If you're looking for a game that will deliver a lot of play, Garry's Mod is perfect for you!

review: Pretty much a game for everyone, you can make whatever you think with the tools available, or the many addons created by the community. You can create battles between factions, many kinds of apocalypse, or just build. Even without addons, you can make detailed and insane creations. You can create frozen scenes with ragdolls, or use them in uploaded saves as corpses. Sure, it has its glitches (some of which I have no idea how to fix), and the fact that you need certain games for the full experience, but it still makes up for it with its fun. I'd say 9/10, but only because of glitches and needing games. Pretty nice game.

review: Johnny is a successful banker who lives in a San Francisco townhouse with his fiance, Lisa. They share an intense intimate relationship characterized by constant, passionate lovemaking. Despite this idyllic existence, Lisa has inexplicably become dissatisfied with her life, and one afternoon confides to her best friend Michelle and her mother Claudette that she finds Johnny boring. Although Michelle advises her to be grateful for what she has, and her mother counsels her that financial stability is more important than happiness, Lisa decides to seduce Johnny's best friend, Mark. Although he is initially reluctant, Mark gives in to Lisa's advances. Their affair continues through the remainder of the film, even though Mark appears reluctant at the outset of each sexual encounter and repeatedly tries to break off the relationship. Lisa, meanwhile, having come to the realization that she "wants it all", decides to stay with Johnny for financial support and the material goods he can provide her. As the wedding date approaches and Johnny's clout at his bank slips, Lisa alternates between glorifying and vilifying Johnny to her family and friends, both making false accusations of domestic abuse and defending Johnny against criticisms. Meanwhile, Johnny, having overheard Lisa confess her infidelity to her mother, attaches a tape recorder to their phone in an attempt to identify her lover. Against the backdrop of Lisa and Mark's affair, numerous subplots involving secondary characters begin to develop: Denny, a neighboring college student whom Johnny financially supports and "loves like a son", has a mysterious run-in with a drug dealer named Chris-R, whom Johnny and Mark overpower and take to the police. Denny also lusts after Lisa, ultimately confessing to Johnny his attraction; once Johnny tells Denny that Lisa loves him as her friend, Denny resolves to propose to his own girlfriend. Johnny takes on a mysterious client at his bank whose identity he is sworn to protect. Claudette experiences real estate problems, bemoans failed relationships, and informs Lisa that she has breast cancer. Michelle and her boyfriend, Mike, break into Johnny and Lisa's home to make love Peter, a psychologist friend of Johnny's and Mark's, alternates between defending Lisa and assessing her as a sociopath, which results in Mark briefly trying to murder him. Each of these subplots receive little exposition, and none are ever resolved. At a surprise birthday party for Johnny, Steven, a previously unseen friend of Lisa's and Johnny's, catches Lisa kissing Mark while the rest of the guests are outside and confronts her about the affair. Lisa expresses no remorse, while Mark angrily urges Steven not to tell anyone. Johnny announces to the guests that he and Lisa are expecting a child, only for Lisa to tell Steven and Michelle that she lied about it in order to "make it interesting". At the end of the evening, Lisa flaunts her affair in front of Johnny, who physically attacks Mark. After the party, Johnny locks himself in the bathroom, prompting Lisa to make plans to leave him for Mark. Johnny finally comes out of the bathroom and retrieves the cassette recorder he attached to the phone, and listens to an intimate call between Lisa and Mark. Claiming that all of his friends have betrayed him, Johnny destroys his apartment and then kills himself with a pistol. Denny, Mark and Lisa discover Johnny's body sometime later. Mark and Denny blame Lisa for Johnny's death, with Mark declaring he does not love Lisa and never wants to see her again. Denny asks Lisa and Mark to leave, but they stay and comfort one another as the sound of the approaching sirens grow louder.

review: Garry's Mod is one of those games that if you don't buy it, you are putting yourself to shame. Get off of your computer chair and buy this game NOW. With a variety of game modes from Sandbox and DarkRP to Murder and Trouble In Terrorist Town, new game modes and new servers are coming out EVERY DAY. This is a game that I have sadly not had enough time to play but I think that your 5 (I think) that you will spend to get this game will give you unlimited content (unless you get banned from all of the world's servers). There is always another server to join and new adventures to participate in. If you're the type that gets bored easily, you'll still get at LEAST 300 hours out of this game. If you aren't, get ready for the adventure of your lifetime and make sure you have a comfortable computer chair because you could spend up to 3000 hours on this game and possibly more. There are quite a few people who have spent the equivalent of a YEAR playing this game and it will run on ANYTHING. It even runs on my 5 year old APPLE MAC which is literally the most basic computer possible. It is impossible to not like this game. You can even rent a server from various suppliers if you're up for the challenge. One thing I will say though, is to watch out for the Badmins. Badmins are Admins who use their powers to degrade other people's experiences, but it's not really something that takes away from the game. My final verdict for Garry's Mod is an enthusiastic 9/10! It only JUST misses the 10/10 mark for the Badmins, occasional false VAC Bans and the fact that I wasted an hour of my life on a terrible server that kept messing me around before finally putting me out of my misery and banning me. Everything else, however, is pure gold and this game competes with the greats like Grand Theft Auto V in my view. Cancel any plans you have tonight - you will be super-glued to your computer chair. If you like this game, also consider trying out Facepunch Studio's other major title, Rust, a zombie-survival game where everybody starts without any clothes on. Literally. Anyway, I hope this review helped you out, and enjoy spending a small amount of cash on this legendary. Thanks for reading. Peace.

I have played this game for a couple hours and it is the first game i bought from the store. If you get bored of the regular materials you are given you can just go and download some add-ons including maps, weapons, vehicles, npcs, modes and a bit more. I suggest this game for people who like to build and create and have an imaginative mind while also liking to cool down with friends. My overall rating for this game is gotta be around 4 and a 1/2 stars

review: Anybody who is any sort of fan of Valve games must stick this one on their wishlist and grab it when they've got the dough to cherish this game. Garry's Mod, albeit just a utilisation of the standard game engine, playing online on this game shows off how far the community have taken this. The game engine has been well and truly taken advantage of in a way that has flourished the creativity of gamers everywhere, yielding only a immersive and captivating online experience in modes such as Prop Hunt, Murder and Trouble in Terrorist Town. These game modes take place on well-known Counter Strike: Source maps and give Garry's Mod a familiar feel while uping the social advantages of having such an abudance of creative game modes. Buying this game will ultimately provide you with enjoyment, and it's one of those games that everybody eventually needs to have. It's smooth and fun, fast-paced and exciting. A great advantage is that you can play it endlessly because there's so many different gametypes that everytime you get bored of one, there's always somewhere else you can go where you feel like you're playing a whole new game altogether. So, why exactly should you buy it? Prop Hunt (a Garry's Mod gametype) captures my attention the most; a hub for laughs as players disguise as objects to hide from 'hunters', the team that must eliminate the team disguising as props. It's like the game of hide-and-seek you always wish you had played as a child. It's tremendous. 'Trouble in Terrorist Town' (or 'TTT') is yet another gametype that can be pretty amusing. Basically, you can be innocent or you can be a traitor. The game assigns each person with one of those titles and then from there, nobody knows who is who. However, for the traitors, they see who else is a traitor and who isn't. Unsurprisingly, their job is to kill (without being caught), and it's fun trying to find out who the traitors are! 'Murder' is similar to TTT in a way that everybody appears the same. There's only one murderer, though, but nobody knows who it is, and only a select couple of bystanders (people who aren't the murderer) get a weapon. It's perhaps the most realistic simulation of being in a mental institution I have ever seen. That's just a taste of Garry's Mod; due to its lively community, the creativity of what people can do with the Valve game engine is simply constant, and there's always something new to try.

I would either buy this game 10 more times or have it priced for $70. Amazingly addictive and a fun use of time 10/10

review: Garry's Mod. The very name conjures up images of ragdolled bodies flying through the air as a C4 has exploded in TTT, of countless props spawned whilst trying to make something that, when you take a step back, only slightly resembles the Death Star. For all it's flaws, of which there are few, it makes up in its charm, endless amount of mods, gamestyles and general sillyness. Its issues surrounding hit-boxes are annoying, often find yourself shooting somebody in the face with a shotgun only to discover you've missed and subsequently blown your cover as a Traitor in TTT but you quickly adapt and stab him before he can yell out your name in a pitch that resembles a pre-pubescent little boy. The ladders suck of course but if you're careful enough you'll probably land safetly and if not, after about 5 minutes of rage at being eaten alive in ZombieMod because your character can't quite grasp the function of ladders, you laugh it off and persue the other survivors. I've had some of the best hours of my life playing TTT and Garry's Mod in general, if you're on the fence about it, you shouldn't be, for about 10 (That and CS:S) its a bundle of joy that will keep you up at night until ungodly hours.

review: Have you ever felt like playing , laggy ripoffs of popular and expensive games? If so, don't hesitate to purchase this fantastic game. It includes over one million servers (and only five decent ones) plus a massive community that will shoot you on sight whenever they have the ability to. Don't forget to play one of the numerous DarkRP servers to experience the greatest feature of all: being banned instantaneously for absolutely no reason! P.S. the loading screens are fantastic. Every time you join a server it's like entering the lottery to see whether or not your entire computer will freeze or if your game will crash. It's like gambling without any monetary risks!

review: Well, My review is that Garry's Mod is a very good game for the PC. It is a good price. And the reason why I love this game so much is because it is a Shooter/Adventure/Everything. It has over 50+ modes. My favorite is mode is Sandbox. You can add ''Addons'' onto the game. You can even make your own AddOns. You can even Install maps into the game. Well, This is my review.

I bet you have, and with all the parts, ragdolls, and tools in the game, plus mods you can download automatically from the menu, you can totally make it. And with some ridiculous game modes in multiplayer like Trouble in Terrorist Town and Deathrun, its sure to be a fun game.

review: there are so many ways to play, so many ways to enjoy. endless hours of hilarity in prop hunt, some creeps in MORBUS and spooks in Stop It Slender. get your survivor on with stranded, and kill all of your friends without eny particular reason in Trouble in Terrorist Town. or, you could mess with physics in sandbox. i have gotten so much value out of this, and i think that it's seriously underrated. sure, twenty dollars is a bit pricey, but its worth it for the blood, sweat, and hilarity of this mod.

Of course there is sandbox mode which is halo forge mode but on alot of drugs because it just blows everything elese out of the water with its endless possibilitys. the amount of creativity is insane with all the differant ideas people por out. Just trust me if you play the game right you wont want to stop. Just look at how much hours people put in. dont wait just buy it. ps if money is a problem wait till black friday they always have it on sail and dont forget to get cs source or the game bugs out. thanks for reading

review: Great game to play around with, espeacailly with friends and loved ones! You can fool around or play an all out serious gamemode (don't know any). You can also play sand box with friends and fool around wth items, ragdolls, and many more! I would definetly recommend this game to any non-serious gamers, especailly ones who like to fool around in game! Perhaps you want to throw a random bridge around, well then you can do it! As long as you of course don't break the game by spawning too many. Anyways this game is $10 and I would rate it 8/10 out off all the games I've played so far! Hope you have fun with it like i did!

review: I bought this game for $2.50 when it was on sale (I'm a bit of a liberal spender...), and it's been great! The game is mostly community content and borrowed items from other games, which is cool for a good while. But that's just if you're using single player sandbox... When you start playing on servers, the amazing amount of official server mods, such as Melon Bomber, JailBreak, TTT, FireArt, it's even better. It's a good game. A lot of the community content and servers require you to own games, mostly Counter-Strike: Source (hence the gamepack on sale here.), but if you look around the internet, you can get the gamefiles easily without having to buy the game. Note: You don't get the game for having the gamefiles, just the Gmod content.

This game has tons of potential. Great relaxed game, I suggest this for gamers who like to shoot everything in the face and spawn tons of random NPC's in and shoot them with the FPS engine or create wonderful anythings! So i reccomend you get this game with Counter Strike: Source, as its like 2 games in 1!

I played like 5 hours in a row and i still wanted to play :D If you should buy one game, take this game because its you that decide how you are gonna play it: hard way, peaceful way, killer way, etc And it has more than just one game mode like: Sandbox Mode (You do whatever you want), Trouble in Terrorist Town (Like playing Call of duty online but Garry's mod way) and finally : Prop Hunt! (2 sides: the props, and the hunters. The hunters have to kill all props to win and the props need to have one player still alive at the end of the time to win) In one sentence: B.E.S.T GAME EVER!!

You can do everything you want in this game that you can do in your life and things you can't do in your life, as long as you have commition that is. and then there is multiplayer, most of the time a total choatic mess with your friends. And if you don't have any, you could just go in any lobby and start playing with random people on the internet. I would higly recommend this game to anyone with a sense of humour and a soul.

review: It's a nice game (technically a Source engine mod) where you can just do whatever the heck you want to. There is absolutely no winning or losing, just doing your own thing. You can make maps, mess around with weapons/props/NPCs/etc, download addons and more from the workshop to play around with, and play online using community-made gamemodes with friends or people you have no idea as to who they are. Plus, the achievements rock, too. The possibilities are endless. It's awesome. 11/10 for the amazing possibilities and modding compatability (Better than Minecraft's by far)

review: I haven't played too much of this game, but I heard it was pretty good, i mean even read the plot ------------------------------------------------- : BioShock Infinite is the third game in the BioShock series. Announced on August 12, 2010, it is Irrational Games' newest project.[4] It was released on March 26, 2013 for PC (Steam), Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3,[2][5] and August 29th, 2013 for Mac (Mac App Store and Steam).[3] BioShock Infinite is not a direct sequel/prequel to any of the previous BioShock games, and it takes place in an entirely different setting, although it shares similar features, gameplay and concepts with the previous game-------- sounds great

review: Who needs a review for garrys mod? I mean, it's freaking garrys mod! Flying rocket sofa, weird animation faces, strange npc scenes in akward positions, blowing up things with bombs, dubstep shotguns and even a  rocket. Also, it works for more "serious" animation works, screenshoots with cool scenes or simply a funny shortmovie. "But those things will get monotonous for me one day, right?" BEEH. Wrong. Even if you get tired of these weird and random things (which is nearly impossible, specially if you play with friends) there are many other possibilities. You can download other game mods from the workshop for FREE (Yes, no DLC ). Hide 'n seek, zombie survival, race modes and even golf. And, if you have CS Source mounted, you will be able to play my favourite game mod - Trouble in Terrorist Town. Player are put in a map where there is 1 detective, 1 traitor and the rest are common terrorists. The traitor's goal is to kill them all, while the detective must stop this. Nothing pays more than being in a TTT game when people start to randomly shoot one on another just because they think they know who is the traitor. In gmod not even the sky is meant to be a limit. Do what you want, the way you want, Anyway, ignore my poor english and buy this game NOW. 10/10, totally recommend it

review: This game is probably the main reason I'm a PC Gamer. I have logged about 300 hours so far on it and it has never failed to entertain me every single time. This game has the best price/gametime ratio. (Many people log thousands of hours on it.) Buy it no matter what price it is on or if it's with CS:S. It is the best and cheapest game I have ever played at the same time. (I payed 1.50 on sale). Also has very low system requirements and runs very well on most PCs.

review: Garrys Mod. Alot of Hours Spent on that Game. Well, Garrys Mod is good but not good as you might Think. Yes, It Has alot and I mean ALOT of Custom Files to Create everything you can Imagine! also, The Multiplayer has good Modes like Trouble in Terrorist Town, Prop Hunt etc. To be Very Honest, I Barely Played the MP (Except for TTT) because I dont like Prop Hunt or anything like that. TTT is the only Exception. Ive Played ALOT of Singleplayer Sandbox to test Addons, Create Simulations and Buildings etc. It has ALOT of Stuff. GMod used to be Perfect but with the Updates, It went VERY slow, I miss the Toybox, and Addons can Infect your Game which sucks alot when you have 500 Addons and then 1 of it s up your Whole Game. It is a good Game that I DO recommend (I mean, 10 Bucks.) yet Still its not the Best Game.

review: This is not just your normal sandbox game. In Garry's Mod, you can have different modifications to make your game even better, by the simple click of a button!

review: This game is very entertaining to play with friends. There is so much stuff to do. You can easily play hours and hours of this game without even trying. You could head into Single-Player and just spawn random stuff and see what you can come up with, or you can go into Deathrun, Prop Hunt, TTT, or any other interesting game type. There is never a shortage of things to do and it's even better with friends. I highly recommend this game especially with a price of only 10 dollars.

review: After watching some popular YouTubers play the game, I decided to try it out for myself. I absolutely love it and playing with friends makes it even more fun. Prop hunt is my favourite gamemode but there are others like Hide & Seek, Murder, Death Run, TTT and many more. I recommend trying it out; I play on a laptop with no problems at all.

review: You don't know what you are missing out on...definitely the most expandable and ever-changing mod I have ever played. I normally get bored of games pretty quickly, but hence the amount of playtime I have with this, it has never ceased to stop entertaining me. The community is very diverse, and depending on what directions you take you will probably find your niche easy. Some of the gamemodes play like they could be a game just by themselves, but in any means you can never get bored if you keep trying new things. And singleplayer/sandbox is already perfect enough in that matter, if you find the loading times worth it. Very developer-friendly too, it uses LUA and as time goes on more and more hooks are being updated and added. Definitely worth a script-kiddie's time.

review: This game, well where do I start? If I could try to convince you to buy this game for one reason it would be that this may be the only sandbox game or any game really with barrels that actually explode in it. I rate the barrels 9.56 out of 3 because of them. Definetly worth buying if your into them. I should know I was once a barrel, but thats not what I'm here to tell you about I'm here to tell you about Garry's Incident. Wait what, this is Garry's Mod? Well screw it Garry's mod has ummm pretty much anything you want in it. And literaly I MEAN ANYTHING. On that note I hope to see you in game... I'll be wating for you. Yes you the one reading this thinking wtf is wrong with this guy. You will find me in the sewers like a rat, with a barrel. Always watching.....

review: a good sandbox creation mod, with no end of great addons super quick and easy to install. There is only a few downsides to it like is that alot of things require other source games (portal, css, hl2ep2 .ect .ect) and building is a bit elasticy but the mod itself is brilliant if it goes cheap i really recommend you buy it its awesome no end.

review: This game is truly special, offering unique, never before seen gameplay. No wonder ir's sales rate has never halted, at 3,000,000 sales. I'll tell you now, the 5.99 is worth Trouble in Terrorrist Town (gamemode). Alone. The game never gets boring, always differing from the past gameplay. Don't like the 100's of awesome gamemodes like Zombie survival, TTT, sandbox Dark RP? Make your own! Make anything you imagine possible. The limit is your imagination. I highly reccomend purchasing both Half-Life 2 & Counter stike Source otherwise 3/4s of the guns will be 'errors' and the maps will be a blur of purple & black un-rendered textures.

review: GMOD is a game which really brings players together. Through its countless amount of gamemodes, users can play games with friends doing various things, such as sandbox (the default gamemode) or others made by third parties like jailbreak, morbus and so on. Not only does the game have plenty of playable content, you can even create your own through the ease of map making and item making using various software such as 3d modeling software. Thankfully the game has plenty of community items to add through the use of the steam workshop which adds more fun to an ever increasing game. There are plenty of gamemodes which in my opinion stand out, of which some I have already mentioned but others include Trouble in terrorist town, Hunger Games and Stop It Slender. Gary Newman in my opinion really hit the nail on the head with this game, it's ideas to create a game which is managed by different communities is a great addition. The only drawback I find is that when loading into servers the page freezes for the login period, this could be fixed which would make the game even better for me. I seriously recommend anyone who is a community player, someone who loves playign their favourite games with others and also people who are creative as GMOD allows ones creative mind to flow.

review: Garry's mod is a sandbox game where anything is possible. Garry's mod promotes creativity which makes the game stand out from other games. Garry's mod has endless things to do like play Trouble in terrorist town,Role play,Prop hunt,ect. One thing i don't like about Garry's mod is that you will have missing textures if you don't own a specific game like Half life 2 or Left 4 dead. This limits what players can experience without seeing that horid purple and black missing textures. Garry's mod rating for me is a 8/10 The score would be higher if we did not have to buy other games so we don't get errors

review: Gmod is simiply a great game in general. To have the best experience i would highly recommend playing online gamemodes such as trouble in terrorist town or dark rp. It's best to play with friends even if you dont have anyone one play with you will easily make friends in the gmod community. Single is great fun as well especially when you download lots of extras and weapon packs. I would recommend to anyone looking for crazy online fun.

review: Garry's Mod is a game that is so unique that it almost needs its own genre. Basically, it's a sandbox game where you can create complex contraptions, scenarios with ragdoll posing, or just mess around with your friends. You can have fun in this game with no knowledge of it whatsoever. The Steam Workshop adds a lot to this game, enabling user-built models to be used as well. If you can get a few friends to join in with you, the game becomes even more entertaining - the possibilities are wide-ranging. You can have a bathtub racecar derby, a contest to see who can make the best exploding couch, or see who can make the scariest ragdoll pose. With all the tools available to use and a bit of creativity, this game is a blast and is very fun if you can get some people to join you. You will need a Source game to see all of the textures, but at this point, who doesn't have a Source game, anyway?

But, as i played it more and more, i fell in love with it. there ar so many things to do in gmod, and thats without even factoring in the workshop. and, if you get bored of sandbox, there are tons of multiplayer gamemodes. some of which i enjoy are: death run, ttt, murder, hide and seek, prop hunt, and rp'ing. i would definitly recomend this game for any creative mind. oh, and if you plan on playing gamemodes like prophunt, i would recomend the bundle. it comes w/ counterstrike, so that means you get all the counterstrike maps

review: I think this game is great for anyone who likes sandbox FULL multiplayer zombies FPS rp and sooooooooooooooooooo much more. This game is great for almost all ages frome 5 - 35 and for an old game it has BEUTIFUL graphics. You can get a HUGE range of addons from the workshop that are in almost every way easy to get, that include NPC's vehicles weapons tools props and more. So i think that if you have the $10 you should get this game.

review: Garry's mod is one of the best sandbox/community driven games on PC and possible in Gaming. If you are going to buy this, you should buy CS:S with it since many game modes use those textures in it. Sandbox mode is nice, you can do many things in that but many people also love to play on game modes, I would recommend TTT as a nice game mode if you find a good server but the sky is the limit in Gmod gamemodes(actaully it is the engine but eh). There are so many things to be said about this game and this review would go on for pages if you were to explain every single custom gamemode that is on garry's mod and you will get you 10/5/2.5 euro or whatever the price is out of it since there is constantly new content developed on servers. A great game with a good community if you know where to look.

review: Garry's Mod is a great game to play and a good time waster. Its endless supply of gamemodes allow you to do whatever you feel like. You can play the normal sandbox mode mode which challenges your creativity to build something original and exotic. There are also modes such as prop hunt, ttt, or murder. These gamemodes are nothing like any other gamemodes. They are completely new and original. You will spend countless hours playing an almost endless amount of gamemodes.

review: One of the best "games" on Steam. This is a gem even the most uncreative mind can comprehend. What's that you want to strap rockets onto the back of a T-Rex model and try and send him to the moon? Oh what's that, you want to build a wooden maze with a maze generator, then put enemies in it and watch from above as they run around trying to destroy each other. Then once your done you can burn it all down, or push the undo and start over. This is a unique experience that no other game can give you.

It's free to download add-ons for your game, and even the game without any add-ons is entertaining. A sandbox game with no objective other than to have fun, makes this a great buy. Get your friends to get it too. Seriously. NOW.

review: Garrys Mod was originally a mod for Half Life 2. It is a sandbox game which revolves around spawning props, experimenting with addons and new content, and multiplayer gamemodes. It is LOADS of fun to play. There is always new content with the steam workshop which includes maps, gamemodes, weapons, models, etc. (Some of the maps make you lag, but don't play on those. Play on decent maps) The multiplayer is fun as well. Here is pros and cons: PROS: Very fun to play, and addons support. - As far as I know, its the only game where you can attach melons and bathtubs to a car using an electronic beam. - Lots of gamemodes besides sandbox. These include Trouble in Terrorist Town, Prop Hunt, and Cinema. CONS: - Multiplayer servers take a long time to connect to. - Some servers lag even if you have a low ping. - Sometimes servers are polluted with people who spam props, objects, etc. Overall, it is well worth the 10 dollars. Buy it.

review: I highly recommend this game, due to its great multiplayer, hilarious physics, and decent graphics. It is fun to play singleplayer, but even more fun to play multiplayer. The only downside to multiplayer is the server restrictions. Some servers have HUGE restrictions that make the server boring and no fun to play on, while other servers allow you to do whatever you please. Another reason I recommend this game is the mods. Mods don't ruin the fun like mods in some other games. But instead, the mods enhance the singleplayer, and multiplayer if the server owner is running them. Overall, if I were to give this game a rating, it would be an 8.5/10. The game is really enjoyable.

But, anyways this game is awesome there are many gamemodes created by the community to play in such as Trouble in Terrorist Town, Murder, and Prop Hunt just to name a few. You can also do whatever in the sandbox mode and download more stuff off of the Workshop. But, I recommend you get Counter Strike Source for the textures since this game uses mostly CSS textures.

review: Garry's Mod, also known as "GMod" is one of the first steam games that I've ever bought, and from then on, it has been one of the games that is always in my library, installed. Not exactly, "always" actually. I have uninstalled it many times because of reasons but I always end up installing the game. It HAS the power to make people play the game. Its gamemodes, its skills you use to play the game like creativity and its addons... All of those things make up the game named "Garry's Mod" - the greatest game of all time. Multiplayer. Multiplayer is also the thing I must mention. Multiplayer in GMod lets the game open up a gateway to many different gameplays and it makes the players be together with other GMod players, creating fun, friendships (or more of a bonded relationship) and soon a community that many players likes each other. I have experienced this by playing on servers and especially by playing with friends. It really does make a better relationship! Garry's Mod is also good for your brain. "wat" may be your reaction but it's true! It's not just a "360 noscope headshot omg super gameplay wow fun" game. It's also a very very very creative game. "Why?" you might ask. Well, in many gamemodes you need to, most likely, use creativity, stealth, figuring out and decision making. Which you will need in many real-life situations. Making GMod a game where moms would not go "IT'S NOT A GAME THAT IS EDUCATIONAL!" This may be the shortest ending to a pretty long review, but it's okay because this game gets a rating of: 11/10. Best Game. Nuff' said.

review: This is one of the best games on all of steam. It might not have the best graphics or gameplay, but the things you can do with the steam workshop are mind blowing. The game alone is quite fun, you can build stuff and spawn creatures, but the workshop gives access to hundreds of different games, thousands of different maps, NPCs, weapons, vehicles... The community is really friendly, so you'll be able to find a friend to play with easyly. You need to get this, you will have hours of fun. Also, I'd recomend getting CS:S with it. Without Counter Srike, you wont be able to see alot of the models or maps.

review: Garry's Mod is a hard hitting sequel to Half Life 2 and the prequel to Half Life 3. Garry's Mod really tries to focus on the hard life of Garry living in the slums. Garry has to hide his identity as a 'traitor' to his people and try to kill every single person he comes into contact with. He has to hide and maneuver around the 'detective' whose main goal in life is to find and take down the traitor once and for all. This job can be hard for the seekers because Garry can also be known as a hider and take form of any object, even a cup. As a hider in the form of a cup, he will hide inside, under, or even around gigantic structures like a dumpster to snake his way to victory. That evil Garry. Garry's Mod also allows you to invite all your friends, even the ones who doesn't seem to ever know whats going on. You play with that one person for an hour or so and this person says "This is boring. I don't even know whats going on. Let's go play League." As friends you go and transfer your account to the North America region to play League becuase of the little baby who doesn't have a clue about life, to find out he gets off. 12/10 would role play as Garry again.

review: I highly recommend this game, due to its great multiplayer, hilarious physics, and decent graphics. It is fun to play singleplayer, but even more fun to play multiplayer. The only downside to multiplayer is the server restrictions. Some servers have HUGE restrictions that make the server boring and no fun to play on, while other servers allow you to do whatever you please. Another reason I recommend this game is the mods. Mods don't ruin the fun like mods in some other games. But instead, the mods enhance the singleplayer, and multiplayer if the server owner is running them. Overall, if I were to give this game a rating, it would be an 8.5/10. The game is really enjoyable.

review: Garry's Mod, also known as "GMod" is one of the first steam games that I've ever bought, and from then on, it has been one of the games that is always in my library, installed. Not exactly, "always" actually. I have uninstalled it many times because of reasons but I always end up installing the game. It HAS the power to make people play the game. Its gamemodes, its skills you use to play the game like creativity and its addons... All of those things make up the game named "Garry's Mod" - the greatest game of all time. Multiplayer. Multiplayer is also the thing I must mention. Multiplayer in GMod lets the game open up a gateway to many different gameplays and it makes the players be together with other GMod players, creating fun, friendships (or more of a bonded relationship) and soon a community that many players likes each other. I have experienced this by playing on servers and especially by playing with friends. It really does make a better relationship! Garry's Mod is also good for your brain. "wat" may be your reaction but it's true! It's not just a "360 noscope headshot omg super gameplay wow fun" game. It's also a very very very creative game. "Why?" you might ask. Well, in many gamemodes you need to, most likely, use creativity, stealth, figuring out and decision making. Which you will need in many real-life situations. Making GMod a game where moms would not go "IT'S NOT A GAME THAT IS EDUCATIONAL!" This may be the shortest ending to a pretty long review, but it's okay because this game gets a rating of: 11/10. Best Game. Nuff' said.

review: I really like this game for a selection of reasons: 1.You can do anything. 2.If you get tired of sandbox, you can play other gamemodes. 2.5.(Technicaly, this is another reason, but it ties in with no.2). It comes with a (IMHO) really good gamemode, TTT (Trouble in Terrorist Town). 3. It has a MASSIVE modding community, including Steam Workshop. 4. It is constantly updated. I hope this review helped.

I'd really recommend this game for everyone, its only downside is that i needed to download some contect to fix some missing graphics. Totally worth the time.

review: I can't -not- recommend Garry's Mod as it's whatever you make it. Make things yourself in sandbox modes, or join one of hundreds of custom game types, some of which are incredibly well done and truly don't even make you realize you're playing Garry's Mod. Like mini-golf, kart racing, hide and seek, prop hunt, slender, obstacle courses list goes on. It's always cheap and has tons of possible games for you to try out for free once you get it.

review: Garry's Mod has to be one of the best sandbox games ever made. When ever you fell creative, you have the power to do anything you like and I mean ANYTHING, and thats what makes this game awesome. If you feel brave enough to conquer the scares of a asylum or be the boss of your own gamemode, go right ahead. Everyday the community grows larger, and so does the possibilities that they bring. Addons are a big part of this game, one day you could be owning the skies with WAC aircraft or building an empire of technology with the Wiremod, same goes with gamemodes. You could be outsmarting your opponant in Deathrun or even hunting down your enemies on Trouble in Terrorist Town. The possibilities are truly endless from the moment you press "Play".

EX.Make flying cars with "Hoverballs" and "Thrusters" or go on a rampage by killing millions of NPCs! I would recommend this game to others because if they're wanting to do just about anything or if they are really bored i can just tell them "Hey, you can get this game for $9.99 on Steam store if you feel like doing something completely random or just about anything and Heck, you can even make your own Gamemode!"

The only drawback is that you have to install programs from outside of steam, in order to play garrys mod, 8.5/10

review: Garry's mod is one of the best sandbox/community driven games on PC and possible in Gaming. If you are going to buy this, you should buy CS:S with it since many game modes use those textures in it. Sandbox mode is nice, you can do many things in that but many people also love to play on game modes, I would recommend TTT as a nice game mode if you find a good server but the sky is the limit in Gmod gamemodes(actaully it is the engine but eh). There are so many things to be said about this game and this review would go on for pages if you were to explain every single custom gamemode that is on garry's mod and you will get you 10/5/2.5 euro or whatever the price is out of it since there is constantly new content developed on servers. A great game with a good community if you know where to look.

review: Garry's Mod is something made by gods above the earth working with Valve. It is rediculously fun, neverending, and hell, you might learn something about physics or teamwork because of it. The game is originally a sandbox type of deal but now with a community that breaths without air, you can have races, gunfights, competitive play, and so much more. If I had a list of games every Steam account should own simply because everybody loves it to death, this would go on the list so hard, right next to Half-Life 2. THAT is how good Garry's Mod is. I could tell you even more if you'd like, like for instance, my steam life dealio began because of a lucky choice on Garry's Mod, Garry's Mod builds friends and begins lives.  society, play some Garry's Mod. I'm done here, buy it when you can.

The Reason Being I Wouldn't Reccomend This Game As Mutch For SinglePlayer... But Even If Your Steam Friends Don't Have This Game, There Is Plenty More To! - EG ( Public Prophunt, Public Sandbox, Public TTS - Trouble In Terrorist Town - And Plenty More!! Down Sides - The Biggest Downside To This Game Is Missing Textures!! When U Havn't Got A Certain Game Or Addon For A Server ( MOSTLY PUBLIC ONES ) Or A Mod It Hasn't Got The Texture Files Installed, So It Makes A Black 'n' Purple Glitchy Texture Wich Can Sometimes Be Really Annoying!! I Hope This Review Helpes If So, Drop A Like :) Thanks!!

review: Garry's Mod, a well known game thanks to Youtubers like PewDiePie and VanossGaming. And instantly you understand why they play it so much, it's very FUN! You can shoot zombies, do assault courses on Deathrun, and become a cup on Prop Hunt. BUT, before you do that you first must download the textures that you need to play properly. No, they do not tell you to do that. Your first game of Prop HUnt for example will consist of you looking at your screen confused whilst giant red ERROR signs walk around a map of black and pink squares (unless you already have the games with the correct textures). After downloading everything you need to play the game, you decide to join a snadbox server. BAD IDEA! You spawn and instantly get blown to pieces by a squealing 10 year old with a rocket launcher. If you live long enough to walk around the map, you will constantly be lagging due to the amount of vehicles and giant spaceships whizzing around. Even though there are negatives, they're not really the game devlopers fault. The rest of the gaming experience is reasonably good. There are many diffrent game modes to choose from. And you get a chance to meet new people whilst playing hide and seek, what more do you want?

review: Garry's Mod is probably one my most favorite games, Creativity is imperative in this game and many players show it. You dont have to just build, you can play DarkRP and rule as a mayor or commit petty crimes as a criminal. There are also other gamemode such as TTT or Trouble In Terrorist Town, Zombie Survival and other kinds or RP. However, it does get annoying if you dont have CS:S and everything is a black and purple checkerboard, so i must give this game a 9/10

review: What is Garry's Mod? Hmm. Let's start from the beguining. Garry's mod is a sandbox based on Source engine wich was taken from Half Life 2. Well, what is this game? It is pretty much everything. You can play mario, you can play football, you can race, you can tune cars and have a jet fight with other player. Also you can become a starship designer, create a cake and blow  up.You can do anything. Literally. You can fly a turret threw the wall, you can threw tanks at hordes of monsters. You can FUS RO DAH the  our of a dragon. You can do ANYTHING. You can even dance in front of a minivan singing a silly song. What are the limits? Your limit is your imagination and the map borders. Nothing else. There always is a way to bypass any obstacle. You can work to buy that fancy BMW you always wanted. You can rob banks, blow police vehicles up. Imagine a world where anything depends on you and your trigger finger. This is what Garry's mod is all about. You can't get a lightsaber? Script that ! Make a mod that adds it! The infinity of choises and abilities come from this flexability of Source engine. I won't argue, it does lag sometimes. It does crash for no particular reason once in a week. I have outraged like 100 times because of a new update that makes the game crash the very moment you start it. Yes, I have had a very hard time because of mods that crash the game if installed uncorrectly. Yes, in this game EVERY moment you spend in it goes no where. Server mind get wiped or close. But had I a chance to go back in time and choose again if I should buy this game or not, I would buy it. You do waste your time there. Totally. But what do you get in return? The feeling of total freedom, you have a lot of fun and you find new friends. The outcome is in your hands. You practically choose what will this game give you back by playing in a certain way. So what is Garry's mod? Garry's mod is everything you want it to be.

review: $10 is not even close to the value I have gotten out of this game. Messing around in Sandbox mode with friends, running furiously from the murderer in Murder and keeping still on the edge of your seat in Prop Hunt, the possibilities are LITERALLY endless. The beauty of Gary's mod is that although it is amazing with friends, it is still fun when played alone. Don't let not having any friends who play it stop you from buying this amazing game! I would recommend this game, even to the most casual of gamers.

review: Garry's Mod is a great game to play and a good time waster. Its endless supply of gamemodes allow you to do whatever you feel like. You can play the normal sandbox mode mode which challenges your creativity to build something original and exotic. There are also modes such as prop hunt, ttt, or murder. These gamemodes are nothing like any other gamemodes. They are completely new and original. You will spend countless hours playing an almost endless amount of gamemodes.

review: Easily one of the best games I have ever played. Multiplayer is possible with just the game, but many multiplayer mods use models and textures from other valve games, especially counter strike: source. A quick google search could also give you theese models, helping you to play the game better.

You can also play gamemodes in multiplayer, there are alot of gamemodes to choose from.You can download addons from the workshop so you can use in the game. You might see tons of youtubers playing this game because its one of the top ten games to choose from the steam store. You can also make your own movies, artwork, and all sorts off stuff you can think of, But before you get Garry's Mod, you need to bay Counter Strike Source, it helps alot with your textures. If you don't get that game, your textures will look really ugly, but it's worth it.

review: Garry's Mod, played over 200 hours my most played game on steam. It's great especially in the multiplayer with the vast amount of game modes to try out it is not that hard to find the right one for you. I might play a bit of sandbox every once in a while my favorite is Trouble in Terrorist Town it's a great game mode and it is even better when you find a good server to play on. I probably won't play much anymore since I got perma-banned off my favorite server but I'll still play from time to time.

review: This game is like having sex for the first time. Once you download the game you jaw drops from all the different game modes, just like when you see your first set of . Then as you close your jaw and realize you actually can play every game you drop your shorts and get into it. Just as soon as you enter the lobby you realize you have no idea what your doing, move around pointlessly, going god knows where, and end up boned just like every other newbie. Whether that be stuck as a T man in prop hunt or stuck outside a building becasue you don't know how to open a door. Then get frustrated, slam on your keyboard, put up a spray not knowing how to do so and finish before you even know whats happening and go to another server and get boned all over again. 10/10 would recommend.

Getting the Attack on titan experience on gmod) Dark RP (Where you can roleplay a life with Atm`s , buying specific items and guns, etc ) and Many more gamemodes .

review: This Game Is Very Good because of its creativity and the socialization. Even If you run out of your creativity you can go on the workshop and download a creation someone else has made. I enjoy this game as well as all the people that make money out of this which is awesome and I wanna do too!

review: This is one of the hardest games to reveiw...it is proboly the weirdest game i have ever played. The game is fun by itself, but once you go to it's workshop...there bare millions of ideas/mods to choose from. They only problem/frustration is that some mods don't work.

review: The ultimate Sandbox game! Garry's Mod started life as a simple idea from one of Valve's employees, but it has established a huge player base since its inception. The original game mode is a creation mode, where you can build anything you want (some people have built working computers within the game for example) which provides some brilliant comedy value! The big thing with this is the Third Party Content, the game is open for people to create their own files, such as game modes, (one I recommend thoroughly being applejack semi serious RP) weapons, maps, textures, characters, models, I could go on but you can basically create a game within a game. Even if you aren't highly creative, there is still enjoyment to be had. You can download other users creations, play them with your friends, use them for their intended purpose, or just try to make them explode! There is nothing else that needs to be said about this, its cheap and very cheerful! 10/10

review: This game is fun for me. It's more like a game where you decide what happens. It's actually a game, model tester, and animator (if you do it right). But if you're the kind of player that just likes to mess around and not take games very seriously, this is the game for you. You can get all kinds of models of characters from any game you have on Steam, or the "Addons," and do whatever you want with them. You can get weapons, skins, props, tools, all random stuff. You can even get achievements just for playing the game! So if you like to play games, and play them YOUR way, I highly recommend Garry's Mod. :3

review: Garry's Mod is more than just a game. It's an experience. It's a place where you meet the best friends you've ever had. It's a murder mystery. It's a horror game. It's a virtual 5 star hotel complete with a youtube television and several entertaining gamemodes. It's a racer. It's a sandbox building game. It's a movie making tool. It's whatever you want it to be, and that's why you should buy it. The CS:S content is what is used the most, along with TF2 items, so both are recommended to be installed. I've logged over 1,540 hours into this game and counting, so to say that this purchase was worth it is an understatement.

game-hours: 174.2
review: Okay, seriously, this is probably my favorite game of all time. When you download it, there are a few maps and a million props and all the Half-Life 2 stuff (weapons, NPCs, models). However, upon opening the "Addons" page, there are a million more things that you can download, absolutely free! Guns, maps, characters, cars, and even airplanes. This game literally lets you do anything you want, wherever you want, whenever you want. If you thought that Minecraft was the "ultimate sandbox game", just wait until you try this. It makes Minecraft (and for that matter, most other sandbox games) look puny and wimpy in comparison. Go buy it. Now.

review: This game is one of the most fun and diverse games i have ever played as it not only allows the player to do whatever he or she wants but it also allows them to play on incredibly diffrent and diverse servers with a frindly community for the most part also the amout of mods for this game is massive. The only main problem i have with this game is that you will need other titles to run it properly with no errors or texture bugs this could be frustraiting for some. 9/10.

It's replayability is just outstanding, with topics ranging from being a starship trooper aboard a space ship fighting bugs and super humans, to being a terrorist, finding the traitors within your ranks. It'd require buying hl2, hl2ep1, hl2ep2, and CSS, but it's definitly worth the money.

review: I have always liked simulation games, but Garry's Mod has always succeeded the limit of fun and enjoyment. Because the only limit is your imagination and you can do whatever you want, whenever you want and as much as you want. For me it's one of my favourite games to mess around and have fun with my friends, or make friends probably in different servers! But most of all I Gmod (Garry's Mod) always makes it fun for me and aswell my friends, as you socially increase your limit of imagination by sharing which makes Gmod one of the unique games of enjoyment with social sharing. ;) I recommend this game for anyone who would like simulation games or just to mess around. :)

review: This is my personal favorite game ever. This game is worth all of your time and money. While on the outside it just looks like a Half-Life sandbox game. It is so much more than that. Sure there is singleplayer and its fun but this game is all about the people. Setting up a server can be hard but joining a public one is fun and easy. There are so many ways to play, These are a few of my favorite. TTT (Trouble In Terrorist Town) is all about false trust and communication in a world of evil people. Prop Hunt is just a crazy Hide and seek. Murder is a easy way to play TTT. Cinema is a great way to pirate movies. and sandbox just turns into making cannons and killing everyone. Howerer you play make sure you talk to people. I have met so many awesome friends through this game. We just hang out and have a good time. That should be the motto of Gmod "Just hang out and have fun".

review: Video Games are over all a good investment when it comes down to hours to cost. A game that does this the best is a sandbox game, Garrys mod is a source engine used in the beloved Half-Life episodic series. The gamemodes, Mods and playing style make this one of the best games for value. The one problem is that most of the games require the Counter Strike Source (CSS) textures and is recomended to buy the pack. Over all I give this a 8.5 out of 10

There is Tower, Trouble in Terrorist town, Surf, Flood, and many more! I highly reccomend this for anyone! The bad side? The only bad side is that Garry's Mod mostly uses Counter Strike textures, but I highly reccomend you get the combo: Counter Strike Source + Garry's Mod, for twenty five dollars.11/10, it is a great game!

review: This is the game you play no matter what mood you are in. Wanna play a scary game? Gary's Mod has many addons to make it thrilling. Wanna shoot some people? Try trouble in terrorist town. Feeling creative? Hit the sandbox mode and use everything you have downloaded to make whatever you want. 10 out of 10.

review: Pros: I recommend this game because it's just so weird.... I like it because there's no particular aim to it and you can do whatever you want, honestly buy this game if you're looking for something a bit different! Also you don't have to worry about your computer not being able to run it. Mine's not amazing but I never get lag/framerate, but some maps may cause these problems. Cons: Have seen a few bugs/glitches and whatnot but with a game like this, what else do you expect? I have found that on some servers you need to manually download modpacks instead of them downloading automatically, thus the maps on the servers look very strange indeed. Tbh I struggle to find many other important faults in this game, so all I can say is if you buy it, the well done, 'cos you'll never be bored! :D

review: What I like about this game is that there's endless fun. Play any game mod you want, I's a really fun game. However, it really isn't the same without having friends to play this, sometimes none of my friends are online so playing this is not as fun - If you have lots of friends on steam and like to mess around this is a game for you. 8/10

The amount of gamemodes available is unreal, I couldn't recommend this game more, I would also recommend you to spend an extra couple of bucks for CS:S and HL2 just for the full expiriance, every single one of those 500 hours were worth it, go ing buy this game now!

Garry's mod a sandbox game where you can make your ideas reality, atleast in Garry's Mod, it never gets old we keep trying new gamemodes that keep us thrilled and wanting more a great game i'd recommend especially compared to its great price. The only negative thing is you almost %100 need CSS or else everything will be purple...

review: With well over 1,000 hours logged here, I can without a doubt say this is one of the most fun, interesting, player friendly games I've ever played. Im the type of person who will play a game religiously for weeks but then toss it aside when I've played it through. Not with Garrys Mod. This game has such great functionality and constant new (player made) content, it's literally impossible to get bored or have nothing to do. This game has kept me entertained for years and I've seen the good and the bad. All in all i would HIGHLY recommend this game to everyone.

review: One of the greatest games I have played in a long time, with friends there are boundless opportunities to what can be done, and it is something that I can't stop playing, and always have to come back to. I would definitely recommend this to people as it is so cheap as well.

review: Garrys mod is one of those games that allow you to do whatever you want whenever you want, (unless of corse you dont downlaod any addons which would be a fools mistake). if you dont like the content the current addons supply you with (which would be near impossible) you can go and create your own addons and let others enjoy your creation. And better yet, if you get bored with mindlessly running around the gmod universe, you can invite some friends to mindlessly run around together. no trust me if you buy this game for cheap $9.99 that it is you will never regret it.

review: A Game where you can literarly do anything, thats what Garry's Mod is all about. The community is very active, coming out with many different models, ragdools, player skins, weapons... you name it, the workshop literarly has everything!. You won't be missing any textures for the default, but for others textures they will probably need Half Life 2, Half Life 2: EP 2, Counstrike Source, Portal, TF2. That's the only (Ant sized) problem with Garrys Mod. Garry's Mod is just a plain old Beautiful game, where you let your imagination run wild, Thanks to the extremely active community for popping out the gold of this game!.

review: Garry's Mod is not a game. It is a platform where people can innovate by turning their thoughts into games. You can choose from a variety of different game modes and maps and play them alone by joining servers or along with your friends. New content is continually added. The only limit is people's imagination. One of my favourite game modes is Murder, where you have to figure out who the murderer is along some "innocent looking" humans. Prop Hunt is cool as well, where you turn into objects, and the opposite human team hunts to kill you. You can download more content via the workshop. The game is based on the Source engine and uses graphics from CounterStrike Source, so it is mandatory that you own that game in order for Gmod to function properly.

Install maps and stuff from the workshop, and watch hours fly by. 10/10 Replay: Achievements exist for HOW LONG YOU'VE PLAYED. 9.5/10 Graphics: Half-Life 2ish. Unless you have CS:S or HL2, the graphics don't work so good on some maps and objects. 8/10 Sound: Base sound is okay. Sound mods from the workshop make it a joy. 8/10 Music: Non-existant. Play the radio in the backround, you gamer. Radio mods exist? 2/10 Overall, ADDICTING AS HECK. Install a ton of mods and have fun alone or with friends. The game's lack of music makes it seem incomplete. Not a MAJOR factor, but efficiant. 9/10

review: Garry's Mod is a sandbox game. There are literally unlimited things to download to your game to enhance or differenciate your gameplay. Pros: - Gamemodes, which are each kind of like their own kind of game, for example, "Garry's Mod: Stranded" has to do with survival in a certain location in which you survive with specific techniques. - You can literally do whatever you want. - Die from cans - Multiplayer fun! Cons: - It's tricky to get used to at first. - Downloading new material/addons can slow down your game, depending on how much you download, and it DOES get pretty boring after playing with one of the addons you downloaded for a little bit. Overall I think it's a really good game that I would recommend. It's literally all types of genres so basically anyone can play and have fun.

review: I never really wanted to write a review for any game, but this game sure deserved one. This game changed what a game was. Garry's Mod is a game of endless possibilities. What ever you couldn't do or wanted to do in a game, you can do in garry's mod. Along with the workshop for garry's mod you can download tons of addons, that it be a car from a game or one some one has made, a favorite character from another game or one someone has made, or even a map from another game or one someone has created. You name it, the workshop has it. If it doesn't have what your looking for, then make it and publish it to the workshop for yourself and others to enjoy! If your creative and or have an imagination, or just want to be able to do what you want, this game is for you. I would recommend this game to everyone. Now with every great game, it comes with its down sides. The only bad thing i can say about this game is if you want the full experience you will have to buy some other source games. Some of those games are Team Fortress 2(which is free on steam), Counter-Strike: Source, Half life 2, Portol, Left for Dead, etc. Though if you have Team Fortress 2, Counter-Strike Source, and Half Life 2 you should be good to go. But if you don't have the money for those other source games and don't mind seeing the occasional purple and black checker board(garry's mod owners know what im talking about) then i highly recommend this game to everyone.

review: This Game Is Quite Possibly The Single Most Fun You Can Have In A Steam Game, This Is A Must Have For Everyone With And Account On This Website. With It's Sandbox Mode Allowing For Infinite Creative Fun, There Is Already Quite A Lot You Can Do In This Game, With The Workshop Allowing You To Share Your Own Creations With Friends. And If You Somehow Become Bored Of Just Sandbox Mode, There Is A Huge Amount Of Other Game Modes That Other Players Have Created, Allowing For Almost Infinite Fun. The Only Downside Is That, If You Are A Person Who Prefers Games That Have A Linear Story, You May Not Find This As Enjoyable. But If You Just Want To Mow Down Some Zombies In A Thruster-Powered Melon Couch, Than This Game Is Definitely For You.

review: This game was fun, 08-11, but now its just full of TTT or lame RP servers. The glory days of the mod are dead for multiplayer, filled with 12 year olds on the mic, and power abusing admins. No one plays decent modes, like Sassilization, SpaceBuild, its all DarkRP and TTT. Still fun in SP just mucking about. If you are under 15 you will probably like this. Go and ask your mom to buy it for you POS.

review: Garry's Mod is a really fun game to play. If you want to buy it, it's not that much either, just be prepared, you'll need Counter-Strike Source for it to work or at least to have CSS-Content, Textures and Maps wich can be found on .era.ee. From there, follow the insturctions or over the youtube. After you buy it, if you already don't have bought CS Source then go to that site that I told you and figure it out. Anyway, game is awesome, still some bugs here and there, so buy it fast, 'cuz, it's getting worse if u wait. 9/10 Just because of bugs... - Static

review: This is my number one favourite game OF ALL TIME! (Warning: May cause erection without warning). -================================================================- For anyone who doesn't know what Garry's Mod is: a) You can do pretty much anything. Yep, anything. Create an entire civilization of flying bacon-flavoured waffles only to have them destroyed by a giant-mutant-cyborg toaster from outer space if you want; I don't care. Oh yeah, and it's multiplayer. b) If you don't want to make things or just mess around like that (if so, what is wrong with you?), then you can play more serious or just generally less-creative game modes like 'Trouble in Terrorist Town', 'Zombie Survival' or 'Prop Hunt' (among hundreds of other modes). c) The fun never ends; The Gmod community is one of the largest and most-active gaming communities out there! New mods, models, maps and gamemodes are constantly coming out, plus there's also the hundreds of thousands of things that have already been made. Essentialy, you're always playing Garry's Mod, but you're also playing over a hundred games inside of it. d) If you haven't heard of Garry's Mod, then where have you been hiding? You'd need to completely cut yourself off from the outside world to not have heard of it. You should be ashamed of yourself. So all-in-all, you're paying a small fee to provide yourself with (at minimum) hundreds of hours of awesomely spazztastic fun. At this price, you should feel guilty. Especially with all of the new FREE STUFF that comes out. I would gladly pay 80 or 100 to have this game. Honestly. Not kidding. For real. If you (for some reason) can only have one game ever, then make sure it's this game. I've seen people put in almost 2,000 hours for this game. NOW FOR THE FINAL SCORE -=======================- I have never given a game 100% because surely that's not possible. There's never been a perfect game. Yeah well if you thought that too, you're wrong. Gmod ISN'T a game. It's like thousands of tiny-and-equally-awesome games all in one. 10/10 without any doubt whatsoever. If you disagree, would you kindly go kill yourself please? Thank you.

You might see tons of youtubers playing this game because its one of the top ten games to choose from the steam store. You can also make your own movies, artwork, and all sorts off stuff you can think of, But before you get Garry's Mod, you need to bay Counter Strike Source, it helps alot with your textures. If you don't get that game, your textures will look really ugly, but it's worth it.

review: From the exterior, Gmod seems like one of those games where you play it, realize how stupid and/or boring it is, and never pick it up again. Well, my friend! You are so wrong! First of all, there are several gamemodes to play - want to shoot some terrorists, but want to do some sleuthing while you're at it? Trouble in Terrorist Town. Want to make a giant  out of random props? Sandbox. Want to pretend you're the pickle inspector? DarkRP. Want to play hide and seek, but with random objects replacing the hiders, and futuristic super-soldiers from Half-Life 2 as the seekers? Prop Hunt! Also, don't forgot the great modding capability - as mentioned earlier, there are THOUSANDS of community-made gamemodes out there. Gmod fully supports modding, having it's own workshop and all. Which brings me to my next point, you can download extra stuff from the Workshop. Want to take candid photos of an awkwardly made Shrek model? Download an awkwardly made Shrek model and whip out yer camera! Want to blow some crap up? Download a weaponry mod. Want to survive against badly-coded zombies? Download a Zombie mod! Want to run around an abandoned hospital? Download a hospital map! The possibilities are endless! Don't forget about the community! Sure, there are some s out there, and by some I mean quite a bit, but don't let that let you down! Find a nice little server, join their forums and instantly gain HUNDREDS OF FRIENDS*! *may not actually be true

Being a part of a community and having experiences which you could never relive once. Having this game has brought tears to my eyes because of so much crap happening all at the same time. So much fun. FIRST BUY IF YOUR GETTING INTO PC GAMING.

review: To simply put this, completely un-simple and simple game, it is a huge and amazing game, that still has yet to get better, but then after addons, things will get interesting... -ly fun! You can build beautiful trains, cars, building, cannons, lazers, et cetera, etc, etc. Servers and mechanics can be horrible for most, including lag, lerp, and a few severe losses of FPS, but overall better than a game. 9.5/10

review: This game is amazing,awesome, full of uporotunitis,... I just love this game, i've played it for 111 hours and i will play it to 1000000 h !!! This game is worth every penny. The game costs 7,99$ and its worth it. The game gives you allot of gamemodes and fun stuff to play and gamemodes made by players of the game (us). The game is a first/third person game and you can play sandbox and diffrent gamemodes like ttt(trouble in terrorist town),Deathrun,...Made by buyers or users. If you're thinking if i should buy this game then march to your parents and tell them buy me garry's mod for only 7,99$. In this review i just want to note to people that the game is awesome if you compare it to its value. And thats why i recommend this game!!!

review: I recently rebelled against the overlord. Piling my team into a hoverboat I set out for downtown, stopping only to grab several nukes, Just in case. I plowed through the hordes of zombies, tanks, and nyan cats with a rocket launcher. I faced the tyrant alone, on top the tallest tower. Unceramoniosly kicking him off, I jumped after him. landing after the drop, I thanked the miniscule fall damage and sprinted away with a orbital strike signaler I happened to find laying around, firing madly at the dinosoar bodyguards. This is Garry's Mod. 'Nuff said.

review: Very fun game that has a lot of gamemodes, you'll never be bored.
game-hours: 755.7
review: The amount of things you can do with this, and all of the mods, I'd truely recommend this. For example, you may want to construct stuff and make cool contraptions in sandbox mode, the default mode. Or, you may want to play a different version of something, like hidden, taken from the hidden source mod. Heck, there's even a bomberman mod, called melonbomber, and that sure is fun. If you want to see how good you are under pressure and putting the pieces together of a murder while around a bunch of people you can't trust because they can kill you at any moment, then Trouble in Terrorist Town is very fun, even if you don't want to detect anything you can just wait for someone to be identified as a traitor, and use the custom guns in some servers to kill them, or if you happen to be a traitor, get a bunch of fun equipment and kill someone creatively. Overall, Gmod is a very popular game with loads of mods, and for a good reason. It's the multipurpose game, because it doesn't have one genre, it has many. Many many many many genres. All the videos on garry's mod aren't really accurate, like the trouble in terrorist town videos or just general gmod construction videos, because the people playing them are doing it for "fun" (Being idiots and not bothering to actually accomplish anything) and have no idea what they're doing, like a lot of TTT videos have people RDMing others, which just takes the fun out of the game, even if it is fun to watch. If you watch a single video of Gmod by one of the popular youtubers, you can catch many things they missed. As it stands, I recommend this game a LOT, simply for the fact of it being able to be whatever game you want it to be.

review: I would recomend this game only to people who have or are planning on buying counter-strike: source. Most of the textures in this came are taken from CSS which makes it hard to play for anyone who doesn't own CSS. I would also only recomend buying this if you have friends who also play because without a set storyline this game is quite boring to play alone. A good Idea would be for someone to post the CSS texture files in the Workshop for this game for those who don't own CSS. Idk if thats legal or not but it would be helpful. Overall this game is great and completely unique, but on a scale of "Yes" to "No" I would rate it: "On The Fence".

You can get cool addons from the workshop and play around with them, or you can go on gamemodes. Join fun servers, join communities and have fun playing. The graphics are good for a 10 dollar game. It's beyond worth it. People can say it has no point, or that it's stupid. But, in this game you can make a goal for it. There is no boundary.

review: Garry's Mod, Sandbox at its finest, the workshop for this game makes it an even more amazing game. You can never play too much of this game i have played 200+ hours and would love to play more. Multiplayer gamemodes such as Trouble in Terrorist Town (TTT), Murder and Prop Hunt are just a couple of my favourite gamemodes. I would absolutely recommend this game if you are new to steam or are an experienced Gamer. I would have to rate this game a solid 9/10 I...<3...Gmod ~JuggerChooChoo

review: Garry's Mod, a game of games... In Garry's Mod (or you can call it Gmod) you do whatever you want. You could race cars, build a castle, blow up a castle, go on a rampage of HL2 characters, pose a wide variety of people into stupid positions. The possibitlities are endless! It also helps that it's supported by Steam workshop! You can even play gamemodes such as Murder, Trouble in Terrorists Town, Prophunt, and DarkRP! Overall, Garry's Mod is a superb game, it's my favorite game in fact and I highly recommend you give it a try!

review: If you haven't played Garrys Mod, you've been living in a dark world. Garry's Mod, or Gmod, recreates the infinite universe and allows you to do anything you are able to think of with a little bit of ingenuity. Even when you are not building, Gmod can act as an amazing FPS game as you can spawn countless weaponry and enemies creating an infinite number of adventures. This is a must-play game!

review: This game allows you to create whatever you want, from little table to giant maps with weird souds and traps. Very good choice for creative people or just for those who likes to mess with different things. Despite such a creative oportunities in this game it also gives an oportunity to have some fun in different gametypes. Such as: Prophunt, Zombie Survival, Jailbreak, Mini Golf and few others.

review: This is one of my favorite games because not only is it easy to make new friends but its also fun to play. Once you get the game you are able to go into single player or multiplayer. For single player you can get cool addons to improve the game, and if your more of a multiplayer person then thats okay too because there aton of games to choose from, you can play GTA, murder or one of my peronal favorites Jail break. Garrys mod or G-mod if youd like to call it, also allows you to make your own servers so you can play /w your friends. -Lord Pancake

review: This is an overall good game, but most things I screw with have missing textures due to things not downloading properly. Not sure if this is client-side, server-side, or game-side. Anyways, Garry's Mod is definetely a game you would want to purchase first-hand if you are a new Steam User since it is played by many people and is loads of fun. You can download mods and mess with them, or you can play on a server with multiple people while played one of the downloadable gamemodes available. I like the idea that people in the Steam community can finally put their creativity to the test and create something that would entertain thousands of people. Imagine the guy who created Murder and how successful he/she feels that they made something worth mentioning to people they know!

review: Hi, This is my review for Gary's Mod and i think this is a great game and i do recommend this game. There is no campaign or anything but there are gamemodes on multiplayer and on single player you can play sandbox. You can play sandbox by yourself or with friends. There are so many things and people are posting stuff in the workshop everyday so it is almost and infinite amount of things that you could do. I do not think that this game will ever bore you because it always brings laughs and has almost endless things to do. So i think it is worth the money that you pay.

Then this is it, garry's mod, for a low price, offers you literally the best game you could buy. There are so many game modes in it, you can't even play them all in 1 day. You are just paying for a lifetime ticket to great moments with your friends. Personally I think garry's mod is one of those games you really need to try it out, and for such a low price, why not?

Sandbox mode is nice, you can do many things in that but many people also love to play on game modes There are so many things to be said about this game and this review would go on for pages if you were to explain every single custom gamemode that is on garry's mod and you will get you 10/5/2.5 euro or whatever the price is out of it since there is constantly new content developed on servers. 11/10

review: This is a good game. It teaches you something about physics, It is fun, It takes away your life, It entertains you until you find out that you played for more than five hours, It is stressful for n00bs, It is recomended to have a source game like TF2 or CS:source, and many people use this for videos on youtube or take silly or inappropriate images on google. Still it is a very good game and if you dont have it I'll tell Saxton Hale to send you a certificate that declares that you don't live. GET IT NOW!

review: As someone that doesn't find "build anything you want" games to be fun I really could care less about the sandbox potential, and even if I did, the physics engine, like many others, doesn't exactly work well with the concept of precision and Newton's Laws of Motion (the main issue being how objects in motion in GMod interact with NPCs and player characters in a less-than-relativistic fashion). With that all said, however, the ability for the community to create custom game modes has resulted in a lot of interesting, fun and somewhat unique multiplayer experiences, which include Trouble in Terrorist Town, Jailbreak, Dark RP, just to name some of the more popular ones.

review: This is one of the games that is worth getting and will indeed change your life. It might be a bit boring when played in single player, but then try joining either some public server (be sure to get CS:S too then), or grab a couple of friends and play together... No matter how silly it might look like, just go and get it. NOW. It's on sale anyway...

review: 10/10 I love this game. You can do anything from making a car attached to a rocket ship, to shooting an orange. You can do sandbox by yourself, or with people. You can get cool addons from the workshop and play around with them, or you can go on gamemodes. Join fun servers, join communities and have fun playing. The graphics are good for a 10 dollar game. It's beyond worth it. People can say it has no point, or that it's stupid. But, in this game you can make a goal for it. There is no boundary.

review: I'd say this is the game we all dream about; A 3-D paradise where you can do anything you want, where you want, when you want. The game spans a long spectrum of game modes and possibilities. From getting the living s#!ts scared out of you in a horror map, to building a sled out of a lamp and a tricycle then racing it against your friends. In a world where everything is possible and the only limit is how powerful your pc is. 10/10. I reccomend it to anyone who's looking for a game that'll never get old. :physgun:

Theres no objectives or timers, barricades or save points, you are completely free inside this world. You can make Movies, Games, Cars, Guns, you name it! The thriving Steam Workshop also means you can download to your hearts content. WARNING: THE MORE ADDONS YOU OWN, THE MORE GMOD GETS SCREWED UP! If you can, buy it!

review: Quite complicated when you first get it, but you'll learn alonfg the way. However, You will need Counter Strike: Source to have the proper textures for everything, or else many objects and walls will be purple checkboards or huge error symbols. TTT is a good gamemode to play/ If you don't have Counter Strike Source, I would recommend playing on minecraft servers. You can just type in "minecraft" in the search bar. Gmod is overall a great game though.

review: One of the best games ever on steam 11 stars out of 5 It has awesome single player where you can spawn in rag-dolls and objects and just mess around with them The multiplayer is the best part of the game, they're are about 14 different game modes, some which are zombie infection, trouble in terrorist town and G-mod flood. My all time favorite memory from g-mod was when i was in a zombie server, we were waiting in a room, hoping that the zombies wouldn't have killed the guys at the front, i managed to jump into a vent at the top where 3 other guys were there loaded with ammunition, i don't know how but the zombies made it in a killed everyone, we were the last people to be gotten at because someone had barricaded the entrance to the vents with chair, books etc. ONE OF THE BEST GAMES ON STEAM MUST BUY!

It's so much fun, sometimes I just like to download a lot of addons and make huge wars in singleplayer. But there is also one thing I hate about this game and it's the community, there are so many kids or annoying players blaming each other and ruining the fun but once you find a good server with good community it's perfect game. 9/10
game-hours: 598.9
review: . I love this game. or, should I say, loved. The amount of things you can do is absolutely amazing, and there are even more to come, for the game is made by the community. I played 1600 hours+ on my old account, however I got quickly tired of the game, because the community was flooded with children attracted by various let's players (don't get me wrong, some of the people attracted by said lets players aren't actually that bad players.) and the good gamemodes and servers were buried by the mass of TTT and DarkRP servers all featuring the same features from coderhire (again, not all of those are bad). It's still a good game to play and  around on with friends if you don't mind the community.

game-hours: 2757.1
review: I've played Garry's Mod for over four thousand hours, meaning even before they tracked time on steam games, there's almost unlimited possibilities for this mod turned game. I've seen games that cater to creative minds who wish for nearly limitless possibilities with a physics engine(Sandbox), those who want a serious roleplay experience(SRP/HL2RP), those who want to feel helpless or want to slaughter innocents(TTT), those who have always wanted to do stupid  in a city-like enviroment(DarkRP), and even just people who want simple minigames, or fun small mods(Elevator: Source). The downsides? They depend on your computer, partially if you want to dock game content onto your GMOD(Loading up HL2, CS:S, TF2, ect for content). Every gamemode and server provides a different style and feel, and are not just the only things Garry's Mod has to offer. Hell, you might even waste hours looking for some server or gamemode that feels fun to play. Overall, I've probabally spent the most time on Garry's Mod out of any other game I own(And I mean it, I've beaten HL2 over 52 times now, at the time of posting), and it's tooken up a fraction of my life, I've met good friends, made enemies, watch communities die and grow, dealt with DDoSs, awful admins, and permabans on this game, and it's a damn journey, I'll give 'ya that. tl;dr: 4000+ hrs on game, buy HL2, and buy the CS:S and Gmod bundle, it's worth it.

This game has downloadable content, customization, addons, and so much stuff. And, if you're an up and coming coder, or you want to be, the Expression 2 (E2) in this game is a great place to start, giving you so much to lean on and explore in the sandbox of Garrys mod. Of course, there isn't just Sandbox. There's TTT, a very popular one. DarkRP and other RP's are also popular. So much to do, so little time. Just ask my 1000+ hours. I've invested a portion of my life into this game and the servers on it, and I was not dissapointed.

review: Garry's Mod, if you ever feel the need to just build a giant  out of random junk, then here is the place. In single player you can spawn props from games like TF2, Counter Strike and the Half Life series also you can spawn props from other Valve games that you download, but the fun doesn't stop there, you can also spawn enemies from the Half Life series and shoot the living  out of them. You can go into no clip mode and play god as you send a force of the vortigants after a bunch of antilions, you can also download new props, vehicles, weapons and npc's from the Steam Workshop. The multiplayer of Garry's Mod is also just as fun, It's hard to tell how many game modes there are, but the ones to look into are the zombie survival, prop hunt, death runs and trouble in terrorist town. But you should really experiment with the game modes and get a feel for them. I hope this was of some help.

Garry's Mod is based off HL2 but instead of following some annoying girl, why not kill her, go into noclip, get computers thrown at you, make a private army and MUCH more including: Killing traitors in TTT. Killing innocents in TTT. Starting off with nothing but your fists and advancing to the modern age in Gmod Stranded. Roleplaying a citizen of City 17 in Roleplay. Fending off zombies in Zombie Survival. Fending off humans AND zombies in Zmod! You could even sit in an elevator and watch crazy  happen in Elevator Source!

review: Oh Garry's Mod, you have entertained me for hours. Yet it's really hard to make an review for this game. as it is more of a "engine" for a lot of games within this game. Think of Garry's Mod as a really weird canvas which many have created awesome art on. It's just hard to describe. If you're not satisfied easily then this game might be excelent for you. Why? Well as this game has way more to offer then just messing around, it offers so much more then an average "real game" would these days. For this exact reason I love this "game", it allows being f*cked around in, but aswell gives this incredeble freedom which others might not exploit but build on. If you're not certain if you want it I strongly recommend checking if you have more Source games in your Steam Libary such as Counter Strike: Source and Half Life 2 (and episodes) since Garry's Mod (or GMOD) uses them as resources for texures and items you wouldn't want to miss out on, since most servers use these textures aswell you basicly need them to get the full expierence out of this game! (Yes I did it, I called this "Garry's MOD" a game!) So I'd recoomend this game to everyone that just... wants to have fun!

review: This is most likely one of the greatest sandbox games on the Steam Webstore with plenty of things to do from making a floating piece of wood with some decorations to a motorised bathtub to a fully functunal ship! Or just stack up wooden objects and set them on fire. And if the vanilla version doesn't grab your tastes, get some addons! This game has an outstanding number of addons that can be downloaded with a click of a button! Some addons are made for great new building experiences, take Expression 2 and Wiremod for example, with the use of wiremod you can create working doors and other things (not that good with wiremod so can't give detailed explanation) and with Expression 2 you can make Holograms, Teleporters and big explosions. Although this is an amazing game and I HIGHLY recommend it to anyone who's looking for a unique sandbox experience there is probably only ONE thing that I dislike about it... And it's that if you don't have certain games like Half Life or Counter Strike, some textures and models won't work, this include black and pink checkerboxes and big flashing Errors signs, (luckily I have found a way around this, check out this website to get free models and textures from games such as Portal, Half Life and Counter Strike
game-hours: 584.5
review: - go to the GarryContent tab to gain access to the resources, THIS IS NOT PIRACY, it is not letting you play seperate games for free it is simply giving you textures and models for gmod) other than that issue I give it a rating of 9/10, Definately got my money's worth

review: Garry's mod isn't a game. It's a tool to produce art, whether that be for creating screenshots, testing custom models, designing contraptions with Wire or animating videos for youtube. Its also a great multiplayer experience. Invite your friends along and play some private PvP, play through an Adventure map or a Horror map, Boot up a pre-existing source game and play through it with added weapons and rules. Half-Life 2s single player with six players all wield weapons from Halo 2 would make for an interesting experience wouldnt it? If none of that takes your fancy download a custom map, enable third party models and run a Role-play server. Metro 2033, My Little Pony, Fallout- all youll need is a map which fits the theme- Player models and items ripped from said game and you can role-play to your hearts content. Gmod is also great for custom game modes such as Trouble for Terrorist town which provide a truly unique experience. For such a cheap price tag I would recommend Gmod for anyone who enjoys PC Gaming. Since it provides its users a unique experience every time you play. (Requires HL2, ep1.2, CS:S & DoD to work correctly)

review: Garry's Mod has blown up to be so strong and full of support, it can practically be any game ever made. This sandbox toolkit allows the building of completely awesome structures and devices and the creation of awesome game modes using .lua file structures. In other words: FUN. Want to play racing like mariokart? There are servers for that. Want to act like a homeless person in a city? There are servers for that. Do you want to play something like Quake? You guessed right, more servers. The possibilities with Garry's Mod in the future is great. Admitingly, the Source engine is starting to lose some of it's luster as far as graphics go. Still, Garry's Mod is a solid buy.

Team Fortress 2 is free and is a source game! You don't even need to buy css, in the workshop you can download css packs which give you all the materials and models for free! Now the gameplay consists of 2 modes, single player and multiplayer. Single player allows you to screw around on different maps and do whatever. Now the multiplayer is the reason you should buy this. So many wonderful gamemodes. Consisting of roleplay, jailbreak, trouble in terrorist town and much more! This game is being constantly driven by the community, they are constantly uploading stuff to play with. Did I mention you can spawn watermelons? The watermelons in this game are so appetizing and rich! Best feature by far! 69/10 Watermelons take the cake for me on this game

review: At first when you buy Garry's mod, you're like "wtf do I do." Then you learn the controls and realize there's nothing to do in the game. But then you check out the workshop and realize that there's an assload of thigns you can download for free and play with friends that make the game soooooo much fun. Sure it blows  if you don't have at least the counterstrike source maps, but if you do, it's fun as all hell. And then out of the blue you're getting the acheivement for playing 8 consecutive hours on the same map and server. And then out of the blue you get the acheivement for having a full year worth of your life invested into this game. Seriously worth it, and if you're thinking it isn't worth it, buy CS:Source, HL2, and then buy this game. Your life will be forever altered.

review: This has got to be one of the best games on steam because of the flexibility and imagination of some of the titles (Prop hunt, Murder, Terrorist town etc). The community support is overwhelmingly good and the players are largely a friendly bunch. This is my go to game for casual play.

review: This game is amazing. There are plenty of gamemodes you can play on from standard sandbox servers to war servers. There are plenty of mods you can get for this game too to keep yourself entertained in singleplayer. Only bad thing I can spot out is that on some servers they crash every so often but not a big deal. Check this game out and if you can get the CS:S and Garry's Mod bundle if you can it makes things so much more simple.

review: One does not simply review Garry's Mod. Like, seriously. No one could possibly describe this game. If you can think it, it probably can exist in Garry's Mod. There are gamemodes that are so awesome, well, yeah. They're amazing. You have Trouble in Terrorist Town and Murder, your very own psychopath simulators/stealth games. You have a number of different Roleplaying types, including DarkRP, MafiaRP, Star Wars RP, GangWarsRP (I think), and a number of other bizarre roleplaying types. You have your random gamemodes, like SledBuild (building a sled and racing it), Flood (build your raft, try to survive the oncoming fight), and the infamous GMOD Tower, which is like Garry's Mod inside Garry's Mod. With hats. Yeah, it's pretty awesome.

The only bad thing about it is you should get CS:S (Counter Strike: Source) since many server need it for textures, modles and other stuff. 9.5/10 MUST GET

review: Garry's Mod is the diamond in the stone of all video games today. Lots of games are built upon the promise of the "endless possibilities of your imagination", but truth is, that's not entirely true. Garry's Mod is your imagination, itself. Do whatever you want to do. Fight ninja donuts on a steamship, throw strawberry-infused sunglasses at a flying purple Xbox, have a balloon fight dance party with the president. Whatever you can imagine, it's possible with Garry's Mod.

review: Garry's Mod is a physics sandbox. Unlike regular games there aren't any predefined aims or goals. We give you the tools and leave you to play. You spawn objects and weld them together to create your own contraptions - whether that's a car, a rocket, a catapult or something that doesn't have a name yet - that's up to you. If you're not too great at construction - don't worry! You can place a variety of characters in silly positions.

If you have the spare $9.99 I'd highly suggest you save it for an Xbox One so you can play "Call of Duty 1,000,000 Revenge of Reznov". In my honest opinion, everyone likes this game which means I hate it even though I enjoy playing it. Why do people bother, this game sucks because it sucks. No one is entitled to their own opinions, opinions aren't even real. I'm taking my frustration out in this review because I found out I have a small  and I can't find it anymore when I try to pee.

This game allows you to do that. Ever wanted to kill a dinosaur with a mere pistol? By a few clicks of the mouse, you can do this. Ever wanted to do all this with your friends on Steam? You guessed it, you can do just that. Honestly, after 700+ hours and counting on Garry's Mod, I can say as an individual that this game will blow your freaking mind. I definitely recommend this game to anyone and everyone. Buy this if you can, you will not regret it!

Relax gmod has you covered for the next 6 hours,then when you forget about your job,life,and eventually getting fired then keep playing gmod. Then due to no "Social Life" (Whatever that means) you can make tons of sexposses,just like the rest of the half-idiots-jk-13 year olds do! So whatever you do do not play this game if you have a social life,you will one day then wake up and have nothing but gmod13 being outdated due to playing it for 6 years straight,and also have no memory of forgetting to feed the cat,or calling your mom for 6 years. Anyway buy this game. All proceeds go to watermelon farms everywhere.

review: Oh, yes! Garry's Mod... LOT OF ENDLESS FUN. It's like my own world where I rule the physics. And the MP gamemodes are just awesome. I really lke the game. For the first time you can mybe have a little problems with understanding what is going on and how the things work, but after a while of messing around with tools and spawnlist it will become fun. I totally recommend it :) And sorry for my English, if something is wrong :)

review: In a sea of bland darkRP servers and uninspired TTT clones, one stands above them all. Hellsgamer's is the pinnacle of excellence. They raise the bar in aspects. The gameplay itself is flawless, with humans spawncamping the zombie team with a diverse pool of weapons for the entirety of the game, never faltering. The sublime selection of levels the server has to offer is astounding, with five second fps black holes, to hallways longer than the sun, truly remarkable. Finally, the friendly community that has kept this gamemode ahead of the pack. With in-game points for sale, with real money, the spawncamping never ceases. They have set the bar for administration, banning members of the Noxiousnet community, who's version of zombiesurvival is undoubtedly superior. The brave new world Hellsgamers has created for us is waiting to be explored.

review: This game is fun for all your friends. I have been playing this every other day and I'm loving it so far. If you want a game that constanly changes and you get new expirence every day get this game. My most favorite mod is probably TTT because of all the trills and guessing. Even though people hack and ruin the expirience i go on trust servers. I also play prop hunt which is loads of fun since you never know when something is underneath your leg as a cup. Overall I suggest everyone should play this game because it gives you possibilities other games can give you.

review: Audiovisually Garry's Mod still has the charm of pretty much all of Valve's source games which bare a strong resemblence to Half-Life 2. However due to the nature of Garry's Mod being a very moddable game it can be all over the place if you are utilising the workshop. Gameplay wise Garry's Mod offers the great stability and is rather easy to use. Much of the gameplay depends on what modded gamemode you play but throughout almost all it is sound. Focusing specifically on the primary gamemode, "Sandbox Mode", the tools given to create and destroy all work effectively and easily. Overall Garry's Mod is a brilliant idea that has formed into millions of games in one. Easily the best game for the price.
game-hours: 135.2
review: Not really a game, and definitely not just a mod. At basic levels, it's a sandbox goof-off free-for-all where you throw ragdolls at explosives or drive flying boats. At master levels, Garry Newman has created an amazingly complex animation tool and multi-game... game. If you want to do anything, gMod is for you!

Even if your PC's not especially powerful, you can still run this game fairly well, as long as you tweak your settings correctly. I reccomend this game to almost anyone-- It pays for itself month after month

review: If I had to describe Garry's Mod in one word, it would be this: godly. Gary's Mod is the most amazing and fun game I have ever played, and comes to a tie when compared to the greatness of the Half-Life series (even though Valve hasn't released Half-Life 3 yet!). You have no objective. No story. And everything to do. This deserves to be owned by every single player on the Steam commmunity, and everyone should play it. I've been playing this game every day since I bought it, and I have regretted every time I've had to close it. This game pulls you in more than games like Amnesia: The Dark Desent, and even Call of Duty. So, if you haven't played Garry's Mod yet, then what are you waiting for? Get to playing! I can not say this with enough emphasis, just play the darn game! Everything: 10/10. All it takes is one start-up, and you won't want to put Garry's Mod down!

review: Garry's mod. Garry's mod is a game where you play and spend your first few hours doing dum crap like flinging your first rag doll around like a savage then you start building stuff like box's or some peoples favorite  or spawn seagulls and shoot them with your favorite gun. Then you discover it THE ADDONS or MULTIPLAYER BROWSER then it's feels like a whole new game again. when you get your 50+ addons or playing multiplayer show people your glory's prop  or shooting people or props in gamemodes like TTT or prop hunt. This is a game where you can spend hour upon hours of mostly high end fun but there is times where you will get mad at the game because you can't just get that prop the way you want it or there is someone being a mingebag or A$$-hat. Would i recommend this game YES! p.s get the counter strike source + Garry's mod and save your self the pain of seeing errors.

review: This is an amazing game, with endless possibilities for fun capers. My only regret is that Gabe Newell cancelled the release of 'Garrys Mod 2: Electric Boogaloo', as I was rather looking forward to finding out who Kleiner's father really is after the cliffhanger of the last game. Personally, for me this would have been a welcome addition to the series, especially after 'Portal Strike 3: Left for Life' fell through. But maybe that's just me.

One warning I can give you though: Don't expect to play this game alone too often. As soon as you add in even one other friend, building a rocket or swing set can become just the funniest thing you've ever done. So if you have friends and a hunger for fun, go right ahead and get Garry's Mod.

Basically this game is a haven for anyone who use the tools offered ranging from building, model porting, to even programming your own weapons or gamemodes you wish to make. Only your imagination can limit your potential in Garry's Mod.

This is essentially a game pack that contains 200+ games, is constantly having more added... and it only costs 6 (or about 15 if you don't have a source game). Seriously, great value of money, and provides a very long source of entertainment...

review: As you can see, I've been playing this game for a very long time. This game is one of the best games I've played, and easily goes on my top 3 list. At first, it was hard to get into. A lot of stuff to learn, experience, and do. You decide if that is a positive note or not. Even after 2+ years, I still find myself getting on once in a while, craving that creative side of me that makes me want to build things. This game is not just one thing. This game is many games in one. There are at least 100+ different gamemodes I've played. Most of them are really good. But if you do get this, try not to get sucked into Gmod Tower. It's really addictive. So yes. I really would reccomend you get this game if you're a creative individual looking to do what you want, when you want, without boundaries or limits. The only limit is your imagination.

review: Okay guys, the games on for $2, go dig around in your couch for a while and purchase this absoultely amazing game. It's got something for EVERYONE. You like scary stuff? Stop it Slender. (urehurtingme;-;) More creative and like to build? The entire game is SANDBOX. Enjoy Roleplay? There are so many schemas for RP some of them are bordering on weird. Enjoy being a 12 year old? DarkRP. Nuff said. Like to laugh with total nobodies in an elevator? Elevator: Source. Just remember, don't let God get high or... Yeah. What if you enjoy doing thinks like screenshots and are more artsy-fartsy? The sky's the limit! It's even got something if you're a perverted little kid who wants to see Mossman BJ someone. Just go into the Dupes tab, you'll find them. <_> There are next to NO limits! Prophunt, TTT, Clockwork, Sledding, Stop it Slender, Elevator: Source, The Hunger Games, Stranded, DarkRP, Sandbox, Cinema, and so much more. Those are just SOME of the amazing game modes people dedicate themselves too. The game is grossly addicting, and is easily one of the best purchases you'll ever make. Now go, little birds with credit cards, go and buy Garry's Mod. BE FREE!

As it was built apon Half-Life it comes with all the items, weapons and car/boat. The game is fun with friend and has meny gamemodes. The workshop is full of mods at just a click away. I would recommend this to all my friends because come on my name is fricking DRGMOD100.

review: Given most of the time, a player's creativity, the allowance to make your own gamemodes and mods to this game, even maps, NPCs, Weapons, and even those with special functions, events, and coding. It's entirely up to the player's creativity to how much this game would yield it's worth. You create your own world in this game, or you play others' creations. This is what some would call, the greatest Sandbox to have. And in most cases, they're right. 'cause I end up preferring this game more than another well-known Sandbox named Minecraft. I've still yet to get bored of Garry's Mod.

You could play things like TTT, Prop Hunt, or maybe some DarkRP if you want to be a Theif and rob someones base, or maybe you want to be Civil Protection and protect the community. Get out there, the choice is yours on this game, so many things to choose from, have fun. 10/10

The best part of the game is that this game is MEANT to be modded, so there is always something new to try. No wonder it's called Gmod. And no, you don't spend these years, playing Gmod all by yourself, there's co-op modes as well.

review: Awesome game. Originally this game is based around in using your imagination and you are given the right tools in order to make your imagination come true. Purely from building, it is a fantastic game because you have LOTS of tools to choose from and many different techniques to make your item that you're building work. You can build stuff from a simple car by building a plank, adding wheels and making the wheels move in whichever direction you want to building a huge ship with lots of details inside it and allowing your friends enter the ship (Multiplayer). Excluding the main purpose of the game of building, this game has great variety of mods whether it's a gameplay mode of TTT (Trouble in a Terrorist Town) or Cinema mode. There are lots to choose from and each mode are unique in each way. If you are buying this game then definitely get some friends over for a multiplayer game because it will make your time much more better! This game gives you lots of free choices and many tools, many modifications, many gameplay modes in order to continously count up your gameplay hours! Definitely worth it's price!

game-hours: 386.8
review: Garry's mod is hands down the best sandbox game you can ever find. The only goal is to do whatever you want, however you want. In this game, you can smash watermelons, spawn a heavy, drive a turbo bathtub, fight zombies, spawn the G-Man, shoot NPCs, fly to the moon in a cargo box... The list goes on and on and on. Sandbox mode allows you to do whatever you can imagine! And, once your tired of that, there are tons of gamemodes on multiplayer just waiting to be played! The gamemodes range from multiplayer sandbox to prop hunting, and a twisted terrorist version of clue (TTT). The community can sometimes be a little annoying, but if you find a good server, you will have tons of fun! This game will never make you bored due to the fact that the community has literally tens of thousands of weapons, maps, cars, and any other addon you can think of. I would suggest buying the CS:S + Garry's Mod pack because most of the multiplayer gamemodes require CS:S content to play. I have had this game for 3 years and I'm still having fun with it! My rating: 10/10

review: Great fun and highly addictive! You discover something new and amazing every time you launch the game! Garry's Mod is great for experimenting and playing with things. Build traps, secret bases, houses or even Rube Goldberg Machines! When describing this game to my noobling friends, I describe this game as "The best game ever made because whatever you want, you can get. Wanna pony? *BAM* Pony." Steam Workshop integration was the most perfect idea for this game, allowing mod making nooblings, such as me, to upload wacky dupes, such as yours truly's "The Kleinstain", a nightmarish idea that sprung into mind. I would STRONGLY reccomend this game as it's just so unpredictable what you might find! Mods that I love: The TARDIS (And corresponding Sonic Screwdriver Mod) ALL mods in the Carter's Addon Pack (CAP) ALL Space Build Maps And many more.

review: Garrys Mod. What can I say? This game is nothing short of amazing and overly-addicting. It doesn't matter what type of gamer you are, you could be an rpg gamer, first person shooter gamer, sandbox gamer, or just a gamer who enjoys having laughs and goodtimes. And this game delivers plenty of those. My favorite part of the game is spawning hundreds of npc's and making them either have an all out war with me or other npc's. There seems like endless possibilities and things you can do with this game. And it has a brilliant workshop. My advice is to go on and waste alot of hours on this game. Because every second is worth it. This game recieves a 93%

review: Once upon a time a user named Garry posted a few screenshots on SomethingAwful many, many, many years ago. He wanted to show that it was possible to 'rope' objects together with valve's source engine in HL2. Then he added some other functions like spawning items below your crosshair with tools and change ragdolls's faces, it quickly turned into the mod that exist today. Maybe you should buy it?

review: GMOD is a game which really brings players together. Through its countless amount of gamemodes, users can play games with friends doing various things, such as sandbox (the default gamemode) or others made by third parties like jailbreak, morbus and so on. Not only does the game have plenty of playable content, you can even create your own through the ease of map making and item making using various software such as 3d modeling software. Thankfully the game has plenty of community items to add through the use of the steam workshop which adds more fun to an ever increasing game. There are plenty of gamemodes which in my opinion stand out, of which some I have already mentioned but others include Trouble in terrorist town, Hunger Games and Stop It Slender. Gary Newman in my opinion really hit the nail on the head with this game, it's ideas to create a game which is managed by different communities is a great addition. The only drawback I find is that when loading into servers the page freezes for the login period, this could be fixed which would make the game even better for me. I seriously recommend anyone who is a community player, someone who loves playign their favourite games with others and also people who are creative as GMOD allows ones creative mind to flow.

I can't recommend this game enough, 11/10

review: Great game. This game pretty much lets you do what you want. Build a missile? Done it. Create a zipline with a a bathtub? Done it. There are nearly no limits in this game. And if you can't do it out of the box, there's probably a mod for it. One of the best mods ( or mod collection) I've found is GMod tower. Try it out if you buy the game! Oh,and on the workshop there are several conter-strike : source content packs. It means you can play on servers and gamemodes that require Counter strike: source without buying it.

review: This game is really not your normal game, and I suppose you can see that from most of the screeshots. Sandbox games are powered by others, and what they create, to be honest, without downloading anything from the Steam Workshop, the game can get boring fast, it's loaded with 2 pre-made maps with valve to goof around and get a hang of the core components of the game. But then that's where TTT comes in (Trouble In Terrorist Town), it's an incredibly unique game mode that's very fun and there is really nothing else quite like it. And playing a custom downloaded game mode or map can be an incredibly hilarious and generally enjoyable experience to have. Overall this game can provide endless fun if you play it in the right way. The visuals are nothing groundbreaking, but it is a almost direct port of Half Life 2, so if you have played it then you know what your getting into. Hope this review helped

review: Garry's mod is one of the best community driven games on the PC. Garry's Mods has a variety of gamemodes from sled build to Trouble in Terrorist town(TTT), and even Rolepaly servers. To use this game to its full advantage, you will want to have Counter Strike Source and Halflife 2, Hl2 episodes one and two, as many mods on the Steam Workshop will not work with out one or the other. After Playing the game for some where around 24 hours I can gladly give this game an 8/10. I didnt give it anything higher because it doesent work to its fullest advantage with out the other Valve titles.

review: One may look at Garry's Mod and say, "Oh, you can do anything. Cool." without giving the game a thorough look. Deeper inside Garry's mod, you find that it isn't only posing ragdolls from Source games and giving them silly faces. There is a variety of seperate gametypes to choose from, whether you construct things with your friends, solve a mystery and find a killer in the old-fashioned "who-dun-it" matter, or even building boats to stay afloat in a flood. The options are nearly endless, as Steam Workshop creators can make things for Garry's Mod. This game will keep you playing for hours and hours, no matter what gamemode you play. Note: This game IS better when you play it with friends.

review: Garry's Mod is a great game. The game offers a variety of game modes that can be fun for playing alone or with friends. The base Sandbox mode can provide a lot of fun, and can also be very interesting when you go in-depth. There are also plenty of other game modes such as Trouble in Terrorist Town, Murder, DarkRP, and Prop Hunt. (and many more.) Many of these game modes require Counter Strike: Source to fully enjoy them, but you can buy a bundle of them both for relatively cheap. Great game.

It is really worth to buy the game. On the most server are a really good community. Good work Facepunch Studios :)

review: The most customizable game that I have seen. It has everything, and you can add more, from Half Life 2 vechicles to THIS... IS... SPARTA! The biggest sandbox game so far. With hundreds of gamemodes and thousands of addons that you can put five more hours of gameplay into per addon, you will never be bored by this stunning combination of build-it-yourself singleplayer and fantastic fan-made multiplayer. You will find yourself inserting months into this game, and you will be hooked on it for years, as new updates come out to make it even better. In all honesty, if you would love to put years of your time into a game, this would be the one for you.

review: Garrys Mod is quite a relaxing game for when you are felling creative. It is one of the grates sandbox games I have ever played with such aa huge variety of activities wich ranges from building what ever you want or just blowing  up (wich is my favorite). If you get bord of vanilla then install some mods of the steam workshop, wich as loads of content such as new maps, gamemodes, npcs and even more weapons (for blowing  up)

review: This game is so awesome and fun! You can do everything you want, from fun multiplayer minigames like Prop Hunt or Trouble in Terrorist Town to horror maps, to wars with guns that have graphics like Battlefield. You can build stuff, create houses, do fun games with NPC's and let your imagination flow! There are so many workshop addons, ranging from anime NPC's to weapon packs. There is everything you can imagine in Garry's Mod. There are maps with an intense war like Combine Onslaught and the dozens of millions of zombie survival maps, but also family friendly things like downloadable cars and racing maps (although the racing controls are really stiff). There is even a huge NPC that is the final boss of Doom 3, it's so much fun to spawn some cute anime girls NPC's, make them invincible, give them weapons and fight against that monster while it's spawning other monsterse at you, that boss even got a boss theme, and in the right map it's just intense. There are even Skyrim dragons as boss! It's just so much you can do in this game, you never get bored of it. But something that I don't like is that the achievements are IMPOSSIBLE, I stalk Garry (the creator) every day to see if he's playing the game, to join him and get that darn achievement. Anyways, this game is awesome and really fun. 9.5/10

It took me forever to get a good grasp on the controls, but when I figured them out I couldn't stop playing this game. Helpful tip: Don't download a LOT of models cause for some weird reason my game doesn't like a lot of them and will quit out unexpectedly if I try and use them.

review: Garry's Mod is a fantastic game, and in my experience (albiet a short one compared to most other people that have it) has been a fantastic one. If you can think it, you can do, build, create it. Garry's mod is one of the few games that is only limited by your own imagination, and that's why I love it. In fact calling it a game is an understatement, it's a whole world of it's own, It's what you make of it. I have experienced very few errors in the game, and the ones that I have experienced were so minute that it hardly affected the gameplay in any way. It is a truly remarkable title and I highly recommend it to anyone and everyone.

review: Garry's mod is a sandbox game where you have fun with characters from other games. Garry's mod is most fun with a friend on an online server. But, the only way to get the full experence is by getting stuff from the workshop. So, if you arn't the type of person to do that, then this game isn't really for you. But, I highly recomend that alot of people should get this game for some laughs and just for have a good time. My rating for this game would be a 9.4 Out of 10.

review: Try to add every Source valve game made + physics + Imagination = Garry's mod. Racing, flying, and mods. It's like Valve's version of 3D - Physics - and open source to Minecraft. Get the game now! Sometimes buggy because HEAVY coding sometimes crashes, no worry a few seconds away from a quick command fix. If you play with mods i.e: Weapons,etc. Prepare for tons of crashes, or if your lucky tons of redo's and reinstals. overall a highly good game to buy. Runs off of the imfamous Source engine so prepare to do a LOT of loading!

The only downside I see with this is it requires many downloads to get the textures used, and if it's on sale, I would recommend buying the CS source package with this game, as alot of textures and maps come from that game. Otherwise, just download a CS source mod that gives you most of the textures and maps from CS, but be ready to see a few giant error signs, especially in prop hunt if you choose this option. 8/10

review: Definitely a top pick! Never really knew what this game was until I finally played it when a friend recommended it to me. It went on sale and I decided to give it a try, and I can honestly say that I was not disappointed. Garry's Mod is esentially a bunch of smaller games roled into one title. Using Half Life 2 as a base, it edits its gameplay mechanics to create an entirely new experience for players, with even more content and creativity added in by the community. This is definitely a great go-to-game if you have some friends to play with and want an entertaining time waster.

review: From cool mini-games and game-modes, to awesome mods, and the best-created maps there was, Garry's Mod has a ton in stock for the player to enjoy. Trouble in Terrorist Town, Murder, Prop Hunt, all well-created game modes, will entertain you for, a very, very, very long time. This is the coolest sandbox, where you can make almost anything, like a human slingshot, be anything, from a zombie to a tyrannasaurus rex, and see anything. (You get the point.) I recommend buying this, creators! If anyone doesn't have this game, I feel bad for you. 15/10

It is a very entertaining game. Seeing as most people have already played this game, I don't have to go in depth about it. I would recomend this game to anyone with a computer thats not very powerful because this game isn't very requiring.

If you know how to adjust settings and put together objects, you can make cool screenshots. If you know how to script with Lua, you can make fun gamemodes. The list goes on and on. If you're just a consumer and you don't really want to be productive, you can always join a server with a gamemode like Murder, Prop Hunt, or even Bunny Hop. With Garry's Mod, there's something for everyone, the developers and the players.

review: this game is VERY SATISFYING it is FULL of new things EACH DAY i found myself playing it for 637hrs that is CRAZY and i havent noticed the game is very fun , it is not a serious game so if you are a serious gamer you might not enjoy it that much. the game is a fantastic game to play with friends , i would say if you play the game on your own you may miss some really enjoyable moments out. overall IT IS A LAUGH HONEST ( NOT IN A BAD WAY) it is a fantastic LAUGH you will LOL SO HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARD READ BEFORE BUYING PS : GET COUNTER STRIKE SOURCE ASWELL OR IT WONT RUN THAT WELL so Gmod i think its 6 with counter strike source which i think is like 10 but its always on special offers (THAAAANKS STEAAAAAAAAAAM xD :) XXXX ) ITS WORTH BUYING !

review: If you're one for playing a game that sort of requires minimal gaming skill (like this person) but have a functional mic and a likeable personality, then this game is a 100% must. After purchasing, I made more friends than I could have ever hoped for, being that the community is more or less completely welcoming of pretty much everyone - this is certainly for the awkward gamer who doesn't really know what to do with their time and needs a new outlet aside from Minecraft! Please purchase, and we hope to see you soon!

review: took a little bit to figure out how to play but once I did it is so amazing it's like minecraft in general with sandbox and minigame gamemodes, maps, and mods (addons), but is more of a first-person styled game like Call of Duty in the way you explore the different maps and aspects of the game. the UI was a little difficult to understand but you get more into the game the more you play and experiment. definitely recomment, atleast an 8 out of 10

review: It is the absolute utopia for sandbox games everywhere. Garry's Mod can be everything from making houses, to doing heists and capturing hostages. The multi-player is what I belive to be a key factor in this games success, It has so many different gamemodes that the people have made such as, Roleplay, Sandbox, Racing, Trouble In Terrorist Town (Detective), If you can think of it, this game has it.

review: A hilarious game mode that attracted me in as soon as i started playing it. I was first attracted to Garry's Mod from Youtube, mostly from Trouble in Terrorist Town, but my interest was piqued by many more game modes when I opened the servers list. Dark RP is an amazing roleplaying gamemode which has you pick a job and live among others. The people can sometimes troll, but whenever that happens, just have a laugh yourself. TTT, on the other hand, brings you into a scenario of 3 people, the Traitor, Innocent, and Detective. The Traitor is amazing (my favorite) to play, strategizing the best way to kill everyone on the map with your fellow comrade(s). Another gamemode (or multiple gamemodes should i say) that I loved was Gmod Tower. It was almost a hotel, where you could get a room and decorate it using furniture. Where did you get this furniture? From games or course! You were able to match up against players in different gamemodes, and reap your rewards to decorate yourself, your room, and even give you an edge up in some games. All in all, Garry's Mod is an amazing game which I would reccomend to anyone looking for a good waste of time that isn't strict at all.

review: When I first bought this game I thought it would be a good idea to join a mostly free-build DarkRP game. As soon as I joined I checked the jobs, and since I was relatively young I thought it would be "Hella Sweet" to be a drug dealer. "Heheh, if my mommy found out I would be in soooo much trouble", I would say to myself. Little did I know, I was 12 and she wouldn't give a , I was kinda the same way when I got a Grand Theft Auto texture pack for Minecraft (because I wasn't allowed to play GTA). These guys approached me in my SICK drug store made out of doors, wooden pallets, and one window. So... I need to stop getting off topic, seriously what the ? They bought a bunch of drugs off of me, then proceeded to keep me with my base (I didn't lock it... smart me). They literally ing took my drug store and dropped it on me THEY ING DROPPED IT ON ME. They then proceeded to steal my money and continuously prop kill me... over... and over... and over. (Commence squeaker voice) "GUYS! SRSLY, STOP KILLING ME IT'S ANNOOOOYYYIIIINNNGG". The guy who was killing me said he would stop killing me, then his friend started killing me over and over again, I said "WE HAD A DEAAALLL", he replied with, "Yeah, I said that I would stop killing you".

review: This game started off as a simple sandbox game where you build things with friends and screw around to any extent you wanted. People started to create mods and gamemodes which gave the game an entire overhaul, making it completely modable, with many mods. This game has a wide arrange of gamemodes to play, with the ability for more to be written. I highly reccomend this game for anybody who is looking for a good way to pass time or have fun, because this game has every time of play style available.

review: This game is just ugh. its like babycrack. If you seriously don't know by now, Garry's Mod is a sandbox game with no specific or predetermined goals in mind, meaning you can do whatever you want. PROS While the default sandbox gamemode is fun, there is a really strong comminuty for this game that will recreate just about anything into this game. These are packaged into the game as addons, are there are several of them to download through the steam workshop. Some of my favoritee gamemodes include Trouble in Terrorist Town, a mod that is now bundled in the game, where there are several innocents trying to find the one or very few traitors, who try to kill innocents, and Prop Hunt, hide and seek on crack, where there is one team morphing into map props, and another team trying to kill the props. CONS The only con is that unless you wanna see error alot, you really need to buy CS:S, but since that game is great too, i don't mind.

It's one of my most favourite games going, I haven't found a single flaw with it, and I enjoy DarkRP and whatnot, the gamemodes range, and meet everyones different needs. So I'd recommend it, it's quite cheap too. So buy it.

review: Garry's Mod is hours of entertainment and a game that I highly recommend. It's on sale on Steam often enough, so if you don't have it, buy it. It's a sandbox-style game that can load content from a number of Source games (TF2, HL2 etc.), as well as having a great selection of weapons, tools, maps and saves available in the steam workshop. You can plonk stuff anywhere you like, build contraptions such as hover cars or even spawn huge weights to crush Barney under (because he still hasn't bought you that beer!) The part I find most enjoyable, though, is loading up the original Half Life 2 maps and using the GMod tools to cause havoc. Bar up doorways, set up trip-wire bombs or even find where Dr. Breen is hiding and replace him with a beach ball. And if you're the programming sort, get WireMod. You can put down a range of sensors and displays to make cool stuff like control panels where you have to turn the key and input a 4 digit code in order to set off the explosion. Takes a bit to learn, but is so much fun!

review: Garry's Mod, where can I start? This game is comparable to buying a cardboard box and putting outside in the rain and watch it slowly deteriorate. But this game is probably the closest thing a person can get to being able to be themself without worry of failure. This game [as it says in the description] is basically an electronic sandbox. You can literally play with yourself and still have fun. This game is worth the price to pay for it. Although it has gone to poop in the last vew software versions. It is still a good game. I highly reccommend this to people that don't already own this game.

You wanna build a ed up spaceship? Go and do it! Just wanna have fun and massacre NPCs? JUST DO IT! The only downside I can see with this game is that hosting your own server via the garrys mod own multiplayer server tab is broken you cant just get your friends and join the game you need to open ports etc. Only thing so far I can see with garrysmod 9/10. And we should not forget the game mods you have play on this game ttt,prophunt and many more!

review: One of the most open and enjoyable games you will ever play. You think it you can create it in GMOD. Its a huge community driven experience and its still being played 7 years after it became a fully fledged game. You will need the rest of the source games to fully enjoy gmod, but providing you do its a blast. Make anything, do anything and get shouted at by 12 year olds from Russia while you do it. Also theres that TTT thing, thats popular and fun. For its Normal price or the amazingly low steam sale prices Gmod is a game you will not regret buying, unless that is that you want to get something done, its kinda good at stealing time away.

review: This game is like no other game. Garry's Mod, or more commonly abbreviated as "Gmod", is a Sandbox game that lets you build anything you want. You can go into an empty building and spawn a table, chair, and a ragdoll to make it look like he is having some nice tea. Garry's Mod doesn't have any objectives. Instead, you set the objectives for yourself. Some may say, "There's a right way to play GMod." They are wrong. There is no right way to play this game. Not even a wrong way. Even GMod pros have more things to discover. The game basically gives you free will. You can do basically anything without consequence. You can spawn some NPCs and kill them. The game just gives you the tools you need and lets you be. The GMod workshop also provides great addons made by real users, for those who aren't content with the default maps, props, and ragdolls. GMod 14 better not be a flop.

review: Garry's Mod is one of those games which doesn't grab you at first - but once you delve deeper you realise how much potential it has. Its singleplayer building sandbox offers a wide range of props and physics manipulations. You can create really intricate machines and contraptions if you have the inclination. For me though, it's multiplayer "gamemodes" which really draw me in. Trouble in Terrorist Town, Deathrun, Surf, DarkRP, Jailbreak etc are a few community developed gamemodes which make the player fulfill a certain role. Essentially, games that could be a standalone product (especially TTT) are all available for free. If you are interested in buying Garry's Mod, then I would strongly suggest you check out these gamemodes. Word of warning though, the general player community in Garry's Mod is honestly one of the worst I have ever come across. Of course there will always be trolls; but each server generally has around 50%+ people who are really not going to be the most civil bunch you've ever met. Try to find a server which has decent admins (which I admit has become a rarity) and that you enjoy playing on.

review: This game is without a doubt the must-have game for Steam. It is the staple for all sandbox games and comes with an abundant supply of gamemodes/mods. The three recommended game modes to first play when starting the game for the first time is definitley the original sandbox gamemode. Its great to get a feel for the game and most of the textures and aslo isnt short of props and other creations in the menus. The second and third are Trouble in Terrorist Town and Prop hunt. TTT is one of the most entertaining mods i have ever played. When comparing TF2 prop hunt to Gmod Prop Hunt. Tf2 is shutdown. Gmod PH provides hundreds even thousands of props that you can change to anytime during the round and overall make it more fun for you to hide as something you choose. ***BIG NOTE: It is highly recommended that anyone who decides to purchase GMOD should try and purchase the Garrys Mod + Counter Strike Source bundle because several of the gamemodes use counterstrike textures and props. You can still play GMOD without CSS but in most of the TTT servers and many other gamemodes you will find loads or giant ERROR signs and missing textures due to the reliance on counterstrike. Not to dent steam revenue but waiting till there is a sale for the game itself or the bundle is the best economic purchase. Gmod and CSS are regularly on sale throughout the year. When not on sale the bundle is somewhere around $25, and when both are on sale for 50-75% off the bundle is like either $7.49 or $10. Disregarding what you spend on this amazing game it will pay for itsself time and time again, with never ending entertainment and fun. It is a must buy for and PC gamer.

review: Garry's mod is one of the best sandbox/community driven games on PC and possible in Gaming. If you are going to buy this, you should buy CS:S or buy CS:S + Garry Mod pack with it since many game modes use those textures in it. Sandbox mode is nice, you can do many things in that but many people also love to play on game modes, I would recommend TTT as a nice game mode if you find a good server but the sky is the limit in Gmod gamemodes What can you say about a mod that has about a million servers and infinite replay value with it's own workshop and fanbase? Well, for starters. this game has everything to offer due to its unbeleveable amount of mods and mod authors,you can spawn what you want but that is limited number. Very intuitive for creative minds, if you love to get creative, and if you love the Half Life series, this is the best game for you!

But seriously, if you like the "build and play" minecraft syle of games, you'll love this. It's basically Minecraft, but with a huge array of guns, maps and mods that can change the way you play the game. Take TTT for example, one of the most played Gmod mods, and by far one of the most...interesting(?) games I've played in a while. Sadly, the only flaw was that you needed a  tonne of games to make it truly work with all the mods. With over 40 worth of games to make all the mods, and all extras run nicely and the weapons not to be giant "error" signs. 7/10 Good game, with the right games.

And thats just sandbox mode. there are many other amazing online modes, but the best is TROUBLE IN TERRORIST TOWN which is a great and fun game mode, but it will require Counter-Strike:Source.

review: A game where you can do whatever you want, share what you just did to the community for others to play around for it. It's a unique game, where you can experiment with your friends, family, or strangers that you just found on a server. A lot of custom game modes, where you can all do lots of different things. Ever dreamed to make a spinning baby-doll on a razor blade attached to a sonic scewdriver which is on a rocket attacked to a school with robots in who have waffles in their mouths? Guess what, you can make it! You can do whatever you want, even make a whole new invention better than all the rest! Now, no game is perfect, so my score will be fair, no game can truely be 10/10. I'll give it a... 8/10. I just love the idea of being able to experiment, make custom maps or objects and then share it with the community. This was Harichi, and thank you for reading my review.

review: This is just tremendously fun. At the mere price of $10 (and an accompanying Source game, but if you're on Steam, you probably have one of them already), this is probably the most value I've ever gotten from a game. The core game is great for faffing about, but the add-ons (all free!) are where it really gets fun. Want to race a Lamborghini around Dustbowl? Go ahead! Want to have a giant Hatsune Miku beat up Godzilla with a crowbar? Make it happen! And if there's some crazy idea you have that somebody else hasn't had already, you can make your own creations in Lua script and import them into the game with ease. All I have to say is just buy it already.

review: First of all , The Sandbox is fun , You can do almost ANYTHING! Second , The servers are fun , they have different kinds of game modes like Trouble in Terrorist Town , Prop Hunt and even a Minigame server! like some kind of WarioWare or Mario Party kind of game mode. Third , The addons are just so cool , Everytime I go through the addons menu , In every page I never got dissapointed , Picking up the things I want and getting excited to try them out myself. I'd rate this game 9/10 , some things are missing out like the instability of props (which makes the game kinda hilarious)

It also supports other games such as Team Fortress 2, and the Counter Strike series, allowing you to create maps and other wonderful inventions across different games! Garry's mod isn't the best visually or physics wise, however due to it's light hearted nature... It really doesen't matter! Have fun!

review: Not that this game needs much of a review, it is already an extremely popular and successful game but I figured I may as well just drop a note down since I do much enjoy the game. This game is so great because you can almost play it no matter what type of game you may be in the mood for. Want to sit back and enjoy some good entertainment? Go check out a cinema server and let the mounds of hilarious videos pour in while you socialize with others. Maybe you want to blast away some zombies, you can sure as hell bet there are some zombie survival servers where you fight to survive an endless amount of deadly zombies that want nothing more than to get a taste of your juicy brains! Maybe you're feeling creative today, go find a freebuild server and create almost anything your heart desires. With the addition of the wiremod plugin your creative possibilities seem almost endless. If none of this is fast paced enough for you, that's fine, we've got deathrun servers waiting for you as well! Feel your heart pound as you attempt to jump and climb through deadly traps, all controlled by the simple press of another player who wants nothing more than to see you fall in to that pit of spikes or get smashed by the giant hammer he just sent down to crush you like a little ant. Make it through all the traps and you'll be able to get your revenge by mowing him down with your sweet little smg! If none of these few examples I've given have caught your eye, don't go yet! There are plenty of other gamemodes to choose from. Just ask one of your friends that I'm sure owns the game or check out some videos online. This game is everywhere!

review: This game sounds strange, but it is anything but that. This game is a game where you create contraptions that could do almost anything.The game is basicly a sandbox gamemode for half-life 2. However, many people make multiple types of addons for this game, including npcs, wepons, tools, vehicles, maps, and just about anything else you can think of. You can also play online in building servers or rp(Role Playing) servers.

review: One of the best "games" on Steam. This is a gem even the most uncreative mind can comprehend. What's that you want to strap rockets onto the back of a T-Rex model and try and send him to the moon? Oh what's that, you want to build a wooden maze with a maze generator, then put enemies in it and watch from above as they run around trying to destroy each other. Then once your done you can burn it all down, or push the undo and start over. This is a unique experience that no other game can give you.

review: Garry's Mod is one of the most unique games I have ever played, for the reason that there is no overall goal. Take any other game and you'll see that, although sometimes hard to find, there is an overlying goal, something that Garry's Mod lacks, and for a good reason. This gives the user a level of freedom never before experienced, in both singleplayer and multiplayer. The multiplayer in Garry's Mod is, arguably, the best part of Garry's Mod. A few weeks ago, I watched videos of people playing Prop Hunt and Trouble in Terrorrist Town, never once believing that both game modes were part of the same game. The ease at which you can play multiplayer with your friends is unbelievable - you simply join their game, and voila, you're in. Playing Trouble in Terrorrist Town with friends is one of the best multiplayer games you can play, and only for 5.99! The one, and only, downside to Garry's Mod is the fact that it requires you to possess a Source engine game such as Counter-Strike: Source, because without this, the game is full of checkered textures and error messages. If you are going to buy this game, buy it with Counter-Strike: Source. Therefore, overall, I have to say that the 84 hours I have played of the game, split between TTT, Prop Hunt, and Death Run, reflect how great this game is. My score = 9/10

review: Garry's Mod is a Sandbox Game based around the idea of building. My friends and I have many hours of fun crafting new and exciting contraptions. In addition, you can interact with people from around the world and make new friends and fun.

review: Garrys mod is a great game and I would recomend it to everyone considering how cheap it can be on sales and it's a real laugh with mates. But garrys mod does experience crashes a few times, you need quite good connection to run a server because one stupid move or you spawn something particularly big the server will crash, but as I said it's amazing fun. The community is great on this game as well with pepole making mods all the time so it can't really get boring with the near endless amount of mods in this game. The game features building and combat with a wide range of silly mods that are tremendous fun. But you do have some kids that will annoy some pepole quite a lot but you can turn of voice chat so that dosn't mean its a problem in some cases. It's a source engine so the performence is good as every source game. It ran on my old computer which was 8 years old so the performence isn't a factor you would need to really consider. So overall I would seriously reccomend this to anyone.

review: This is basicly everygame put together. I play this all the time with my BFFs. Only down side is that if a server has a certain texture you don't have, but i don't think that's Garry's fault, but they could add a feature where you can install what you don't have while on the loading screen. Otherwise, this is the coolest game. Are you a whoivan, you can install Doctor Who addons. The fanbase for this game creates so many addons and they're easy to install, but I'm reviewing the actual game. I give this game a 9.5 our of 10.

review: Gmod (Garry's mod) has been a long time favorite of mine and i think its about time to right a review. Basically, for the people that dont know/or cant tell, its a collection of games and ideas that was put into a sandbox. This game has developed over time (7 years, current date 12/27/2013), and has developed with the community. So many whacky, funny, interesting things can be added to this game and now with Steam workshop, its just the click of the button. Though i will say this, some versions of the game of been better than others, including the current version. But that doesnt stop it from being any less fun. This is a very good sandbox that i highly recommend for any hardcore or casual gamer.

review: Single-player isn't that good, but the multiplayer is! The Single-player world requires a lot of imagination to play, however, if you want action, try the multiplayer, there's so many gamemodes to choose from, thousands of servers, and an endless adventure, provided you know the ropes :)

review: Worth it! The amount of fun that can be had is only limited to your own imagination. Seriously this game can have no real reason to stop playing, just so much you can do with it. And the servers are all unique, you'd be surprised what you can find. The only problem is it can be a bit overwhelming at first but no worries, this game is just as fun by your self.

review: What can I say about Garry's Mod.This a fun strange game with the liberty to do whatever you please, you spawn a number of things in sandbox, or find that murder in murder, search for those props hiding or hide from the hunters trying to catch the prop. This games has tons of things to look forward to, but of course the textures.These texture will have to be bought in order to see the map you're playing in correctly, although you can still play without the textures the map quality will be at it's worse, but aside from that, you will need to get counter strike source, but aside from that, the game is great I guarentee you'll like the game and based from my perspective I would definetly recommend this sandbox, weird, fun game to my friends.

review: This game let you do everything you want with the Source engine. Unfortunately, it's just toy. When you know, what you want to do, you will have great fun, but if you have no idea what to create, the main idea of this game will be useless for you.Fortunatelly, it's not only sandbox. There are many gamemodes, such as Prop Hunt, GTower or, the most played, Troubles in Terrorist Town.

review: This game is probably the most bang for your buck if you plan to play with friends because of all the different game modes, creativity, and the community on it. I would definately recommend this game to anybody that enjoys humor in their gaming experience because this game has it. You can play anything from TTT to Horror to RPG games in this which adds a lot to the value. PS I would suggest getting CS: Source because it will allow you to see most of the textures and it does need the original game in your library if you are trying to use models from other games.

review: This game is the ultimate sandbox experience. You can build anything you could imagine, and more. For example, I built a reverse sled. Let that sink in: A REVERSE SLED, as in, A SLED THAT GOES BACKWARDS. This unmarred creativity paired with addons that add content to the game such as new weapons, vehicles, and creation tools makes for a game you won't be forgetting for a long time to come.

review: Pretty cool game. Single-player gets old after the first few builds, but multiplayer is really cool. There is a game mode called "Trouble In Terrorist Town" where you try to guess who is innocent and who is a traitor. now, right when you're sure that someone is a traitor, pump a few shotgun blasts into them. Of course, 90% of the time you will accidentaly kill and innocent, and they will start ing at you. "I WAS INNOCENT! I WAS INNOCENT! I WAS INNOCENT!" is about all you hear in that game. I swear to God I can't even play that  anymore because of the ing  ing about being innocent. I will ing kill the next person who starts shouting about their innocence. I mean, for 's sake, just shut the  up. Someone gets killed one  time as an innocent and they have a ing stroke over it. Also, while I'm at it, I burned down an orphanage when I was met with the task of trying to build a roller coaster. ing . Final Review: 8/10 Worth the money.

game-hours: 46.6
review: Like Half Life? Enjoy Team Fortress 2? Spend your life trying to figure out those hard puzzles in Portal (Cause seriously, some of those are pretty brutal.). Then Garry's Mod (More famously known as G-Mod) may or may not be for you! With this game (more like a sandbox sort of thing, thats a type of game right?) you can move ragdolls of all your favorite valve (and any other models you find on the interwebs) games in any way you want. And yes, this does mean that this game is full of sexually suggestive poses and woman with hardly to no clothes on. Putting that aside, it is fun to make movies with your favorite characters, making them do something serious or funny. The game gives you plenty of tools to help you create just about anything like, tub cars, rollercoasters, and weird messed up things you can't even consider part of this humanly world. (Cause it's always fun to create something that can give you nightmares for more than a week.) I do enjoy this game and hope you find it interesting as well! -Remi (A.K.A SPIRIT)

review: It is a fun sandbox game. Well, actually, this game has no specific category. In fact, this game is one of the biggest platformers I have ever played. You can explore everything. Do you want to be a gangster? You can be, want to be a pilot, it is all possible. This amazing game is just 10 euro's and now it is only 2,50 euro's. Why not buy it? Oh, and if you have want more mods or gamemodes, download 'em in the workshop. I give this game 9/10 because it is amazing, but sometimes crashes due to the spam of items :P -Sir'Kaleh

review: This is the ultimate good deal. I actually bought in on sale for $5, but gladly would've paid $10, $20, maybe $50 for this game. Garry's Mod is like a thousand games in one. You buy this one ten buck game, you have a thousand game-modes inside.

It is, however, better if you own half life 2 and some source games (Not just TF2, things like CS: source, or Day of Defeat:Source). These allow for more maps and models to use, (though if you just want to screw around, you may well just get a source game). Also fun to use soucre mods, like Trouble in terrorist town or Zombie Panic (games you can load in Gmod). It's good fun, but even more fun with friends. Good to test new mods/custom sweps with as well.

review: Awesome Do-everything-you-want-to-do game, From making rocket launchers on your plane to piss off your friends, to making a fully controlable tank to make the server Rage Quit. And the best thing is, everything you build feels rewarding especially when it pisses people off, because thats the fun thing, right? I would recommend this game to everyone with a little bit of creativity or the one's that are searching for a sandbox game that isn't crappy. -This is the game for you, hit the buy button already, it's only 2,50,- You greedy  ;)

review: Garry's Mod provides a great place to get together with friends and experience countless gametypes and even watch youtube videos or movies together like Netflix used to have on the Xbox 360. It's suitable for all ages and has a very funny community that widely vary in age and maturity. Definitley worth the money, just make sure you get some friends to get the game as well, it will make the experience that much better. Also make sure to check out the community creations, especially Gmod Tower, and get the whole collection of content for it!.

review: Garrys Mod is not just one game but multiple games compiled into one small payment which will give you countless hours of fun playing multiple types of multiplayer mods or creating machinmas in single player or just messing about in single player but this is probably one of the best games ever made and it keeps bringing me back for more 10/10 I highly suggest it

review: A game where you can do whatever you want, share what you just did to the community for others to play around for it. It's a unique game, where you can experiment with your friends, family, or strangers that you just found on a server. A lot of custom game modes, where you can all do lots of different things. Ever dreamed to make a spinning baby-doll on a razor blade attached to a sonic scewdriver which is on a rocket attacked to a school with robots in who have waffles in their mouths? Guess what, you can make it! You can do whatever you want, even make a whole new invention better than all the rest! Now, no game is perfect, so my score will be fair, no game can truely be 10/10. I'll give it a... 8/10. I just love the idea of being able to experiment, make custom maps or objects and then share it with the community. This was Harichi, and thank you for reading my review.

review: This is just tremendously fun. At the mere price of $10 (and an accompanying Source game, but if you're on Steam, you probably have one of them already), this is probably the most value I've ever gotten from a game. The core game is great for faffing about, but the add-ons (all free!) are where it really gets fun. Want to race a Lamborghini around Dustbowl? Go ahead! Want to have a giant Hatsune Miku beat up Godzilla with a crowbar? Make it happen! And if there's some crazy idea you have that somebody else hasn't had already, you can make your own creations in Lua script and import them into the game with ease. All I have to say is just buy it already.

review: Absolutely one of the coolest games I've purchased. With all of the custom content flowing through Steam Workshop, it's impossible not to find something you like. Garry's Mod was originally a Half-Life 2 mod, but now it's $10 on Steam. While it might seem stupid to pay for it, I assure it is not. There are a ton of fun gamemodes you can download for the game right off Steam at no cost. There's "The Stalker", a fun match where one player controls an invisible creature that has to eliminate every other player (the hunters) to win. Then there's the "Murder" gamemode, where one player is secretly the murderer and has to eliminate all bystanders (usually while trying not to get caught); however, one bystander has a gun and can use it to kill the murderer and win the round for the bystanders. There are a TON of awesome gamemodes on Garry's Mod and more are always being created. If you don't have Garry's Mod and you like anything you've seen or heard about it, then I recommend buying it. Side Notes: -Graphics are nice, but can be lowered if needed (like most games, obviously) and even on my laptop I can play Gmod pretty well. -Gmod has a few issues (for example it sometimes closes out on you after downloading something in-game or, rarely, when hitting the ~ key to open the developer console. This isn't that big of a deal, though, and you can always find solutions for these kind of things. -Lastly, if you have an issue with fps when playing on servers, you can fix that by opening Steam and navigating to the games list (Right-Click Garry's Mod, click Properties, click Set Launch Properties, and enter -dxlevel 80 +mat_antialias 0 window. (I know it has nothing to do with the review, but I think everyone should know it if they want to play the game.)

review: I got this game a couple of years ago. I killed massive hoards of combine with a HL2 annabelle (they used to let you have those.) But alas my comp broke so I got a new one, I joined a darkrp server for the first time (headphones off) and bought a house. I was a noob back then and just bought a bunch of printers in the middle of the street only to get gang banged with what i believed to be red  by a gang of what i believed to be metrocops. Moral of the story? Buy a gun and hide your printers. (unless its a SRS rp server then you should prob not get 50 printers.) Saw a baton by a dead player waiting to respawn. I picked it up and started slapping people with it. You have been banned for Random Death Arrest (RDA). 999999999999999999999999999999/10 Definantly buy if you: 1: Are not uptight about getting killed, 2: Are not uptight about roleplay (you will not find that much rp here) 3: If you do not rage (you will get gang banged if you rage while on here) And lastly, please do not be a punch (spamming people with your fists) RDMer (random death match) RDAer (randomly arresting people) FPer (favourite picker) or mingebag (using cheats, guns, griefer tricker, and props to ruin other peoples gameplay. -A veteran Gmod fan.

Building silly contraptions to outright murdering your best friends, the game offers something to everyone. The addon library is huge, people upload dupes of their saves and contraptions so you can spawn them into your game and an amazing host of multiplayer game modes build on top of and improve a core game that is nearly ten years old.

Definitely reccomend to buy this, if you don't have it already.

review: Garry's Mod, a well known game thanks to Youtubers like PewDiePie and VanossGaming. And instantly you understand why they play it so much, it's very FUN! You can shoot zombies, do assault courses on Deathrun, and become a cup on Prop Hunt. BUT, before you do that you first must download the textures that you need to play properly. No, they do not tell you to do that. Your first game of Prop HUnt for example will consist of you looking at your screen confused whilst giant red ERROR signs walk around a map of black and pink squares (unless you already have the games with the correct textures). After downloading everything you need to play the game, you decide to join a snadbox server. BAD IDEA! You spawn and instantly get blown to pieces by a squealing 10 year old with a rocket launcher. If you live long enough to walk around the map, you will constantly be lagging due to the amount of vehicles and giant spaceships whizzing around. Even though there are negatives, they're not really the game devlopers fault. The rest of the gaming experience is reasonably good. There are many diffrent game modes to choose from. And you get a chance to meet new people whilst playing hide and seek, what more do you want?

review: Garry's Mod is a physics sandbox. Unlike regular games there aren't any predefined aims or goals. We give you the tools and leave you to play. You spawn objects and weld them together to create your own contraptions - whether that's a car, a rocket, a catapult or something that doesn't have a name yet - that's up to you. If you're not too great at construction - don't worry! You can place a variety of characters in silly positions.

review: This is an overall good game, but most things I screw with have missing textures due to things not downloading properly. Not sure if this is client-side, server-side, or game-side. Anyways, Garry's Mod is definetely a game you would want to purchase first-hand if you are a new Steam User since it is played by many people and is loads of fun. You can download mods and mess with them, or you can play on a server with multiple people while played one of the downloadable gamemodes available. I like the idea that people in the Steam community can finally put their creativity to the test and create something that would entertain thousands of people. Imagine the guy who created Murder and how successful he/she feels that they made something worth mentioning to people they know!

review: What can I say about Garry's Mod? Umm.. nothing. The game is a mixture of epic, weird and funny! Garry's Mod Sandbox is not a pretty girl to look at on its own, but the servers.. oh the servers. Coming from gamemodes such as Trouble in Terrorist Town, ZMod, Murder and every GMod Tower gamemode... I just can not come without recommending this game. But if the workshop conetent and the ability to mod this game was to be cut from it, this would not be appealing at all. What drew people to this game is its simple and yet genious lua code. It can be modified but you cant live without seeing some pointers first! Even I was a server host during time.. long long ago, and even tho I was new to the thing, lua drew me deeper and deeper in! So overall, Garry's Mod is a 10/10

The community is very diverse, and depending on what directions you take you will probably find your niche easy. Some of the gamemodes play like they could be a game just by themselves, but in any means you can never get bored if you keep trying new things. And singleplayer/sandbox is already perfect enough in that matter, if you find the loading times worth it. Very developer-friendly too, it uses LUA and as time goes on more and more hooks are being updated and added. Definitely worth a script-kiddie's time.

review: This game, well where do I start? If I could try to convince you to buy this game for one reason it would be that this may be the only sandbox game or any game really with barrels that actually explode in it. I rate the barrels 9.56 out of 3 because of them. Definetly worth buying if your into them. I should know I was once a barrel, but thats not what I'm here to tell you about I'm here to tell you about Garry's Incident. Wait what, this is Garry's Mod? Well screw it Garry's mod has ummm pretty much anything you want in it. And literaly I MEAN ANYTHING. On that note I hope to see you in game... I'll be wating for you. Yes you the one reading this thinking wtf is wrong with this guy. You will find me in the sewers like a rat, with a barrel. Always watching.....

review: Garry's Mod is very fun game to play once you find a game mode that you enjoy. What stood out for me was the game mode "Trouble in Terrorist Town". You spawn in with a bunch of people, and after the timer ends, you either get chosen as a Innocent, Detective, or a Traitor. As a Traitor, your goal is to kill as many Innocents/Detectives without getting caught. Same goes for Innocents/Detectives, you find and kill the Traitors and hope to god that your fellow Innocents and Detectives don't kill you first. Ever since then, I've been running a Garry's Mod - Trouble in Terrorist Town server since September 2013. It has grown the community I run and many friendships were formed due to it. This game will leave you lots of fun and good memories to come. I highly recommend 10/10

review: This is pretty much a must buy for most owners of Valve/Source engine games, so if you don't already have it, this is what you can expect: Garry's Mod is essentially a sandbox providing physics, posing, and props from any Source Engine game you own. It's what is used to make a lot of machinimas. There is also LUA scripting and a whole lot of usermade mods, so there are a few usermade gamemodes. Expect to have bought CS:S as a lot of everything uses those models, and expect to have friends to do crazy things with for hours in a giant sandbox enviornment to maximize enjoyment.

review: No game is as synonymous with tomfoolery and general mayhem as Garry's Mod. The game's major selling point is that it enables the player to do whatever it is that they please, within the bounds of reason (and often outside of these bounds as well). From building your own spacecraft, to causing a server crash due to the saccharine bliss of obscene quantities of manhacks and melons, Garry's Mod is a game truly worth wasting your time on; even more so with friends.

review: Thousands upon thousands of hours of content in this game, almost everything is user created, and there a plenty of game modes to play with people online, or with friends of your own, from extreme football throwdown (like the mario kart version of american football) to the classic TTT, A mystery team-based shooting gamemode, to sandbox, with countless addons, ragdolls and tools to make your own animations. Even further you can get invested in a good gaming community and one of their servers, becoming a regular is usually rewarding when everyone recognises you. Overall garry's mod is more than it seems, pick up a couple of friends, or find a good reliable server with friendly people, and have great fun. Scores: Value for money: 10/10, honestly, I can't stress this more, even free to play games don't get 10's. Content: 9.5/10. the majority of the content is user-created, and as much as this is great, it can't get a perfect score. Fun capacity: 9/10, although generally a fun game to play, no game really can get an all out fun feel, especially all the time. Community: this section doesn't even get a score, because that doesn't make sense. But in all seriousness, if you're on a server with good owners/admins/moderators usually you don't have problems with disrespectful players. Graphics: who gives a f***? Overall: 9.7/10 would garry again.

review: 8.9/10 Such an open door for developers of all kinds. The amount of things you can do in Garry's mod, is far too big to post in a review. You can build rockets, stab bystanders, build sleds, or play 'Flappy Garry'. While playing Garry's mod is not competitive, or something to master. You can breath lightly while playing it, and not take it too seriously. When you first open Garry's mod, you will play sandbox, using aspects from other games you can build amazing, or laughable things. The amount of scenarios you can create in sandbox alone, is breathtaking. Yet you have still to discover, many intresting and vastly different gamemodes to enjoy: Trouble in terrorist town, in which you discover the Tratiors, who are killing innocent terrorists in order to win rounds. Roleplay, build houses and and buy cars with the money you get from the money printers you hid from the police. Murder, go around with your knife murdering innocent bystanders, trying to hide your identity. And many, many more... While Garry's mod cannot be called a great game in it's own right. The way it uses aspects from others, and allows you to manipulate and use them, is entertaining. Garry's mod is a game you play on all day, not realising the time. I've racked up not too far short of 200 hours in a couple months, without feeling bored or tired of it at any point.

review: **Quick warning, this game is much more enjoyable if you buy it with the Counter-strike: source pack. You want as many source games as possible when playing this because it borrows models. This game is downright awesome. There are many modes from playing as a traitor and trying to blend in with the civilians waiting to kill them to playing a jail warden commanding the prisoners to follow your orders lest they rebel.

review: Probably the greatest game/mod of all time, for mainly two reasons that are really cool and amazing. Highly recommended. One reason is that you can do anything your brain desires, theres rarely ANY limitations, the only limitations there ARE is that sometimes when you wanna do something, you can't find the things you need to do whatever you were going to do, but then you usually find something else to do that you have the stuff to do it with. But you can access ALL source (i.e. Counter Strike, Half-Life 2, Portal, Team Fortress 2, and anything made by Valve really) models, objects, characters, vehicles, npc's, etc. It has a large community workshop, which has characters, player models, npc's, gamemodes, tools, objects, and more. There is also a section called "Dupes" which has community creations, i.e. a Heavy wearing a baby on it's head, things like that. You can do so much in this game and there's so many things you can do that it's impossible to describe EVERY single thing that is possible in GMod. The second reason why it's amazing, is that you can make Machinimas (A Machinima is a video/skit made with a game, but the video isn't a commentary or anything like that, it actually has a storyline) with GMod. You can spawn in a character (preferably a ragdoll) and then place a camera facing the ragdoll, and you can either move the ragdoll a little bit, then take a screenshot with any software you have that lets you do so, or just use the screenshot function in GMod or Steam, or you can use the Phys Gun to move the character around and have that as your video. There is many really good GMod Machinima creators out there, such as DasBoSchitt, many good GMod Machinima videos, such as Team Fabulous 2, and there is a lot of good GMod Machinima series, such as the GMod Idiot Box. Overall, GMod has so many features, so many useful things, that make it the greatest game of all time, because there isn't any rules like you get banned from GMod for using an addon that wasn't from the GMod Workshop, because there is things like that on the GMod website itself. So that gives you a lot of access to a lot of things, which makes GMod truly, a revolutionary game.I HIGHLY recommend this game, I recommend this game more than any other game because it's so many features. And that's why GMod truly is, a revolutionary game.

If you're looking for a story then you won't find it here. you just do what the hell ever you want. Shoot NPCs, build stuff, shoot players, drive around and many more. You can also download stuff from the workshop. Its up to you on what to do.

review: Amazing sandbox game. A game where u can do pretty much anything you want. Build a rocket ship out of a chair, blow up an army of rollermines, make a drone that actually works. These are only some of the things u can do.

review: Pointless fun. If you enjoy sandbox and creative games, then Garry's Mod is for you. Using source games for content, you can create damn near anything. I enjoy putting rockets on a bath tub and then tethering it to the ground, causing it to either fly in circles or sporadically, killing almost everyone around. The more source games you have in your library, the better your catalogue of items in game is. There are user generated content, but a lot of it either doesn't work or relies on something that's incompatible with most others. As for online play, there are a ton of options to choose from. You can do regular sandbox play, jump into a RL game and take on the role of burglar, theif, mayor, kingpin, etc., play a game of jailbreak where you start as a prisoner and have to listen to the warden for orders or your stay will be cut short. These are just a few of the gametypes online, and there are a lot more. If you are good at creating machinima, you can also use this game for just that. I've watched countless G-Mod videos (some hilarious, some just sad), and wish I had the patience to create one myself.

review: Two words... FREAKIN AWESOME! This game allows productions for so much from professional style screenshots to animations. Or if nonsense is your thing; stick a watermelon on a zombie's head then spin him around on a 7 foot monter truck tire. With the huge space of creativity you get from just this game and HL2+CS:S you can do more than you could handle, and then theres the workshop which adds an unlimited span of creativity, nonsense, and professional productions. Honostly, this game is a bit too addicting. I highly reccomend it on any price, truly worth it.

review: Garry's Mod     .      ,    .      -,     .       ,      !!!            . ,       ,   ! As we all know the game Garry's Mod popular on the planet Earth. This game is classified as sandboxes, it is quite extended sandpit. The meaning of the game itself to achieve something, what you want to achieve in life. You can imagine this game helps to create layouts, without injury to the environment reality! You can understand from what we die or what we will become easier. The main thing is that this game is great not only graphics, but also animation!

review: A fun way to make your avatars! And then there is the "Trouble in Terrorist Town" game mode. A pretty odd and amusing game mode about subertfuge, paranoia, and criminal investigation. Or spawn in strange-looking AI bots and allies and replay Half-Life 2 levels. If you get good at coding, you can try programming an original game mode. The open sandbox mode seems too buggy to me to make new gadgets though.

review: This game is extremely fun, with a ton of different gamemodes that are very fun. That's really all I have to say. The only problem that I have with this game is that you need Counter Strike: Source to play the game properly. But if you don't want to spend $20, then you can download the maps and textures off of the internet, like I did.
game-hours: 778.6
review: Garry's Mod is one of the best sandbox games I have ever played. You can have endless possibilities of roleplaying, building, shooting, deathmatching, and just ing around. Most roleplaying servers DO require Counter Strike Source, so I would definitely reccomend buying CSS along with Garry's Mod if you plan on doing any long term online gaming. The game rarely lags, and since it runs on the Source engine, most CPUs can run it with ease. If you're a creative spirit or just like to have crazy fun, buy this game. I totally reccomend it.

review: Garry's Mod is a physics sandbox. Unlike regular games there aren't any predefined aims or goals. The game's makers give you the tools and leave you to play! You spawn objects and weld them together to create your own contraptions -- whether that's a car, a rocket, a catapult or something that doesn't have a name yet -- that's up to you. If you're not too great at construction -- don't worry! You can place a variety of characters in silly positions.

review: When I first saw Garry's Mod and tested it a little, I was critical of it. But when I took it upon myself to buy the thing, I was in love. You could spend hours upon hours of sandbox alone, making a group of police fight a horde of zombies for your enjoyment. But then you get to multiplayer. Prop Hunt, Murder, Trouble in Terrorist Town, etc. This game is by far best with friends, but there's no shame in playing alone. Still a butt load of fun to be found. 10/10.

Then my grades started to drop and I began to realize my error. However, it was to late and by the time I pulled my head out of it I was failing. Be careful and prepare to commit yourself and your wallet to meaningless servers. Enjoy it. Your life will go to  pretty damn quick. Good luck Comrade!

review: This game is great, it is a much better sandbox than minecraft will ever be. You can get any prop you could ever dream of, if you get bored of one thing there is always another, and it is, well, pointless. There is no objective, no end of the game. The only problem I have with this is you need to buy games to get a lot of textures but there are *ahem* ways to get around that, so overall great game.
game-hours: 242.2
review: You're sitting here reading this review, when you could be sandboxing in this wonderful game. With mods. And addons. From Sonic the Hedgehog player models to excessively powerful nuclear bombs and everything in between, this game is one of the best to mess around with friends in. On top of the randomness you can encounter in sandbox alone, there are different gametypes create for Garry's Mod, such as RP games where you can mug somebody for their coffee.... mug. Or Trouble in Terrorist Town, a game where friends become foes and the traitors must eliminate the terrorists. Soya. Buy it.

review: its so sexy
game-hours: 536.5
review: This game is great fun, there are hundreds of gamemodes within this game. This allows hours and hours of playtime as once you get tired of one gamemode you can just play another more interesting one. You may have already heard of this game from many highly known youtubers such as pewdiepie. The only issue is that this game is not for a truly casual gamer with litlle money to spend. This is because you need other games to be able to get all textues and items within the game. The number one other game you need to fix most problems is: CS:S. If you don't know what that is, then you shouldn't by this game.

Also,beware,alot of perverted little kids started uploading "Sex" addons,with titles like "Zomg,BEWBZ" or "HOT FURRY READY FOR DOGGY STYLE" or "SEXEH PONY PINKI PHUIE WANTS SEX"if you see any of those,do everyone a favor and downvote and report them to have them removed,they do not belong on the game. that's the only downside of the workshop i guess,but except for that,you should buy it.

review: If you are going to get any game in steam i advice you to get this game it 6 and with special hoidays it drops to 1 it doesnt need a mega pc to run a simple pc will do it has many fan made games on like ttt and prop hunt but what i find cool you can make anything in sand box and with thousands of download content in the workshop you will never run out of ideas it allows you to add games on for more content for excample if you have team fortess 2 you will get all the models preinstalled, but it is heavy counter strike lots of content is counter strike but you can fix the errors by downloading the maps which can take time which make the game 9/10

review: Garry's Mod is a unique and classic multiplayer game. This game is awesome with many modes. People use humor in some modes. My favorite modes are prop hunt where u can be a prop and hide.

But if you want to play multiplayer prop hunt or ttt on the most popular maps you need to have Counter Strike Source and its not as important but you want to get Half Life 2 as well. Both of these games are good on their own so its not like you're paying $30 for maps its just that the game needs those games for their textures. Now, you dont need an amazing computer to run these games so Bottom line is, get the game you will love it trust me, i'm Khan.

review: DarkRP experience: Name myself "Justin Beiber" People follow me around asking for autographs. Someone hires a hitman to kill me. Have a shootout in the street with hitman. Crips and Bloods join in. Both against me. My fans revolt and get weapons and kill everyone. Feel proud of myself. Assassin jumps from roof and kills me. Fans scream and cry and molest assassin. Go play TTT. 10/10 would play for 180+ hours.

review: I can say I have not had as much fun as I have had with this game.. Iv'e had it for a while now and iv'e been playing on most mods and such. My favourite mod up to now though is just the regular sanbox. You can do anything here, I went on war with my friends in a tardis hunting them down one by one while they were building bases out of turrets hiding from me. I mean you can literarrely do anything in this game and you can download any kind of weapons or models or such from the workshop. It goes from  drills to fist's of fury. This game is huge, if you have a mind with ideas you can express your ideas here. Try this game out! It is truly a joy.

review: The perfect game for someone who generally likes to piss about and have a laugh with their friends, and people who like to get down and make something very productive. Main problem with GMod? It has to be the Prop-pushers and Griefers. Not many problems with the actual game, ENDLESS amount of community addons so the game never gets old. 8/10

review: Garry's Mod is a game that is often bought to play modded multiplayer servers like prop hunt, TTT and Dark RP but what many people overlook is the main feature of the game: creation. Garry's mod is a game where you can build things, both big and small, simple or incredibly complex - Garry's mod defines the genre Sandbox, within the game you create a world to your liking, invite your friends to it, populate it with npcs or literally anything you want to do - its a world that can free your mind, built to your design, and of course you're not alone - you'll have the tools and entertainment provided by possibly the most productive and inventive community gaming has ever seen, as is hinted at in the game's title, Garry's mod is a game built around the concept of modding and there are thousands of mods that can enhance your experience. I've had quite the time with Garry's Mod, among all the games I've played there will never be another experience like it, and that's really the beauty of the game, when it comes down to what you create and what you do with Garry's Mod - you'll end up with a completely unique experience shaped to how you play - no other Garry's Modder will have the same experience as you had with the game, and no other game will give you the same experience as Garry's Mod.

review: This game has a lot of talent and is the best game to play with your friend to have a laugh but it isn't perfected. ~ ~ ~ Dislikes: Laggyness- The game lags sooooo much and has a lot of online game issues. I don't like how when I try to load up a map and the whole game crashes. It tells me whats wrong and I go threw to delete it but that didn't help at allllllllll! Online- My friend and I were trying to play in my SandBox mode and he had to install a program and I had to two called Hamachi to connect! Can you believe that! Step your game up Garry! Downloading Via Workshop- My workshop sucks.. but it'll probably be good for you. ~ ~ ~ ~ Loves: Addons- Now they have rea;;y amazing addons such as NyanCat Gun, MW2 Sniper Rifles, Halo4 and 3 Weapons, and etc. Fun- The game is really fun to play with friends, if it works. Player Model- Love how they have Slenderman and Lucario plus Mario and his bro Luigi. Friends- You can meet amazing people in the game. ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ My final rating mixed from personal enjoyness and ragness is 7 1/2 out of 10.

review: A good indie game for all who is creative. includes tens of selections of "minigames" for Garry's mod, for example; RolePlay, Jailbreak, PropHunt, Stop it slender and obviously alot more. In my own opinion this game is great for artistic/creative types of people over the age of 13. most people on Garry's mod seem to be 'Squeekers' as Elder's seem to say. This game is very educational, you can learn basic science and alot of techniqual difficulties able to easily solve. The main feature of Garry's Mod is SandBox. The 'GameMode' where you can do anything! You can also create a server to allow your friends to play with. If you're going to buy this game i seriously suggest buying counter strike source too. (and halflife) Take my advice on this game. like seriously... I downloaded this game in 2008 and have been playing it every day since. It NEVER gets boring. There is allways someone or something to keep you occupied. You can take my advice because ive been playing this game for years. you can easily tell. Look at my game time. Over 2,300 Hours! Thats a long time. I hope this helped.

review: Best. Game. Ever. Period. Well, this is an "in-depth" review sooo... First of all, you can never be bored on this game and you will always be doing something crazy, unless you're a serious person. The more creative you are, the better. You can build many structures and even build robots with all the tools at your disposal. There are ragdolls, props, vehicles, and many maps to offer. The game gets even better when you add the workshop. The community makes content that you can download and there are in-game community-made dupes that you can screw around with. Garry's Mod also has spawned many ridiculous and fun gamemodes, like GMod Tower, Trouble in Terrorist Town (TTT), Prop Hunt, Murder, STOP IT! Slender, and many more. Overall, this game is totally worth $9.99 (that is how much I bought it for) and it should be worth more because you can play games within a game in GMod. That is crazy, much like this game.

Whether you are building complex contractions or laughing at the silliness of the game, you can use your imagination and play a delightful game at the same time. Garry's Mod is definately a video game worth investing in.

review: This game has all the stuff you need, from Ragdoll's to equipment's, and the most funniest and coolest thing is that you can build mostly anything too. But from my point of view on what I like about this game, is launching ragdoll's into the air and putting NPC's ( Non-Playable Character's) holding gun's, making them look like a bodyguard. So, if you are a big fan of creation, then this game is *RECOMMENDED* for you. Good Luck and Have a Blast!

I say this because it launches at a very slow speed and i have to wait a few minutes for it to start but when it does it seems fine until i join a server.

This game allows you to go nuts and do what ever you want simply because you can! I would strongly suggest this game but must say it is much better with the entire Half Life series as a large quantity of its content relies on it.

review: Garry's mod isn't a game. It's all the tools you need to make a game. You can make essetially whatever you want if you have the skill to do so. You can either screw around with tools and props in anyway twisted way you can imagine, or you can just download other peoples creations and be impressed. If for some reason you are new to Garry's Mod and never played before, the best downloads I can suggest are Prop Hunt, Trouble in Terrorist Town, and if you're looking for some "WTF" moments, try out Elevator Source once. (seriously, only try it once of twice at most. The things themselves don't really change too much, but the order they come in does) There are more than hundreds of maps to download and explore, with tons of different custom gamemodes. There's even one named Melonbomber, which is literally just Bomberman. Garry's Mod is very social driven. Try to have some friends to play with, or settle for just random matches online (though playing with random people has a LOT of downfalls compared to just playing with friends) However Garry's Mod does have some prerequsites, the most important being Counter Strike: Source. Garry's Mod uses the textures and resources from that game in particular for a lot of the maps people create, and without it, you'll mostly have ERRORS and pink/black checker patterns on everything. There are other ways to get the textures and resources though, which you can find very easily from a Google search. After that, almost any Source Engine game you own can be used for textures and props to pull from into Garry's Mod. There are also hundreds of custom props and characters to download from the Workshop. Garry's Mod will seem complicated and intimidating to set up at first, but once you get the more important tools installed, you'll be filling up that hard drive with anything from maps of castles and cruiseships, to replica bottles of Mountain Dew and drivable mechs.

review: I absolutely ADORE this game. It's my favourite game ever. If you're thinking about buying this game don't hesisate. It's really hard to explain what this game really is. It really just sums up about everything you can wish in a sandbox. You can spawn all the props from half life 2, counter strike and most of the games that run on source engine. use those props to make a giant robot, a catapult, make a flying car, DO WHATEVER YOU WANT! It doesn't sound too exciting, but belive me, it is. It has realistic physics guys, YOU can spawn everything, and you can install addons for even more cool content with the click of a button!!!! This game is crazy.. But also crazy fun. Don't like sandbox games? Doesn't matter! You have freaking GAMEMODES! You can play TTT or Murder or Prop Hunt.. Zombie survival, Just NAME IT! I can't express my love for this game in a review.. But trust me. You will love this game. To sum garry's mod up in 5 words: It has content for everyone. For shooters, builders, griefers, survivors, etc. For the shooters you have shooting gamemodes. For the builders you have sandbox. Same goes for griefers... Survivors? Oh let's give 'em gmod stranded. *** I highly recommend this game. I think this is the best game is the history of gaming. But that's my opinion. Find yours. Explore it. Find it. And last but not least... Have fun. -Farian

review: You can just do whatever your heart desires, then when you get bored, you can install a mod, which is easier do do in Gmod than Minecraft and other games because in Gmod mods require no mod loaders, and it is much safer because you dont have to install them off the internet because you can download them in the menu really easily. I give it 10/10, five stars, and two thumbs up. There are infinite possibilities of what you could do.

review: This is gonna be a different review, 'cause it is about Garry's Mod, but also about something else. First of all, Garry's Mod is REALLY FREAKING FUN. All you do in this game is...anything, really. Get some add-ons, maps and friends, and you can have yourself a good time! Now, while it is kinda boring singleplayer, those who don't know about this add-on that I am gonna review is very fun, single and multiplayer. It's called Garry's Mod Stranded. Basicaly like Minecraft, but probably ten times better. You must keep track of your health, hunger, thirst, and fatigue. Gather supplies and build anything with the tools at your disposal. It's rather fun singleplayer, and I would assume multiplayer, 'cause I've never tried that before, but the Yogscast made it look pretty fun. NOW you all know why this review is different. Overall score: 9.5/10 :3
game-hours: 1736.6
review: Yeah, Garry's Mod easily has the most hours logged, but to be honest. about 1,000 out of those like 1,700 are me having to constantly fix the ing bugs caused by this half  game. Even though it has its moments, they're outweighed by the thought of all the ing times the game has gone to  because of ing hackers and all that . DarkRP is the best gamemode on the ing game and TTT is overplayed. 7/10 would rather buy TF2 Keys. ======================================== ZOMBIEKILLINGWEEDLORD420 REVIEWS

review: This game is an over-the-top-game-in-your-face-palooza. Tired of creating things in Sandbox? Go kill people in Trouble in Terrorist Town. Tired of killing others and being killed? Try out Prop Hunt, the ultimate hide and seek. Tired of that? You play too much. Fine, try Deathrun or RP or any of the other 200 or so game modes. If you somehow become bored with EVERYTHING, then look to the Workshop for mods and skins. Trust me, this game should cost three times as much for all the games it contains. Plus, whenever Gmod updates, guess what, NEW GAMEMODES!!! This is totally worth it. See you in there.

review: This game is probably the main reason I'm a PC Gamer. I have logged about 300 hours so far on it and it has never failed to entertain me every single time. This game has the best price/gametime ratio. (Many people log thousands of hours on it.) Buy it no matter what price it is on or if it's with CS:S. It is the best and cheapest game I have ever played at the same time. (I payed 1.50 on sale). Also has very low system requirements and runs very well on most PCs.

review: Garrys Mod. Alot of Hours Spent on that Game. Well, Garrys Mod is good but not good as you might Think. Yes, It Has alot and I mean ALOT of Custom Files to Create everything you can Imagine! also, The Multiplayer has good Modes like Trouble in Terrorist Town, Prop Hunt etc. To be Very Honest, I Barely Played the MP (Except for TTT) because I dont like Prop Hunt or anything like that. TTT is the only Exception. Ive Played ALOT of Singleplayer Sandbox to test Addons, Create Simulations and Buildings etc. It has ALOT of Stuff. GMod used to be Perfect but with the Updates, It went VERY slow, I miss the Toybox, and Addons can Infect your Game which sucks alot when you have 500 Addons and then 1 of it s up your Whole Game. It is a good Game that I DO recommend (I mean, 10 Bucks.) yet Still its not the Best Game.

review: Very fun! Garrys mo has many different maps, game modes, weopons, cars, and many other made by everyday gamers like you. There is a wide verity of great game modes with servers attatched to them for you to play with without having to pay anything to play on the servers. If you think you have the stuff to made something you should using workshop to post something great that can be added onto you single player experice. Garrys mod uses the source engine though that might be a little out date it allowes us to do many things that cant be done in other games. The gamemode that come with it, Sandbox allowes you to do about anything you want such as a rave party, a zombie apocalypse, and many others. Ive played this game mode since Gmod 9 (the first version open to public) and it has been great throughout all my experice.

review: With a thriving community and dedicated server owners this game will live on for a long time. The game is many games in one, with hundreds of different gamemodes to choose from in multiplayer. Very low amount of hackers/cheaters, and dedicated servers means most undesirable players are kept away. Graphics are noticably dated, and some gamemodes are losing support slowly. Buy this game. You'll have fun, guaranteed.

review: This game is the best game on steam in my opinion. When you start out with no addons it feels like a sandbox Half-Life 2. But then when you enter the Steam Workshop and get yourself some addons. This game turns into a brand new experience everytime. I love this game, there are some fatal bugs that are tough to fix because of addon collision. And btw Garry sometimes really annoys us by updating stuff a bit too much which makes our addons outdated. But this game is literally the ultimate: Action, Multiplayer, Role-playing, Puzzle, Racing, Sandbox, Strategy and Simulator. There's just so much you can do, and once you've tried it all, theres still more things to do that you still haven't discovered yet.

One of the current things you have to know before getting this game is that you must have Counter Strike: Source , or is not gonna run well on most mods. You can either get the game, or get the textures on the internet. If you are looking for fun with people, this is the real deal.

review: I recommend this game very greatly Its very fun maybe over 100 games probably over this game is so much fun all of the games are fun, some wachy while others can be very fun and addicting but also if you are going to buy this i strongly recomend the bundle of Garrys Mod and Counter Strike: Source because many of the games in Garrys Mod For example:Trouble In Terrorist Town, Death Run, and Elevator Source A very boring bizzare but very entertaining, Ect. All require textures like guns and walls or props from counter strike source so over all if you are wanting a game on steam or you got a steam card for some random reason i strongly recommend this game for many many reasons.

Once you get the hang of GMod or you're actually decent unlike me, I hear this game is fun. You have all these gamemodes, TTT (Trouble in Terrorist Town) Murder, RP, Deathrun, and others including Sandbox. This game is packed with fun. It's multiplayer and relatively cheap. You should have no problem playing with your friends since almost everyone has Garry's Mod.

review: Garry's Mod. It started out as a sort of machinima making game and evolved into so much more. This game is the ultimate game. Anything is possible, like a naked panda riding miley cyrus down a freeway being chased by an army of Morgan Freeman's. This game contains many sub-games such as TTT, PropHunt, DarkRP, Pirate Wars, Elevator and many more. If you consider buying this game you will never regret it. You can pore endless hours into this game and barely scrach the surface. Gmod is the game of all games, giving all players the freedom to create and imagine the impossible. 10/10. Note: Is Much more fun with friends, So make some online or invite the one's you have. Cheers!

Some people say the building mod is also fun but i have never tried it. The thing i hate is when i try to play with my friends Gmod DayZ, the map is always full because ther is only one server. Also when i join some games it takes at leat 15 minutes to go in the game so thats kinda . Although it is laggy i still enjoy playing it.

review: Let me ask you a question. In the instace of random boredom and no school/work/family obligations, you'd naturally go and do something, right? Specifically, something that is fun by your standards, yes? Alright. Now could you tell me the approximate number of people who disliked doing whatever it is they picked because they found themselves in an instance such as that one? Naught. That is exactly why you cannot be wrong when you pick this game. With so many addons, countless multiplayer gamemodes, possibility of making gorgeous and/or stupid screenshots and the ability to attach dozens of thrusters to anything and watch the physics engine do it's magic is what will keep you coming back for more. The fact that you need other games to extend the possibilities of Garry's Mod may put some off, but with the ever-updating community addons, there's always gonna be an alternative.

review: Hard to make a good movie animation like other do? Want to spend what imagination you have in mind? But of course, this game is worth the money, mate! GMOD is not just a sandbox where you create things, integrated with Steam Workshop (and any other Modding website). When sometimes when you see good things in Steam Workshop you will need another Source Games. Still it's really worth the money. Go Buy it, and start making good Screenshots, and post them worldwide!

review: This game is literally more then a game. It's what you make of it. You could leisurely go around a random map of over a thousand, shot and mess around with friends with over 10,000 weapons and tools, Use a load of random character's and NP'S to kill and have a literal adventure with. Out of all the Literal things you could do, create, discover, and just mainly  around with, this game has basically everything you could and would want to do in a video game. All you have to do is use your imagination with the tools you are given, And there is a wide variety of tools, from face changers, to a gravity gun, to a freaking Weather changer. Overall, definently get his game since it is on sale almost all the time. And if you still think you might not want this game, there are a bunch of reviews that will definently change your view on this outstanding game. 10/10

review: I can't believe that someone was skilled enough on the computer to put Half-Life 2, Team Fortress 2, Counter-Strike, and lots of physics together to make this godlike, wonderful game. If you do not have this game, or if you think it's not worth 10 dollars or so, then get it! Don't falter, for this game is not only a wonderful tester for anything physics related, but it's also a great way to make contraptions and crazy machines you'd never be capable of seeing on Earth! From roller coaster making, to aimlessly shooting NPC Mr. Breen a hundred times, to making the Scout bend in impossible stances, this game is just the best! I give it a rating of 10/10, and no, I'm not just saying that to be nice. I'm saying it because everything I've said on this review is 100% true, and is just another way why I love this game! This concludes my review. Thank you.

review: Within this game, you are a gamer, playing as your favorite video game character within some abandoned video game sanctuary. You've pretty much completed every objective of the main game, and now you are bored; you must find a way to occupy/entertain yourself for the remainder of your precious free time here in the universe. --With this, I find it to be no surprise that we humans have come to thrive with life in such desolate, austere environments; as we have within the confines of our reality here on earth. We, like the players, within this indolent game we call life, start from nothing, and sprout out of the vain emptiness with life, like wildflowers after rain, and make amazing things with our tools as human beings. It is with this simple sandbox game that we humans are able to truly contemplate the reality of our ingenious resourcefulness and the fullest extent of our creative capabilities, as we, like artists of blank canvasses, create astonishing works out of nothing, finding valuable amusement within the vain emptiness of the blank slate that is what life is to be, and is what this game is to give the user;

game-hours: 85.3
review: This game is possibly one of the best sandbox games out there that has a fair price. What makes this different from other titles is it has a growing community that not just plays the game, but makes mods, gamemodes and much more content. Garry's Mod is great, but the things it lacks is graphics and textures. Since Garry's Mod takes textures from other games, you need to get that game so errors, missing textures and script errors dont pop up. But its a small price to pay just to get Counter-Strike: Source. Garry's Mod's community is filled with large maps and mods that are interesting. This game is amazing. So I give it a 97/100.

review: I loved this game.... But you need good internet to play well...... Things I disliked about this game: -Very long loading screens for servers (Downloading Steam workshop file mods) -Purple and black missing textures that almost every player will encounter when they first download Garry's mod unless they have Counter Strike; source -Unruly admins letting other players kill you whenever they want (Mostly on Sandbox) -Kids with very high voices that spam the voice chat Things I liked about this game: +Unlimited possiblities of random scenes and creative artworks +All the playerbase mods (There are some really cool ones :D) +The default tools (Most people underate these but these make the game for me; Welding, stretching, and balloons +The FUN (You can have lots of laughs with your friends in private servers or public ones while smashing each other with props, flying planes, attaching planes to helicopters and LOTS more. Overall I think high of this game and it is fun to create your own unique stuff. My favorite sandbox :)

review: its a sandbox editor..so you can pretty much do anything you want with the source engine, even go online and play many different game modes that the community has made, like Zombie survival, racing, even a Quake 3 Arena mod<<< now that mode took me back to the hardcore days. there's even a cinema game mode or some sort where players can get together and watch a bunch of random youtube or other video sharing site at the same time, and that was a very interesting experience in my point of view. You can pretty much do anything with the source engine nowadays. So yea, Buy this game and have fun. there's really no rules here.

review: The Sandbox for this game is simply amazing. The number of things you can make and the creativity involved is simply astonishing. The other gamemodes for this game can turn a sandbox game into a fun FPS. TTT, Murder, Jailbreak, etc. are some of them and the addons you can add make the games even more fun. This may soon become my favorite game.

review: Garry's Mod, oh Garry's Mod, what can you say? I still miss bridge building from 9, seriously what happened? And what about watermelon racing? That was great. So any way, it's basically a sandbox game, anything really goes but there's also gamemode maps and mods. Some are as fun as putting a fork in your eye, others you will instantly love (TTT rocks!). Just beware this game attracts trolls like flies to crap.

review: Garry's Mod is one of the best games ive ever played in my life! Ive been playing this game since 2008 I think. I cant really remember. But I know I have played it a  ton, and I recommend you to get it. There are always new mods, addons, map, etc, made by the community. The people who play this game put hard work into making this game even more enjoyable. This is why it never gets boring. The community keeps adding on to it, to keep this game up and running. Also, lets not forget those people who deal with keeps up with servers. This is a community based game. Where you dont have to pay for stupid things like exspanion packs, news maps, people make it for free. Anyway, enough about the people who add on to the game. The community of players who play this game, is the straight definition of, "The Internet." The people who play this game are random, funny, and will make you laugh your  off (the people who have been playing a long time atleast.) Players are always coming up with things to get others hyped up, and having a good time on the game mod that they are playing on. Now those were the main things I love about Garry's Mod. P.S: IF YOU DONT HAVE A SINCE OF HUMOR, ARE UPTIGHT, OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT. DONT PLAY THIS GAME. UNLESS YOUR STAYING IN SINGLE PLAYER.

review: This game is highly recommended for everyone who likes to play Valve Games, Nothing is impossible to be made at Garry's Mod make everything, cars, catapults , rockets , EVERYTHING! If you're feeling to bored to play alone check out the awesome Gamemodes on other servers! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED SUCH FUN WOW

review: This game is just amazing you can litteraly do anything that comes up into your mind. You can shoot someone in the head with a melon thrower, play some Trouble in Terrorist Town, or hide as a Prop in Prop Hunt. If you whant to Role Play just go onto a roleplaying server, if you feel like being/killing aliens you can do that too. Anything that pops up in your mind could be done, wanna play some Angry Birds but don't feel like getting your phone, just build a 3D version of Angry Birds and throw some birds! This game deserves everything you can come up with. Play long and imaganative! *Spock Hand sign*

review: Well, my first review now. Garry's Mod is a Game you rly should buy because you can have so much fun with that. The best of this game is that you don't have just one game. You have many different Games in One. So u can play Prop Hunt or Murderer or Dark RP or many many maaaany other mods. Thats why I advise Gmod to everyone who likes to play many different things. And also the Community of Gmod are mostly nice and friendly.

review: Ok lets be truthful here. This has to be one of the most fun games i have ever played in my life. There are endless servers and game modes and it doesnt stop there. You can mod and make your own gamemodes,Host servers. Positives: This game has so many gamemodes. This game can bring your creativity out to a new limit. If you like to Build/Rolepay/Play mini games/ Conversate This is a game for you. There are gamemodes such as dark Rp And TTT These two game modes are the 2 most well known. They are so fun and don't ever get boring. The game never stops with new stuff. The community has so many things they add all the time and it will never have a limit. Negetives: The community is one of the worst communities i have seen. It has so many people but most of them consider them selfs to be trolls. If you have a squeeky voice or do not like cussing and negetive attitude. I would turn voice chat off and type witch would be hard and ruin the game. There are some people on this game who are nice and dont care what age you are. But most of the people on this game are stuck up  who make fun of everyone and try to annoy. I will be honest there are lots of screeming 10 year olds who run around not knowing what there doing and ruining the game for everyone. So the only thing bad about this game i would say is the community Conclusion: The game itself is great you will have lots of fun and never get bored i can promise you that. So i would Definitley recommend this game. the only bad part like i said was the fact that the community tries to make you commit suicide 90% of the time. But like i said again there are nice people and the game is very entertaining. out of the 1,000 hours of this game i have played, It has been the most fun i have had on steam.

The only bad thing about it is you should get CS:S (Counter Strike: Source) since many server need it for textures, modles and other stuff. 9.5/10 MUST GET

review: Garry's Mod is the diamond in the stone of all video games today. Lots of games are built upon the promise of the "endless possibilities of your imagination", but truth is, that's not entirely true. Garry's Mod is your imagination, itself. Do whatever you want to do. Fight ninja donuts on a steamship, throw strawberry-infused sunglasses at a flying purple Xbox, have a balloon fight dance party with the president. Whatever you can imagine, it's possible with Garry's Mod.

review: ah, Garry's Mod. What a good amount of many days, hours, weeks, possibly even months I could spend on this game. I know I haven't played 1000+ hours and that there are people who have played many, many hours, But I know that this game wouldn't have got this much publicity if it wasn't top notch. The fact that people such as Pewdiepie, Seananners, Vanoss and high-rate youtubers play it purely proves it. I find Garry's Mod to be a neccessity for all gamers on steam, I recommend it highly and will probably roflcopter if you don't have it.

review: Great fun to be had in this sandbox / creative "mod" for Half Life 2. Want to weld a toilet to a car? Go for it. This game has been a favourite of mine for some time now - and I always seem to come back to it every now and then for some manic play. You can run through the Half Life 2 levels, or try your hand at a sandbox map. There are also a multitude of really good stuff on the Steam Workshop to further enhance your fun. It's cheap and it's immensely fun. Get some friends together and get creative! Jimbo Rating: 8/10

review: Garry's mod. Oh garry's mod what a fantastic game! All the way from gameplay to gamemodes to graphics just amazing! i dont like it just because you do whatever the heck you please on this game because of the gamemodes! DarkRP:you role play as you are in a real city and real life jobs about 35+ of jobs just amazing it would take all night to talk about what you can do on it. Trouble in Terrorist Town:there are people few of them are terrorists they try to kill every body while incoents try to kill the terrorist who to trust who to not? Prop hunt: there are 2 teams props and prophunters the prophunters try to look for props but props disguise as any prop. and a few dozen more gamemodes So what are you waiting for? BUY THE GAME! OR ILL EAT YOUR COOKIES. Why are you still reading? dude go buy it. Rating 11/10

review: Garry's Mod; where do I begin? This was one of the first games (it's so much more than a game) I got on my PC. I played it, crathed it and faved it; it was so fun! After countless hours of Sandbox I figured I would try something new. I made the life-changing decision to click the 'find multiplayer game' and after that, well, I didn't see my Mother for weeks. Trouble in Terrorist Town, Prop Hunt, Role Play, Slender, the list goes on and on. After discovering owning other VALVE games added content to the already MASSIVE game, I couldn't resist. I now own most games they have made and honestly? Best money I've spent on gaming my whole, juvenile life... Worth absolutely every penny 10/10 and always getting better.

This game has downloadable content, customization, addons, and so much stuff. And, if you're an up and coming coder, or you want to be, the Expression 2 (E2) in this game is a great place to start, giving you so much to lean on and explore in the sandbox of Garrys mod. Of course, there isn't just Sandbox. There's TTT, a very popular one. DarkRP and other RP's are also popular. So much to do, so little time. Just ask my 1000+ hours. I've invested a portion of my life into this game and the servers on it, and I was not dissapointed.

As it was built apon Half-Life it comes with all the items, weapons and car/boat. The game is fun with friend and has meny gamemodes. The workshop is full of mods at just a click away. I would recommend this to all my friends because come on my name is fricking DRGMOD100.

review: Garry's Mod is a physics sandbox. Unlike regular games there aren't any predefined aims or goals. The game's makers give you the tools and leave you to play! You spawn objects and weld them together to create your own contraptions -- whether that's a car, a rocket, a catapult or something that doesn't have a name yet -- that's up to you. If you're not too great at construction -- don't worry! You can place a variety of characters in silly positions.

review: Garry's mod is a really fun game, My opinion of course. I just have fun building stupid and fun things like torcher chambers,for ragdolls, and slides. I like to connect rockets to two ragdolls so it looks like they are thrusting each other XD. But im sure there are other people who should buy this game that can make more extrodinary, and awsome creations, like Mecha bots or whatever is hard to make. Some people might think it's easy to build advanced creations, but to tell you the truth, I think it takes skill to build planes, huge robots and other big creations. Basically i'm just saying that you need to know how to use all the tools like thrusters, ropes, and other advanced tools. But otherwise, if you have those skills, then i'm pretty sure you'll like this game.

review: Garry's Mod, where can I start? This game is comparable to buying a cardboard box and putting outside in the rain and watch it slowly deteriorate. But this game is probably the closest thing a person can get to being able to be themself without worry of failure. This game [as it says in the description] is basically an electronic sandbox. You can literally play with yourself and still have fun. This game is worth the price to pay for it. Although it has gone to poop in the last vew software versions. It is still a good game. I highly reccommend this to people that don't already own this game.

review: What is there to say about Garry's Mod that hasn't been said already? There is no purer joy than tossing explosive barrels at your friends or building robots that shoot semi-phallic projectiles at your opponents. Garry's Mod is a game that literally has infinite possibilites. You can build anything, do anything, and with the Workshop allowing custom content and with the ability to mount any Source engine game or mod, you can have just about any asset you need. Whether you wish to roleplay, build, just mess around, pose screenshots, make machinima, play a variant of clue, or escape from creepy internet memes, Garry's Mod has it all. There's even a gamemode where you're just on an insane elevator, there is literally no limit to the possibilities. Since the possibilities are so expansive, there is almost no way for you to not enjoy this game. It's at the point where it's a must-have.

If you don't have the money for it, get a job. If you don't have a job, rob a bank. If you get arrested robbing the bank, at least you tried.

review: Garry's mod is one of the best sandbox/community driven games on PC and possible in Gaming. If you are going to buy this, you should buy CS:S with it since many game modes use those textures in it. Sandbox mode is nice, you can do many things in that but many people also love to play on game modes, I would recommend TTT as a nice game mode if you find a good server but the sky is the limit in Gmod gamemodes(actaully it is the engine but eh). There are so many things to be said about this game and this review would go on for pages if you were to explain every single custom gamemode that is on garry's mod and you will get you 10/5/2.5 euro or whatever the price is out of it since there is constantly new content developed on servers. A great game with a good community if you know where to look.

review: Try to add every Source valve game made + physics + Imagination = Garry's mod. Racing, flying, and mods. It's like Valve's version of 3D - Physics - and open source to Minecraft. Get the game now! Sometimes buggy because HEAVY coding sometimes crashes, no worry a few seconds away from a quick command fix. If you play with mods i.e: Weapons,etc. Prepare for tons of crashes, or if your lucky tons of redo's and reinstals. overall a highly good game to buy. Runs off of the imfamous Source engine so prepare to do a LOT of loading!

review: This game, this bloody game. I'm going to talk in the context of just playing murder and trouble in terrorist town. This game is a trolls paradise! It has the ability to ruin friendships signified by the stout trust one places in another. It basically is betrayer simulator. The joy one feels when your friend readily accepts you as an innocent, only to obliterate him in the back of the head with your shotgun. Brains all over the place. even now my hands shake, as i just want to be a traitor again and murder everyone in a blissful dance :D :D :D :D

review: Garry's Mod. You'll most likely do absolutley nothing productive in your first hour of playing. You'll look at the NPCs. Maybe face pose some ragdolls into genius works of art or hideous abominations. You'll look at the weapons. Get a mod or two. All that kind of stuff- but then, your flat world of near-pointlessness will expand. You'll make movies that desrve -2 oscars, but are still amazing. You can make a minigame using a save that will rocket you to the top of the most popular saves list for about 3-5 days. You'll make vehicles out of everything, and only spam thrusters when your friends are in a vehicle. You can go on a server and play with the community. You can even make an addon for the community. So, why wait to buy this, when you can get it now and do all of the things I just said. Why? Because in Garry's Mod, you can do anything- and yes, that includes making a pigeon-powered bathtub tank if you have the right mods.

review: This game is not like any other game. This 'game' technically isn't even a game. This game can let you add elements from other games into this one. So it's a game within a gam withing a game. I am saying game too much. Anywho, Garry's Mod brings hours upon hours of fun with endless possiblities you couldn't even imagine can be packed into a game. From making funny youtube videos to just simply blowing up nuclear bombs with your friends. Gmod simply does it all. You are a fool to not get this game let alone when it's on sale numerous times for a mere 2.50$. Get this game if you haven't already. You can thank me later.

review: Garry's mod is a madness. When you run it, you have the choice to play like 50 different types of games. You can do anything you want, you can be anyone you want. Really good prices on sales, you can grab it for like 1,5 euro. TOTALLY worth every ing cent. Also, i'm pretty sure, somewhere in a deep and dark corner of this game, /b/ has its headquarters. No doubt.

review: A great game, Worth more than it actually is This game consists of "Game Modes" The Major gamesmodes that I am aware of are: -Trouble In Terrorist Town -DarkRP -PropHunt -Murder You may have heard all of these game modes(Besides DarkRp) from YouTubers, SeaNanners for example can show you the very basics of these game modes. Although, You will need to buy Counter Strike: Source to have all of these games graphics. If you are patient enough you can wait for the Garry's Mod, Counter Strike: Source steam sale. This game is awesome, I have spent a tonne of time playing this game

review: My Personal Favourite Game of the Year. If you are thinking of buying it, I would suggest you to search a Friend who also has the Game. It makes much more Fun playing it with a Friend than alone. The Multiplayer is good too, althoug it takes FOREVER to join a Server (Its because every Server has their own Settings and Addons, which you must download first, the Game does it automaticly9
game-hours: 777.7
review: On my opinion - this is best mod for a game ever! In this game EVERYTHING is possible. You can spend your time in Singleplayer making random mechanisms, or making animations (yeah, some people doing that, and making money on it. So why not?) Or you can play in Multiplayer on many game modes (SandBox RolePlay, Trouble in Terrorist Town and ect.). This game have many features. So what are you waiting for?

game-hours: 660.7
review: All in all, this game is great, nothing bad to say about it really, it's fun, you can be created, there's a crap ton of different game modes, if you don't like one, go to another. One could be riding a sled, and the next could be finding pages to escape slender. If you're thinking of buying this game, I'd advise to get it, and get counter strike: source, for textures in some game modes. It's all worth it, trust me.

review: Imagination is creation and this game allows your Imagination to run wild with what you want to do. When I first got this game I wanted to create a mech suit, and so I did. This game is wonderful with all it's gamemodes, and workshop support to download add-ons. Although it requires Counter Strike: Source for 60% of it, it is definatly worth buying, if able to buy the bundle it's a bit cheaper. This game is wonderful on how you can create and build your wildest desires although learning the tools is a bit of a hassle you can get the hang of it. 8/10

review: This seems to be more of a game for people who want to make their own laughs by makin movies and scenes, but in the long run we will all be cought making a train sith a chair on it go in the sky with over 500 rockets and have it tied down with a extremely powerfull elastic rope to try and kill us. This game is a true must have to any kind of gamer, even if its just to play 5 min a day for the next few years. Its flat out amazing at what it did and does for us. You make things with others by wielding them on, you make cars with tires and seats, and you get to even do prop hunt where you go and look like a item as others case after you with crowbars (thats if they can see you), and over 100 more types of games inside. Highly recommend

review: Garry's Mod is all about EVERYTHING! You don't like minigames? Go to TTT, don't like TTT? go to sled, ETC. So as you can see there are alot of gamemodes in Garry's Mod, there's definately one gamemode you will like. Also Sandbox mode is great, download more addons from the workshop to make better vehicles, building and more! From my perspective there is NO rating for this game because there is so much. Garry's Mod is definately worth buying at sales, even 10 euros is still worth it. -Noko.

Highly recommended.

review: This game gives all your favorite vavle games mixed together. You can spawn npc's from many games from the steam workshop and also get many weapons from the workshop as well as a many veriety of vehicles to player models, or just some props from other games. This game gives you many different multiplayer game types. The gamemodes are Hunger Games where players are pitt against each other to fight/scavenge/survive. Perp lets you get a job buy a vehicle a house and even grow drugs, carefull though if you get caught by the cops your in jail or worse. suicide barrels is a gamemode where there is a team of exploding barrels and a group of survivers who hold out against them. Prop hunt is where you have to find some props to win the game, but there is a catch, some players are props and move around and hide from you making the game hard. There is a good amount of role playing gamemodes such as dark rp, half life rp, 1940's rp, and many more. And then there is Trouble in Terrorist Town, where everybody is a terrorist but they have to find the evil team of terrorists who have to eliminate the innocent terrorist. And much, much more. There is singleplayer were it is just sandbox mode that you can just mess around or make a battle or whatever you want. I strongly recommend this game for people who like vavle games or like to build stuff. Also i recommend you get orange box and cs:s for no missing textures.

I'll tell you now, the 5.99 is worth Trouble in Terrorrist Town (gamemode). Alone. The game never gets boring, always differing from the past gameplay. Don't like the 100's of awesome gamemodes like Zombie survival, TTT, sandbox Dark RP? Make your own! Make anything you imagine possible. The limit is your imagination. I highly reccomend purchasing both Half-Life 2 & Counter stike Source otherwise 3/4s of the guns will be 'errors' and the maps will be a blur of purple & black un-rendered textures.

review: This game gives all your favorite vavle games mixed together. You can spawn npc's from many games from the steam workshop and also get many weapons from the workshop as well as a many veriety of vehicles to player models, or just some props from other games. This game gives you many different multiplayer game types. The gamemodes are Hunger Games where players are pitt against each other to fight/scavenge/survive. Perp lets you get a job buy a vehicle a house and even grow drugs, carefull though if you get caught by the cops your in jail or worse. suicide barrels is a gamemode where there is a team of exploding barrels and a group of survivers who hold out against them. Prop hunt is where you have to find some props to win the game, but there is a catch, some players are props and move around and hide from you making the game hard. There is a good amount of role playing gamemodes such as dark rp, half life rp, 1940's rp, and many more. And then there is Trouble in Terrorist Town, where everybody is a terrorist but they have to find the evil team of terrorists who have to eliminate the innocent terrorist. And much, much more. There is singleplayer were it is just sandbox mode that you can just mess around or make a battle or whatever you want. I strongly recommend this game for people who like vavle games or like to build stuff. Also i recommend you get orange box and cs:s for no missing textures.

review: Garry's mod is one of my personal favorite sandbox's and so far i love it, you can make films, play game modes for example prop hunt and death run, mess around with any models and best of all screenshots, only down side is that you need content like Team Fortress 2 or Left 4 Dead 2 or portal or half life 2 And counter strike source or every valve game, so if you have $10.00 don't spend it on Jimmy john's spend it on this game instead and pay for lunch later or just sell your copy of Teenage mutant ninja turtles: out of the shadows lolz OVERALL SCORE: 10/10 Exelent

While playing the various community made multiplayer modes (I would recommend DarkRp or Trouble in terrorist town), You will find no more amount of fun can be had when playing with friends. An flawless masterpiece, thanks to the community that makes it so lively and enables it to provide you with endless hours of entertainment.

There are many different gamemodes including "Trouble in Terroist Town" when you have to find the traitors of your team with evidence like killing innocents. The other game modes include DarkRP, Prop hunt and normal Gary's mod which is Sandbox mode. There are also other game modes if these game modes don't interest you. Anyone with Steam needs to have this game.

I wouldnt recommend this game if you ain't having Counter Strike Source (css) ___ - Cause the most of the mods using css items/maps/caracters. But if you have css you should buy this. I will recommend this with 4/5 stars. - The star that is needed is that you need too have css for playing the best part of the game. - Good luck there.

review: Being a sandbox you may enter the game on your first go just wandering what to do, You have a few main groups of things. Props; the general objects of the world you can pick them up, throw them, stick them together. Entities; you can interact with these, they are the health vials and the vehicles. Tools; These are a group of tools which you use of props to weld, rope, ignite, remove and colour, there are a lot more but too many to list. NPCs; These are the AI, they are taken from the Half life 2 games so Hostile AI is Combine/Alien and Friendly AI is the Rebels. What really makes this game is the mods, they adds tons of content. Bored of the sandbox? Try TTT, Prop hunt etc Don't like the weapons in the game? Download a laser/WW2 mod.

review: If you are reading this and this game isn't in your library, you're an idiot. Seriously, this is one of steam's best games and arguably one of the best games ever. Well, it isn't a game per say, but it's close enough. It is an open source engine that takes props, maps and characters from other games made from the source engine and allows you to do as you want. Make a deep and meaningful adventure game, make a platformer that makes people want to pull their teeth out or just put characters from Half-Life and Counter-Strike in random sex positions and giggle. This game is truly the perfect game as there is infinite things to do in it. If you aren't too imaginitive you can always jump online and play TTT or Prop Hunt or one of the millions of other game modes that other, more intelligent(or just more nerdy), people have made. A must have for PC gamers everywhere especially since you can pick it up for no more than 3 dollars when it is on sale. 10/10

review: Garry's Mod, game of the year 2014 for me, amazing. Garry's Mod is a sandbox | Fun freeroaming game for anyone who is either bored, or someone who wants to be entertained by the inflation tool... and so on. The thing that really caught my eye on this game whilst watching videos was that there were many great features that really made me want to get it, same goes for Minecraft which is a complete other subject. I highly recommend this game to any Steam user, who is even reading this. Valve, Steam, you guys are doing such a great job! Inventing new games, from bringing new DLC's to the fun games. As well to you guys, thanks for all of the clever Workshop content which is made continuously everyday. :D I am hoping everyone reads this review, as I play this game every day which makes me happy. I hate down votes about this game and think its wrong since this game is extrodinary once more. I rate 1,000,000 stars out of 10 stars. (which is this ---> *) :P Many thanks for this game, Icy

review: If you're one of those people like me who enjoy a nice sandbox game in between stomping on Goomba and saving Hyrule, then Garry's Mod is the game for you. Originally a mod of the Half-Life series, Garry's Mod combines first person shooting and Minecraft. Not only can you enjoy a good firefight with your friends, you can even design the map you fight on! With multiple game modes including Sandbox, Prop Hunt, Trouble in Terrorist Town, and Death Run, Garry's Mod will never get old. At only fifteen dollars this is a great value and will rack up hours on your Steam account. Between me and my handful of Steam friends we have racked up at least a couple hundred hours on this game. If you are looking for a time waisting sandbox game then Garry's Mod is the game for you.

review: Garry's Mod is one of those games you hear about from a friend, go to all kind of effort to get working correctly so you can play it with them, and in the end, it's all worth it. This game definately has it's quirks, don't get me wrong. It suffers issues from new users missing textures to other assorted bugs like control-z crashing a server. But the game just offers so much, whether you want to play a gamemode or make one, Garry's Mod is really a great tool. I never knew I could get such enjoyment out of $2.49. Garry's Mod recieves an 8.5/10; if it fixed some bugs and made it easier to start playing it could be a 9.5/10.

review: Well well well, what can i say? Facepunch studios has made a simple sandbox/physcis and left the rest of the work for the people. I really enjoy this game with all its amazing features (apart from the 5 year olds playing XD) but other than that i really love this game because i'm always doing something new and it doesn't get boring. I would highly reccomend this game to anyone whether you're into shooters or RP. This game contains those aspects and many more. What i really love is this game and Skype. This game has created so many hilarious moments for my friends and I. My computer cannot take the amount of files of videos and pictures that have been recorded and taken. If you really want to have a fun experience, try getting some mods. So yet again highly reccomended, very funny and is awesome either in single or multiplayer. Personally murder, TTT, and hide and seek are all very fun and funny. So if you are reading this, go ahead and buy it, despite what others say it is not a waste of money. I actually would pay more for this game. If you are going to buy this game i reccomend you buy it with Half-Life2 or Counter Strike Source. That is all i have to say for garry's mod so hope my review was convincing . So farewell :)

It is also recommended to grab some friends and just go crazy. Garry's Mod is such a fun thing to do when there's nothing else to do and having a friend to enjoy it with makes it a whole lot better than a solo experience

review: Have you ever had "The Itch"? No, not the one your Girlfriend gave you... I'm talking about the itch you get from a great idea. The itch that you have to act upon. The urge that has existed from the birth of the Human race. Man's will to create that which he dreams. But... How? How can two hands, and ten fingers create that which can only exist as a bylaw, as a fugitive of physics? Reject physics. Reject reality. substitute your own. Admittedly, Garry's mod is not the final solution. Gmod is a rough tool, a hammer of creation. It was not the first of its kind. And it will not be the last. And currently, it is the closest that you can get to being God, with a universe at your command.

If you enjoy a building game or just a all around fun game, yous hould buy this. I couldnt get enough of this, escpecially the TTT. But there are much more gamemodes like Prop Hunt, Hide and Seek, Murder, Deathrun etc. Just a goof off game in general. Those were a few reasons why I love this game. Buy it and I ensure you youll have a great time with lots of laughs. P.S If you want max experiance get Counter strike: source so you can see all the textures and have a even better time.

review: Ah, Garry's Mod. One of the most beautiful gems in the whole Steam Library. Before I even give you my thoughts on this, I'm telling you right now. BUY THIS! It doesn't matter what type of games you like to play, as this is a sandbox game, where you can really do anything. Using the Steam Workshop, you can download add-ons that enhance the expirence, and heck, even make your own! Keeping in mind that this is a mod of Valve's Source Engine for games such as Team Fortress 2, Left 4 Dead, Portal, and others, you can mount these games on, and extend the madness! So, yeah. If you pretty much have an imagination, get this. It's worth it. I give Garry's Mod a 10/10.

review: Garry's Mod is an excellent experience with multiple gametypes from what is essentially hide and seek but with humans and objects, to roleplaying games. If you get a group of friends and jump on you will have hours of enjoyment from this Mod. Please note that this game is a Source Engine mod and requires a Source Engine game to be able to run it, such as Half-Life 2 or Counter-Strike: Source, and that different gametypes require models from differet Source Engine games/mods. I would recommend having Half-Life 2, Counter-Strike: Source, and Team Fortress 2 installed along with this game. To see my gameplay of Garry's Mod, visit my YouTube channel below; I occasionally post videos of this game!

review: Garry's Mod. What a wonderful game. PROS: Hilarious Sandbox mode, the physics and face poser make it even better! Amazing gamemodes like Trouble in Terrorist Town, Prop Hunt, Murder and Stop It Slender! It has a certain witty charm that makes you like the game even more. CONS: Missing textures. That pink and black checkerboard is my worst enemy. (I bought CS: Source with it, which is highly recommended.) A lot of servers I've been on have been inhabited by WAY too many tryhards. When I went on Trouble in Terrorist Town for the first time, I was greeted with the lovely sound of, "ERMAHGERD YOU RDMED ME YOU SWEAT! IM GONNA REPORT U FOR DAT YOU M**********R!" You will hopefully be more lucky than me if you get this game.... XD But overall... GET THIS GAME. Avoid the raging tryhards, and you'll be fine.

review: what can i say? Well firstly you can't not like garrysmod! There is something in it for everyone, wether you want to play a racing game or an FPS, you can in garrysmod there is always a way. Or maybe you enjoy the gamemodes like Prop Hunt or Trouble in Terrorist Town. Or maybe you just want to build your own. In garrysmod anything is possible. There is nothing to not like, amazing job developers. The game runs smooth the graphics are good and the gameplay is fun no matter what your into so read this review then just hurry up and buy the freaking game. Best 14 pounds i ever spent. My only problems have been while on sandbox or sometimes online getting chucked back to my desktop and garrysmod crashing for no reason. But i think the main problem is if you want the game to actually work online, you need Counter Strike Source. This though is not the developers fault. When people made the gamemodes such as Prop Hunt or TTT they made them using mainly CSS textures and models so if your getting this game, buy it with Counter strike source for that bit extra.

review: awesome game
game-hours: 136.2
review: Its one of my favourite games, its a game, where you can install a lot of gamemodes, maps, ragdolls and more. The only problem if youre new is the textures, i mean, if you dont have CounterStrike, HalfLife, Portal and TeamFortress you will not have all the textures. But its not a very big problem, you can downloaded it from internet. Anyways... I love this game and if you have friends, who have this game too, you are going to have a really good time. :)

review: When i first got this in its early stages i was completely stunned, really this game is AWESOME. like most games you can only do one thing, for example CoD ghosts. you shoot peeps, but with GMod you can do whatever you like, for example; roleplay, TDM, Muder, prophunt, TTT, you can also make Machinimas with ragdolls. the list is ENDLESS. if you are A CoD fan or A battlefeild fan or ANY GAMER get this games NOAW, you will not regret it! ;) -Duck

review: I have R$20,00 on steam. It costs R$16,99. With promotion I get it for R$4,99. I'm gonna get it at R$16,99 because it's REALLY worth it! This game kicks so many butts at once.. Terraria, Starbound, Counter-Strike, Call of Booty, BattleField, TrackMania, Need for Speed, Grand Theft Auto, APB Reloaded, MapleStory.. This game is PERFECT! 11/10!

review: Buying this game costs $9.99, and sometimes it's less. A meal from a fast food restaurant costs about the same. If you buy and play a game for longer than it would take you to eat a meal of the same worth, the game is worth its value. Garry's Mod, statistically, is worth over 10 thousand cheeseburgers.

Highly recommended and I have more hours on this game than any other game I have. It's massively multiplayer and if you're ever on the road and you don't have internet, there's a single player mode where you can mess around with all of the mods you have. Oh yeah, there's a million mods you can choose from! There's GTA V Player Models, Lightsabers, Modern Cars, Monster Energy Trucks, Exploding Shark Guns, and hundreds more! And it's only $10! This game is totally worth it and will take away what little bit of a life that you have! Jk ;D

review: Here's a game that anyone can enjoy. There are a variety of gamemodes to try out other than Sandbox such as Prop Hunt, TTT, Murder, ect. There is almost always something for everyone in this game. Alot of people argue that this game sucks because there are no tutorials on how to use any of the games features. Don't let this disscurage you. There are plenty of helpful youtube videos out there to get you started on what ever it is you want to build. So to sum this up, garrys mod is a great game that should be played at least once and is worth the $9.99. 10/10 (P.S) Buy this game when its on sale. You can usually get it for $2.50 )

review: Garry's mod is a great game. The most inportant thing that makes people play Garry's mod is the customizability in this game. There are many differant gamemodes to play. The game keeps getting updated and Garry keeps releasing hotfixes so that there will be as less bugs possible... Overal this is a great addon to your library! Also this game doesn't need a fast computer. But that doesn't mean the game is ugly... note : I recommend you to have Counter Strike Source because many of the custom maps have CSS textures. If you dont have CSS you could see some missing textures. Hoped this helped out.

review: Garry's Mod is a fantastic game. You can build literally anything here, like rockets and jet-powered car-boat party-stuff things? The requirement of Source games may be a downside, but if there's a sale you can easily snag CS:S and Garry's Mod for a very good price. The modding community is great- there's TDM Cars for the car enthusiasts, WAC Aircraft and their community packs for them hardcore pilots and 9K Murderthon gun packs for the murderous soldiers. There's like a quadzilion of different mods available to you in Garry's Mod- with a fair ammount of them on the Workshop. There are different maps, game modes (such as the well-known TTT) and just a fantastic community. The best part about it? Multiplayer. You can build, fight etc. etc. with your friend or friends! Or some people from the other side of the world! This is a total must get, especially with the winter sale coming up.

review: Best Game Ever! Period. With the Steam Workshop having over 100,000 items for Gmod you can get weapons, tools, you name it. The only thing that upsets me is that I need Counter-Strike: Source to fill in the missing textures and get better prop hunt. My parents won't let me buy Coutner-Strike: Source coause it's M. Remember, it seems boring at first, but when you get the hang of it and have mods, it is the most enjoyable thing ever,

review: I've played upwards of 20 hours which isn't all that much for me but that was BEFORE i figured out how to dupe things and download addons. And this is just the most damn fun i've had in forever. Sandbox is fun, alone or with people, the amount of messing around you can do is endless But then there are game modes.. you can do anything from survive zombie attacks to play hide and seek, to doing parkour, to playing football. Whatever takes your fancy. You can also build practically any kind of vehicle or make any object into one, and if you're lazy you can just dupe things in other people have made. It's not limited to objects, though. You can get rollercoasters and even entire maps. And a Dear Sister Gun complete with music. Oh and you can set off fireworks And be a firework And hell you can make the house from Up with balloons.. And a whole plethora of other nonsense and just pure fun. This however is only fun if you're willing to explore the spawn menu. If you just walk around being confused like i was to begin with you won't find a reason to keep playing. Amazing game! Well worth the pennies it costs for a lifetime of entertainment!

Second , The servers are fun , they have different kinds of game modes like Trouble in Terrorist Town , Prop Hunt and even a Minigame server! like some kind of WarioWare or Mario Party kind of game mode. Third , The addons are just so cool , Everytime I go through the addons menu , In every page I never got dissapointed , Picking up the things I want and getting excited to try them out myself. I'd rate this game 9/10 , some things are missing out like the instability of props (which makes the game kinda hilarious)

review: Garry's Mod- I'll try to look at it unbiased. I personally, LOVE this game, and it has something for everyone, whether that is a crime-solving mystery game, surfing, hiding as a prop while big men with guns try to find you, building sleds, or my favorite, building explosive rocket cars and seeing how far they go before they inevitably break. Many, MANY youtubers have brought more attention to the game, such as the Yogscast, CaptainSparklez, SeaNanners, and even PewDiePie. There is not, and never will, be an aim to the game. The big youtubers play gamemodes such as Prop Hunt, Trouble in Terrorist Town, and Murder, mainly because building isn't an interesting target for viewers. The original goal was to build whatever you wanted, and nothing else. It is very rare nowadays that people just build... But that is not neccesairily a bad thing. Now, onto my personal thoughts: The game is original, fun, centered around creativity, encourages modification, and, well, does whatever it wants. It reminds me of games like roblox- A base for creating what you want, a gaming platform. TL;DR: This game is amazing. Buy it.
game-hours: 698.8
review: Oh . This game. You can do whatever you want, Whenever you want, wherever you want. I'd reccomend having TF2, CS:S and HL2 for this. The most important one is probably CS:S if you want to play tons of servers. But anyways 10/10.

review: Garry's Mod has an unlimited amount of content, and a vast amount of gamemodes. You don't like Trouble in Terrorist Town? Try Prop Hunt or Basewars! Use all kinds of addons and such, make a movie using ragdolls, kill some stuff, do what I said previously with some friends. It is near impossible to not like GMod, get bored with it, and not recommend it. Sure there is no story but its not supposed to! The main point in the game is to have fun, mess around, and make videos. Thats Gurry's Mud for yah!

review: This is one of the best games on all of steam. It might not have the best graphics or gameplay, but the things you can do with the steam workshop are mind blowing. The game alone is quite fun, you can build stuff and spawn creatures, but the workshop gives access to hundreds of different games, thousands of different maps, NPCs, weapons, vehicles... The community is really friendly, so you'll be able to find a friend to play with easyly. You need to get this, you will have hours of fun. Also, I'd recomend getting CS:S with it. Without Counter Srike, you wont be able to see alot of the models or maps.

review: This game is like having sex for the first time. Once you download the game you jaw drops from all the different game modes, just like when you see your first set of . Then as you close your jaw and realize you actually can play every game you drop your shorts and get into it. Just as soon as you enter the lobby you realize you have no idea what your doing, move around pointlessly, going god knows where, and end up boned just like every other newbie. Whether that be stuck as a T man in prop hunt or stuck outside a building becasue you don't know how to open a door. Then get frustrated, slam on your keyboard, put up a spray not knowing how to do so and finish before you even know whats happening and go to another server and get boned all over again. 10/10 would recommend.

review: Instead of a full review (which you can find plenty of in this section), I will shorten it down to a positive/negative table. (That's right, just for you, lazy boy!) + Great sandbox game for players and modders. + Many different online game modes. + Many different offline game modes. (Go ahead and take a look around!) + Plenty of workshop items. + Great communities. - Outdated on many ends. - Bugs everywhere. Not well coded either. - Some game modes are simply copied from CSS community servers. (What means, you can experience those gamemodes in CSS too, you don't need Gmod for that.) - Many imature children running around. If you find a good community, you should be safe though. If you are still not sure, if you should buy it and try it out: Go for it! You are missing out on something that is not comparable to any other gaming experience (yet)!

The only problem is that Gmod is not updated much meaning the Mac Support suffers as there are occasional crashes when using the Mac OS version.

review: Garry's mod is one of the best sandbox/community driven games on PC and possible in Gaming. If you are going to buy this, you should buy CS:S with it since many game modes use those textures in it. Sandbox mode is nice, you can do many things in that but many people also love to play on game modes, I would recommend TTT as a nice game mode if you find a good server but the sky is the limit in Gmod gamemodes(actaully it is the engine but eh). There are so many things to be said about this game and this review would go on for pages if you were to explain every single custom gamemode that is on garry's mod and you will get you 10/5/2.5 euro or whatever the price is out of it since there is constantly new content developed on servers. A great game with a good community if you know where to look.

review: This game sounds strange, but it is anything but that. This game is a game where you create contraptions that could do almost anything.The game is basicly a sandbox gamemode for half-life 2. However, many people make multiple types of addons for this game, including npcs, wepons, tools, vehicles, maps, and just about anything else you can think of. You can also play online in building servers or rp(Role Playing) servers.

review: Garry's mod is one of the best sandbox/community driven games on PC and possible in Gaming. If you are going to buy this, you should buy CS:S with it since many game modes use those textures in it. Sandbox mode is nice, you can do many things in that but many people also love to play on game modes, I would recommend TTT as a nice game mode if you find a good server but the sky is the limit in Gmod gamemodes(actaully it is the engine but eh). There are so many things to be said about this game and this review would go on for pages if you were to explain every single custom gamemode that is on garry's mod and you will get you 10/5/2.5 euro or whatever the price is out of it since there is constantly new content developed on servers. A great game with a good community if you know where to look.

review: Garry's Mod is one of those games that if you don't buy it, you are putting yourself to shame. Get off of your computer chair and buy this game NOW. With a variety of game modes from Sandbox and DarkRP to Murder and Trouble In Terrorist Town, new game modes and new servers are coming out EVERY DAY. This is a game that I have sadly not had enough time to play but I think that your 5 (I think) that you will spend to get this game will give you unlimited content (unless you get banned from all of the world's servers). There is always another server to join and new adventures to participate in. If you're the type that gets bored easily, you'll still get at LEAST 300 hours out of this game. If you aren't, get ready for the adventure of your lifetime and make sure you have a comfortable computer chair because you could spend up to 3000 hours on this game and possibly more. There are quite a few people who have spent the equivalent of a YEAR playing this game and it will run on ANYTHING. It even runs on my 5 year old APPLE MAC which is literally the most basic computer possible. It is impossible to not like this game. You can even rent a server from various suppliers if you're up for the challenge. One thing I will say though, is to watch out for the Badmins. Badmins are Admins who use their powers to degrade other people's experiences, but it's not really something that takes away from the game. My final verdict for Garry's Mod is an enthusiastic 9/10! It only JUST misses the 10/10 mark for the Badmins, occasional false VAC Bans and the fact that I wasted an hour of my life on a terrible server that kept messing me around before finally putting me out of my misery and banning me. Everything else, however, is pure gold and this game competes with the greats like Grand Theft Auto V in my view. Cancel any plans you have tonight - you will be super-glued to your computer chair. If you like this game, also consider trying out Facepunch Studio's other major title, Rust, a zombie-survival game where everybody starts without any clothes on. Literally. Anyway, I hope this review helped you out, and enjoy spending a small amount of cash on this legendary. Thanks for reading. Peace.

review: Anybody who is any sort of fan of Valve games must stick this one on their wishlist and grab it when they've got the dough to cherish this game. Garry's Mod, albeit just a utilisation of the standard game engine, playing online on this game shows off how far the community have taken this. The game engine has been well and truly taken advantage of in a way that has flourished the creativity of gamers everywhere, yielding only a immersive and captivating online experience in modes such as Prop Hunt, Murder and Trouble in Terrorist Town. These game modes take place on well-known Counter Strike: Source maps and give Garry's Mod a familiar feel while uping the social advantages of having such an abudance of creative game modes. Buying this game will ultimately provide you with enjoyment, and it's one of those games that everybody eventually needs to have. It's smooth and fun, fast-paced and exciting. A great advantage is that you can play it endlessly because there's so many different gametypes that everytime you get bored of one, there's always somewhere else you can go where you feel like you're playing a whole new game altogether. So, why exactly should you buy it? Prop Hunt (a Garry's Mod gametype) captures my attention the most; a hub for laughs as players disguise as objects to hide from 'hunters', the team that must eliminate the team disguising as props. It's like the game of hide-and-seek you always wish you had played as a child. It's tremendous. 'Trouble in Terrorist Town' (or 'TTT') is yet another gametype that can be pretty amusing. Basically, you can be innocent or you can be a traitor. The game assigns each person with one of those titles and then from there, nobody knows who is who. However, for the traitors, they see who else is a traitor and who isn't. Unsurprisingly, their job is to kill (without being caught), and it's fun trying to find out who the traitors are! 'Murder' is similar to TTT in a way that everybody appears the same. There's only one murderer, though, but nobody knows who it is, and only a select couple of bystanders (people who aren't the murderer) get a weapon. It's perhaps the most realistic simulation of being in a mental institution I have ever seen. That's just a taste of Garry's Mod; due to its lively community, the creativity of what people can do with the Valve game engine is simply constant, and there's always something new to try.

A mix of a lot of Valve games + you're own imagination + all the tools you will need + millions of mods/ addons + very good engine + gamemode galore + enough servers and player to keep you playing for YEARS. I would either buy this game 10 more times or have it priced for $70. Amazingly addictive and a fun use of time 10/10

review: Garry's Mod. The very name conjures up images of ragdolled bodies flying through the air as a C4 has exploded in TTT, of countless props spawned whilst trying to make something that, when you take a step back, only slightly resembles the Death Star. For all it's flaws, of which there are few, it makes up in its charm, endless amount of mods, gamestyles and general sillyness. Its issues surrounding hit-boxes are annoying, often find yourself shooting somebody in the face with a shotgun only to discover you've missed and subsequently blown your cover as a Traitor in TTT but you quickly adapt and stab him before he can yell out your name in a pitch that resembles a pre-pubescent little boy. The ladders suck of course but if you're careful enough you'll probably land safetly and if not, after about 5 minutes of rage at being eaten alive in ZombieMod because your character can't quite grasp the function of ladders, you laugh it off and persue the other survivors. I've had some of the best hours of my life playing TTT and Garry's Mod in general, if you're on the fence about it, you shouldn't be, for about 10 (That and CS:S) its a bundle of joy that will keep you up at night until ungodly hours.

If you desire freedom and nothing else, pick this up right away.

My only regret is that Gabe Newell cancelled the release of 'Garrys Mod 2: Electric Boogaloo', as I was rather looking forward to finding out who Kleiner's father really is after the cliffhanger of the last game. Personally, for me this would have been a welcome addition to the series, especially after 'Portal Strike 3: Left for Life' fell through. But maybe that's just me.

The fact that you can go from messing around on Sandbox to chilling in a Cinema with friends watching who-knows-what and jump right to betraying each other in murder.

I don't see myself leaving this game any time soon unless I have to go to classes at college but besides that this game is far worth the experience and laughs along the way.

review: Garry's Mod. You'll most likely do absolutley nothing productive in your first hour of playing. You'll look at the NPCs. Maybe face pose some ragdolls into genius works of art or hideous abominations. You'll look at the weapons. Get a mod or two. All that kind of stuff- but then, your flat world of near-pointlessness will expand. You'll make movies that desrve -2 oscars, but are still amazing. You can make a minigame using a save that will rocket you to the top of the most popular saves list for about 3-5 days. You'll make vehicles out of everything, and only spam thrusters when your friends are in a vehicle. You can go on a server and play with the community. You can even make an addon for the community. So, why wait to buy this, when you can get it now and do all of the things I just said. Why? Because in Garry's Mod, you can do anything- and yes, that includes making a pigeon-powered bathtub tank if you have the right mods.

review: My Grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, 'If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately.'. Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through." I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway.

This game is NOT just a sandbox, but rather it's your own world, you choose what to do in it, you choose what to make, what to build, kill, destroy, whatever. This game is the spark to your creativity, now sometimes it may not spark, sometimes it does. But I think that is what makes this a great game.

review: I love this game! It's Valve games all in one. You can make your one story, mess around with things, play different gamemodes, and the workshop addons are the icing on the cake. There is no limit of what you can do in Garry's Mod. The most fun part: playing it with friends. I TOTALLY RECOMMEND THIS GAME !!!

review: Do what ever you want, go crazy, blow stuff up, shot stuff, make ships, and you can even get new content made by other people. You can play multiplayer with friends. Endless amounts of maps allow a great time, every time you play. It's a game you won't get tired of it. You can even use stuff from other games. Like props or zombines, allowing you to bring in your favorite parts of other games and use them in this perfect sandbox game.

review: took a little bit to figure out how to play but once I did it is so amazing it's like minecraft in general with sandbox and minigame gamemodes, maps, and mods (addons), but is more of a first-person styled game like Call of Duty in the way you explore the different maps and aspects of the game. the UI was a little difficult to understand but you get more into the game the more you play and experiment. definitely recomment, atleast an 8 out of 10

review: It is the absolute utopia for sandbox games everywhere. Garry's Mod can be everything from making houses, to doing heists and capturing hostages. The multi-player is what I belive to be a key factor in this games success, It has so many different gamemodes that the people have made such as, Roleplay, Sandbox, Racing, Trouble In Terrorist Town (Detective), If you can think of it, this game has it.

review: A hilarious game mode that attracted me in as soon as i started playing it. I was first attracted to Garry's Mod from Youtube, mostly from Trouble in Terrorist Town, but my interest was piqued by many more game modes when I opened the servers list. Dark RP is an amazing roleplaying gamemode which has you pick a job and live among others. The people can sometimes troll, but whenever that happens, just have a laugh yourself. TTT, on the other hand, brings you into a scenario of 3 people, the Traitor, Innocent, and Detective. The Traitor is amazing (my favorite) to play, strategizing the best way to kill everyone on the map with your fellow comrade(s). Another gamemode (or multiple gamemodes should i say) that I loved was Gmod Tower. It was almost a hotel, where you could get a room and decorate it using furniture. Where did you get this furniture? From games or course! You were able to match up against players in different gamemodes, and reap your rewards to decorate yourself, your room, and even give you an edge up in some games. All in all, Garry's Mod is an amazing game which I would reccomend to anyone looking for a good waste of time that isn't strict at all.

review: When I first bought this game I thought it would be a good idea to join a mostly free-build DarkRP game. As soon as I joined I checked the jobs, and since I was relatively young I thought it would be "Hella Sweet" to be a drug dealer. "Heheh, if my mommy found out I would be in soooo much trouble", I would say to myself. Little did I know, I was 12 and she wouldn't give a , I was kinda the same way when I got a Grand Theft Auto texture pack for Minecraft (because I wasn't allowed to play GTA). These guys approached me in my SICK drug store made out of doors, wooden pallets, and one window. So... I need to stop getting off topic, seriously what the ? They bought a bunch of drugs off of me, then proceeded to keep me with my base (I didn't lock it... smart me). They literally ing took my drug store and dropped it on me THEY ING DROPPED IT ON ME. They then proceeded to steal my money and continuously prop kill me... over... and over... and over. (Commence squeaker voice) "GUYS! SRSLY, STOP KILLING ME IT'S ANNOOOOYYYIIIINNNGG". The guy who was killing me said he would stop killing me, then his friend started killing me over and over again, I said "WE HAD A DEAAALLL", he replied with, "Yeah, I said that I would stop killing you".

review: I think this is one of the few must-have games on steam. The gamemodes and originality of serve this game very well. There are noumerous gamemodes and every one of them with their own commutity. You want to shoot people? Totally possible! You want to play minigames? Yep, all possible! You just want to build whatever you want? Ofcourse! This game is like a game-engine, this is the base, and you can fully decide what game you want to make with it. The only downside is how often it crashes on low-end systems and the high internet you will need to smoothly run some gamemodes. And, it is just 9.99 (i guess $9.99 too, but i am not american)! It has more playtime than a 60,- game and is way more enjoyable Definally a must have! [8,7/10]

But i would describe it as weird. You can be an ninja Indiana Jones that builds things, fill them with skyrim guards and then explode it. You can be a Portal robot while you kill aliens that shoots nyan cats. You can go multiplayer and be a terrorist traitor that suicides himself with kamikaze bombs, you can disguise yourself as a melon and play hide 'n seek. It is an funny game. A hilarious game. But a really, really, REALLY weird game.

review: Garry's mod is a fantastic game that never ends. Most of the game is building things. Or thats what i thought. After i explored, i had found something that changes the game COMPLETELY. I am talking about the community. This games community is GIANT.The mods that come out of the community makes this game last forever. So pretty much you can build anything, and after you get bored of that you can use the mods until you get bored of thoes. And at that point you would have thought of something to build and the cycle repeats. I have played this game for 450+ hours and i can safely say that it is my favorite game of all time and that you should get gmod at any cost. 10/10

review: Garrys Mod was originally a mod for Half Life 2. It is a sandbox game which revolves around spawning props, experimenting with addons and new content, and multiplayer gamemodes. It is LOADS of fun to play. There is always new content with the steam workshop which includes maps, gamemodes, weapons, models, etc. (Some of the maps make you lag, but don't play on those. Play on decent maps) The multiplayer is fun as well. Here is pros and cons: PROS: Very fun to play, and addons support. - As far as I know, its the only game where you can attach melons and bathtubs to a car using an electronic beam. - Lots of gamemodes besides sandbox. These include Trouble in Terrorist Town, Prop Hunt, and Cinema. CONS: - Multiplayer servers take a long time to connect to. - Some servers lag even if you have a low ping. - Sometimes servers are polluted with people who spam props, objects, etc. Overall, it is well worth the 10 dollars. Buy it.

review: In my time playing this game, I have made countless friendships with a variety of individuals, including several hundred ten year-olds and a pedophile. I am very grateful to have had this great oppurtunity to play one of the most riveting games of all time; I will never forget the great times I had while playing this game, and will likely tell stories about it to my grandchildren, so that they, too, may enjoy this wondrous entertainment. My only regret is that I will never play or see anything as great as this game in my entire life again. Garry's Mod is truly the highpoint of all of our lives, even those who have never played the game. This game changed my life completely, whether that is for better of for worse is uncertain, but I emerge from this game a new person. Anyone looking seeking meaning in their life will enjoy this game immensely.

review: Garry's Mod is a fantastic game, and in my experience (albiet a short one compared to most other people that have it) has been a fantastic one. If you can think it, you can do, build, create it. Garry's mod is one of the few games that is only limited by your own imagination, and that's why I love it. In fact calling it a game is an understatement, it's a whole world of it's own, It's what you make of it. I have experienced very few errors in the game, and the ones that I have experienced were so minute that it hardly affected the gameplay in any way. It is a truly remarkable title and I highly recommend it to anyone and everyone.

review: Garry's mod is a sandbox game where you have fun with characters from other games. Garry's mod is most fun with a friend on an online server. But, the only way to get the full experence is by getting stuff from the workshop. So, if you arn't the type of person to do that, then this game isn't really for you. But, I highly recomend that alot of people should get this game for some laughs and just for have a good time. My rating for this game would be a 9.4 Out of 10.

review: To start off Gmod is love Gmod is life The graphics are great 9/10 and it is made in 2009/2008 so it is very well done for that time, The game still has thousands of players on the Steam community even more not on steam The game is always getting better cause of all the workshop items you download can improve textures alot Great workshop lot's of people upload stuff a little to many copys but they are great for Textures, Veichles and everything Good Gamemode's Such as, TTT, Murder, DarkRp, Flood and much much more Great host's of servers for cheap 10/10 for the game overall If you need help with the controls or anything the community is friendly and you will defeinitly find someone who will help you out and tell you the controls Good for being turned from Half Life 2 Mod into full game that thousands of people enjoy everyday so, 10/10 for Game 9/10 for Graphics (Keeping in mind this game is still old) 10/10 for Gameplay 10/10 for Community it keeps on growing Buy this game for fun!

review: Garry's Mod is simple yet hillarious, while being able to create things at your own will in single player the multiplayer beats all, after playing Prop Hunt for 200 hours I still want to play much more. With all the different gamemodes for Gmod there isn't a second without fun and laughter. Definetly my #1 favourite game on steam, I recommend that if you haven't already you go pick this up ASAP.

review: I bought this game for $2.50 when it was on sale (I'm a bit of a liberal spender...), and it's been great! The game is mostly community content and borrowed items from other games, which is cool for a good while. But that's just if you're using single player sandbox... When you start playing on servers, the amazing amount of official server mods, such as Melon Bomber, JailBreak, TTT, FireArt, it's even better. It's a good game. A lot of the community content and servers require you to own games, mostly Counter-Strike: Source (hence the gamepack on sale here.), but if you look around the internet, you can get the gamefiles easily without having to buy the game. Note: You don't get the game for having the gamefiles, just the Gmod content.

This game has tons of potential. Great relaxed game, I suggest this for gamers who like to shoot everything in the face and spawn tons of random NPC's in and shoot them with the FPS engine or create wonderful anythings! So i reccomend you get this game with Counter Strike: Source, as its like 2 games in 1!

I played like 5 hours in a row and i still wanted to play :D If you should buy one game, take this game because its you that decide how you are gonna play it: hard way, peaceful way, killer way, etc And it has more than just one game mode like: Sandbox Mode (You do whatever you want), Trouble in Terrorist Town (Like playing Call of duty online but Garry's mod way) and finally : Prop Hunt! (2 sides: the props, and the hunters. The hunters have to kill all props to win and the props need to have one player still alive at the end of the time to win) In one sentence: B.E.S.T GAME EVER!!

review: I'm mostly into the creative side of Gmod but that's not the only thing you can do in Gmod where with Sandbox you can make funny poses, faces or even messing around with the fingers, You spawn enemies, allies to cause a war for your own kinds of fun. But what can you do with the resources at your disposal? Don't have anything that you need? That's where the Steam Workshop part comes in! However You may need to download certain games in the Steam Library to get some things working. Most notable Counter Strike and all of the Half Life Games to avoid Texture errors. [that's how it went for me] However there are good gametypes you can try out though some have their downsides. But here's what I know to those who seek to buy the game. Trouble in Terrorist Town: A fun game of sorts where there are three types of teams. The harmless and yet still carry guns innocents, The detective who is after the main badguy that is known as the traitor: There are ways to tell if one is a traitor or not depending on what kind of weapon does he have that most others can not have? Stop it Slender!: The only Slenderman gametype where one person plays as the Slenderman! And you got to collect all the pages before someone catches you. Have fun while you not being alone! Murder: It's like Trouble in Terrorist town cept a bit more realistic. However the Revolver only has one bullet and the guy who has to kill the Murder is the only one who has it. The murderer himself has a knife to stab with instant kill. Prop Hunt: Hilarious form of Hide and Seek. Rather than tagging someone. You turn into any kinds of objects. Like a Sofa, or a bananna or even a chair. And you hide from other players with rifles and shotguns that is trying to hunt you down and reduce you to shreds. Have fun with that. I'd give this a 9/10 because it's one of the games that would take a while to get used to on the creative side and on the fun side. There are things to be downloaded automatically as you enter the server so you can play the game without any missing models whatsoever.

You want to create a battlefield and start a war between NPC's? You can do that too! The game comes with a TON of different things to build and create with, but with the Steam Workshop you'll never run out of things to build. And I'm only talking about the Sandbox gamemode. There's Trouble in Terrorist Town, Murder, Prop Hunt, DarkRP, and a whole lot more! Basicly if you get this game, you'll never be bored!

review: This is an incredibly versatile game. With lots of gamemodes! Are you creative? Want to build? Play Sandbox. Want to roleplay? Play DarkRP. Want to be a detective, and find murderers? Play Trouble in Terrorist Town. Want to watch YouTube videos with friends? Play Cinema. Want to go on a strange adventure in an elevator? Play Elevator: Source. Want to play Hide and Seek while disguised as a prop? Play Prophunt. Want to play a "Wipeout"-esque type of thing? Try Deathrun. That's only a few gamemodes - there are 1000s. Seriously, there is nothing Garry's Mod can't do. Except make me a sandwich. But you can spawn one in. Plus, you can download weapons, vehicles, props, maps, and things other people have made. You can even play with friends and make some crazy contraptions! If you have other Valve made games such as Half Life 2 (and the episodes), Team Fortress 2, Portal (1 and 2), CS:S, CS:GO, DoD:S you can import stuff like items and maps in to Garry's Mod! It does this for you. 10/10. I can't recommend this game enough.

review: A game that started out as a mod for sandbox in the source engine, using assets from Valves evolved into a full on game that can use the assets of Valves games, but do more with it than mess around and build stuff. There are so many different game modes in this, so many things to do it's incredible. The only problem? The community is full of young kids who saw their favorite youtube playing a game mode and now most of the game is infested with young kids who can ruin the experience, but I've met some pretty cool kids. Overall, it's a very good game for the sheer ammount of content in it thanks to the community.

review: Garry's Mod is a good game. In this review I will explain why by presenting my experience in a simple and logical form. Pros: - You have skin. Potatoes have skin. Therefore: You are a potato. - The sky is blue. Water is blue. Therefore: The sky is water. - Skeletons are spooky. Spooky is spooky. Therefore: Spooky Spooky Skeleton. - I can't. Evan can. Therefore: I can't Evan. Cons: - I am a potato. - I can't swim. - I am bad dingus. - I actually can. This game has replay value: 10/10

review: This is a great game for (almost) all ages! It is very fun and gives you the freedom to do whatever you want. It is mostly a building game, but anything can happen! There are roleplay maps, zombie survival maps, flood survival maps, and a whole lot more available to download on the Internet. The building in this game can get very complicated, but there are tutorials all over the Internet. The game does have violence present in certain multiplayer game modes, and there are guns and zombies available in the spawnlists, but it is definitely not forcing violent content on you. Getting involved in violence in this game is totally optional. Multiplayer with voice chat is available, and the people on there can be profane and rude. However there is no need to play multiplayer when there are thousands of different singleplayer maps to build on and explore! I'd say this game would be best suited for kids 6 and up, assuming that they do NOT engage in multiplayer or violence.

review: I was skeptical about purchasing this. I couldn't find a review that really explained what it is to a degree to buy it. But it was only five bucks, so I bought it anyways. I do not regret my purchase. I do not build levels with hammer, or go in depth with all the special posing tools, I just fool around in big maps by driving cars and fighting ais. And that's fun enough. If you have ever played a game, and then played that same game again with a bunch of mods, that is what garry's mod is in a nutshell. Starts out as fun, but with addons, YERRAH! That's some fun stuff. I don't play multiplayer. But there are a lot of servers. I'd like to point that out.

review: Ah yes. Garry's Mod. Among the vast genre of games that Steam has to offer, this has to be by far one of the most entertaining games of the 21st Century! Vertually anything is possible! If you find yourself bored of a certain game mode, don't you worry! Just go to the server selection menu, and pick from the wide variety of servers available at your finger tips. And did i mention, everyone has access to a free baby in the prop selection screen in-game!? This game is well worth the money, and don't forget to go buy Counter Strike: Source. Because without it, your Garry's Mod textures wont work on almost any server! Have fun, friends! - Nico

review: Garrys mod is a great fun game where you can put many hours into playing. There are much addons to mess around with by yourself or with friends. There are many gamemodes you can play so you dont get bored of the game after a while. Many maps in the game and the best thing about the game is you can be creative and let your imagination take you away. The only thing is I have against this game you must buy and download CS:Source and Half life 2 to get the textures for certain props and textures, also there are certain bugs that make the game crash but other than that Garrys mod is a great game. Garrys mod is worth its price and goes on sale a lot so you can get it for a very cheap price. Hopefully this review was written well enough to motivate you to but the game :). I would rate this game a 9/10

This game is so openly sandbox I can't even put it into words, the crazyness, the exploits and glitches, the gamemodes, the weapons, the vehicles, and most of all the addons. This is what makes this game the best out of all. For ten dollars I've spent over 700 hours on this game and counting. If you want a game that is worth every minute look no further.

review: Hands down the best game on steam, you can do whatever the hell you want as this is a game that is the doorway to many games. Famously known ones are Trouble in Terrorist Town, Prop Hunt and Murder.Garry's mod is cheap and I love it, the games are fun you can mess around all you want and I prefer this over anything else on steam.

review: Garry's Mod. Truly the wild card of the Source Engine. So much can be done with this game, it almost baffles my mind! Quite honestly I am surprised nearly every day with the mods I find. One day I find a mod that adds realistic guns, another a mod that adds a new gamemode where I can RP as a character in the HL2 universe. It is my most often played game on steam, and for good reason. The creator of the game is one of the funniest people I have ever heard about. Here is one example! Early on in Gmod's history, there were a bunch of people trying to play cracked versions of the game. So he implimented a file that targeted only the cracked versions of the game, and asked on a public forum if any one was having the issue. The next thing everyone knew, all the cracked Garry's Mod users were getting banned. Now isn't that just genius? It's like some Death Note genius right there. The three most popular gamemodes of which I will go into detail, all have thousands of players on hundreds of different servers. Each of these select gamemodes are widely different and are really entertaining and have many fun experiences for each, so give all the gamemodes a try! Sure, some of them are bound to be stinkers, but most of them are creative and unique. Sandbox: The default gamemode, this is what Garry's Mod was designed around. It is prety self-explanitory, you build with props from various Source games, spawn in enemies from HL2, and weapons to take down those enemies. Oh, and there are mods that add pretty much anything you can think of. I like to add a ton of mods, then go on a Combine massacre. Pretty fun. Trouble in Terrorist Town (TTT): My favorite gamemode, personally. It is a gamemode about stealthily killing innocent terrorists as Traitors. But the detective throws a loop in your plans, or helps you out by using tools to find out who the traitors are. I have played at least 400 hours of this. DarkRP: Basically real-life roleplay. Fun, but there are a lot of rule breakers and squeakers. The vanilla gamemode already has a lot of jobs, but most servers have more than 30 jobs, examples include: Citizen, Police Officer, Gangster, Mob Boss, Mayor, and many more. Overall Rating: 9/10

review: Garry's Mod is something made by gods above the earth working with Valve. It is rediculously fun, neverending, and hell, you might learn something about physics or teamwork because of it. The game is originally a sandbox type of deal but now with a community that breaths without air, you can have races, gunfights, competitive play, and so much more. If I had a list of games every Steam account should own simply because everybody loves it to death, this would go on the list so hard, right next to Half-Life 2. THAT is how good Garry's Mod is. I could tell you even more if you'd like, like for instance, my steam life dealio began because of a lucky choice on Garry's Mod, Garry's Mod builds friends and begins lives.  society, play some Garry's Mod. I'm done here, buy it when you can.

Also there are thousands of addons that you can install direct from the Steam Workshop that is integrated into the game. I have around 5 copy's of the game that I am willing to give out for free, so message me if you need one!

review: Garrys mod is the ultimate sandbox game. It plays with physics, mainly in the ways of props, NPCs and models. It uses the parts, models and sounds of any source based game (Mainly Half Life 2 and Counter Strike Source). I have fallen in love with this game, It's use of the source Engine's mechanics is second to none. There are addons for it, these add things like maps, weapons, gamemodes, vehicles and much more. Its multiplayer, like the majoity of all souce engine games, making it great for groups to play together. Things like "Trouble in Terrorist Town' (Formally known as TTT) are game modes. TTT is a great gamemode, made off the fundamentals of betrayal. Garry's mod is an incedible game overall, I highly recommend it. So come on, grab some mates and have a good time. -Sc00p 10/10

review: A humorous level builder and a great extension to the Half-Life series. Garry's mod is user friendly when it comes to customization, animation and modifying bits and pieces from other games that you own! Just don't forget to save.

review: This game is so fun :D You can do so much with it and if you like electronics and wiring you can install the wiremod and do even MORE cool stuff with this game! However if you do not like building you can try out one of the many gamemodes in multiplayer either on public servers or with your friends (depending whether you have downloaded the gamemode or not)

review: Meh its decent, personally i only play it for the fun gamemodes but no one makes any good ones anymore, the only ones that are good are Dark RP (for trolling), zombie survival (gets old fast) and a couple other ones. People just play gmod for TTT and roleplay but none of those get updated anymore and since the developers are making Rust then gmod is just forgotten now which makes me sad as this has so much potential! Good news is most of the 10 year old s of the gmod community are now gone! Thanks to rust :D. Also the developers are greedy s.

As i have read, Not everyone is having this problem, but it is happaning.. And the problem has been around for more then a year or two.. Maybe its not a bug but who knows. But asides that, The game is great, and has many gamemodes for you to play... basicly no matter what you are into game wise. This game has a game for you! Its a great game inside a great game! So Get it and enjoy it!

review: This is my number one favourite game OF ALL TIME! (Warning: May cause erection without warning). -================================================================- For anyone who doesn't know what Garry's Mod is: a) You can do pretty much anything. Yep, anything. Create an entire civilization of flying bacon-flavoured waffles only to have them destroyed by a giant-mutant-cyborg toaster from outer space if you want; I don't care. Oh yeah, and it's multiplayer. b) If you don't want to make things or just mess around like that (if so, what is wrong with you?), then you can play more serious or just generally less-creative game modes like 'Trouble in Terrorist Town', 'Zombie Survival' or 'Prop Hunt' (among hundreds of other modes). c) The fun never ends; The Gmod community is one of the largest and most-active gaming communities out there! New mods, models, maps and gamemodes are constantly coming out, plus there's also the hundreds of thousands of things that have already been made. Essentialy, you're always playing Garry's Mod, but you're also playing over a hundred games inside of it. d) If you haven't heard of Garry's Mod, then where have you been hiding? You'd need to completely cut yourself off from the outside world to not have heard of it. You should be ashamed of yourself. So all-in-all, you're paying a small fee to provide yourself with (at minimum) hundreds of hours of awesomely spazztastic fun. At this price, you should feel guilty. Especially with all of the new FREE STUFF that comes out. I would gladly pay 80 or 100 to have this game. Honestly. Not kidding. For real. If you (for some reason) can only have one game ever, then make sure it's this game. I've seen people put in almost 2,000 hours for this game. NOW FOR THE FINAL SCORE -=======================- I have never given a game 100% because surely that's not possible. There's never been a perfect game. Yeah well if you thought that too, you're wrong. Gmod ISN'T a game. It's like thousands of tiny-and-equally-awesome games all in one. 10/10 without any doubt whatsoever. If you disagree, would you kindly go kill yourself please? Thank you.

review: GREAT workshop community sandbox game. Sure some of the gamemodes are sort of tough at first but they are so simple and so fun once you learn to play. The possibilities with this game are endless and the potential is unlimited. Sure the graphics arent great but this isnt Skyrim, nobody cares about the graphics or anything with this game, its Gmod. And when I say the potential is unlimited is tat because of how the players can develop amd customize their own gamemodes or servers, also the amounts of wonderful workshop creations. Also recently youtube has been exploding with Gmod videos which is only making more people play this game, dont be left out. I completely 100% recommend this game. Give it a try, its tough at first but once you learn the basics, its so simple.

review: This amazing sandbox offers unlimited possiblites. The content is generated by the players. The only limit to this game is the source engine, which is for the most part not a bad thing. The maps and graphical content suffer from this, but the gameplay is the heart of this game which makes it truley amazing.

review: Garry's mod is perfect for anyone. You can do anything. You dont even have to build things if you dont want to, just load maps from the workshop. There are also a ton of mods that can really make the game interesting. It is very easy to just spend hours spawning things and then blowing them up. Or camp out in a gas station and see how long you can fend off the zombies. The invisible barrier in the sky is the limit.

review: Garry's Mod is hours of entertainment and a game that I highly recommend. It's on sale on Steam often enough, so if you don't have it, buy it. It's a sandbox-style game that can load content from a number of Source games (TF2, HL2 etc.), as well as having a great selection of weapons, tools, maps and saves available in the steam workshop. You can plonk stuff anywhere you like, build contraptions such as hover cars or even spawn huge weights to crush Barney under (because he still hasn't bought you that beer!) The part I find most enjoyable, though, is loading up the original Half Life 2 maps and using the GMod tools to cause havoc. Bar up doorways, set up trip-wire bombs or even find where Dr. Breen is hiding and replace him with a beach ball. And if you're the programming sort, get WireMod. You can put down a range of sensors and displays to make cool stuff like control panels where you have to turn the key and input a 4 digit code in order to set off the explosion. Takes a bit to learn, but is so much fun!

review: This is probably the best game I've ever played. It is a open-world sandbox builder that beats all other builders I've played, while still being a great Fps. It has great graphics considering what all is in the game. I almost never lag besides when nuking the map with one of many mods you can get (so far 200,000+). There are lots of fun multiplayer servers too if you want to Roleplay or Shoot some people in a Fps. I have over 250+ hours put into this game and I've only had it for about 3 months.

I wish that the designers of Garry's Mod would make some awesome stuff (if they haven't already) Garry's Mod is awesome. If anybody asked what my favorite game was, I'd probably have to say...Garry's Mod :D
game-hours: 4341.7
review: This is, in my opinion, the best game ever made. Not because it has a great story, or because of Super Ultra Turbo High-Def 4D Graphics With Blast Processing. It's not good because it has immersive, HUD-less gameply. Not because the controls are great (in fact, sometimes they kind of suck. But at least you can change them.) This game does not have some innovative, never-before-seen combat system. It does not have memorable characters. So what does it have? EVERYTHING. Build. Destroy. Explore. Kill each other. Roleplay. Play with dolls. Drive cars. Program robots and computers. Go platforming. Play golf. Build a fort. It doesn't matter, because you can LITERALLY do anything in this game. This isn't like GTA, where they just SAY you can do anything. In GTA, can you fill a room with toilets and giant-headed aliens? Can you kill Alyx Vance over and over again? Can you live out your fantasies of being Mario or Samus or Link or Master Chief or Sonic or Ryu or the Heavy? You can here.

review: This should be a greenlight. And for you people out there, IF YOU HAVE PROBLEMS LIKE TEXTURES OR MODELS ENTER IN Right click on that steam game. Go to properties. launch options enter -dxlevel 81, for team fortress 2 -dxlevel 90 to see spawn menu Q press E and move mouse to rotate objects or ragdolls without having to jump like a monskey everywhere and its usually used in movies, of gmod. Press C top left corner to turn of the blue beams, and halo if you are trying to make a movie. its fun, you can get along with people very easily, and badges, and trading card are allso easy. So thats just stuff to refresh you memory. And i highly recommend this game like when you cannot play a certain game because youre graphics card doesnt support it, well you can just download all of that from steam workshop. P3@C3 0UT

review: I love this game. It gives so much freedom to do what ever you want. There are amazing gamemodes and i f you dont like a singleplayer mode with so many things being able to be created or experimented with. Only thing I dont like about this game but wasnt a big deal for me was the fact that you had to buy Counter strike and Half Life 2 to get some of the items that most of the gamemodes require items from. Other then that this is a great game

review: If you can think of it, you can do it. Easily worth $10. I can't write a very in depth review due to the nearly infinite amount of content in this game. If there is something you do not like about this game, there is a map, gamemode, item, playermodel, you name it, that fixes said problem. Final thoughts: If you aren't willing to spend $10 dollars on infinite gamemodes and content, this isn't the game for you.

I always have something exciting to do when I'm in single player ranging from playing with saved duplicates, to making a contraption that does stuff.

review: I'm gonna make this clear. 1. This game is for 10 bucks only, I mean , go get it! 2. The amount of fun you could have, even if you don't have internet connection one day is huge. 3. There's hundreds of thousands of addons, mods, props, gamemodes made by the community, that yo uca naccess only by pressing one button, Workshop. 4. Best game ever, thanks Garry!

review: Pro: Garry's Mod is a good game. People can build their imagination. The tools will be hard to use but sooner or later it will be very easy to process. There are many gamemodes people can choose to play such as : Jailbreak, Deathrun, Bunny Hop, Traitor in Terrorist Town, Murder, Prophunt, and Gun Game. The gamemodes are very fun, people don't discriminate that much anymore because it's common to have anyone play now. Con: You need 100$ extra for textures. ( Or else you will see purple and black checkered textures for some addon and map. ) Games needed : -Team Fortress 2. Free On Steam -Half-Life 2 (Episodes One, Two, Half-Life: Source, Half-Life Deathmatch: Source, Half Life 2: Lost Coast, and Half-Life 2: -Deathmatch are also supported) -Portal 1 and 2 -Counter-Strike: Source -Counter-Strike: Global Offensive -Day of Defeat: Source -Zeno Clash -Left 4 Dead 1 and 2 -Zombie Panic: Source. Free On Steam -Alien Swarm. Free On Steam -Dystopia. Free On Steam -Nuclear Dawn -Age of Chivalry. Free On Steam -Pirates, Vikings,and Knights 2. Free on Steam -D.I.P.R.I.P. Warm Up. Free On Steam -INSURGENCY: Modern Infantry Combat. Free on Steam I highly recommend getting CSS (Counter-Strike Source)

review: Garry's Mod, a game where you can let your imagination run free, and acquire many, many add-ons to make your time there all the more enjoyable. There is seemingly a gamemode for everybody to enjoy, (The gamemodes I usually play are Sandbox, DarkRP, Prop Hunt and TTT) and plenty of servers to keep playing that might have their own custom group of add-ons, allowing you to experiment with new items, that might have you say "Hey, that would be AWESOME to have in my singleplayer!" and then you try it out, and combine it with your other items to have one big collection of some of your favourite game characters, anime characters, weapons, vehicles, NPC's and tons of other cool stuff. In conclusion, all this workshop content that I have been going on about, is what keeps Garry's Mod fresh, new, and one of my favourite games, that I strongly recommend and hope that you give it a try.

There are many different gamemodes on Garry's Mod (nearly too many!) this means you will never get bored of or regret this low price purchase. In a sense this game isnt just one game, it is many packed into one making this one of the best steam games ive ever bought. I could go on forever giving you reasons to buy this game but at the end i would still comment on it the same, this is a MUST BUY and should be in everybody's game library especialy at this fantastic price!

review: If Gmod was something in real life, it would be a blank canvas. This Half-Life 2 mod (Now you can just get TF2 for free so get that if possible) is not a game. Theres no objectives or timers, barricades or save points, you are completely free inside this world. You can make Movies, Games, Cars, Guns, you name it! The thriving Steam Workshop also means you can download to your hearts content. WARNING: THE MORE ADDONS YOU OWN, THE MORE GMOD GETS SCREWED UP! If you can, buy it!

review: 8.9/10 Such an open door for developers of all kinds. The amount of things you can do in Garry's mod, is far too big to post in a review. You can build rockets, stab bystanders, build sleds, or play 'Flappy Garry'. While playing Garry's mod is not competitive, or something to master. You can breath lightly while playing it, and not take it too seriously. When you first open Garry's mod, you will play sandbox, using aspects from other games you can build amazing, or laughable things. The amount of scenarios you can create in sandbox alone, is breathtaking. Yet you have still to discover, many intresting and vastly different gamemodes to enjoy: Trouble in terrorist town, in which you discover the Tratiors, who are killing innocent terrorists in order to win rounds. Roleplay, build houses and and buy cars with the money you get from the money printers you hid from the police. Murder, go around with your knife murdering innocent bystanders, trying to hide your identity. And many, many more... While Garry's mod cannot be called a great game in it's own right. The way it uses aspects from others, and allows you to manipulate and use them, is entertaining. Garry's mod is a game you play on all day, not realising the time. I've racked up not too far short of 200 hours in a couple months, without feeling bored or tired of it at any point.

review: **Quick warning, this game is much more enjoyable if you buy it with the Counter-strike: source pack. You want as many source games as possible when playing this because it borrows models. This game is downright awesome. There are many modes from playing as a traitor and trying to blend in with the civilians waiting to kill them to playing a jail warden commanding the prisoners to follow your orders lest they rebel.

review: "This game is a rainbow of possibilities without limits that will make anyone laugh" Garry's Mod is one of the best humoristic games I've ever played. It consists of a large diversity of different gamemodes which offer many possibilities of adjusting the game to your liking completely. The usage of the Half Life engine is really put to good use in Sandbox but also so many other modes. Because of the community the game remains interesting because of the additions they bring. My favorite gamemodes are TTT, Prop Hunt and Sandbox for sure. But other gamemodes will certainly entertain you, and new gamemodes keep popping up aswell. The downside of the game however is that there is a lot of downloading, you require Counter Strike Source to actually play without having failing textures and errors unless you download it from the internet. Sometimes maps or gamemodes require games that the common person does not own. My final conclusion would be that the game is worth the price, you get a lot of content from that small fee. But remember that if you do not have CSS you will have to go through some copying and pasting. I'm rating this game a well deserved 8.5/10, it uses a lot of other games, so rating it higher would not justify it.

review: This game is epic. Whether you have a vast, creative mind, hungry for building, or a love for shooting things big and small, Garry's Mod is the game for you. With tons of stuff to download from the Workshop, and tons of user-made things in the In-Game interface, you can never run out of stuff to do. You want to fight Alduin with a bazooka? Create a horde of Scouts dangling from a flying saucer? Host a party of Strawberryfish while jamming to a Portal Core that plays music? Ride a raptor into the sunset? Fly a delorean from Back to the Future off a cliff? Have a tea party with Headcrabs? Go for it! Garry's Mod comes with Half Life 2, Source, so you get all the props and weapons to use at your will. It also provides you with the NPC's and vehicles too! You get tons of content for it's astoundingly cheap price, and trust me, it's worth it! Have TF2? You get all the props, maps, backdrops and items! As well as ragdolls for each character! Have Counter Strike Source? You get all the props, maps, backdrops, weapons and items, as well as additional ragdolls! You tempted to buy it yet? Well hold on a minute! You only know the basic parts of Garry's Mod! It features tools such as the Axis tool, Weld, Duplicate, Rope, Winch, Color, Lamp and Bone Poser tools, allowing you to make different structures and creations. In fact, the first thing I did when I got Garry's Mod is build a house out of boxes, and then destroyed it with Alyx's decapitated body! Cool, huh? WELL THATS NOT ALL! You can summon different creatures to fight against, or get SpaceTech's Pet Mod and call zombies to your side! If you like downloading different NPC's and animals, check out PirateCat's stuff! I really recommend the raptors! "Wait!" You say, "This is cool and all, but, what if I just want to drive around in a cool car with my friends?" Hahaha! Well, dear reader, that is possible! TDM Cars, SGM Cars, SligWolf's Vehicles and SCars are a few of the best packs out there that give you amazing vehicles from the sportiest sports car to a fifty foot crane with additional forklifts. Also try out the WAC aircraft pack if you like helicopters and planes. Playing with your friends? No problem. When you go to make a world, you can toggle how many players you want to allow on a server, as well as how many things can be on it [to reduce lag]. Setting it to a local server will stop people further away from joining your server, so you and your friends can play in peace. It is highly recommended that you and your friends have the same addons, because if someone places something that you haven't downloaded, you get a flashing error sign. Unless you like that kind of thing. Garry's Mod features the famous minigames, Prop Hunt, Murder Mystery, Trouble in Terroist Town, Chimera Hunt and Cinema. There are alot more out there like Elevator and GMod Tower, so feel free to download what you want. *Eerie Silence* Well, that about covers it. Now, if you don't mind, I'm going to have a disco party with Wheatley, Lugia, and the JetSet Radio crew, Ta ta for now.

review: This is a very great game and love playing, modding and just plain screwing around in this game. This game is already the best sandbox game I have ever played, and in my personal opinion; this beats minecraft in my book. In this the more games you own the better or you can just grab some mods and fool around with your friends. This was money WELL spent and I recommend everyone with $10 in their account to buy this amazing jewel.

review: This is just one of those games you can play for hours on end and won't get bored. There are soo many gametypes for this game for example some of the most popular at the moment are: Murder, Trouble in terrorist town, Jailbreak, Gmod tower, Sandbox, HL2 and DarkRP and many more - And there are always new gametypes being added. If you buy this game I highly recommend buying and installing counterstrike source aswell because the majority of gametypes use the skins, guns and objects from source (do this to avoid annoying error signs). You can also have alot of fun offline aswell, you can almost build anything in this game, from a speedy car to rocket ship. The steam workshop support aswell is amazing for this game, it is a breeze to download things from workshop, for example you can download cars, tools, maps and even a fully functioning dinosaur as I once did.

review: Pretty damn good sandbox game, multiplayer gamemodes for just about everything from roleplay to DayZ. Modding ability (Which is no doubt implyed by the name) is amazing. The only problem I have with it is my insane connecting time to just about any server, then again that might just be that I'm on OS X and with Australian internet, anyway, get it or Bob will kill you :)

review: its garrys mod so its awsome the only problem is havin to buy other games to have textures so basically if u only buy gmod then the game will be all eroors and no fun but if u get cs and tf2 plus half life then the game will be amazin and u will play it for ages becus of all the dif game types u can play over all its worth it even tho u have to spend around 30 pound to have textures to play everything it doesnt matter the game is fun and time will just pass by with ease if u let it so id suggest buyin it

review: copy and pasted for school comic project Reviews - Garrys Mod Garrys mod is a popular steam game it is very fun and is the latest trend.Garrys mod is a game about randomness and hilarious game modes.From stabbing someone in the back to running round as a can of beer this game has got everything.There are classic game modes such as trouble in terrorist town where there are traitors trying to kill you could it be your close friends? maybe.If that isn't your type of game then theres sandbox create things such as flying cars or roller coaster with the right skill and the right imagination you could create anything.There is even roleplay run round as a cop and shoot bad guys be batman and kill criminals or sell guns in your own store It doesn't stop there , there's more Ever want to kill of a herd of zombies?neither have I but garrys mod gives us the option What doesn't this game have?

review: Garry's mod is one of the best sandbox/community driven games on PC and possible in Gaming. If you are going to buy this, you should buy CS:S with it since many game modes use those textures in it. Sandbox mode is nice, you can do many things in that but many people also love to play on game modes, I would recommend TTT as a nice game mode if you find a good server but the sky is the limit in Gmod gamemodes(actaully it is the engine but eh). There are so many things to be said about this game and this review would go on for pages if you were to explain every single custom gamemode that is on garry's mod and you will get you 10/5/2.5 euro or whatever the price is out of it since there is constantly new content developed on servers. A great game with a good community if you know where to look.

review: As you can see, I've been playing this game for a very long time. This game is one of the best games I've played, and easily goes on my top 3 list. At first, it was hard to get into. A lot of stuff to learn, experience, and do. You decide if that is a positive note or not. Even after 2+ years, I still find myself getting on once in a while, craving that creative side of me that makes me want to build things. This game is not just one thing. This game is many games in one. There are at least 100+ different gamemodes I've played. Most of them are really good. But if you do get this, try not to get sucked into Gmod Tower. It's really addictive. So yes. I really would reccomend you get this game if you're a creative individual looking to do what you want, when you want, without boundaries or limits. The only limit is your imagination.
