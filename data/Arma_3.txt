review: My first game on A3 brought me the most horrific experience I've ever had in any game, ever. We're on our way to the objective, a small dump east of a town occupied by enemy forces. I'm leading a team of 4 men. We come to a crossroad and I sprint across, telling my men to hold back. I cross a few more times, trying to get a response from any snipers. Nothing. I run, my SAW gunner runs, my medic runs. But I kept my Marksman on the other side to make sure we'd make it across. Anybody seen Full Metal Jacket all the way through? Remember the sniper scene? The marksman takes a round in the leg as we're running and goes down. He then takes two more in the chest. The kid who was playing had some mad acting skills, he played it up to 11 here. He screams as he's being shot. Crawling, drenched in his own blood. "SARGE? YOU AIN'T LEAVING ME OUT HERE LIKE THIS, RIGHT? I-I WANNA GO WITH YOU GUYS! C'MON SARGE, H-HELP ME! C'MON! PLEASE DON'T LEAVE ME!" he died after that. I cried and he respawned. 11/10, would recommend getting.

review: This is not a game for people who want fast action movie style gaming, this is a game for people who appreciate the finer things. Having done both military service and picked up MILSIM airsoft as a hobby this game is the closest you will get to what goes on in reality. There are experiences you will have in ARMA 3 that can not be had in COD or BF, experiences that will have you shaking from the adrenaline release. One that comes to mind was a mission to destroy an enemy comms tower, I was squad leader of 8 or so AI:s. As we approached the Comms tower and I told my men to go stealth, no firing unless fired upon. We moved slowly taking advantage of terrain, keeping an watchful eye for enemy patrols. Once the tower was in visual range pace slowed even more and I spent the better part of 30 minutes just looking for enemy patrols and advancing to about 200 meters from the tower. There I positioned my men to cover a wide firing arc as I had spotted quite a few patrols moving in and about the tower. I considered opening fire and probably being able to drop a good portion of the enemy before they could zero in on our position. But a firefight is always a risk, and these AI had been around for a few missions and I had started to anthropomorphize them a bit and secondly I might get hit and killed. As I considered how I would start the engagement a sudden hole opened up in the patrol pattern, I realised the tower is unguarded and I had an opportunity to do something I had not considered. I got up and ran as fast as I could towards the tower, all the time expecting the bullets to start cracking above my head. I kept scanning as I ran whizzling through bushes trying to pick a path that the least visibility to any patrols. After what seemed like far too long I reached the tower and threw out a satchel charge and another for good measure, if one would not bring the tower down it would sure attract attention. I turned around and made my way back, as I closed on my men I started ordering them to fall back, hope growing that I might get out of this alive. Falling back to about 400 meters I finally detonated the satchel charges and the tower fell, from there it was just a short run to the truck and back to Command. I had done it. I had pulled off the perfect mission, not a shot fired and all under my command back alive. That is what this game is about.

review: Oh man. Where to even begin with this one. It would be an extreme disservice to simply call Arma 3 a shooter, as it is so, so much more than that. Arma 3 is a military simulator. This is a distinction that its developers hold sacred and are proud of, and one to which I can attest is completely accurate and deserved. But its even more than that. Arma 3 is a gaming platform, upon which so much has already been and will continue to be built for years to come. At its core though, Arma 3 in a supremely excellent military sim. The graphics are stunning, the gameplay is excellent, the mechanics are solid, and Bohemia Interactive has done an absolutely amazing job packaging this all together. New comers to the Arma series (as I was) may initially be overwhelmed by the games complex mechanics and decidedly different pace from your typical FPS/shooter. Enemy engagements happen at much greater distance than is typical in the genre and are often brief, brutal, and more times than not will conclude with your demise. There is no handholding here. No mini-maps, no enemy UI icons/indicators, no hit markers, no health bars. If you get shot a couple of times, you will find yourself unceremoniously dispatched. While this creates a high barrier for entry and a steep learning curve for new players, it provides a unique and distinctive play style. Situational awareness, cover, teamwork, suppressive fire, and generally moving purposefully and as if your  depended on knowing what was behind the next ridge or hiding in the bushes are paramount to your success. Add to these infantry mechanics the amazingly rendered vehicles, armor, helicopters, and planes, each with their own realistic mechanics to learn and master, and you end up with a truly amazing military simulation experience. Out of the box, Arma comes with a great single player campaign comprised of 3 separate acts, each containing ~12-15 missions. The campaign focuses on a well crafted story of a military conflict that has erupted over Arma 3s two HUGE islands of Stratis and Altis. You play the part of a NATO soldier who finds himself stuck in the middle of a complex engagement. The campaign is rewarding, and challenging. (I have yet to complete it as Im stuck on one mission that I simply cant seem to complete.) However the single-player campaign is FAR from the end of this title. The mission editing tools have allowed this amazing community to develop some absolutely awesome single player missions, all of which can be downloaded free of charge from the Steam workshop and numerous other sites around the interwebs. I would also recommend you check out the supremely excellent full game conversion single player mods Whole Lotta Altis and Dynamic Universal War System which will provide countless additional single player hours and could be completely stand alone titles in themselves. Oh and the multiplayer, oh god the multiplayer. Wasteland, King of the Hill, Invade and Annex, Battle Royale, Breaking Point, so many Co-Op opportunities, the amazing looking upcoming Epoch (currently in closed Alpha). Im sure there are so many others that I havent even discovered yet. Each of these represent COMPLETELY USER GENERATED and totally disparate ways to play Multiplayer within the Arma 3 platform. By purchasing Arma 3, you immediately have access to each of these completely gratis and each could essentially be considered totally separate game. In wrapping up this lengthy review, Arma 3 is an amazing experience and a true accomplishment in game development. It is the only game in recent memory that I can say with confidence that I never get bored with playing. Bohemia Interactive has made it clear that they plan to support this game for years to come, and they have built something amazing on which the possibilities are truly endless. Purchase this game. Purchase it now. Thank me later. (IF YOU DO NOT FIND MY REVIEW HELPFUL, please leave a comment as to why. I welcome the constructive feedback.)

review: Can't tell you if you should buy it or not, but I can tell you this. You will find annoying bugs, highly requested features that isn't there and lack of content if you're not satisfied with what you have. But when you really get down to it, and experience some of the awesome scenarios you can get in multiplayer and custom sp mission, it's something magical you just can't find in any other game. Arma is not a game which you pick up at launch, play the campaign and a bit of mp, and then trow away. You buy it, love it or hate it, and then play it forever or trow it away immediatly. Arma is a game which you can never called finished. There will always be added to it, be it user or official content, fixes, features or optimizations. Hope I expressed myself correctly and that you learned something from it :) If you like realistic shooters and organized large scale multiplayer warfare, this will be your gem! I'll give it a 9/10, simply because: screw bugs, I've used hundreds of hours on Arma 3 that I would never take back. READ: I will not accept random friend requests! If you have a question, please post it in the comments.

review: I have owned this game for a number of weeks now and I have been completely hooked. Great game for the more serious war gamer, not for those who prefer the fast paced combat that you get from Call of Duty series which I consider more for the younger gamers anyway. Arma 3 moves a lot slower and is more squad based than other war games, similar to Battlefield series only slower than that when playing online and you may find yourself on 10 minute helicopter rides just to get into the battlefield and you will be highly satisfied with each kill you make as you know a single round landed by your enemy could be fatal regardless of the weapon they are using. You will have to make good use of any cover you can find and hit the dirt as soon as you hear a bullet crack over your head and then very carefully survey the surrouding area and work out where you are taking fire from as it will usually not be obvious where the fire is coming from and you will find yourself having to hold up for 10-20 minutes in a single location (sometimes longer, I personally have gotten pinned in one location for over an hour) because you are either pinned by enemy fire or it is too dangerous to move forward. You will need to buffer up on your mic communication skills as most players use proper phonetics etc when relaying information to each other on the battlefield such as coordinates and other reconaissance. You can not respawn as quickly as you can in CoD if you are taken down by enemy fire so staying alive is more crucial than any other war game you have played and you wanna hope you are moving up with a squad that has a medic. The graphics are great, the game is a little glitchy at times and the controls take a little getting used to. I recommend buying this game to any serious war game enthusiasts who want to get as close to war as possible (unless doing paintballing or airgunning), and if you do buy the game - I recommend completing the whole VR Tutorial before actually joining a server or playing the Campaign as you will need to really learn all those different keys that may make the difference in a hairy situation in game.

review: If you're coming to Arma 3 as an Arma series veteran, you already know what to expect. For the most part, the game hasn't changed since the last installment, but then it's always felt a little bit like Bohemia Interactive are still building on the groundwork laid back in 2001 by Operation Flashpoint, in the world's longest ever game of 'development Buckaroo'. Thankfully, the whole thing has yet to fall to pieces in any significant manner; it's quite happy to continue wobbling uneasily for now. Arma has a reputation. It's known to be frighteningly obtuse, bewilderingly complex, and often hilariously broken. I can tell you right now that Arma 3 is no different, and absolutely still deserves that reputation. Thankfully, I don't think it's unfair to say that this is the closest an Arma game has come to being 'user friendly'. The controls have been tweaked, and the interface refined a little to accommodate more modern tastes. For these improvements alone, I do recommend it to newcomers to the series over any previous entry. Coming from any other modern FPS game, it will still take a good few hours of what can feel an awful lot like hard work to get to grips with the controls, but I honestly think Arma 3 will see a far lower 'drop-out rate' of newbies who were frustrated to the point of giving up by the previous games. At the time of writing, the elephant in the room is the lack of content available. When compared to Arma 2 (which is handsomely bolstered by an array of official expansion packs), the amount of hardware available to play with is frustratingly slim. In many cases, opposing armies are equipped with identical vehicles which get a slightly different paint job at best. For anyone used to the myriad of variants and oddments available in Arma 2, Arma 3 can feel awfully disappointing. Fortunately, this is alleviated to some extent by the strong mod community. It has long been the case that the best parts of the Arma games are the parts not developed by Bohemia Interactive themselves, and Arma 3 is most definitely continuing this 'tradition'. Nevertheless, I can't help but feel that the game could've done with a few months more time in the oven before full public release. Speaking of the mod community, I think it's criminal that almost none of the best, near-indispensible mods from Arma 2 have been officially integrated. For a self-professed 'war simulator', Arma 3 is hugely lacking in basic features like being able to rest your weapon on surfaces (even with a visible bipod), or tow damaged vehicles. For all its flaws, though, Arma 3 is still a blast to play. If you can find a decent group of like-minded gamers with access to a voice-over-net server, you're in for some of the best gaming you'll ever experience. Sure, you'll probably have to load up on mods to satisfy your need for variety. And sure, sometimes the game will crash spectacularly, or the physics engine will flip out and kill you for standing too close to a wall. But when you're standing on a hilltop, looking out over an enemy outpost with your squadmates while a CAS helicopter strafes an enemy APC and spots targets for a distant sniper team; when everything clicks together in the way that only Arma can manage, you'll be glad to have been along for the ride.

review: I HIGHLY recommend this game for any wanting to see the closest thing to real life combat without actually joining the army. Not only does this simulate real military tactics but provides an excellent window of opportunity for clans to really feel like they are in the middle of a war! Friends can get together and act like the Special Forces team that they all wanted when they were little kids! You can even have roleplaying games and custom games such as Cops and Robbers! This is by far my favorite military game of all time! Sure it takes a while to learn about the dangers of not going prone when an enemy comes by or getting major fatigue in the middle of a firefight but it is a SIMULATOR and by far the best one for military standards. I DO NOT recommend this game for the Call of Duty & Battlefield lovers because there is just no simple "respawn" or "run and gun it" situation this is not built for Deathmatches! It is built to be a simulator that simulates real time combat for the hardcore people! There are no killstreaks/CoD type loadouts/simple respawn or scoreboard. If anyone gets mad because this game is just a simulator I only have one thing to say. THIS GAME IS NOT FOR YOU!

review: If you want to play the best military simulator experience, Arma 3 is your best bet. It has the combat, vehicles, weapons, it has it all. I have played Arma 3 for around 300 hours and it is still fun. There are a variety of different game modes that you can play: such as Wasteland, which is less serious than others; Life servers are for the ones who probably played a lot of DarkRP in Garry's Mod; Insurgency and Domination, they are also good tactically played gamemodes which are sometimes taken a lot seriously. This game gives the feel that YOU are the soldier. YOU are the pilot in that A-164 Wipeout. YOU are the commander of that Hunter GMG. Survive. Adapt. Win. Lovely game, 10/10.

review: "The best sandbox war game of the year" Arma 3 is a continuation to the Arma series by Bohemia Interactive, taken to the next level. With increased player control/movement, enhanced mechanics for vehicles, weapon systems (if you buy it), flight models (if you buy it -_-), and much more! The control in tight spaces should be worked on, this is no call of duty, the controls are clunky, but are a vast improvement over the previous installment (arma 2). Another of the top complaints of this game is the NETCODE. It is terrible under load, but again, is much better than arma 2. This game is mostly open source, Meaning that players are able to change almost every aspect of the game from the amount of fog to adding dinosuars into the game. The things you can do are endless and that is it's selling point. Bohemia Interactive leaves the imagining to you and the community to come up with your own story or missions. This game is heavily supported by the modding community and for good reason. The scripting language for ARMA 3 is .sqf, Based off the C++ coding language, but it seems like a little of everything works. (there is alot of things you can do to make somehting work) I have based 4 years of my life modding and playing arma 2 and arma 3, making this my most played game, by a long shot. The best way to play this game is modded and with friends. By it's self, arma is fun, but somewhat bland, but that seems like that was part of the plan... BI (Bohemia Interactive) made the game as basic as possible to allow you and it's users to change it the way they like it! Do I recommend this game? YES! This game has supplied my friends and I countless hours of playtime with new and exciting missions and firefights, and with a few basic mods it has become 400% better than before. 9.2/10

review: After 1752 hours of gameplay, 3 created mods, and thousands of written code, I can safely say that ArmA 3 is an incomplete game in its vanilla state. I could only recommend this game if it was ~25-30 dollars. The game is missing a lot of promised features - but it's okay, you can get a fraction of them by paying ANOTHER 15 dollars to get the DLC they released. The DLC which has a whopping 2 helicopters. Yay. This games success is built by the community and I view ArmA 3 as nothing but a platform in which to create things - like lego. The AI is terrible. The lack of content is terrible. The developers woud rather release "new V3S's" for DayZ. ArmA 3 has a better engine than ArmA 2 - but lacks everything else. The DLC is helping out with the content problems...but only if you're willing to pay for what SHOULD HAVE been there. I honestly don't know what more to say...If you're on the fence about purchasing ArmA 3 and don't have a group to play with - I would not purchase this game until it goes on sale. tldr: When this game goes on sale for 10 dollars, buy it and it's dlc.

review: The most comprehensive military sim out there, setting you loose on a massive island with all of the weapons, vehicles and scenarios you could possibly wish for. The game itself has remained almost unchanged since the original Operation Flashpoint, released over 10 years ago. However, of all the iterations, Arma 3 is the one that has improved things the most. These aren't big changes, but merely small gameplay tweaks that make it feel more polished and smooth. Graphically, it's convincing. It isn't always beautiful but it gets the atmosphere of a real place just right and the large view distances are key to making it feel ALIVE. You can tell that the developers did their homework when researching the island that this game is based on (Yup, it is a real place). If you don't know anything about this game, the best word to sum it up with would be 'realistic'. You are a single soldier in a large, real-time conflict. You can die from a single bullet or stray shell and alone you have limited influence over how the battle will go. Expect to be crawling through muddy fields or cowardly hiding behind cover as bullets whiz overhead. Don't expect to behave like Rambo and to survive. I wouldn't consider this game 'complete' just yet- for months they have been rolling out updates and patches and at the time of writing, the main campaign is only 1/3 released. That being said, it's the community that really supports this game. Mods like Dayz show how flexible and open-ended the game can be. Really, Arma 3 can be seen as offering an island and great multiplayer support, letting the community come up with the best content. Personally, I haven't spent much time in the large-scale multiplayer side of things. I prefer playing missions with a friend and those experiences have been enjoyable and memorable. Expect a single objective to take a while and for it to get rather frustrating as you die through seemingly no fault of your own. I've also spent a lot of time simply exploring the large island. Yup, on my own, with no NPCs or other players. I love the sights and sounds. I love exploring over the next mountain, or lounging about on a beach, soaking up the digital rays. I don't expect other people to find that fun and neither does the game- the fantastic mission editor simply opens up countless opportunities for you and I chose one of the most dull and mundane simply to see how much enjoyment I could extract from it. The community is what makes this product what it is. They're serious but loyal and will likely be playing this game for years to come. You'll make good friends if you behave in a sensible and team-worthy fashion and thanks to the Steam workshop support there are thousands of mods and maps to download to boost the number of scenarios the game has to offer. Buying this game is an investment. The developers and community have pledged their loyalty to build it into a must-have title, though it could take several years to reach that stage. Don't expect gameplay that's easy to jump in to, nor should you expect a fun standalone experience. But this game is no COD. By default it's not a mainstream game, but the possibilities it offers you are almost endless.

review: This is quite possibly the most emotional shooter I've ever played, and it's not because of the campaign. Crowd around, children, it's story time. One day, not so long ago, my squad had just destroyed an anti-air battery. Our pilot landed, and the rest of the squad boarded one by one. I was about to get in when the rockets started flying. The chopper lifted off, with my pilot saying that he would return in a few minutes. Unwilling to die before then, I rushed to the nearest cover, a small house by a narrow road. I entered to find a ten year-old player who had also been left behind. He explained that he was a sniper and invited me to join his "clan". I politely declined, explaining that my own squad was inbound. As I finished, a Ghost Hawk flew over the horizon. My squad had arrived. This noble child soldier and I were sprinting to the helicopter when the bullets started hitting. The sniper screamed as a 6.5 mm cartridge entered his leg. His shrieks for help were cut short by one final burst of carbine fire as I climbed in the transport. My new friend was dead. 10/10, would experience survivor guilt again.

review: This game had a whole lot of potential based on the early screenshots, but then Bohemia squandered it when they completely changed everything about it. You can find screenshots jam packed with weapons, attachments, camos, characters, and factions that just do not exist in the game solely because Bohemia wanted to go another course halfway through development. That might have been an accpetable option, except Bohemia didn't fully commit. Because of this, a lot of the game is just copy-pasted nonsesne. Almost all vehicles use the same HMGs, GMGs, and auto-cannons with the only difference being the hull of the vehicle. All static weapons such as the mortar, GPMG, and anti-tank/anti-air missile launcher are the same in different camos for the different factions. There's maybe a total of 15 unique weapons in the game, all of which are divided into classes and inside these classes there is no variety. An example of this is the MX and Katiba. These each have their respective variants in the CQB, regular, grenadier, and DMR roles, but each one of them is the exact same. They have the same ballistics, same damage, same recoil, same magazine capacity (even though the MX has a much longer, thicker mag than the Katiba,) and hell, even the same round! Take a look back at ArmA II, you'll notice that each faction has their own ups and downs as far as weapons and vehicles go, but in ArmA III everything feels the exact same and in MANY cases it IS the exact same. They couldn't add a different auto-cannon for each faction, but they sure could add six different fedoras and civilian outfits for you to wear! Another moronic decision on the part of the devs was to place the game in the future WITHOUT actually adding any futuristic content. Any and all futuristic content was scrapped early on in the development process and then they started adding things that "look futuristic." The Merkava replaces the M1A2 Abrams tank in the least sensible move since Jimmy Carter running for a second term, the Bradley is replaced by the Namer, another Israeli tank, and come to think of it, this entire game is a showcase for Israel. This doesn't make any sense at all in the current iteration of the game where it's spread out amongst all factions, but it made a lot of sense in the original story when Israel was annexed by CSAT and CSAT started using Israeli made weapons and vehicles to supplement their Soviet-made equipment from yester-year. This is a great example why they should've committed to the original story rather than stray away from the original path and create this jumbled mess of a game. When you get down to the core of it all, all that matters is the gameplay. Unfortunately, that is horrendous, too. The game feels like they watched Rambo on repeat for six weeks straight because instead of combat being fast paced and short lived like it was in in ArmA II, combat is now based on who is a bigger bullet sponge. Players can routinely take six or seven shots before dying, even two shots to the head sometimes does not kill! Full auto is now glorified and not using it is almost a sin because if you don't you're going to be the one in a body-bag. Seriously, they took a simulator game and turned it into Call of Duty. The encumberance system is another horrible mess. Seriously, your character is not fit for military shape because he can't sprint for more than 20 seconds in full combat load without needing a five minute break, and good luck hitting anything once the enemy has fired a shot in the opposite direction, because your guy is apparently in his first firefight and is already reaching for his entrenching tool to dig all the way to China and is shaking harder than Michael J. Fox with a cold. Another noticable feature of this game is how poorly optimized it is. Seriously, even with a good gaming rig your online experience will be riddled with framerate drops and, at times, outright freeze-framing. All in all, I would not recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of the ArmA series, because what you will find is far and away from the usual experience.

review: i want to love it so so much, but the fact remains that i get over 120 FPS on single player and only 25-35 FPS for multiplayer. i know it's not my fault because my computer is a sexy devil. i know some of it depends on the server. that is a fact yes... but another fact would be "unless your running your own server or playing on a server VERY close to your location, you can't achieve 60 Constant or better, FPS. and i just can't deal with that in 2015. im sure alot of others feel the same way as i do and thats why i cannot recommend ARMA:3 to anybody wanting to server hop around. i would say this game is stricly for single player OR playing a private server with a few of your friends whom live close to you. ^ i will clearify that this is only MY case, so if the above doesnt apply to you , don't rage at me instantly, be happy. because you play servers that you connect to very well. and for that im straight up jelious, if i had one wish it would be to have this game, but with as good as frame rates as arma 2 or even dayz standalone. it literally hurts my feelings that this game is such a letdown. thus all said, if you LOVE arma:3 as much as i do, play some COOP with your friends or play singleplayer. you still get amazing FPS if you have a good computer. however i do not think this game is worth $60, perhaps wait for a massive steam sale. this is my reveiw and i most certainly not recommend ARMA:3 without love for singleplayer/small private servers.

review: If you are an Arma fan, this game will change all that. When you spen 60$ and your computer can't run it, It will be because your computer is crappy. When you are disappointed in the complete lack of content compared to other Arma games, you will be called spoiled. When there is nothing to do offline, no point or story it's because it's still in the works even though it's a full release. When you can't eek out better than 10FPS no matter what your specs, it's because you didn't tweak enough. When you can't find a server to play on it's because you don't know the right clan. When you do get on a server and it lags, greifs and glitches, it's because you play on crappy servers. When you don't think it's realistic, it's not a sim. When you cant have any shoot'em up fun like BF it's because it is a sim. When all your other games run like a champ and are fun but not Arma3, it's not fair to compare. When you voice any of the above views here or the BI Forums you are a liar.

review: Arma is a series that has always had my intense fascination. I cut my teeth on the early Tom Clancy games, Rainbow 6 and Ghost Recon, so I was no stranger to the concept of a hard infantry sim. I've followed Arma since its inception as Operation Flashpoint, and I have grown to love the series like no other. There are portions of Arma 3 that are more boring than watching grass grow, as you sit in vehicles or tromp around on foot for endless minutes. The real meat of the game though, lies in what can turn into thirty seconds to five minutes of pure chaos. Firefights don't have the corridor of meat puppets that games like CoD or other mainstream shooters have to offer. There are no meticulously rendered setpieces. Instead, everything outside of radio chatter might as well be freeform. You draw attention from a chopper while infiltrating a base, they radio out to a mechanized squad that sends an infantry fighting vehicle armed with a 40mm machinegun. The ground churns around you and your own team as fire and shrapnel turn a stealth mission into a desperate fight for survival. These are things that happen in this utterly unforgiving, but satisfying game. This isn't a series for the squeamish, and this surely isn't a series where you expect instant health regeneration while you duck down out of the way from canned enemy fire. You will learn to fear the sound of a faint crack in the distance or the recognizable drone of a gunship approaching. Enemy man, 100m, bearing 045 Ready to fire

review: I'm a huge fan of the series (since the good old operation flashpoint), but now i'm hugely disappointed by what public multiplayer has already become! Arma was a Military Simulator aimed for those who like the genre, 90% of public servers today are RPG. For me Altis Life is the plague of ArmA... There needs to be a forced filter to remove them from the server browser. To get that real 'Arma' experiance nowadays you need to play with friends or join a group/clan... No way to get the real Arma experience on public servers. (Sorry for my poor English)

review: Downloaded Arma, and then opened it. Proceeded to do a horrible tutorial, but after that, it was just beautiful. Opened an RPG server, and ran 2 miles to get to an atm, and ran 2 miles to a shady car salesman. Bought a car, spent the next half hour trying to figure out how to actually get into it. After I finally managed to glitch into it, I underestimated it's ability to travel at light speed, which in turn caused me to crash into a wall. After that, my car was a smoking mess, with a top speed that a sloth could outdo. 10/10 would crash again

review: Arma 3 is a lot of fun. I say this as someone who enjoys the following elements in games that I devote a lot of time to: Extensive, detailed cooperative play, and realism/immersion. If you're going to Arma looking to play the next Counterstrike or whatever, you're going to walk away disappointed. Arma is more of a simulator than a casual shooter, and yes, there is Wasteland which is basically a worldwide deathmatch sandbox, and Arma 2 had DayZ (Which let's face it, is also a boring deathmatch sandbox with the inclusion of zombies), but to get the most out of an Arma game, you need to approach it for its strengths - the simulation aspect. You can play solo as a member of a squad (Depending on the mission - finding good missions can be a little tricky), or command AI using some non-traditional, but with some practice, easy to understand commands and play it like more of a strategy game. In multiplayer, COOP is king in my opinion, but you can have large scale team-vs-team PVP which is a lot of fun as well. I admin a server that runs a large-scale coop mission 24/7 and it never fails to impress and challenge because the AI is smart enough in Arma games to allow for emergent gameplay - they'll flank, they'll fall back, they'll improvise, and it's different every time and you have to think. The engine takes some getting used to compared to the average shooter, but Arma 3 specifically is far less buggy than other Bohemia games have been. Being different isn't a reason in and of itself to dismiss it though. If you're used to other games or approach it like a shooter, you might be annoyed with it, but if you give it time and learn it (and I can't stress enough how important it is to play a good mission in a coop setting to get the most out of it), it's hard to put down. Some of the best gaming experiences I've had have been a product of this game engine in coop with dozens of other people, and you owe it to yourself to give it a shot. Treat it like a strategy game or simulation that has shooting involved, not like a CounterStrike-Of-Dutyfield alike. Also steam sale so why the hell not?

review: I remember playing this game after getting a taste of Arma 2 and i was so disappointed. I joined a Invade and anex server and got killed over and over by the super op aim hack AI. I was just about to rage quit, when one of the server group members asked me if i wanted to join their squad to play with them. They told me what to do and after an hour i got the sweet taste of Arma team play. I joined the group after a while and started playing user made missions with mods and holy . It has been the best year of gaming i have ever had. If you like millitary tactics and teamplay, Arma is right up your alley. It is not like any of the big fps's out there, you don't feel like a action movie super soldier. You feel just as vulnerable as the other guy on the receiving end of your barrel. If you are ever going to play this for the milsim part of the game, get yourself a group to play with. Nr. one advice. I watch this every time I wonder why i play arma and I just want more:

review: Arma 3 is everything that I have ever wanted within a simulation shooter. I purchased it in Alpha and I was completely unaware of the amount of gameplay possibilites! You can go all out and re-create a real life scenario with the simplified editor layout, you could role-play on one of many open world servers, or you could just jump on a CO-OP server and use teamwork to destroy your enemy.. I had never played an Arma game until now and I have no regrets whatsoever for purchasing Arma 3 in Alpha and watching the game progress as it has. You would be a fool to not buy this game during any type of sale!!! The reason I really love this game is because it incorporates three of my favorite games from "years ago". Those games being "Choplifter", Arma 3 has an AMAZING 3D Version with so many more options and settings and you can carry actual players and fuel/damage/ammo...ah, so good. The first game I played, some guy was screaming at me to get in the chopper, and as we arrived to the LZ I heard the pilot say, "Good Luck guys", and I was completely blown away!! I thought that it was an AI pilot! The second, "Black Hawk Down" for pc from like 99', the PVP is so much similar but way better. Last but not least, "Battlezone2", that was my favorite game of all time as a kid with custom base building and defending your base. I recommend finding a community as soon as you get into Arma 3, you will instantly become immersed into the game with a full community of people from all around the world. Arma 3 is a great action packed shooter with lot of simulation aspects, a ton of different gamplay styles and gametypes, and a great place to make friends that will take you to a new level in the Steam community. More friends more fun..... WIN WIN! And the Mods! End of Story..... See you in the battle soldiers! Be sure to get it before 2015 rolls around, "Make Arma Not War" is going to add so much and I have high hopes for the future of Arma 3.

review: So where do I start!! Review is below please read all before passing judgement :) I'm so so so disappointed :( I bought a PC again after a massive 8 year PC break when I moved to console in very late 2006 . I bought an Xbox 360 which I owned for almost 6 years then only 13months ago I moved too XBox One had it for 4 months and thought get rid of this piece of junk and use the money I get and put it towards a new Gaming PC so june this year (2014) I bought a PC. Anyway so I bought a PC with one thing in my mind "Yes it will be like the old days I will join back up with my clan" I was with almost 7 years ago. I enjoyed countless hours days weeks years with the lads on Operation Flashpoint : Cold War, Arma and then Arma 2. I was in the AirCorps for them "GOL" clan they are called so I signed up for them cause I forgot my password (come on its been 7 years ago) and used the same name as I was back in 2006 ish 'GOL Tactical' I thought wow its been that long I was wiped from there system :) Anyway LT Chris didnt know how I was so I mentioned a few names to him and that were old clan memebers and he stopped talking for a split second "are its you Bloody knife" (which was my original name before changing to GOL Clan when I )was expected) The guy that made me start an AirCorps. I was so excited to be back sadly most of the old memebers werent around (god I sound like a child Im' 25). Sorry for all the text above :) I just wanted you/people to know that I've played Arma before for alot longer than most 7 years straight. I bet most reading this didnt know about Operation Flashpoint was originally part of the same team that is today currently making Amra still today. Anyway present day 30/12/2014 The Review I'm sorry but the Arma I grew up to love is just not the same Arma! Arma 3 is like to me the Call Of Duty of today every childs dream, its the game that they must have otherwise your not cool etc although that last statment isn't true for Arma franchise it only came extemely popular in like 2007 to early 2008. Thats how much I love or sould I say loved Arma it was my goto game whenever I was bored I would talk about Arma when I was at school when I was with anyone, as soon as I got in Lets play Arma whenever I had spare time Lets Play Arma I even bunked/skipped days of school to play more. I just didnt get bored of Arma or Arma 2 or Operation Flashpoint Cold Assault if I'm honest it consumed all of my early teens and into my late teens. Yes a full 7 years of my life I was coming up to be 19 and on my birthday I bought a Xboxb 360, go and read the above for a full discription :) So the Arma I knew was a realistic military simulator the best simulator infact but Arma 3 what have you done you've gone slightly futurisitc. Why? Its a military sim how can you simulate something that isnt even made yet keep it with the real life stuff that is used today you at least in my eyes have ruined my childhood game thanks Bohemia Interactive and 555 games thanks a bunch. It isnt all bad though its just because of my history with the game as you can tell they are many happy customers giving good reviews. But if Arma 1 and 2 and 2.5 is anything to go by hopefully they are modders out there that feel the same way as me and remove all the futuristic stuff and replace with Real Equipment Weapons etc that are used today If you got this far thanks for reading and dont base the game of my review its just because of my history with the game. The core components are there with what I can assume is realistic simulation its just not me furturisitc stuff in a Simulator you cant call it a sim in my eyes anyway. So as you can tell I dont recommend this game. Even the it almost hurts to say it : (

review: This game offers a lot. And I mean A LOT. You can download endless missions made from the community workshop and play with strategy with your friends or run around half naked and dance around. Or you could roleplay and buy an ATM from all the drug money you earned in Altis Life. Or have races with friends in Karts. This game is an Army Simulator, but it's great for modding which let's you do more things. Now, this game isn't something like COD or Battlefield, it takes strategy and tactics and patience. If you come from these games it will be harder to get into fast. Although if you play through the campaign it will help you get used to the game. Please don't think the warfare in this game is just pew pew pew, die, respawn, repeat. It takes skill. Altis is a very big map, you can drive around for what seems like forever in this beautiful map. There is forestry, a lot of ocean, desert, grassland, etc. There is also Stratis, a smaller, more wastelandish and deserty than Altis. You need a good PC to run this game. I usually get around 45 fps on online servers, around 60 on single player or games with small amounts of people in it. Overall, this game has a ton of things to do and you can't get bored of it. I give it a 9.5/10

review: Welcome to the future, where 30 years from now current weapons and equipment such as the MATV,Fennik,IWI Tavor and Negev,Cheytac .408,M14 EBR,Merkava battle tank and littlebird will still be in use with different names and no real world upcoming technologies such as power armor,airburst launchers, VTOL aircraft, and infantry HUD will have any presence on the battlefield what so ever. Also weapons cancelled years ago such as the Commanche helicopter will be readopted generations later and renamed to avoid copyright issues. Enjoy a convulted control set up where in the heat of battle you will enter the steam control panel,trying to set a machinegun to auto fire will reset to semi when entering a truck or changing weapons or enjoy running over a chicken wire fence with a multi-ton truck will disable it to a halt. Also enjoy advertisements in game to buy over priced DLC if you move near some of the helicopters that cost 16 USD when the devs got drunk and thought they were devs programing pay content for World of Tanks or Warthunder. Don't buy unless you want to play the userbase made game modes suxh as Wasteland,King of the Hill, or Breaking point, the only thing worth playing with this software.

review: BESTEST GAME EVER SINCE BATTLEFIELD2! yes, I said it =) If you played BF2 and you loved it, but hated all its successors... Arma3 is the deal. This game is what should`ve followed BF2, it`s pure, awesome, tough and unforgiving warfare. It`s NOT made for easy (or rather noobish) play, you can`t run for a mile and expect to be able to shoot straight the instance you stop running; you can`t either fly your AttackHelicopter slamming into trees and buildings along the way and expect to be alive... ArmA does not do that, you die, you get hurt, in any case, you do stupid stuff... you will pay for it. It`s a Mil-Sim, not an Arcade-Shooter like all the other "tripleA" titles out there: you want a challenge? - get ArmA3! you want realistic movement? - get ArmA3! you want realistic weaponshandling? - get ArmA3! you want honest (!) and hard working developers? - get ArmA3! you want a game with HUNDREDS (or more) mods to chose from as you like? - get ArmA3! you want your own skill to be the baseline on how your play has influence on the battle/game? - get ArmA3! By all the good stuff mentioned, it`s only fair to tell about bad/unfortunate things Arma3 offers: This game needs a good CPU, not an ok one, a good CPU... and a fair amount of tweaking to get it run somewhat smoothly. And for MultiPlayer: Client`s performance is dependant on Server`s performance, you can have a beast computer, but if the server you play on sucks, your fps will suck aswell. You`ll have to learn this game before you can be really good at it... and then when you`re good, Arma3 is deeply satisfying. Just for personal comparison: I now have more hours of Arma3 playtime (1500h+), than ALL hours of ALL Battlefields I`ve played over the years combined! Thats the message, yes =) AND IT DOESNT GET BORING YET!!!

review: Game requires several gigabytes of modding to be playable. Gun sway is obnoxious, optical glare is like looking through an instagram beer glass and although in real life soldiers can carry up to 40kg in a firefight, the characters lose stamina and said gun sway worsens to musket-levels of pinpoint accuracy. Not to mention there is actually no stamina bar or notification, you simply hear him moan incessently. The game is expensive and some of the vehicles and equipment in the game is classed as separate DLC's which you need to buy to pilot or use. Despite the hefty price of Arma 3, you can expect the ratio price of the DLC's to be roughly 20 percent of Arma 3's original cost. The helicopter DLC, for instance, contains only two helicopters and a "realism" mode which worsens your ability to fly for your viewing pleasure. They, the creators of a military simulator, also randomly brought in a DLC that lets you race around in a go-kart. No, I don't know why either. You can indeed exchange attachments on weapons except bipods and front-grips - no one really knows why they discriminated. Not to mention said bipods serve absolutely no purpose and without a mod you cannot deploy your weapon on any environment be it bipod, edge of a window or bonnet of a car. The body armour does indeed seem to affect your lethality but again there is no indication anywhere what is more armoured and what is less armoured., what weighs more, what weighs less. Many of the "futuristic" weapons on Arma 3 are actually cancelled weapons systems deemed inferior in real life (AH-99 Blackfoot) or don't actually exist (such as T-100 Varsuk) making the game incredibly peculiar. It's also extremely difficult to host a server for your friends to play and will require third-party software such as a server host plus hamachi or equivelant software. The experience is stunningly frustrating and can easily consume three hours of your time learning the game's scripting language simply to run the game or create a respawn point. Queue irritating slurring youtube tutorials by semi-conscious d1ckh3ads who can't get to the fuc king point. Buildings are only superficially destructible, they won't crumble but they will undergo scripted morphing turning magically into ruins.Tanks can also be defeated by a farmer's three foot stonewall. Yes. And collisions cause the game physics to dart you away hundreds of metres even in a tank sometimes. Overrall I would rate this game as being lower than the temperature of outer space. Arma 2 including its DLC'S have major flaws but the replayability is immense and covers actual modern weapons. And whilst Arma 3 experienced the longest most buggy alpha-staging in Earth's entire gaming history, Bohemia's employees were arrested for espionage because they thought it would be smart to send two work employees on tourist visas for a little bromance "coincidently" where they were basing Altis on and started taking pictures of actual military bases there. What the fu ck were they thinking? Ridiculous, ludicrous. Don't buy this game. The Iranian soldiers also look like bugmen or bumble-bees.

review: Adolf Hitler (German: [adlf htl]; 20 April 1889  30 April 1945) was an Austrian-born German politician and the leader of the Nazi Party (German: Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei (NSDAP); National Socialist German Workers Party). He was chancellor of Germany from 1933 to 1945 and dictator of Nazi Germany (as Fhrer und Reichskanzler) from 1934 to 1945. Hitler was at the centre of Nazi Germany, World War II in Europe, and the Holocaust. Hitler was a decorated veteran of World War I. He joined the German Workers' Party (precursor of the NSDAP) in 1919, and became leader of the NSDAP in 1921. In 1923, he attempted a coup in Munich to seize power. The failed coup resulted in Hitler's imprisonment, during which time he wrote his memoir, Mein Kampf (My Struggle). After his release in 1924, Hitler gained popular support by attacking the Treaty of Versailles and promoting Pan-Germanism, antisemitism, and anti-communism with charismatic oratory and Nazi propaganda. Hitler frequently denounced international capitalism and communism as being part of a Jewish conspiracy. Hitler's Nazi Party became the largest elected party in the German Reichstag, leading to his appointment as chancellor in 1933. Following fresh elections won by his coalition, the Reichstag passed the Enabling Act, which began the process of transforming the Weimar Republic into the Third Reich, a single-party dictatorship based on the totalitarian and autocratic ideology of National Socialism. Hitler aimed to eliminate Jews from Germany and establish a New Order to counter what he saw as the injustice of the post-World War I international order dominated by Britain and France. His first six years in power resulted in rapid economic recovery from the Great Depression, the denunciation of restrictions imposed on Germany after World War I, and the annexation of territories that were home to millions of ethnic Germans, actions which gave him significant popular support. Hitler actively sought Lebensraum ("living space") for the German people. His aggressive foreign policy is considered to be the primary cause of the outbreak of World War II in Europe. He directed large-scale rearmament and on 1 September 1939 invaded Poland, resulting in British and French declarations of war on Germany. In June 1941, Hitler ordered an invasion of the Soviet Union. By the end of 1941 German forces and their European allies occupied most of Europe and North Africa. Failure to defeat the Soviets and the entry of the United States into the war forced Germany onto the defensive and it suffered a series of escalating defeats. In the final days of the war, during the Battle of Berlin in 1945, Hitler married his long-time lover, Eva Braun. On 30 April 1945, less than two days later, the two committed suicide to avoid capture by the Red Army, and their corpses were burned. Under Hitler's leadership and racially motivated ideology, the regime was responsible for the genocide of at least 5.5 million Jews, and millions of other victims whom he and his followers deemed racially inferior.

The game never had a lot going on for a while but with all the fine tweeking Bohemia have done and are still doing which in turn is allowing some really fantastic mods to either port over form Arma 2 or Ones that are completely new come onto the scene. With all the current DLC and the Marksman DLC on its way plus the winners of Make Arma Not War announced there has never been a better time to get on and get stuck in. Whether its life you're into, base building on Wasteland/Epoch or just blowing and shooting the hell out of stuff on King Of The Hill, If zombies is your thing try Breaking Point (These being the most popular) , If you cannot find something you like then you are doing it wrong. But i will not sugar coat it too much but it can be a steep learning curve for those new to the game and yes there are performance issues for some and it can be a challenge for some rigs but the game is still good at 30fps or dare i say it even 25(from personal experience). There are many forums with tips, tweeks and setups that can help you get the most from your Arma experience. It may take a little bit of time but it is worth it.

The bullets snap and whiz around you. There are many choices of vehicles to choose from all with different roles and abilities. Kinda wish there were more guns that's just my opinion but the fewer choices bring simplicity in the game. The underwater subs and scuba suits are also very awesome, totally wished they had sharks that would bring some thrills. Also the graphics over all are sexy all over, pleasing your eyes with ic glee.

I pant and gasp as I struggle to wade quickly through the grass, as I carry many grenades on my back. That's not the most of my worries, though. My team and I are planning to back up a team to attack and control Gina, a village just up the forest. My CO talks urgently through his radio. "Jackson...Jackson, do you read? What's your location?" The team leader panics, and exclaims we push on with the mission even though the second team will not respond. We pull around a corner and find ourselves trapped between two ridgelines. A collection of friendly bodies lay infront of us. "Damnit, Jackson's down! Doc, go check on him, the rest of you, covering fire!" It's a scenario that is frequently played out in many shooters, although in this scenario, it was different. We had the disadvantage, we were trapped, and the enemy was hundreds of meters away from us. We could not tell where the bullets where coming from, and we had to stay down low and hope we weren't hit. This is realistic combat; probably the best I've played. Even in a game that seems like a buggy, glitchy and poorly made simulator, I felt far more immersed then every other war game I've played. The graphics, for such a large scale in this game, are stunning. Compared to Arma 2, the movement, lighting, and weapons systems are all vastly improved. The sheer amount of content such as mods and other tools and missions in this game are vast, and I feel like it was perfectly worth the 60 dollars I dumped on it. This game is possibly the best war based video game I've played.

review: There is a notion of this game i can't figure out. This game is an all around mess and an all around success in all aspects. Many call it a finished product and a BLAST to play and some call it an unplayable mess which involves complete "hyper realistic fails". So who is right? Well, this game appeals to both an arcade style audience willing to get action and combat at extreme levels and also to the hardened clan fighting veteran focused on mods which improve gameplay and add features to the game to improve and keep game experiences fresh. In this game however, having played it for solid hours on end, these moments which I had did not come naturally. For a game to acheive its scale and realism to levels as in ARMA 3 is by no means accepted to all in this generation. Not trying to put my old man cap on here but to play games like DayZ and ARMA you can't expect double kills and planes and cars to appear at the spawn. The PMC's of advanced warfare didn't appear in the army for just being strong and chosen. To play ARMA, it is the same as DayZ (although not as boring) and all "running simulators". And I don't mean to scare you by saying to have to run to Pygros from Kavala with broken legs. What I mean is the same principle that you DON'T start as a badass, and if that is your playstyle just don't play it or convince yourself that you can take the heat. Stories have to be made with extreme disiplinary acts in this game. And how do you get those? Well here are the steps. 1. THIS GAME TAKES SOME ING BALLS TO GET WHERE YOU NEED TO GO. This can always be avoided (LOL not really) some way or another through the vast expanse of gamemodes like wasteland, and joining a realsim unit is all acceptable for even the hardest MLG sniper to learn what this game is about. But this part cannot be let go. In parts where the game is about serious progression, you CAN'T be the one crying for someone to give you a chance because you are being a little  cat. To be the general, you gotta go through West Point first. 2. THIS GAME WILL BRING YOU DOWN TO YOUR ING KNEES AND WILL ALWAYS  WITH YOU. So, how do not let this happen? Well you really ING can't. It all happens in a matter where if you are in the right place at the right time which perfectly demonstrates how this game IS SUPPOSED TO BE. This is why you need to be with a team of people who know what they are doing and know exactly WHAT THE HELL is going on, or be daring and be alone, being a target, and dying. Just like in an animal world. So treat it like that. Hunt or be hunted, kill or be killed, the strong only survive. Because this is no FPS that you have ever seen and before buying this, you have to know what is coming for your soul. Oh, but I have decided to roast your  again by saying that this game is amazing fun. "Oh, but you said it took a long time and was boring." 3. SHUT THE HELL UP AND LISTEN TO ME. Because if you don't you will die. This game, has changed my perspective on what it is. Well, what is this game? What does it offer? What are you in for? To be honest, this game is really a test of mentality. This game is really to see what you do in dire situations of disaster, catastrophe, military occupation, and survival. This can tie in to thinking of this game as an animal world like I said before. To live, you have to be familiar with your surroundings, familiar with the weapons, and all around just knowing WHAT THE  YOU ARE DOING. Because this game is never merciful and is always working against you as said in my other steps above. So how can you alter this? You can't. You can't change the future. You can't CHANGE your actions in this game. Because it defeats the whole purpose.

review: ArmA III, the fourth game in the ArmA series, if we include the original Operation Flashpoint as well. Many mainstream 'FPS gamers' complain about ArmA's style, because it's unique? That's exactly why I love this game. You really have to find patience and a learning curve to this game. But once you have control over the game, you'll find tons of enjoyable content. You'll find yourself playing around with the editor, campaign with great storyline, 2 beautiful islands to explore, customizable gear, multiplayer fun as well as serious gameplay. What else do you want? Yeah it might have some bugs and lag. But, if you look back at ArmA 2, not many complained about it though ArmA 3 is highly improved from the previous title. ArmA is a huge game that you will be playing for years to come. You'll always find ways to emerge into ArmA's gameplay. It's ultimately up to you to be creative. Because of Bohemia Interactive's hard work on unique warfare gameplay, and immersive experience, I'd give it 9/10 :)

review: After building on their signature game engine Bohemia has truly put forward a simulation gem with Arma 3 that no other game franchise has even come close to matching. This is where you hit the dirt, and find that bullets aren't all warning shots, and that the blood on your face can't be waited out, but that bullets will kill you, and that you'll have to wipe that blood off yourself. While it still isn't the most stable engine a game has run on, it's the most advanced one I know of, with all the trimmings of environment that effect the battle and without all the crashes of Battlefield 4. Bohemia has brought the Arma series to it's highest point ever, and it's playability has been increased 200%. I can't reccomend this game to everyone, but there's one great lesson learned in my time with Arma; I've ended missions in other games seemingly covered in blood, wearing a bandana and sporting no shirt but instead a big sculpted chest and a BFG in each hand... And yet, I'd rather I could just make it home with a mission well done and all of my team safe and sound... This is what Arma is... It's fighting a real fight, where you have to pace yourself and hold your breath, where a bullet in the face can kill a man regardless of whether he's controlled by a player or an AI. It's using your map, intel and wits to determine the best angle of attack on an enemy position, and sighing in relief when you find out later that you picked a good entry point. It's being truly tense, when you lie hiding in the bushes, hoping the MRAP with a GMG turret didn't spot you when it's lights passed over you, and hoping that you can get everyone home safe at the end of the day. Hundreds of hours into this game, I have yet to be bored even on the most patiently conducted sniper missions. There's a satisfying reward in every mission in this game, and maybe that's because you really have to work to make it out alive. Seriously, put on your boots because as far as a game goes, this is as close as it gets. This is Arma, and there is nothing else like it. ~Valtros

review: I've never played any ARMA before ARMA 3. I really didn't know what to expect. I was somewhat, bewildered, you could say. This game is a pretty difficult one to learn. Even as i'm still learning the game, there is a never a moment I regret buying this title. 100% worth it, good quality, good community(modding community as well), and excellent gameplay. What are you waiting for?? Buy this game, and be amazed by its wonders.

review: Easily my favourite game right now. While there is less content than ARMA 2 right now, BIS is continually adding more. This game is definitely not for your typical CoD kiddy as it takes patience and strategy which all adds into the experience. The biggest thing for me is that this is a community game. BIS has simply provided a platform where the community makes limitless mods and missions for the user to enjoy. Speaking of mods, THEY ARE AWESOME! Anything from radio mods, to sound mods, to vehicle and weapon additions, and even entire new maps and game mods (there's even a mech warrior mod). The immersion in this game is great and I would highly reccomend taking the time to join a community. Doing this, you'll gain access to the real ARMA experience and not Atlis Life/Wastelands. Community events are great and there's basically one out there that would suit any player. Lastly, this game supports multiple control inputs which is a HUGE plus for me. For example I have essentially 5 control inputs: keyboard, mouse, Track IR, joystick/hotas, and steering wheel/pedals. They all work seemlessly together and allow for some really awesome configurations. For example, the pedals are tri-purpose. I use them for the obvious brake and gas while driving but I additionally use them for analogue leaning as infantry and rudder pedals while flying.

review: Metascore doesn't do this justice. If you're wired to get involved with a simulator/game like ARMA3, you're in for some good stuff... Be prepared for hours of mission creation editing for minutes of 'Damn that was cool'. When you start scripting and remotely enjoy it...now you're !@#$ cause you're hooked for more hours of editing for minutes of 'Damn that actually worked...Awesome!' Once you start Subscribing and playing missions created by other seasoned ameture/Big League Arma editors, then you're like 'That was !@#$ Insane' and you realize you don't know !@#$ about editing yet. You might as well tack on another few hours, cause you're back to the drawing board enhancing and creating more missions. Great Game Gents! 11/10

review: *HIGHLY RECOMMENDED* This is one of the best Strategy Action Simulators i have played since ArmA II. Looks beautiful if you have top range PC. One Downside is that it is highly intensive on your CPU and I cannot recommend this for low end computers/laptops. You never run out of things to do, due to the Steam Workshop and Level Editor where mahy people create great game types and areas for combat. I give a 9/10

review: Recommending this game is a no-brainer. If you are even marginally into shooters with a nag for realism Arma 3 is inevitable. The game won't let you in easily; it has a steep learning curve, and starting out can be quite frustrating. Also, you are less likely to find good public servers; it hardly is hop-on and play like CoD or Battlefield. The best way to experience it is in a clan or community group. Bottom line, go get it. It's unique, in every aspect.

review: One of the best / my current favorite game. The amount of mods/online modes available is ridiculous. If you're into the realism & being strategic/tactical then this game is definitely for you. It's not your average run & gun FPS like COD & BF, so be warned. It takes a while to get the hang of the game mechanics & learn how to use everything properly because it IS a simulator.

review: For players who have never played arma and go into this game with no expectations, it's okay. The game works for that. But, for people with expectations for this game, (for example, arma 2 fans) it is completely unacceptable. The game completely dwarfs all previous arma games in many aspects. The graphics and engine are much better. It has a great core, with great potential. But that, sadly, is all it has. The game itself has to have been rushed. On the official release day, it was in the state of an alpha game, and still feels like a beta for most people. The game had an actual alpha and beta on steam, but from the player's point of view, not much changed between alpha and release day except for a few new assets and the main map being released. It never should have left the alpha, and the problem is that bohemia doesn't seem to have admitted to even themselves that their game came out unfinished. From release day, they have been treating it like a final product, with only a few small polishes and fixes needed. This is beyond the exact opposite of how it actually is. On release day, it was laughably broken. It had the most bugs I have ever seen in a game, and felt like a joke. Now, after 1.5 years, many obvious bugs have been ironed out. I can say that the very surface game experience is acceptable. The problem today is that while they fixed some of the basic gameplay issues, about 40% of the features feel unfinished, but that is coming from someone with 1000 hours of experience. As I said, the surface experience is acceptable, but if you REALLY start playing, you will notice inexcusable holes in the experience. Along with all of this, the game is set in 2035, so none of the objects in the game are real, and at best partially resemble real things. The NATO and AAF factions are okay, but the CSAT faction, the only opfor faction available, looks terrible. The CSAT people literally look like aliens, and I get depressed every time I see one of them. What was bohemia thinking? Why would you put space aliens in a military simulator, especially ARMA? Atleast put terrorists, or north koreans, or normal russians, but space aliens? This is very controversial, especially for a military simulator, in particular arma. Currently, the helicopters DLC costs 15$. The game shipped with only a few helicopters, so it was good to hear that they were addressing this. It was sad to hear they were charging 15$ for something that should have been included with the game, but I could live with that. What really set me off is that for 15$ you get only TWO helicopters. Yes, 2 helicopters that you should already have for 15 dollars. With the arma 2 OA expansion, we literally got more assets than arma 3 will probably ever have for 20 dollars. Now we pay 15 dollars for 2 helicopters. Currently, from what I can see, Arma 3 is doomed. They are going to continue charging money for each baby step towards a finished game, and with that, only make a few baby steps, and then run off with the money. The only DLC remaining will be a DLC called marksmen which adds 7 weapons, all of which I've played with, and most of which look like laser guns, almost as bad as the CSAT faction. Bohemia also has a interesting DLC model which makes the DLC more like updates with certain assets you can't play with unless you buy the DLC. This will mean marksmen comes with an upgraded weapon system and 3 vests all of which everyone gets, but ingame the core DLC items are unusable without paying. There may also be an expansion way after the marksmen dlc comes out, but nothing has been confirmed about it. TLDR: Arma 3 is a dissapointment for real arma fans because holes in the general experience, not enough stuff and weird art style not appropriate for military simulators.

review: ARMA 3 is a game in a class of its own and defines the genre of tactical military simulations. One of the greatest benefits is the modability and vast amount of user created content, that can be implemented in this very open sandbox. The first part of the campaign "Survive" showed that Bohemia Interactive made their game also interesting for singleplayer, but the true strength of ARMA 3 is for sure the multiplayer. Don't get me wrong - this game needs a certain level of dedication to get the maximum out of it, casual players probably won't get happy. If you want a unique mod- and mission-setting you cannot just create a game and simply "hop in". Hosting a MP-server with mods, creating MP-missions that work flawless with mods - all of this stuff can be quite complex and hard to be learned by one person alone. But if you decide to join a group or community that suites your style of play (action-, hardcore-simulation-, roleplay-orientated or somewhere in between) then you might get a most interesting and challenging game experience.

review: This game has turned from something with potential in a big bag of festering feces, but the worthless immature underage scum that represents the customers doesn't even know better, of course. Like all ArmA games it is a Military Sim. Unlike Arma 2 or the great Operation Flashpoint 1 where most features (Infantry/Vehicle/Air vehicle) worked pretty well, here you have a bit from everything but nothing is polished or smooth. To be honest, the only difference from the Beta that we Preorderers had access to (ages ago) are some new vehicles and weapons. Not even that many that it would matter. The animations stutter and the vehicle driving and physics at all are a joke which is all due to poor coding. The only thing that is good is the singleplayer campaign but after all this is a Military sim which is meant to be played in Multiplayer. I don't want to play against the AI, first of all because the ArmA AI has and always will be horrible and secondly because I want to play against other players and not placeholders. The multiplayer is pretty much unplayable as well and its not getting better. 70-90% of all populated servers are Roleplay servers running the Life mod. The other 10-30% are a tiny bit of survival-sandbox-deathmatch Wasteland servers and some foreign community servers running tons of mods. I also don't want to download 10 gigabytes of unneccesary third party community mods and try installing them for 4 hours because I neither want to garbage my computer up nor do I find unneccessary and poorly made mods needed to play the game.  the steam workshop. I find it ridiculous how they praise their "revolutionairy new" game mode called ZEUS and then don't even make official servers with that game mode (or others) for the players available. What I preordered a year (?) ago? Some overhyped successor game of Arma 2 that pretended to have every feature "work in progress" and to be something completely new once the features are done. What I got after all features are supposedly done? Arma 2 poorly converted into a new engine with new animations, a (ridiculously bad) physics engine and unfinished, unpolished features. I feel ripped off and am very angry at the devs. I will not buy a game from those lying, lazy and greedy a-holes again. If anyone related to the dev team reads this, I hope you feel proud contribooting to the cancer that is killing the video game industry.

review: ArmA2 has much more content and is far more realistic (only medic can heal and it takes a while, weapons acting as real life counterparts, in ArmA3 everything is 'balanced' and you can self-heal in 3 seconds by clicking a proper button). ArmA2 has also more vehicles, more weapons, more everything... really, there is nothing to go for ArmA3 except a bit better graphic, but this is hardly anything important, especially because ArmA2 looks not much worse. Moreover it's been over three months since the release date and the game still has unfinished campaign and terrible AI bugs. You don't have to take my word for it, watch a video:

review: I really, really wanted to love arma 3. But i just can't deal with it anymore. 80+ hours I've spent in the game and it just feels like wasted time. Yes, the graphics are vastly improved, but that comes with a lot of sacrifices. Firstly, you have to have about fourteen gtx titans to run this game properly. I have a pretty decent pc (most games at high/max settings) yet Arma just does not want to play smoothly. I get about 30fps in arma 3 and although that's perfectly playable, the framerate drops and it is a pain to play. "I'll just ignore the framerate drops", i said to myself. "So what if it drops, it's a great game" but the game consistenly crashes. It just happened to me in wasteland, right behind someone with top gear and bam. Arma3.exe has stopped working. It's not like this is an occasional thing either, it happens at least once every time I play. And don't even get me started on the driving, its like trying to wade a kite through custard, seriously. Also, the fact theres about 3 (ok maybe more) guns really annoys me. There's about 3/4 assault rifles and they all perform pretty much the same, there's no quirks with each, they're all just.. bland. That goes the same for pretty much every weapon class. That's without me mentioning the fact none of them are liscensed or have official names. I know its a "futuristic" world, but I much prefered the ak47's, Pkms, m4's etc of arma 2. Have i mentioned the fact only one campaign episode has been released? It's not like arma fans have been waiting for this for years or anything and bohemia take MONTHS to release not the campaign, but a campaign episode. Seriously? In my opinion arma 2 is a mechanically better, smoother and more fun game. My advice, play arma 2 for another year or so and wait for Bohemia to sort their BS out. Arma 3? Me no gusta.

review: I really hate to say this, but you should wait to get this game until BIS gets it finished, assuming that happens. The reader should realize that I have almost 2000hrs in ArmA2. The 600 or so listed on my profile here is just since it got added to Steam and doesn't count the time pre-Steam. So, as someone who plays exclusively with friends on listen servers, not on big public servers. As someone who plays mostly CTI maps (remember those BIS?), and as someone who spent most of those almost 2000hrs flying CAS in a jet (remember those BIS?), .......I can honestly say that I'm rather let down by ArmA 3 and it makes me very sad. The interface has always been clunky from way back in OFP and before. The new backpack system seems to me to just be a reskin of the same thing. It does indeed make it a bit easier to use being able to drag and drop stuff (novel!!), and while I appreciate the work here.....I'd rather have seen the time spent on other things. To be fair, two of the devs DID spend time locked up in Greece for a stupid reason. I think it was 11 months? This is something that is strictly forbidden to speak of on their forums for some odd reason. But, I understand this had a huuuuuuge impact on their development cycle as it was their two LEAD devs as I understand it. I get the feeling that they got back, and shoved development through in order to compete with the (then) new BF and CoD releases. I personally feel this was a huge, quivering pile of mistake. Because......they aren't really in competition with those games!!! It'd be like saying that chess competes with checkers and monopoly. All board games sure but vastly different. Same here! ArmA II was all about trying to make the game more of a military simulator. Though I think they had to admit some limitations here and there with the tech of the day without making the engine only playable on super computers. ArmA III seems to go away from this and I think it's trying to compete even more now with those other games in some ways.....maybe I'm wrong? It just doesn't feel like the team is as worried about realisim any longer. For me, the fact that it's set in 2035 is a HHHHUUUUUUUGE turn-off and almost a game breaker right there. That, and there's ONE jet in the game thus far.....one AND it's some old trainer POS to boot.....nice.....well guess this confirms my hunch I've had for a while now. BIS seems to hate fixed wing like Blizzard hates melee! It's all about rotary wing! Which is fine and dandy unless you need an A10 or a Spooky. By 2035 we assume naturally that these have been phased out, so where are their replacements? Hell, at this point I'd be happy with an F15 that I can just fly and do stand-off attacks with from miles away.....oh right that's what the choppers are for! Am I ranting a bit there? Um, yes sorry, but I was just looking SO foward to this game!!! Heck I even did the pre-order on the delux version!! NOW? Ya I'm kinda not happy about that. I fire the game up now and then after I see an update downloading. Just to mess around with the undrivable pickups and do target practice with the assault rifles that have recoil like a .45-110 every shot......it's like going to the playboy mansion only nobody's there. So, I'd say to wait on this game. I'm still playing ArmAII where I can fly fixed wings even in the base game. Oh yes I know...mods mods mods....ya *hangs head*

review: If you've looked at this on the Steam shelf and even been slightly interested, buy it. Apart from the gorgeous graphics and highly detailed soldiers, weapons, vehicles and environments, it gives you an experience like no other shooter. Best of all, it uses the Steam workshop which means you can very easily download (in-game) scenarios that other players have made. This offers an eternal level of replayability.

review: Arma 3 (short for Arma 3) is a game about shooting things and doing what you're told. Sort of like call of duty, except you'll die 50 times before you figure out how to actually throw the grenade. Arma 3 manages to find the perfect mix between a realistic simulation of warfare, and the fun found in a video game. If the episodic campaigns along with the dozens of scenarios and challenges aren't enough for you, the editor will be. Arma 3 comes with an incredibly powerful mission/scenario/campaign editor which can also double up as NATO rave party when you pop different coloured smoke grenades everywhere. The fanbase for this video game is quite extraordinary, and plays a crucial role in the development and sustainment of this game. Hundreds of mods have already been made available, with many more to come, as well as countless missions that come with multiplayer and singleplayer compatibility. In short - Arma 3 has the potential to be anything you imagine it to. And if that isn't your style, it's still an exciting game on it's own merits. Certainly worth your money, you may want to give this video game a look if you prefer something that feels a little more serious rather than knifing every second person you see. The only downside is that at the moment, some multiplayer servers have terrible frame rates, and the game itself requires a powerful computer to run on medium settings. That aside, 11.2/10.

review: Complex but fun especially if you have friends to play with. - I didnt like it in the beginning I found it rigid and complex, mainly because I was comparing it to the other FPS games in the market + Very good gameplay + Fancy graphics and physics are good + huge community contribution - You will walk a lot and you will be lost in the beginning I recommend it :)

review: The greatest mil sim, possibly FPS of all time I've been playing ArmA since Operation: Flashpoint (Renamed Armed Assault [ArmA]: Cold War Conflict]. I've always loved the concept of a sandbox game. Do whatever you want, your game play is literally limited to your imagination. We all know BIS has this aspect of the ArmA series in spades, but the military realism and breath of immersion with A3 is unreal. You step in the game and you actually FEEL yourself move within the environment. Thanks to the PysX engine, when you drive a vehicle the tactile feeling of traversing the terrain is like no other game out there. Weapons don't just aim themselves, if you miss your target down range (which you will!) it's your own fault. Working in squads and managing situation awareness is crucial to your survival, and you'll find plenty of players who want that next level realsim. The lush graphics and visuals are by far the most advanced of all current FPSs. Finally the best improvement, IMO, is the modified stance system. No longer do you have to clumsily stick to a wall to have cover, or just choose between getting shot or going prone and not being able to shoot. With this new mechanic, you can adjust your position in very specific ways to have sights down range over any variety of cover. By and large this is the greatest experience I've had in video games in a long time. ArmA 3 is only still in beta right now and It's still the most compelling, and in depth video game I've ever played. 10.00/10.00

review: If you want to play a heavy realistic and enyoing game, then i clearly recommend you to play this! The gameplay itself has it's own spirit that makes the Arma franchise unique. The in-game controls may be a little but confusing but you get used to it. Clearly recommended to play this with friends, and the gamemodes are awesome. There is "Altis Life" Wich is a roleplaying gamemode, Wasteland wich is like DayZ with no zombies innit. And ofcourse there is tons of mods in the internet so i suggest you give Arma 3 a try. :)

review: Poor edition to the Armaverse. Tons and tons of potential that is being sadly wasted. The game has nice graphics and lighting albeit not Dx11. The main island Altis, looks quite impressive indeed but has a very empty feeling and doesnt feel alive like other arma maps did. The ragdoll which is one of the new features feels half finished, like the rest of this game if I'm honest. An example of this is all static 50cals have the same model and this situation you will see through out the game, the latest content added were reskined with slight model change BAF helicopter and vehicle which is unacceptable in book if you already payed for that content if you bought BAF for arma 2. The sound leaves very little to be desired, with clipping audio and samples so loud that they actually break up (tank main guns). ArmA and ArmA2 have infinitely better programmed sound engines. ArmA3 is currently a dead duck in my opinion, anything that is positive about this game is quickly over shadowed by lack of content, bugs, inconsistances in code and I hate to say it but, bordom. I never thought I'd hear myself saying it but yes, this game is boring. With the pace of the games meaningful development slower than a snail I'd venture to say dont expect much soon. Maybe if the game still lives in 2015 it could be great, but right now it is certainly not that. Only time will tell if BIS take advantage of this games potentials. My feeling is that it will fall by the wayside because of lost potential and lack of real core code bug fixes.

review: Great game, bad optimization so if you have a low spec pc this game may run slow and have low fps. The gameplay is great, the vehicles and aircraft are great fun and are easy to drive / handle. But there is not many guns and vechicles within this game. The guns handle well and realistic, they also look great and the game has nice animation. The new stances are amazing and really allow you to take cover not matter what the object is you are taking cover behind. Over all fun game, lots of gamemodes online to play, single player is ok, but do not recommend getting this game for single player. There is also some mods online which change the game quite a bit. I do recommend getting this game.

review: Fantastic game already! Everything I wanted improved from ARMA and ARMA2 is improved in ARMA3 Alpha. The controls, animations and movement is sooo much better now, not clunky and meh like previous games in the series. Yet it still keeps that great realism that we love the series for. It is in great shape so far for an alpha version. Cannot wait to see what the full version offers! How did they get it to run better and look better than ARMA2? Pretty impressive! Get it now, maybe see ya online!

A guy hitted the brakes and got thrown out of his car. 3. A medic was driving on the mainroad, I heard his sirenes and suddenly BOOM and an offroad flew through the sky. 4.

review: Don't...even...bother... not picking up this game! This game has changed my life completely. I'm now sober (6 months! I know, still keeping my fingers crossed, because of my relapse last year), and I'm also off Heroin. Last year was a difficult year for me, I was diagnosed with testicular cancer, something about the way I rest my laptop on my left testicle that managed to cause internal bleeding. Ever since I picked up Arma 3 6 months ago, I've stopped resting my laptop on my testicles, instead I've been resting my testicles on my laptop. I thank the developers of this game for creating a masterpiece, and creating a beacon of hope for when I needed it the most.

review: The first couple days, can be really painful for most of the people, "ArmA 3" is kinda hard to understand, it's not for everyone especially not for "BF/COD lovers", the maps are really great, graphics are awesome same as the audio, this game is made really good, not as ArmA 2. ArmA 2 is lagging a lot, has a lot of fps drops, playing ArmA 2 on 1920x1080 Mid/Low and i have only 30-60 FPS, ArmA 3 on 1920x1080 Ultra High/High 80 FPS +++, half of ArmA 3 players can't kill a standing player, so the combat is pretty easy i'd say, the game is pretty expensive but it's definitely worth the money, 10/10.

review: This game is by far one of the best games that I have ever played. I payed 60.00 for it and have not regretted it since! I love this game to death but I play the mods like Battle Royal and Altis. I recommend this game because it brings you to a new state of gaming. Not only are you able to enjoy 1v1 combat or 2v2 combat u can have wars with eachother if you get the right set of people. I have enjoyed this game more than any other just because I caan basically do whatever I want to do and either evade police to get away with it or be kind and help whoever comes along! If you're loooking for a solid multiplayer game this is the one that will capture your attention more than any other. Not only will you devore 300 hours of gameplay you will begin to shape your personality of gaming to become a Rebel, Cop, or Savior. Love live the X-Generation!

review: Hey guys and girls :) Okey..lets get started: 1.Should i buy this game? -> Well it depends: First of all, let my say some positive aspects of ARMA 3. Arma 3 is an amazing game with amazing graphics, and gameplay. There are 2 real maps, a big one and a ULTRA big one (dude, so big you wont belive it. You have to walk about 2h [real time] to get from the W-N to S-E..Not joking), 3 campaigns, an editor mode where you can built your own mission and the fantastic multiplayer. But listen up: If you are a cod fan his game is not for you. This game is not about hit and run or just Shoot shoot and shoot..like almost every cod. No no no, this game is about teamplay, it is a war simulator! It makes more fun to do some patrol than the combat itself. You can play it only with 100 pleople and with vehicles like tanks, jets, choppers, submarines and so on. It is a game that never gets bored while playing with friends and always gives you the real combat feeling. But now to the negative: OMG, if you dont have a really really good computer, that means a over 700 dollar pc, you probably wont be able to play arma 3, please note, without lagging and properly.trust me. I have an i7, 12 GB ram and a GTX nvidia 560 and i almost manage it to play it with no lagging at 70 FPS (on standart settings!!!), on high, nozt joking, at 40, but it feels laggy You will have a huge FPS drop (-30) in multiplayer and this is eats away your frames! So, on overall..is it worth to buy this game? -> I can tell you, yes it is! Good job to the developers! Really nice game! I always fancy playing it and it is a unique game! my ration 8/10 -2 only due to the fps issues

review: This game is so much fun. Dont buy if you have below a dual core though, you wont be able to run it well at all. I have a dual core and play it fine though, no lag or anything. This game is as close as it gets to real life and actually required skill, planning, and patience unlike any other FPS on the market. If you are looking for the best FPS/military simulator look no further. You've found it. Its Arma 3. 11/10 great game

review: A very nice game, the atmosphere (Im not talking about mods, Im talking about the vanilla game) is almost the same as in ArmA 2. At first the game feels dull, almost boring. Youre bored as to why nothing happens and everything seems so slow, but once you get fired upon, or get targeted by enemy artillery fire and see several squadmates around you bite the dust as you barely survived an artillery shell that injured your legs to a point where you cant run anymore - the game becomes extremely intense. Your squad has been hit by artillery and you are among one of the few who kind of survived that attack, but your legs are injured and the next medic is 1 kilometer away from the AO. So you try to stay alive and slowly walk or crawl back to the military outpost in hopes of getting back to the EVAC zone in time (before the transport chopper flys off or the enemy decides to run a couple of bullets through the rest of your body). So you hump back towards the military outpost that you and your team used to advance from, because you know youre going to survive once you get there as there are many teammates and the EVAC zone is also back there. As you slowly make your way through the open field trying to stay as low as you can, crawling behind bushes - you suddenly hear shots from the distance and know that the enemies are advancing towards the EVAC zone and therefore towards you... You try to make your way as fast as possible, when you read your teamchat talking about the EVAC chopper that is already on its way and almost there and youre still 650 meters away. And as if that wasnt enough of an issue, the enemies have spotted and are now starting to fire at you as well. And as you keep crawling towards the EVAC zone and notice more and more shots hitting the ground very close to you, you know that youre probably not going to make it. And suddenly you hear a sniper firing from the EVAC zone down towards your position. He shoots one enemy rifleman after another and suddenly the teamchat indicates that the EVAC area is clear and that the pilot is going to wait for you... you stand up and try to not make your teammates wait too long for you while feeling happy about having survived such a counterattack without having to click on Respawn. This actually happened to me once. 10/10 would buy again

review: Arma 3 is one of the most versatile mil-sim games out there. The support from the developers alone puts this game at the top of any mil-sim list. The vanilla AI are pretty over-powered for what they do. They can get non-stop headshots from 600m away. But a couple AI mods and they react much more realistically. Coming from Arma2, this is game a huge improvement. The addition of PhysX adds a lot to gameplay. Overall, I'm very impressed with the game. Add the developer modding support, and this game is the top of my list.

review: Been playing since the beginning of the Alpha, and this game has stayed so unique. This game is a genre on it's own, nothing else out there like it. The community surrounding this game makes it all that much better, and the modding community is so big. This game is heavily moddable, which gives the community the tools they need to create anything, there is no limits. This is also one of the more hardcore FPS games out there, it's easy to get used to, but hard to get good at, and you can't do anything without a good team. All this game requires is patience, and the ability to work with other people. In order for me to fully explain how awesome this game is, I'd be sitting here all day typing this review out. 10/10, will never quit playing.

review: To be on point: Before purchasing Arma 3 I read about it on forums and on Steam reviews. Indeed, many said that at the moment Arma 3 is just not finished and it is not worth buying and playing as it is. I really liked the game idea and thought that it can't be that bad, so I purchased it. Boy I was in for a big surprise. And I am not talking only about the poor optimization of the game. The whole game feels weird, laggy and just plain wrong. The controls are a mess. For example, to fly with a joystick you have to set all the actions manually. At least in my case. Graphics wise, I might get older but the whole image seems to be blurry and out of sync. Maybe the biggest grief is with super human AI enemies. Somehow they can see you even in the darkest and deepest forest, while there is NO way you can see them, yet alone shoot them. I am sory to say, I regret the purchase and would not advise anyone to try the game in the current state. I would say in a year or so maybe, but not now. In case you want to help out the developer and support the game, by all means, purchase the game now. Play it later :) Do not get me wrong, the idea is super, the complexity is there, visual apeal is there, but it needs a lot of polish to be playable. I would like to state, for the record, that I couldn't get myself to play it for more than one hour. Maybe if I would have spent more time (I guess a lot more) in the game, I would have liked it more. Just for reference: I7 2600k @ 4.4 ghz nVidia GTX 580 1.5 GB RAM 16 GB RAM @ 1600 Mhz CAS 8 Samsung Evo SSD = 40-50 FPS in SP This is just my personal opinion and experience of the game. Take it with a grain of salt. Over and out.

review: The most accessible game in the series, this is Bohemia Interactive's magnus opus and my favourite instalment since the days of Operation Flashpoint (now ARMA: CWC) and it's incredible addons, the technological leap is huge and the possibilities for the end user are limitless, catering to any taste with a very active modding community to boot, potentially taking it far beyond a mil-sim. I have owned this game since the alpha phase and has been worth every penny, it's never been perfect but the development team are constantly striving to make it so. One of the greatest titles I've had the pleasure of owning on the PC for many years.

However, there is a massive community that plays non-military things in this amazing engine. Endless hours of fun await you, friends. I hope to see you on the battlefield. HOO-AH!

review: Despite many warnings from the community, bohemia decided to do the right thing and shove their thumb up their butts and not work off of a decent engine, again. Thus resulting in 90 FPS in single player, down to 10 - 15 in multiplayer, servers can't even handle all the scripts that their idiotic owners apply to said server, resulting in massive jam to be applied on your end of the game. Instead of fixing the AI, glitches and trying to optimize the game, bohemia has decided to pump out new content that adds to the previous issues stated above. What's that? You want single player? Oh well you'll have to wait for them to finish pumping out those SP episodes, why yes they are free, as they should be, as you have just paid for a $60 dollar alpha. Oh and the only thing people play in this "realistic army sim" is a god damn RPG average civi game type where you role play YOUR ACTUAL BORING LIFE.

review: Arma 3 like all the rest of the series, will only offer what you put into it - after all its not really a game is it. Try the editor and learn what you are capable of doing in arma, then apply that knowledge according to what you want to see - for me - personally, i'd preffer life like realism.. and my reward - is what i've learned not to do in a real situation - how will you play arma? - Dont let my arma online XP fool you, i have been scripting in arma since moby  was a minnow - i still dont know what its capable of - remember.. a simple quotation mark, being misplaced can make you frusterated and trying for minutes or even hours to end the script you knew only a few months ago - 8)) - i've been there - Example: !alive nearestObject [obj1, "House"]; <--- this took me 25 min to figure out that i was not putting an exclamation mark in beginning - it tells weather or not the obj is alive or not - in this case it was not and i needed to represent that - you see - simple, but it can cause discreppancy with the whole scipt not understanding what you want - so read over it always - and yes.. i felt stupid when i finally got it right, but that is how it works. welcome to arma logic ;) i recommend arma 3 and all the rest, to anyone bored with cod or battlefield or counterstrike or what ever you need a break from - peace out - - RenderSilent -

But Wait theres more! If you get Arma 3, you can run into all the rocks you want! But be careful, someone decided there was an imbalance and so if you drive into a small chainlink fence, unlike in arma 2, your car has a 75% chance of exploding and a 100% chance of losing its wheels! Can't wait for Arma 4!

review: Arma 3 beautifully continues the legacy of the Arma franchise. At no point in this game did I not stop to take in where I was. Altis and Stratis, the two maps, are stunning. The main map, Altis is very large and just that perspective alone is astounding. If you are playing Arma for the first time, I HIGHLY recommend playing around with the editor and single player before delving in online. This is not a pick up and play type of game. There are aspects that take some time to get accustomed to and you will not get it your first time playing. I cannot wait to see what modders have to offer in the coming months and years to make this game even better.

review: If Call of Duty is a Hollywood "military porn" movie, and Battlefield is the docudrama on military subjects, Arma is the trip down to the local military base, spending time on the range and on the obstacle course, and learning the real deal from the real people. Its about as close as you can get without signing up. Arma 3 is a sandbox infantry simulator with a focus on authenticity, set in a near-future ficticious scenario of 2035, wherein NATO is but a shadow of its former (aka: current-day) self, and a new enemy of Iranian origin begins a localized takeover of a small collection of islands in the Agean Sea, leading to a potential "flashpoint" of a wider war between NATO-allied nations near the Medittereanean and the Iranian-led "CSAT" forces, with Greek-based freedom fighters and the Greek army caught inbetween. There is a large focus (stemming from 4 games prior, not including expansions) on realism, and not the Hollywood "realism" that Call of Duty or Battlefield would throw at you. This game has proper modelling of terminal ballistics (range, ballistics drop, penetration, deflection, windage), proper modelling of the kilometers of distances you'll oftentimes have to travel, proper weapons, vehicles, and equipment modelling and mechanics, and proper tactics and strategy implementation. How proper? Well the seminal game of the series, let alone this infantry simulator genre, was the penultimate "Operation Flashpoint" of 2001 (now named Arma: Cold War Assault), which led to the development of the Virtual Battlespace 1 and 2 interactive training simulator aids that are currently being used by world militaries around the world, alongside the next games in the series (with the new name), Armed Assault (or Arma). Whilst there is a singleplayer campaign of due note (and one that is highly recommendable to newcomers to the series as the campaign since Arma 1 has always been structured to deliver a solid singleplayer experience at the same time introduce and teach the fundamental mechanics of the game), the real focus of the game is in its sandbox nature, allowing a very fanatic and vibrant community to create missions of all kinds, oftentimes with a multiplayer bent, for the game. Many of these missions are in the Steam Workshop, a first for the series. The multiplayer aspect of this game is extensive and ranges from straight-up "hardcore" simulation fanatics, exercising proper military procedures, tactics, and actions, to GTA-like -Life servers, Wasteland (read: DayZ in Arma), and everything in between (Insurgency, and Domination/Invade&Annex). In fact, many of the aformentioned gameplay types are all community-born, with the different communities that play Arma oftentimes having vastly different variants of each type, with many having a lot of bleed-over into each other, or being a singular experience on their own. One's multiplayer experiences are oftentimes directly tied to the quality of the people that share the same experience with you, and Arma's many communities are a notch above the expected grade, with all kinds from laid-back to straight-up, oftentimes with people who are former and even current serving military. You wont feel alone if you look around, and the people you will find are of all kinds, many for the better. This game is highly recommended to those who feel that Battlefield is not a solid enough experience and want to get deeper into the mindset of a soldier in a more authentic worldspace, and want to see how and why military tactics of today work they way they work, from close-quarters battle (CQB) in room clearing, to urban MOUT combat and open areas, to infantry - mechanized - armor - air interplay and supports.

review: Overall, the game is pretty good. I myself can say that I am somewhat pleased with it, the Map is HUGE and very fun to explore it's just with a 200 square kilometer map you would have more then just 14 air vehicles, maybe more planes and helicopter. They did mention they will be releasing new DLC for the game thank god I bought this when it was in Alpha. Otherwise I wouldn't be buying all that DLC. Bohemia in my opinion needs to step up their game and realise there is more to please then just the general European public. :)

review: So. This is one of my Favourite games of all times, since ArmA 1 and CnC Commanders was released. People are complaining about the missing campaigns, being impatient and just douching all over the place because its not a CoD. This game is just like the best MIlSimulator ive ever played, right after ArmA 2 OA. Bohemnia interactive did a very fine job. It has bullet penetration. The soldiers are highly customizable and damn... it is even supporting Mods and encouraging people to create stuff. If you want a real multi-player and FPS capable game, please buy this. Its just amazing. Graphics and Gameplay is O-U-T-S-T-A-N-D-I-N-G. ArmA 2 Needed an additional mod, called ACE, this game here, does not even need any more realism mods, because it IS Realism itself! Worth the money. Fun to play. 9.5/10 -Acekiller.

review: Handcuffed by 3 men. Took my shirt and my pants off. They took deep breaths into the mic. All three stole a bags worth of blood from me. Hit me once with their fist each. Left me to die. Broke out. Found a crowbar. Killed one. Ran away. Crawled into a house almost dead. Had a friend come save me. I wasnt gonna be able to make it i thought. We went into another city looking for a blood bag. Upon entering the hospital we were greated by one of the men that almost killed me. The blasted my friends brains on me. I ran out as fast as the game would let me. I ran to a town. Shot after shot was fired at me. I kept yelling into the mic "You suck at shooting!" Nearing at the town i was hit once. I crawled up to the top floor and used my only rag to stop bleeding. By this point i knew I was gone. Tears were streaming down my face as I wished it didnt have to happen like this. I could hear him running along the floor below me looking for me. He came out of the doorway from the stairs and i scream "WAIT!"... He pointed his gone at me. I closed my eyes and braced myself. nothing happened..... I looked him in the eyes as he looked at mine. I told him the bad things i did. I told him about my family. My friend that he killed. I told him how what they did to me i had deserved it. I could see tears streaming down his face. He looked at me and told me something. He told me how he knew i killed one of his friends. He told me how the other was shot in a shoot out. His face soaked with tears he pointed the gun at me. I said "no need. we have both lost something." He put the gun down. "We can end this together. No need for anymore violence. We dropped our stuff and walked to the edge. I looked to my right and he looked to his left. we both said "Thank you.." at the exact same time. We both jumped off the edge and died right next to each other. i felt my soul leave my body. Then i respawned

review: Ok time for me to get around to this. At first, Coming from ARMA 2 vet, it was quite confusing to play seeing how control are tad bit different. However I quickly learned it was for good. You no longer need to scroll and select action menu. For simple item, you can just enter boxes, open door, pick up item just one click away. For complicated stuff, action menu is there for you. But remmeber, do use mousewheel select or you'll shoot instead. Haha. Also Gears are now Inventory. So thats I not G because G will drop a nade and kill you. Now for the game. I personally disliked the future theme it had going on. However, Thankful for Armaholic and super easy new mod system. I was able to mod the game back to current year. Not 2035. I recommend getting a faction addon such as Canadian Force or Us Infantry with NATO - Spetsnaz Weapon Pack. They will make the game MORE better. Now I am making scenario like madman and playing it. Love how you can customize weapon, love how you can select gears and helmet to use. (Grass Helmet for the win) Vanilla 4/10 with Mods 20/10 Also you dont need to wear pant or condom to play this.

review: If you are considering buying Arma 3 for the multiplayer there are a few things you should know... About the multiplayer: There are several modes of multiplayer. There's Life, which is like an role playing type scenario. There's Wasteland, which is like DayZ but without zombies. There's also the several military combat oriented multiplayer modes. Multiplayer can be rewarding, but the Arma community is extremely diverse in the way people play their game. There are some casual players, but you will also encounter real military simulation enthusists. If you like to have fun, I suggest you approach the latter group with some degree of caution. They're not all bad, but I have run into some that have Units (Arma's term for clans) that do uniform inspections, boring training and, in one case, would not admit women to their unit because it wasn't "realistic". Just remember, if you're not having fun then it isn't worth your time and you should immediately ditch those people that are being such a drag. Other then that, the multiplayer can get quite laggy, but you can usually find another server to play on if that's the case. And bring a book because you can expect a lot of downtime in some modes of multiplayer. The game itself is a bit buggy. It can break your immersion at times, but when it really counts (in firefights) it rarely glitches out on me. This is a CPU intensive game. If you have a so-so processor but a good video card you may have to do some tweeks to make the game run in a satisfactory manner. Overall, I enjoy it a bunch. There's a lot to learn and I'm quite happy with the game.

review: A great military sim that keeps you engaged both in its story and its warfare. Its a perfect slow and fast paced game and allows for multiple playable areas whether you are deploying and picking up troops, running a covert mission with your nightvision, traveling by sea to support ground troops, or fighting on the ground in armor such as tanks or battling on foot. It includes even more areas of battle such as close air support (CAS) to diving underwater and traveling off shore to the area of opperation (AO). I highly recomend this game to anybody looking for a fun first or third person shooter that is very flexable with its battle.

review: This game offers the experience of realism in combat of modern war. There are several different types of game play you can do. Like all miltiplayers, this game escalates in fun with more people you cooperate with. The community overall is very friendly and willing to help you out if you are lost or stuck in a situation. The graphics can look really great if your machine can run it. It is both a first person and a third person shooter, helis, jets, to all sorts of ground vehicles are available for use. Each vehicle comes with their own challenges on operating them. I would recommend this game to those who are seeking a real time, realistic simulation of what it would be like to fight in the battlefied in modern times. Many variety of guns are available for use and the maps are gigantic so repetition of landscape is not an issue. Personally I'm not the biggest arma 3 fan but this game is a solid 8/10 in my book.

review: ArmA 3 is a military simulation game, set in the Greek Islands of Stratis and Altis. This is a futuristic game, using remote control planes, heat-seaking helicopters and amazing new vehicles. In this game you can play as BLUFOR, a teamup of the FIA and NATO troops. You can play as Independent, a group friendly to no one but the AAF. You can join OPFOR, a CSAT controlled team. This is less simulation and more fun. You can make your own scenarios and levels using the Zeus control menu or the level editor. The level editor is simple and fun to use. The modding community is big for this game, and a Steam Workshop is available to install modifications with one click of a button. Installing new helicopters, planes, skins, troopers and more from the workshop! Lots of new gamemodes exist, like Wasteland, Epoch and Altis Life! Wasteland is an amazingly styled gamemode. Complete objectives to gain money and buy new vehicles which come with the game. Pick your weapons and outfits, spending your money. You can fly and drive everything in the game, but you have to pay in-game money. You can join OPFOR or BLUFOR and assist your online team, or play as an independent player, being allowed to kill everyone. Altis Life is a roleplay gamemode for ArmA 3. You can play as a police officer, civilian or thug. Being able to smuggle drugs, steal cars and helicopters and fly around. The police can setup roadblocks, check you for IDs and can do what most police in real-life can. I would recommend this game for anyone and everyone, even if my description hasn't given you much it's a very fun game, easy to follow along and learn. For all of you who have the dream of flying in this game, it's so easy! It includes flight assistance for anyone who can't get the hang of landing and taking off. There are so many different servers, Wasteland being my favourite.

review: This game has a ton of potential. I'm a fan of the of the Arma series, and Bohemia Interactive as a compnany. I bought Arma 3 back when it was in early access as an alpha. Back then, Bohemia was releasing regular updates that included in game content. I've become very skeptical of Steam Early Acess titles, but I trusted Bohemia Interactive as a company I have bought from before and have been happy with my purchases and received many hours of enjoyment from their previous titles. (Arma 2 and Carrier Command to name a few) Arma 3 Eventually hit Beta, and later final release. After the "Finalized" product was increased in price the in game content soon stopped flowing. Then the Karts DLC was released. I thought "Oh this is just some fun thing the devs made some weekend." I passed on it as it had a kind of high price tag for just a mini-game calibre addon. Now the Helicopter DLC came out. It costs around 16 bucks. With these helicopters came new game mechanics. You can now tow vehicles via one of the DLC helicopters. Keep in mind, Arma is a game that has an active community of modders, scripters, programmers, mappers and artists creating new content every week. That's not to say Arma 2 didn't have its share of DLC. However, for comparable prices you got a new singleplayer campaign, a few scenarios, and an array of vehicles opposed to just two. This is the direction I don't like to see Arma go. When I bought the PMC DLC for Arma2, it felt worth it. I got more hours of gameplay by myself and singleplayer and many more options for transport and weaponry in multiplayer. The Arma3 DLC seems unfair. The two combined are offered for a reduced price, with both DLCs (around 25 dollars) You get three vehicles, (A kart and two helicopters.), a few outfits, and a starter pistol. On top of that, this game requires pretty fancy hardware to run above a steady 30 frames. I've found that this a very processor intensive game. I recently went from an I3 processor to and I7 and now make 40 frames pretty steadily on very high or ultra. However, when flying or otherwise moving fast, I still experience some heavy frame drops. These don't make the game unplayable by any means, but they do happen somewhat frequently (usually when flying over large villages with lots of models, namely Kavala.) For CAS pilots, you're almost always flying very low to the ground, and very fast. The added frame drops increase the challenge of flying CAS in urban areas. Now for people who are using lower end processors, you'll find looking at a village, even not directly (through terrain or a building) will drop your frames by atleast five. For people controlling Zeus you'll find that lag increases very quickly for your players the more things you put onto the battlefield. It becomes apparant a lot sooner than you'd expect for a game on the scale of Arma 3. Speaking of scale, a word often used when describing the main map, Altis. Altis has a huge perfomance difference comparatively to other maps. Now, obviously, the bigger something is, the more intensive it is to render. I NEVER noticed differences in performances from Chernarus to Takistan, to Namalsk, to Zargabad, to Utes on Arma 2. Granted, Altis is a lot more urban than Takistan for instance, and to be honest, I'd rather play Takistan if I can go anywhere on it. I've been on Insurgency servers where going to Kavala is against the rules because spawning AI in there increases lag to a huge degree. Being a finished game, Arma 3 feels a bit empty on the side of vehicles and weapons. There are TONS of outfits, but I'm pretty sure there's less than 20 guns (not counting variants) For a game as large as Arma, you'd think there would be a large array of weapons, similar to Arma2. Aside from that, being injured and out of breath REALLY kills your aim, it doesn't really feel right to me but I can live with it. Also, using scroll wheel as an action menu is still awkward as hell, but you get used to it. Again. I can live with it. That's my gripe with Arma 3 right now. Here's what I like: Otherwise, Arma 3 has great potential. The Zeus gamemode is innovation I've been looking for in gaming for a long time. It allows someone to take the role of a Dungeon Master and create the story of the mission as it proceeds. With that it is tricky to be/find a good Zeus. Once you can make a challenging, but not impossible mission for your friends, it is a blast for everyone. It's even fun to mess around by yourself as Zeus. You can create your own missions, and since the AI is good it's still challenging. I love Zeus and hope to see similar concepts in other games in the future. Flying is very tight. Flying is as near perfect as it gets for me. I am very happy with the flying system in this game, I have not tried the advanced flying mode yet, but I imagine Bohemia put the same care and attention into it as the now standard, default mode. The land vehicles turning radiuses seem huge, but they are military vehicles. The singleplayer story is a lot more intuitive and better paced than Arma 2. I have not beat it yet, but there have been many moments I have enjoyed. It is set up in a three part act, much like a movie, the middle being climax/dilema. The first act is rather short. Other than that, so far the campaign is much more engaging than Arma2. The community for Arma, if you're not aware is terrific. I love being able browse for addons other users created. This allows units to personalize their gear and vehicles to better suit their playstyle (Navy, Marines, Airforce, ETC) There are tons of mods that make the game so much more involving and immersive. If you get this game, I'd say it's a must to download a few mods. I know I said the scale is too big above, but if there's some things Arma does right, one of them is scale. When your on Altis, or Chernarus if you want something that runs better, You feel like you're in huge area, and there could be fighting ten kilometers from where you're fighting. Because of this, everything takes time. Getting a tank to a battlefield to tip the balance of the fight is a hard choice to make, because that fight could be lost by the time the tank gets there. Gunplay and movement are silky smooth, however, balistics seems a bit off. Some enemies seem to just absorb bullets sometimes. Bohemia included modified stances so you don't have to download a mod. The modified movements are very useful. ~~~~ Some things I don't like that aren't Bohemia's fault: Servers feel pretty empty at the time I'm gaming, and takes a while to find a good operation. You can no longer host a forward private server for your friends, due to the Gamespy closing, Steam took over, I don't know if they'll bring it back, but that was definitely part of the reason I got into Arma. It was very easy to pick up and do a mission with a couple of buds. Too many Altis Life servers. ~~~~ All in all, I think Arma 3's path will change. The community got pretty upset over the helicopter DLC, and with good reasons. I like this game. I still play it today. Is it worth fifty or sixty dollars? Probably not right now. However, this game isn't by any means bad, and if you enjoy a more simulator feel when playing a first person shooter, I would say that this would be a pretty good game to get. Bohemia, I hope you gain my trust back. (Sorry for any typos, wrote this late at night)

review: I was planning on buying this game for an huge ammount of time, when it was in sale last week I bought it. I mostly bought it for Altis Life, but then I met the amazing modding community of Arma 3. I bought Arma 2 for DayZ and I felt really sad when there wasn't a DayZ mod for Arma 3 (except Breaking Point). After some time playing I saw that my friend bought the game too and we played a lot together. It's really fun when you're with friends. The game is great and it is worth it's money.

At this point we don't have to wait for more tanks and jets, you can get them from armaholic! The movements of the characters are just more than good. Fortunately BIS said goodbye to Arma 2 physics and introduced more realistic engine. I would recommend this game for all who want to feel more reality than in battlefield or call of duty series.

review: I've had this game for quite a long time but never really found what to do with it.,..until I found Altis Life! WOW! It's so much fun roleplaying as a civ trying to find his way on Altis Island. If you like roleplaying and are open to all sorts of avenues that appear in front of you, then this is definitely the game for you! Top Drawer!!

review: Slowly slowly getting in this game. Its got a little steeper learning curve to it if you played any arma 2 games. I heard today that a arma 3 epoch server is coming up soon. Really looking forward to. espically to play a new map altis which looks really rich and eventful. i would look at picking this up in the steam sale if you liked arma 2 or dayz mod's.

review: This game is horribly unoptimized, very buggy, and just plain doesn't work sometimes. Most MP servers are garbage and lag like hell, the single player campain isn't very good, and the vanilla game isn't worth anything near 60$. Think of Arma 3 as a foundation for things to be built on top of. This game gets SO much better with mods and other addons. This game is without a doubt the best military simulator out right now, and it gets many times better if you play with a group of people. It has pretty much infinite replayability and more things to do than you'll ever be able to. It just has so much to offer and experience. I've found that playing with a group of people in Arma 3 is an amazing experience that no other shooter can offer. Arma 3 really is the ultimate sandbox in which the possibilites are endless. If you can overlook it's flaws and get over them, you'll find Arma 3 to be one of the best games you've ever played.

review: I love this game, spent many hours into various kinds of game modes from Alpha to release. I have played many singleplayer maps which I have gotten from the Workshop, some I have spent countless of hours restarting over and over again, just to enjoy it a little bit more. and some I have played with my friends in various fun co-op missions. I have played various multiplayer modes from Wasteland, King of the hill, to Altis Life. I have had my moments of rage, and I have had my crazy ammount of laughter. If you like a good FPS game with a great ammount of depth and lots of replayability, then this is a game for you. If you like to sit on a hill far away from the combat sniping down on the unknown enemy soldiers, then this is a game for you. If you enjoy commandering a group of troops, hell, even a whole army in battle, then this is a game for you. Or if you just want to do illegal drug business while avoiding cops in Altis Life, then this is a game for you. I feel repetive now, but I really enjoy this game, and hope you do so too. Sorry if there is any grammatic errors in the text, english is not my native language.

review: A realistic Military Simulator, this game is worth a buy. With the ability to create your own missions with the amazing editor and to play others with the in-built workshop support, you can have endless hours of enjoyment with this game. It's quite realistic, but still lacks many features of military warfare that could be put into the game. The graphics ain't so good on my computer but that's because my computer is 8 years old and I will be upgrading soon to see this game at it's full potential. I never played a previous Arma game so this was my first. From what I hear of the previous games this game doesn't really add much new content and is more of an advanced graphical re-release with some engine tweaks. However the modding community on this game is small at the moment but this is quite a new game so there's a lot to come! If you are new to the Arma series get this game but if you are a long time veteran then maybe wait a little untill you get bored of all the mods on Arma 2. This is a perfect game for any person who enjoys military combat games or would like a realistic simulation of military combat and life. Worth a buy in my opinion. 8/10 P.S. I haven't played a lot of this game at the current time because it doesn't run so well on my wooden computer and I can only spawn a few units without intense framerate drops. When I get my Diamond Computer it's gonna be max-out time!

review: This game has improved graphics, AI, and voices over Arma 2. However, it features made-up weapons with really bad sound effects. Multiplayer servers are generally suckish, but occasionally you will find a good one. The real fun lies in the editor and missions by yourself and with friends, the customization offers limitless replayability with the right mods.

review: Good single player, great coop multiplayer...when it works. The servers are rather sketchy, they don't run very well and there are hackers waiting to ruin your experience. Just this past week one of the servers was hacked 3 times! But, it is fun and when you get on a server that is good it is worth all the trouble. But, the most annoying thing to me is this has only been out for a year or so and the coop servers are already kinda dead and this is dissapointing. Most people only play Altis Life, the role playing section of the game, which I'd rather just play GTA online. If this is on sale, buy it. Wouldn't shell out the full $60 on it though. If you love tactical games such as Ghost Recon and Rainbow Six, this is your game. All in all 8/10.

review: ARMA 3 Beta, a beautiful place on the island of stratis, filled with wild life and plants, oh yeah, and did i tell you the place is a  battlefield filled with the monstrosities of war? The full release wont offer much unless bohemia has something up their sleeve, the game is going to lack jets, which is one of the main parts of an arma game, bohemia needs to step up and make more stuff, or get embarresed by mod makers, that doesnt mean the game will be horrible, the game will be very good, beautiful and dangerous at the same time, the AI was horrible, but was then made more battle effecient in the beta. If you didnt buy it during alpha, then you will be spending some stacks on the beta or full release, its going to be about 50 to 60 dollars, but from what i can tell, its worth it!

If "LIK OMG U CNT EVEN DO FUKN NOSCOPE 360 FROM 5 KILOMETERS?

review: In the same theme as Carlsberg Lager being Probably the best lager in the world.... Arma 3. Probably the best Mil Sim in the world. Superb in game graphics, excellent replayability, user creation mode is fantastic. More than enough mods are available, workshop for the user created missions, if you can't design your own. One major drawback to it... It requires high-spec machinery to run satisfactory. If you really want this though, sort your machine out, then spend a little cash on this game. It's the most realistic military simulator ever. So damned good, it makes my balls tingle!

And last but not least, friendly helicopter pilots will drop you onto the Hill of Death just for , giggles and points. 10/5 Oh by the way, its unoptimized like every Arma game, so to make it go from 20fps to 90fps you need to balance out CPU and GPU performance.

review: A fantastic game with great multiplayer and the best mission editor I've ever played with. This game almost does ARMA 2 justice, it includes some great graphics options (Picture-in-picture, post-processing effects, draw-distance) which allows it to run on some pretty low-end computers (I'm running it on near max with a 6670! (All on high/Ultra with a view-distance of 3.5km)) The campaign is a vast improvement over ARMA 2's campaign including proper voice acting, realistic plot and some nice comedy hidden around the map. I'd rate this game 8/10 > Great campaign > Fantastic editor < Quite buggy (None which are game breaking) > Fantastic modding community < Lack of units/ a lot of reused assets

review: INSTANT BUYER'S REMORSE I want to like this game. I really do. I've watched soooo many Frankie youtube videos of various Arma2/3/DayZ antics, and I thought to myself, "boy, despite the billion graphical glitches there seem to be present, and the staggering amount of complete aholes in servers, and the really, really clunky looking UI/inventory system.... this looks like it could be fun!" Team based objectives, mods that have huge open world survival based gameplay, vehicles, realistic (seemingly) weaponry, military tactics....at a glance, looks like a pretty decent game So, free weekend, 50% off... 30 bucks for a game that has singleplayer AND multiplayer? infinite modding possibilities? SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY, SIR! 4.2 hourrs on my record, I would say AT LEAST HALF was spend alt-tabbed googling various "how do I do this" or "arma 3 tutorial" since the in-game help/instructions/interface - is . I don't know if it is because I've never played any ARMA installment, or I'm mentally , or the game is simply an unintuitive cobbled together sack of confusing and unhelpful , but either way, prepare for a heavy learning curve. Some enjoy this aspect, some people PREFER a game with 400 keybinds to take advantage of their expensive gaming keyboards and mice.... I am not one of them. It's a first/3rd person shooter with sim aspects - there should be no need for you to be a contortionist or have a 2nd monitor with a keybind list up at all times. Honestly, a lot of the keybinds are whacky and frustratingly unintuitive. I get it, new things take time to learn. Like learning a new language. Like piloting a jet. Like learning how to script. For me, playing a game and learning the controls should be remotely similar to any of these things. I do not want to dedicated 20+ hours just to be able to navigate gameplay. It's not a MMO. Hell, I HAVE PLAYED MMOS WITH LESS BINDS. Not only that, but for the life of me, I could not get my extra mouse buttons to perform the way I wanted them to. Arma3 is the only game I've ever played where that has been the case. Get ready to spend hours scouring the web for 'FPS ISSUES' or 'FPS TWEAK GUIDES' for a game that really isn't incredibly impressive, graphically. All the same, it will make you wonder what your $700 video card and top notch processor, 16 gigs ram, SSD HD, etc are ING DOING. You'll notice, if you have monitors up on your PC, that they aren't being taxed all that much (20%?) yet performance is still AWFUL. Guides will have you downloading CPU parking/unparking software, entering a billion command line switches, sacrificing goats to the Bohemian pagan gods, but alas, very little you do will change the fact that this game is optimized like a bag of bloody . Don't bother searching through forums, 95% of people that don't recognize there is in fact, a massive persistent issue with FPS in this game (so maybe 20 people on all the internet) will just ridicule your computer or setup and tell you to "get a guhd computer, I get 60 fps, must be a problem with your setup,    !!!!!" etc. The campaign is horrendous. The AI is bad. Like, mind blowingly bad. Your teammates will just charge in, and either kill everything in sight while you're playing "realistically" (taking your time, scouting, moving from cover to cover, etc) or they will charge in and get annihilated. Either way, prepare to be a spectator for a lot of the action simply because your character is bound by the "realism" parameters that both friendly and enemy AI is NOT. Examples of this include the enemy have clairvoyant abilities to spot you behind that tree, rock, building, etc and the SECOND you pop your melon out for a little lookie-loo, boom, headshot. From 300+M. From an enemy who ISNT EVEN RENDERED. Oh, okay, I thought I was fighting human beings, not Terminators with cloaking shields. Woops. The enemy AI will have astonishing accuracy. Unbelievable and certainly not realistic accuracy. Accuracy that you simply cannot pray to match if you have been moving at all in the last few minutes before you raise your gun. Try drinking 10-15 beers, then playing that stupid game we did as kids, where you get a baseball bat, and put your forehead to the pommel and jam it into the ground and spin around and around and around for a minute. Then, pick up an assault rifle and try to aim at something 10 M away, let alone 300M away. (I'm not American, so as kids we didn't have the assault rifles, but the baseball bat spinny thing WAS a thing, its not just the 15 beers talking) This is what its like to try to aim down at an enemy after running 15 feet. For a game striving for realism.... yeah. This amazing and ultra realisitic military sim mechanic only affects you, in case you were wondering. Besides the game breaking AI and mechanics and horrid control system and clunky AI and awful on screen instructions - the campaign itself is a lot of "ho-hum lets traverse the country side for 15 mins listening to horrid voice acting (to be fair, its not AS bad as what some people are saying, but its still not good, and considering its the only god damn thing to take your mind off HOW BAD THIS GAME IS PERFORMING ON YOUR GAMING RIG, it just grates on your nerves). Literally, a mission starts, and they have you run from one in game cut sceen to another, with zero action in between, with a few fadeouts, and 15 minutes of walking... is this deliberate to bore you to  death so that when action takes place, you don't notice HOW  the AI acts? Perhaps so. Prepare to traverse the same stretch of not so pretty landscape over and over as the save system is another baffling part of Bohemia's design. I understand not allowing you to save whenever you damn well please (wait..no, I don't) but making me listen to same uninspired, boring, and inane voice acting while running up the same god forsaken hill for 3 minutes over and over and over because the AI consists of super soldiers who can no scope you .5 seconds after a full out sprint to prone is just infuriating after a while. Even during firefights, I did not get an overwhelming sense of "holy shieeeeet, war is scurry man, this is so realistic, only supreme tactics and skill and will have me come out on top in this conflict." It was more like, why the fk am I druken soldier with asthma who can't run 5M and raise his weapon without swaying so bad it's amazing he's even still standing upright? More often than not you find yourself letting your AI teammates do everything while you cower in a bush hoping you might get to shoot 1 or 2 enemy soldiers OR you allow your teammates to cannon fodder themselves and you mop up while the enemy is busy annihilating them. Either way, you barely feel engrossed in the action, and never really feel like a main player in the game. Don't even get me started on the UAV mission. To be fair, this is the single player part of the game. I have yet to really delve into multiplayer - I'm afraid to. People state (numerous times, I might add) that single player FPS is fine but MULTIPLAYER is where it REALLY goes downhill. Oh, goodie. When the game is made so inaccessible, it makes it real difficult to start it up again, let alone try playing with other people and getting into the lovely world of Arma Community friendliness. Better make another run to the beer store. Even if you're not a drinker, spend $30 on booze. You will get way more entertainment out of it. Hell, if you're really not a drinker, give the booze to a bunch of teenagers or your little brother or something. You will be better off for it, trust me.

review: A lot of people lead reviews by saying this game "has potential"... which is a really polite way of admitting that, right now, it absolutely sucks. It also does not reflect well on the game or on segments of its fanbase that well-deserved criticism is met with accusations of being a "Call of Duty" fan or a console kiddy or other supposed slurs on the critic's intelligence. I've been playing this series since Flashpoint and y'know, it's always been bug-ridden, poorly implemented, and heavily dependent on its modders to even be playable- BUT the series has been just good enough to be worth the aggravation and massive time-sink necessary to make it work... until now. The AI is horrible. For a game that involves realism in combat, where damage is more realistic and is dependent on squad tactics, the AI NEEDS to be competent if not excellent. Instead, the AI is incapable of navigating the terrain without getting stuck, incapable of responding effectivly to fire and totally lost inside of buildings - no, literally, lost inside. God help you if your AI decides to use a grenade because he'll just kill himself. The "Action menu" is STILL in the game and has been combined with environmental add actions that are even worse than in previous games. Face a door and click the action menu key... now watch as you transition to your handgun instead of opening the door because the action triggers are inconsistently placed by an incompetent dev team. This has been a major problem since OFP and it's actually worse now. You will lose many many many games, not because you made a mistake or were unlucky, or for legit gameplay reasons, but because the AI is totally- and I mean totally- incapable of doing what the game *depends* on it to do. The devs have taken to claiming ARMA 3 is a "toolbox" (when they're not insisting it's a game not a simulation- or conversely, that it's actually a simulation not a game- what they call their game depends on which set of their errors you're pointing out) in defense of it lacking a campaign. Fine. But what you get for "tools" is laughable- there's a handful of armor, vehicles and equipment, but it's basically just re-skinned copy-and-pastes between factions. Basically everyone shares assets with superficial cammo differences. Did you think ARMA 2 had bad optimization? Well, the dev team topped itself with ARMA 3 being even clunkier, slower and more bloated. Seriously, everything about this game/simulation when it comes to optimization looks like a rough draft of code rather than a finished product. It will slam even high-end machines to a halt because of poor usage routines, bad scripting, and other lazy shortcuts. What about mods? Well the modding community is a brilliant one, we've got some really really good people who really should get credit for making ARMA remotely popular (or playable). But BIS is depending on modders, not to expand the game, but basically to make the game WORK. No matter how good the mod team is, it's still less efficient and effective to try to fix a broken AI with an addon as opposed to fixing the core code. BIS is content to be lazy and coast on its unpaid modders, but there's only a handful of people who work on AI/game core issues (a lot work on maps and missions, but core realism/errors are another matter) and they seem pretty tired of doing this stuff. It's also a pretty sh*t thing for BIS to do, to release a full priced game with barely any content, crappy optimization, an outdated engine and terrible AI- but then expect the modders to bail them out of trouble. Well... maybe it ain't gonna happen this time. Hell, maybe they can't pull it off this time, even if they want to. TL;DR: This is alpha quality work at a final version price. BIS maintains that its games are like "fine wine" that "age well" when actually they're more like cheap wine that you need to take home and mix with fruit juice and a pound of sugar to be in any way drinkable. Arma 3 is yet another great concept that in practice is totally undermined and destroyed by what is either laziness or incompetence from the developers. Wait a year from now. Maybe the modders will fix this lazy incompetent mess and Arma 3 will be a playable game like Arma 2. Until then, just play Arma 2.

review: UPDATE 07/06/2014 I was a big fan of OFP. I am playing "this" game since literally 2002. I was hoping that developers will take it to a completely new level, not only graphics wise, but also improve and sophisticate its Simulation part. That didn't happen. Instead, what we have now as ArmA III is simply an OFP converted to COD/BF/CS:GO. This game is dead, and not worth spending a dime on it. PROS + Improved graphics, soldier equipment is detailed + Improved movement features, leaning, several sitting positions etc. + Bullet ballistics + Big areas available for play as an Islands CONS - Horrible and non realistic human damage system (aka CS-like) - Fictional and not practically realistic weapons - Helicopter can lift and carry a heavy MBT while it is using its main gun in the air... - Sniper can shoot a person sitting inside armed IFV... - Aircraft/Helicopter simulation is at the PS2 arcade flying sim level... - Tank/Vehicle control is simply W A S D + Mouse click, horribly simplified - Vehicle movement on a terrain is a joke, totally screwed up physics - Helicopter can lift 5 ton truck, drop it from 10m and truck continues to drive normally... - Flying physics for Aircrafts/helicopters is a laughable joke - Shooting enemy Aircraft with AA Vehicle is all about "button-press-hold-click" - TONS of bugs without attention. I do not see a value in this game. Developers should have been fixing the above issues and improving our gaming experience, instead, those clowns spend time on releasing trash like KARTS in order to suck additional buck from us! KISS MY A$$ BOHEMIA!

review: A quick review (Jan 6, 2014) Key Features in Arma 3 Altis & Stratis Defeat your enemy on richly detailed battlefields  stretching over 290 km of Mediterranean island terrain. Much of which is boring, empty, flat, unplayble due to poor optimization or lack of multiplayer missions which could take advantage of the map even if it were playable. Solo & Multiplayer Experience military gameplay by completing the singleplayer showcase missions. Run through the competitive firing drills to hone your shooting and movement skills. Form a squad and team up to fight against your enemy in multiplayer scenarios. Single player is a work in progress. Hell the whole game is a work in progress. No content, bad positional audio. Boken server browser. Clunky performance. Little or no large scale player vs player multiplayer missions. The few missions that are playable / popular are cosntantly works in progress suffering from poor performance and glitches. 95% of the community made missions are junk, unplayable , broken or just poorly designed. Weapons & Vehicles Master air, land, and sea with 20+ vehicles; choose your gear, pick from 40+ weapons, and customize your loadout. What good are cool weaposn and vehicles if the game isn't finished, has no content and doesn't run well? Enough said... Content Creation Start creating your own experiences with the powerful scenario editor; develop mods for others to play; share and discover scenarios on Steam Workshop; join our creative community. Tools still a work in progress as is everything else. Revamped Engine Navigate the battlefield with fluid new animations; feel the devastating power of combat with the upgraded sound engine, new ragdoll simulation and PhysX-supported vehicles. Revamped Engine? With the exact same problems Arma 2 had. Low frame rates, high overhead. Game crashes a lot. It is pretty when it runs as long as your not really trying to do much else. Episodic Campaign Supplied as free DLC after release, the official campaign will be deployed in 3 gameplay-driven episodes: Survive, Adapt, Win: I didn't buy the game for single player but I hear the first episode was pretty good. Others are still works in progress. If you get the impression I'm down on the game your right. They released it way too early with no content, tons of glitches, bugs and little to no content. Its plagued by poor coding and optimization. They made a map that is way to big to play, has no missions for it, is a resource hog, feels empty, and brings even the most powerful gaming rig to its knees as nothing you can do seems to improve the performance of it. Now to make mattters worse they areh olding a contest urge people to help them add content to the game. One has to ask why they put out an incomplete game then opt to throw money at it in the form of a contest rather than hiring professions to do the job they should have done. Is Arma 3 fun? Now and then when you can find a game that doesn't lag or crash or get hacked out. Its not really a game at this point. Arma3 is more of a modern combat game engine / simulator waiting for someone to make it game. Its messy, boring, unoptimized, ladden with overhead and bloated. Arma has a ton of unrealized potiental but a lot of rough edges. BI really needs to focus on fixing and finishing the game. Its another prime example of a game that was released to early (to beat BF4 / CoD Ghosts) and now needs time to mature. If looks feels and plays much like you expect a beta to be. Only buy it if the game you want to play if endless tweeking of your system tying to get it to run well or you want to tinker with making your own missions which won't run well either on the "revamped engine." Save your money until 2015 or until the price drops to $30 or less.

review: I'm not going to say, BUY THIS GAME!! because it's not for everyone, if you like ARMA 2 or military, FPS shooters (not COD, thats more like an arcade game) then yeah this game is awesome and is a leader in that market. If you think this game is full on, arcade style action packs bullets,bombs and metal flying all over the place, it's not, but it's just as fun as one of those games.

review: If you want realism combined with awesome FPS, then this is a game for you, if you want Small maps, repetetive gameplay, no pshysics(Sorry i can't spell that word), Same game every year in a row on more than 10ys old engine with a bit laggy netcode and same gameplay with same guns(remodeled) and screaming kids online, then Call Of Duty is the right choice for you. Yeah... I'm not talking about Arma here because i don't think it even needs a compliment, everything it does and it was suppose to do - IT DOES GREAT, not to mention the graphics. BUT BEWARE! YOU DO NEED A BEAST PC TO RUN THIS SMOOTHLY ON DECENT GRAPHIC SETTING. Long boring story: This game focuses on realism also as on gameplay, if youre a tactical player who wants a little bit of challenge and thinking, then this gam is meant for you, if youre a 12y old kid, then turn around and play flappy bird on your stupid iphone(yeah i'm also against ripp-off's = Apple). I am thinking of actually buying this game when i get bored of Battlefield 4. To comparise if you can run this game, check my specs in my profile, i can run it on medium-high(Without AA) with stable 60fps. My CPU is enabling me for longer(like 4000) view distance, which is very useful Imho. Not to even mention that this game has awesome community made mods for playing, as example of Arma2: DayZ. My Rating: 8,5/10 Pros: Excellent in what it does and is meant to do Cons: Not for everyone, but thats not the con? Well, you do need quite a beast PC, because if not, you're in huge disadvantage.

review: A huge step up from previous ARMA titles, graphically and mechanics wise. A3 has addressed nearly all the features I wanted added to increase immersion and to make the game a bit more fluid. Although set in the 2030's, A3 retains its grounding in realism and all the military equipment in this game exists or could exist in 2013 . Pick it up early to save yourself about $20 before the games full release.

review: This game is very well done. It is about as close as you can get to total realism in a game. This is also somewhat a downside though. It makes missions being done by yourself without any AI or player assistance very difficult. But if you have a group of friends to help you take on some of the missions, you will enjoy this game. The multiplayer is awesome. Before I found this game, I had always been searching for a game with a gamemode that has teams with about 65 players or so each all fighting over one point. The workshop feature makes the game even better, being able to download new missions whenever you finish the ones you already have. This is overall a pretty cool game.

review: Arma III is an infantry simulation more hardcore than than COD Black Ops or BF3. I'm looking forward to playing in more team-oriented groups, rather than a bunch of lone wolves. Dslyecxi's Tactical Techniques and Procedures guide is well written, team oriented, and aimed at the best player experience, rather than obsessive fidelity to actual ops.

review: Arma 3 is an expansive military simulator that excels beyond any game I can think of off the top of my head in both realism and graphics. As a PC gamer it is practically a requirement to get this game (assuming you like FPS). It is really fun and is potentially a mix of an FPS, RPG and Military simulator (with sandbox!) The Steam Workshop adds tons more content as well such as missions, racing mods, and pretty much anything you can think of...

review: It's better than ArmA 2, nuff said.
game-hours: 2886.5
review: ArmA 3 (Armed Assault 3) is definitely the most graphically and mechanically impressive title so far in the ArmA series. However - despite it being "released", there is still a heafty amount of bugs and glitches in the game, although they may be small and more in the background than presented upfront. There are also more optimizations that could definitely be implimented that would fix its problem with inconsistant (few and far between but are still issues) crashes happening during multiplayer experiences. These issues have lead a number of users, both old and new, to see ArmA 3 as still being in beta developement. That will ultimately be left up to you to decide though. Besides these issues though, ArmA 3 has advanced from its previous titles in terms of an updated and continuously polished physics engine, numerous graphical improvements to drive immersion, new mechanical upgrades allowing more in-depth maneuvering in either land, see or air vehicles as well as hoofing it across the battlefield and already developing expansions to add more content to the game. (Zeus game mode) Bohemia Interactive are definitely heading in the right direction withthis title, giving it all the love and attention they can muster and, in my opinion, doing the best they seem to be able to do as they're still defined as an independent developer. Pushing onwards from their previous flagship; ArmA 2, BI so blatently wants their entire fanbase, present and future, new and old to be able to take away and share the same amazing experiences from ArmA 3 as they did from the previous titles. And making way to provide great enjoyment for said fanbase which consists of diehard veteran players and their amazing moding community which has put out vanilla content-worthy additions to past titles as well as already ArmA 3. Being new to the series as of the official beta of ArmA 3, I've gone back to ArmA 2 to see where ArmA 3 is coming from. Even though A3 is considered by some to still be an unfinished product despite being released with a pricetag of $60, I can see that my investment will be paying off sooner or later. However I spent $45 when it was still in beta. So you may have to look harder if you've only recently purchased it.

review: I was introduced to Arma through the DayZ mod for Arma 2. It says a lot when a game is so moddable that it spawns other games... I've bought Arma 3 during the Alpha. Best money i've ever spent. Find a good clan/group/community and you'll have a hard time running out of things to do with this game. Cherry on top? The devs are mad men. They hammer daily on the dev branch and release monster patch notes every months. The game has a few flaws like the scroll menu that makes me sometimes lose my  when i try to open a door and instead change weapon. Ladders. Oh dear god ladders. If you want a good FPS with awesome vehicles. Arma 3 is for you. And when you think you're done... Go look at the mods...

review: While it's definitely lacking in content as of yet, the developers are constantly pushing out more and more to add to the game as time goes on. It has sleek graphics and very realistic gameplay; incidentally, if you're looking for Call of Duty or Battlefield with tight corners and insanely over-powered guns and dumbed-down ballistics, you, sir, have come to the wrong place. As said by Runekn so perfectly: "Arma is not a game which you pick up at launch, play the campaign and a bit of mp, and then trow away. You buy it, love it or hate it, and then play it forever or trow it away immediately." The community is incredibly active, and if the game is missing something (a jet, or faction, or gun), there are modders out there currently hard at work making this game more incredible. At the time of writing, the first of three campaign episodes have come out, the next slated for early next year. The game is becoming more and more intricate as people "leave" ARMA II to rest for a bit while they pursue ARMA III and more Scenarios are being made (thanks to Workshop Integration). Overall, this is an excellent game, and if you're sick of CoD or BF, need a dose of excitement or realism, or just need a satisfying filler while the sequel [of CoD or BF] comes out, ARMA III will give the experience yourself looking for.

review: This game is a military simulator. Its very fun to play and instead of running into rooms guns blazing like most shooters there is a lot more stratergy in this. It has quite a few mods that you can download from playwithsix and the workshop now. Im in a group called special team delta and we do operations every weekend and they are pretty fun. Even without my group I can have fun on public servers playing Wasteland or KOTH. The story is very good and is a good length. There are optimisation problems with the game. I cant really get over 50 fps on high with my $900 computer but even on 15fps it is still playable.

It's freaking awesome. Vanilla I don't like the gameplay and their are only a few weapons. But with some mods this game has no limits. Try to find a group or clan who makes their own missions and you will have an amazing time. If not, good luck with the single player.

review: Although it may still only be in a disguised beta sort of stage,its still immensly fun when you hop onto a multiplayer server (Try Invade and Annex which is what I'm referencing here) hop into a formed up squad and clear AOs with the help of coordinated allies. Zeus is also incredibly fun if you're into dropping people into S**t Storms. The ability to basically create your own batles is a very fun concept indeed. Workshop intergration allows mission creators publish their stuff easier and more people have more acess to it. If you want to buy it or not, I don't mind but you definetly keep your eyes on ArmA if incase something makes you just suddenly get the urge to buy it (Like many, MANY mods) and I hope to see you on the field.

review: a more realistic battlefield/cod when you play modes like wasteland or king of the hill; can also be fun if you play the dayz mod for free; battle royal, do I need to say more? get dropped on an island with 30 other people, find a weapon and "survival of the fittest"!; if you're the roleplaying person, who likes to deal drugs, have s (women, who sell their bodies to greasy guys) or just be a corrupt cop, then altis life is just the right thing for you! so in general, this game offers are great variety of mods, it's very own realism and it's not full of garbage kiddies, who flame and pretend to have made love with your mother (like the cod-fanboys, lel) 10/10 would buy again

In Arma 2 there was alot of mods, like DayZ or Invasion 1944 but in Arma 3 they added intigration with the steam workshop, which makes modding really easy. Overall the game is amazing and definitly worth getting, and I would give it a 8/10 with the only downside being what I feel as too few weapons.

I would recomend playing with a group of people because playing this game by yourself can tend to get boring. That is the only flaw iv been able to find really aside from a few random bugs here and there.

review: This game is an incredibly good one, but like past bohemia works it has a long path ahead of it. Do not go into the Steam Community Hub for this game, it is a disgusting look at overrivliged and spoiled children who don't understand how the game works they expect it to run like triple-A action shooters. The Reality is Arma is a military Simulator: your character can get hurt from non combat experience, he will become incredibly exhausted after running and carrying heavy gear, one bullet from any range can cause him to bleed out, it take time and patience to make a shot over 500m away. The vehicle combat requires multiplayer players, if your driving you'll need a gunner and a crew chief to spot targets for the gunner. Helicopters are fragile and take practice for good maneuvering and landing. Part of combat is the journey from your base to the AO, it can be anywhere from 2-25+ minutes of NO combat. To enjoy this game you need to give it time, The studio is still releasing content (FREE CONTENT) on an almost bi-weekly basis. If you don't like the game than I recommend keeping quiet about and maybe return in a year or two. For better opinions on arma 3 go to the arma 3 community website, this steam hub is just a cesspool, much like how the A2:OA hub turned into a DayZ orgy a year ago

review: Not entirely sure how much of this game I have really played, given that I simply took advantage of the free weekend (Who knows how long ago) and was hesitant playing it, given that my laptop has the processing power of a potato (And even then I think the potato is lighter, so yet another minus for this thing), on lowest settings in the SinglePlayer Act that was available, I was able to get a terrible 2-10fps. Despite all of this, I still enjoyed literally every second of the picture show that was playing infront of me. Riding in a helicopter, getting to see a limited view of the still beautiful island, seeing the troops and vehicles moving around below me, to shortly after scaling a mountain while taking fire from well camoflagued native soldiers, and rummaging through their gears to find the best sunglasses or helmet I liked, every moment was constant excitement, laughter, or crying behind a rock as I am suppressed and see my squadmate fall and need medical attention. Somehow able to survive all of that, with that terrible tract record, I thought "Hey, I lived, I'm ready for Multiplayer!" Having seen countless, hilarious videos of the Survival (or whatever the name is) gamemode, I joined that first, as a civilian. Not having played much of Arma other then Arma II Free to Play, and even then in terrible Fps, I expected a few people to be slightly hostile, but hoped deep down I'd find a good mate to run with. Shortly after spawning, I found a fully loaded M4-Something or other, nice shades, a backpack, and a cool helmet. A few steps down the road, I found a funny looking Frog-like APC truck, with gas, and decided to take it for a ride. A soldier on an ATV rides up infront of me, I stop and say "Hey! Wanna hop i-" and he's already off, pulled his pistol out and shot me in the face. 10/10, this is the driving force for an actual gaming setup. My goal is to find the soldier that shot me, kidnap him, take his clothes, pop his knee caps in the middle of the wasteland, and leave him there. He shall be mine.

This was back in alpha. it sucked , and i left the game to collect dust for a long time, then one day when it finally got released, a whole new gaming experience overwhelmed me! Completely swept me off my feet with the mechanics that this game has to offer, and due to one of the latest updates being "Zeus" it has made gaming to a whole new level. Since becomming a fan of the arma 3 i now own 2 servers for a community named STDelta. Its the most fun you could have with a war simulator you could ever have your hands on. Would definately reccomend this game to any gamers looking for a challenge in their gaming. Live long and drop the the floor and do the dinosaur. ~Hash

review: This is definitely one of the hardest games i have played, i mean, i tried the first mission +30 times on easy and never survived the first encounter with the enemy. I had to find a cheat just to get past the the first battle, but the next was just as hard. I don't think Dark Souls is this hard, and it gets worse as you progress. One annoying thing is when your character gets fatigued from running he starts to pant harder than a vintage German porn flick, i guess NATO must have lowered the standards in 2035. He'll start panting after ~30 meter and it gets worse if you continue to run, even walking makes him sound like he a heavy smoker with Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. But don't let the single player main campaign scare you from buying the game, you can have much more fun with the editor. It takes some time to figure it out, but you can make really good missions with it. The graphics is good, but you need a very powerful PC to play it with high settings. The FPS is showing when you do the changes so you don't have to exit the menu to test it. A joystick is recommended for flying the planes and helicopters. The game have a good variety of weapons, equipment and vehicles. The ballistics add a touch of realism.

review: Arma 3 is hands down one of the best war simulator/games that I have ever played!!! If you just want to run and gun then this game is not for you, maybe COD or Battlefield is something more suited for you, but if you are looking for a full immersion into what war is really like, then Arma 3 is the game that you want.. or the game that you need!! Arma 3 has hundreds upon hundreds of different mods and scenarios that you can play so that you are never bored. With mods like Battle Royale, Breaking Point(DayZ) and King of The Hill you will find yourself playing for hours upon hours!!

review: Over 900 hours played. I'm sure I'll be well over 1k when all is said and done. While the singleplayer campagn is ok, the game's true potential is unlocked in multiplayer. This is a true military sim built by the same company that builds sim's for the military. With mods like Breaking Point, Battle Royale, Wasteland, and King of the Hill, it's hard to get bored. If you go deep enough down the rabbit hole, you might even find yourself playing Altis Life... the horror!

review: Although it may still only be in a disguised beta sort of stage,its still immensly fun when you hop onto a multiplayer server (Try Invade and Annex which is what I'm referencing here) hop into a formed up squad and clear AOs with the help of coordinated allies. Zeus is also incredibly fun if you're into dropping people into S**t Storms. The ability to basically create your own batles is a very fun concept indeed. Workshop intergration allows mission creators publish their stuff easier and more people have more acess to it. If you want to buy it or not, I don't mind but you definetly keep your eyes on ArmA if incase something makes you just suddenly get the urge to buy it (Like many, MANY mods) and I hope to see you on the field.

review: a more realistic battlefield/cod when you play modes like wasteland or king of the hill; can also be fun if you play the dayz mod for free; battle royal, do I need to say more? get dropped on an island with 30 other people, find a weapon and "survival of the fittest"!; if you're the roleplaying person, who likes to deal drugs, have s (women, who sell their bodies to greasy guys) or just be a corrupt cop, then altis life is just the right thing for you! so in general, this game offers are great variety of mods, it's very own realism and it's not full of garbage kiddies, who flame and pretend to have made love with your mother (like the cod-fanboys, lel) 10/10 would buy again

review: One of the most realistic shooters I have ever played. If you love games where action is at every turn and everything is tramatic , this is not for you.

review: This is my first review. Arma 3 is one of the most realistic military sim you'll play in awhile. The realism beats battlefield, but is slower. At first if you're not use to it you will wonder how you died. After awhile you will realize that you were shot around 500 meters away. ARMA 3 is for the players who want more realism than battlefield.The game has many positives and some negatives that I can note. Positives: + Amazing graphics in some places + Big maps (2 really big islands, with one about 270km squared) +A decent amount of vehicles / weapons +Alot of uniforms for player customization (using the virtual ammo box, that is present in some servers) + A very good editor and a real time edior named zeus + Life like situations with other players + No annoying kids like Call Of Duty Negatives: - The campaign does not have a story that leaves an impression - The AI downright has no IQ - Needs a good computer - The map though big in some places are really just open land - Hard to learn The game has it's shares of positives and negatives, but will not be like any other game you've ever played. Don't buy this game if you won't take the time to learn how to play. That is because it will overwhelm you if you perfer games like Call of Duty.

review: If you're looking for a great game to give you some adrenaline, then Arma 3 is the right choice for you. Warning: This game involves massive team work on a large scale, if you like playing alone then this game may be too awesome for you. But other than that, work together to succeed! ( It Is Singleplayer, but I dont recommend playing alone ). War has never been accurate in a video game like it is in arma 3. Instead of run & gun combat, you experience patient and heart pounding moments knowing the fact that if you die in a mission, it's a game over. Work with your friends to find advantage points to your enemys and call air support if a tank has you under fire. And If you get it in maybe the leg or arm, you can always bandage yourself to avoid bleeding to death. Many missions usually last many hours so be sure to have nothing to do during the day and time in your hands. And if Arma still feels like it's missing something, visit

review: It is completely undeniable that the Arma series is one of the finest series of video games on the market. And the latest installment, Arma 3, is no exception. The endless amount of hours you will sink into this game unkowlingly is beyond belief, and every hour is justifiable. The countless mods and gamemodes at your disposal is borderline spectacular, and not only Bohemia Interactive; but also the community, put an extreme amount of blood, sweat and tears into making every second as enjoyable as the last. From a casual player, to a Mil-Sim enthusiast, this game will be enjoyed and appreciated by most. As well as this, Arma 3 incorporates some of the most astonishing graphics, mechanics and customization options that many games fail to even begin with. I am truly impressed with this game, as some aspects are just flat out upgrades of the series' predecessor, Arma 2. However, this is not to say the game hasn't got flaws. Optimization has always been a problem with the Arma series, and that is definitely something I, and many other members of the community believe should be addressed. The game also has minor problems that do occasionally affect the gameplay, and in some cases, the immersion. Nevertheless, I am confident that the simply brilliant developers over at Bohemia will address not only these, but all issues they encounter with Arma 3. Overall, this game has got some minor flaws, that get completely outshadowed by its complexity, graphical fidelity, mechanics, customization and so much more. If you are currently thinking of making this purchase, I'd think no more. Even at full price, it is worth every penny. This game, and the Arma series in general, have not just received my respect and appreciation. They've earned it.

review: Arma III has outstanding visuals and a intense set of game play mechanics. This game is not for the average FPS player, its for players who want more from the average FPS shooter. All in all it takes awhile to get into but once you find a good community to play with you have a  ton of fun!

review: This game's review has had a long time coming from me honestly. The single most played game within my Steam collection is undoubtly Arma 3. It is one of the few games I play that I continue to come back to over and over again. I won't go into much of the stuff you can read about online through professional reviews; stuff like the mechanics, graphics, etc. What I will go over though is why exactly this game is a gym despite any short comings and why it has such a loyal community. Arma is a game that scales with your imagination. While not necessarily easy, users can create whatever mod they want for this game. Just recently I saw a video for a T-Rex mod. T-Rex aside, many of the modders for this game take it upon themselve to implement items and equipment into the game that the developers could not (most likely for legal purposes/trademarks). Missions are made constantly so there is never a worry of running out of something to do in Arma 3. With one of the largest maps, realistic ballistics, and a sometimes brutally hard AI, the game provides a sandbox for players to play whatever military simulation they could every desire. Games can be designed to have a small 4 man team infiltrating small enemy camps or they can be designed to have huge operations with several platoons, armored vehicles, and airsupport. My only warning would be to take your time learning the game and the modding community. When I first purchased Arma 2, I didn't play it for a year after my initial play through because I didn't quite 'get' the game. My brother also was not a fan of Arma 3 at first. This is a game you need to Google and learn about. The rewards are definitely worth the time.

review: TL;DR: 9/10 rating. Why not 10? Multiplayer FPS and stability problems. Why nothing less? Read below. ARMA 3 is one of my all-time favourite games. Yes, I don't have thousands of hours in it... but after getting back into King of the Hill (currently level 54 on it with 300+ hours in that mission/mod alone), I plan to change that. First game of mine to break 1000 hours... here I come! Singleplayer runs beautifully though note that, even on regular difficulty, the AI can, and will, shred you unless you play to the absolute best of your ability... but even then... Multiplayer, while not being the best in terms of stability and/or framerate (whether that be the fault of the servers or game's code), excels in other ways that games like Battlefield don't. Easily my favourite gamemode/mod/mission is King of the Hill -- 3 teams all fight it out in a ~500m radius circle. What makes it better than just 'run in and kill' like the Battlefield series? Vulnerable progression. You start out with a TRG 5.56mm; it's okay but you're going to lose most gunfights without the element of surprise. You want that next gun, scope, launcher or vehicle? Work for it. You earn money from vehicle destroys, kills, revives, healing teammates and sitting in the AO (the circle). There are other great modes such as Wasteland which is similar to King of the Hill but, instead, everyone's spread far out across (typically) Stratis. You can group up with people or go lone wolf. Kill people, loot them, get money, buy things, kill more people. The thing that I dislike about Wasteland in comparison... is the lack of progression. It's just a sandbox pick-up and play gamemode/mission. What I'd like to see happen with ARMA 3: - improved multiplayer performance and stability - free, non-DLC weapons and vehicles ported from ARMA 2 (and Chernarus too) - more than just 2 sniper rifles in Marksman DLC -- so many people are disappointed with the lack of content coming from these DLCs - something valuable and proper in the expansion of Late 2015

review: Played arma2, Loved it, Played arma3 and loved it more. I joined the AHOYWORLD team and thrashed this game hard since alpha came out and its great. Endless possibilities for missions with many servers, editors, mods and scripts. Awesome game to get a clan together for team play although just as fun to play alone or MP. (Server dependent): Custom faces,uniforms,vehicles,weapons,sounds,textures,Virt Radios and more. This game has so much potential its crazy. Although..... known for  frames 20-30 on mid systems It tends to make up for that in good times to be had. High spec systems will push up to 60-70fps but conditional. Script running, current spawned in objects and AI, graphic effects overload will hammer some systems. Overall if youre system is good enough to run it and you can handle maybe turning some effects down on mid systems its an awesome game sure to entertain and war sim lovers. 9/10

review: Having bought this on day one, I do not regret it. I'll start with the gun play. Small arms feel weak against anyone wearing a vest, taking more than two shots to kill sometimes even with the almighty 7.62. However, if you play a scenario without body armor of any kind you should have a deadlier match. While I wish BI would fix the problem themselves, the Authentic Gameplay mod seems to help, or at least it makes me wanna go back to an Arma 3 firefight. Driving vehicles feels a lot smoother than Arma 2 in my opinion, thanks to PhysX. A lot of it is still off though, for example, the karts turn ridiculously fast. It's no GTA IV in the driving department, but it's clear they're making improvements over past installments in this department. Sounds are... acceptable. It's clear why sound mods are always so popular for the Arma series. They smoothened out the dialogue, but gun sounds sound weaker and quieter, though they can still be heard from some distance. The campaign is good improvement over the past, or that's what I think at least, up until the end. Although, commanding the AI or waiting for them to move can be a tad annoying, AI still need to be improved a lot. I'll leave it at that to avoid spoilers. Healing system actually seems kind of worse than Arma 2. The First aid kits everyone has heal you up 75%, so you're not totally good to go, but it still makes medics feel useless. Again, you'll need mods like AGM or XMedSys to get past the healing system. Content remains a bit lacking still. There's only a few civilian cars, literally no women of any kind, and no civilian aviation. Also, NATO, CSAT, and the AAF all lack any kind of transport plane. The only new sort of vehicle they added was either the Tempest "Device" or the Bobcat, a Panther APC that clears mines by plowing them. Also, the AAF only has mortars for artillery, which isn't good against NATO with their 155mm guns and 230mm rockets, or CSAT's 155mm guns and 82mm mortars. Also, CSAT lacks rocket artillery. Fun. And, back to aviation, NATO and CSAT don't have an air superiority fighter like the F-15 or anything, which interestingly is where the AAF makes up. If combat photography is your deal, Arma 3 delivers. You can create some beautiful scenes, or horribly gruesome, to capture with the Splendid Camera. Just go into editor and set it up, and then go to the menu and click splendid camera. The new Zeus feature is a fantastic addition though. Whether being added as a supplement to an existing mission to add challenges or relief depending on how things are going, or making an entirely new mission in the Zeus GM missions, it's usually excellent fun as either the victim or the Zeus, although like most multiplayers it can be ruined by awful people. While it may be clunky at first with the controls or function, when you get the hang of it it's a great tool for making other people's fun, or in SP editor preview, just making things for yourself. Karts are terrible fun. Enough said. Considering all these, I'd give it a 7.5/10. Zeus bumps it up a lot, although the weaker guns against just about any armored soldier, and the weakish sounds take it down some notches, it's still great fun to play. P.S. You should really ignore the people who whine about the "futuristic crap". Seeing as everything ingame is either feasible or already existant, there's really nothing "futuristic". If you wanna see for yourself, check out the forums, with the Arma 3 Is it Authentic? thread.

As a PC gamer it is practically a requirement to get this game (assuming you like FPS). It is really fun and is potentially a mix of an FPS, RPG and Military simulator (with sandbox!) The Steam Workshop adds tons more content as well such as missions, racing mods, and pretty much anything you can think of...

game-hours: 1783.7
review: About the game background: In 2001 the game Operation Flashpoint was made for the PC, it followed the Cold War era fighting between America and Soviet Russia. Due to copyright names in 2007 Bohemia Interactive created Armed Assault or ArmA. ArmA was followed up in 2009 with ArmA 2. Now in 2013 the fourth game is out. Armed Assault 3 is set in the near future of 2035 where NATO forces are pitted with a equally powerful foe. Gameplay: ArmA 3 is a very fast paced realistic shooter. With smooth controls and advance movement and stance options. The biggest feature is modualr gear and weapons. The ability to switch scopes, vests, or anything else on the fly to help protect you or assist you in combat sets this game apart from anything else. The AI in ArmA are ruthless and relentless, with advance path finding and adjustable skill they are able to hunt you, flank you, and take cover from you. Multiplayer: The game supports missions with over 80 players! Everything from Death Match, cooperative, team, squad, and unit missions. With the new physics system weapons are more realistic and so is the damage. The Community: ArmA's community is one of the strongest around. Skilled missions makers release daily content. Amazing Modders make new addons that completely change the way the game is played. Final words: While I personally enjoy this game, I do understand it has a lot of content that has not been added (yet). The development is always working on the game, and adding more conent but in its current state it only has half the units, weapons, and vehicles of its predecessor. Graphics: 9/10 Gameplay: 8.5/10 Story: 5/10 (next DLC will add more story content) Multiplayer: 9/10 Overall: 8.5/10 Worth every penny.

review: great game, i have had it since very early alpha and i have a total playtime of almost 700 hours. the game is great in itself and offers many different ways of play. mods are also great for the game (dont get too many as it ruins the game) all dlc's are great and the game is a close to real (basically the most real game avalible) and it covers a range of factions and teams (military,civvilian etc.....) i really reccoment this game to all !!!!!

review: ArmA 3 (Armed Assault 3) is definitely the most graphically and mechanically impressive title so far in the ArmA series. However - despite it being "released", there is still a heafty amount of bugs and glitches in the game, although they may be small and more in the background than presented upfront. There are also more optimizations that could definitely be implimented that would fix its problem with inconsistant (few and far between but are still issues) crashes happening during multiplayer experiences. These issues have lead a number of users, both old and new, to see ArmA 3 as still being in beta developement. That will ultimately be left up to you to decide though. Besides these issues though, ArmA 3 has advanced from its previous titles in terms of an updated and continuously polished physics engine, numerous graphical improvements to drive immersion, new mechanical upgrades allowing more in-depth maneuvering in either land, see or air vehicles as well as hoofing it across the battlefield and already developing expansions to add more content to the game. (Zeus game mode) Bohemia Interactive are definitely heading in the right direction withthis title, giving it all the love and attention they can muster and, in my opinion, doing the best they seem to be able to do as they're still defined as an independent developer. Pushing onwards from their previous flagship; ArmA 2, BI so blatently wants their entire fanbase, present and future, new and old to be able to take away and share the same amazing experiences from ArmA 3 as they did from the previous titles. And making way to provide great enjoyment for said fanbase which consists of diehard veteran players and their amazing moding community which has put out vanilla content-worthy additions to past titles as well as already ArmA 3. Being new to the series as of the official beta of ArmA 3, I've gone back to ArmA 2 to see where ArmA 3 is coming from. Even though A3 is considered by some to still be an unfinished product despite being released with a pricetag of $60, I can see that my investment will be paying off sooner or later. However I spent $45 when it was still in beta. So you may have to look harder if you've only recently purchased it.

review: Hello everyone thematrixman here giving my review on this fantastic game. So if you have played Arma 2 this is a huge jump in the right direction. Personally I didnt like Arma 2 due to its crappy controls and bugs. However, I did like the big open atmosphere which Arma 3 keeps and even out does it if i say do so myself. I gonna be straight out with you guys I have not beat the campaign yet because of difficulty and just lack of interest. The multiplayer is really the way to go as well as player made levels. I recomend playing capture the island for it puts this game to its max and create the intensity of a real war. Overall if you are ever wanting to play cti msg me and we can frag some noobs. The commaning is really crisp and you often have to think on the fly which is great for people who like strategy like me. The A.I arent that bad as they can fly helicopters better than me, but driving is another story (psst, if you put them in relax mode they will only drive on roads). So I conclude that this game will provide you with endless entertainment and i hope to see some of you online. This is matrix signing out!

review: This is Arma 3. The game we have been waiting for forever to improve our arma experience for along time coming. The game does add lots of cool new features to arma but the vanilla version of Arma 3 lacks content. If you are planning to mod it and play with a group of people then i highly recommend Arma for you, But in the long run without mods this game lacks content. 7/10

review: I was introduced to Arma through the DayZ mod for Arma 2. It says a lot when a game is so moddable that it spawns other games... I've bought Arma 3 during the Alpha. Best money i've ever spent. Find a good clan/group/community and you'll have a hard time running out of things to do with this game. Cherry on top? The devs are mad men. They hammer daily on the dev branch and release monster patch notes every months. The game has a few flaws like the scroll menu that makes me sometimes lose my  when i try to open a door and instead change weapon. Ladders. Oh dear god ladders. If you want a good FPS with awesome vehicles. Arma 3 is for you. And when you think you're done... Go look at the mods...

review: While it's definitely lacking in content as of yet, the developers are constantly pushing out more and more to add to the game as time goes on. It has sleek graphics and very realistic gameplay; incidentally, if you're looking for Call of Duty or Battlefield with tight corners and insanely over-powered guns and dumbed-down ballistics, you, sir, have come to the wrong place. As said by Runekn so perfectly: "Arma is not a game which you pick up at launch, play the campaign and a bit of mp, and then trow away. You buy it, love it or hate it, and then play it forever or trow it away immediately." The community is incredibly active, and if the game is missing something (a jet, or faction, or gun), there are modders out there currently hard at work making this game more incredible. At the time of writing, the first of three campaign episodes have come out, the next slated for early next year. The game is becoming more and more intricate as people "leave" ARMA II to rest for a bit while they pursue ARMA III and more Scenarios are being made (thanks to Workshop Integration). Overall, this is an excellent game, and if you're sick of CoD or BF, need a dose of excitement or realism, or just need a satisfying filler while the sequel [of CoD or BF] comes out, ARMA III will give the experience yourself looking for.

review: I love this game, I genuinly cannot play other FPS games without thinking "Why don't I just play Arma?". It has completely changed what I expect from FPS games and I look forward to continuing to play this game as it grows in both features and community made mods.

review: Unique game. This doesn't count as a shooter, its a military simulator, but with good reason. The term "shooter" is used loosely to designate any game with guns. In this game, understanding military language, logistics, and tactics is just as important as having enough ammo and good aim. I rate this game highly, but don't walk into this expecting guns ablazing and being an insane tank able to take down platoons of dudes. It's for its own crowd, it's up to you to figure out if you are/want to be part of that crowd.

review: This game is amazing. Straight up no ifs ands or buts about it. It does fall short in some areas compared to previous titles, for example the vehicle selection is tiny compared to ARMA2 but this will likely change over the course of the game's life as BI is releasing new content in sections like the campaign. Then of course there are the myriad of mods to tide you over :). If you're at all into Milsim or Hardcore FPS games you're probably going to love this. The game's biggest strength is simply that you can do almost anything you want to in it. You want to drive into the target area with a sub, swim to shore and rise out of the water like a Navy S.E.A.L? You can do that. Want to fly in in an AH-6 loaded for bear? You can do that, want to fly a jet? Drive a tank? Skydive? Attack at night? Use a mortar? Be a sniper? Fly an attack heli? Or just go in as a footsoldier? ARMA 3's got you covered. It's as it is advertised...the ultimate military sandbox. Probably going to be my favourite or one of my favourite games of 2013 and 2014 especially in terms of longevity.

review: This game is a military simulator. Its very fun to play and instead of running into rooms guns blazing like most shooters there is a lot more stratergy in this. It has quite a few mods that you can download from playwithsix and the workshop now. Im in a group called special team delta and we do operations every weekend and they are pretty fun. Even without my group I can have fun on public servers playing Wasteland or KOTH. The story is very good and is a good length. There are optimisation problems with the game. I cant really get over 50 fps on high with my $900 computer but even on 15fps it is still playable.

review: Arma 3 is a game you will either love or hate. VES2 is the actual Simulator this game is based off of, and yes, "Simulator". No rambos in this game. No running into a little hut with a .50 in one hand and an RPG in another blasting guys who all take 5 years to aim their gun at you. Rather you've been walking for a half hour with no enemy contacts, then in seconds you have BMPs on your  like its WW3. Save: Do I? Run north through the town and try to hug the walls. Nope, BMP painted you from the hill to the NE. Double back around the coastline. Nope, a chopper just landed some spetznaz looking dudes on the coast who take you down without reservation. Turn east and run straight for the trees. Nope, that BMP to the NE is still holding you down. No no no no. Since you're flanked to the front and rear its advised to draw fire from both, crossing their firelines and reducing their shock value, even slowing down the SF behind you as a BMP is firing in their direction. Now that the BMP to the NE has shifted into the town to avoid friendly fire, you have only one chance to book it east into the trees. Which isn't easy with SF on your . Everyone knows how "clunky" arma can be. When comparing it to medal of honor or call of duty, then yeah it's a pretty clunky game. It's like the actor actually has to catch his footing before running rather than kind've "gliding" atop the surface. Oh and "gahd this game sucks i cant even get into a doorway", because your freakin sniper rifle is clipping the doorframe. Because afterall in real life soldiers just clip their rifles through walls to get around tight hallways. tl;dr, if you have always wanted a game that made you feel like a real soldier in a massive battle, this is the one for you. If you want Akimbo Uzis and love to spam insults at the other players, stick to Call of Duty.

review: If you are looking for another FPS to play like COD, this is not for you. This game brings a much larger meaning to combat oriented games. The situations that you have to adapt to, the fact that the map is about 19 sq. km, and how fluid everything is compared to Arma II, thesse are all factors of the this game that stand out to me the most. This game is not for any COD player (or Battlefield at that) that just wants to shoot people for fun. Once you get used to everything and how the game is played, it really latches on to you. Especially when you have some buddies to bring with you.

review: An amazing game! 6.5/10 As I started from the Alpha of ArmA 3, I noticed as the game progressed I lost my ability to not only run the game once it hit beta but also blue screened three times. I've had multiple problems and even mangaged to fix the issue after hours and hours of searching for the answer to the issues. Now as Beta was a complete horror and full release was right around the corner I decided like many others to quit playing and go back to some good old ArmA 2 A.C.E. and waited till the games full release. As I was pumped for the full release I noticed that nothing had changed from the beta. Same maps, same vehicles, same sounds, same weapons, and same factions. The lack of things for the Sea was a huge disappointment because the ArmA 3 engine actually has a working water system and it was completely wasted. The lack of Air vehicles especially no big cargo plane makes traveling on altis boring and hard to move from place to place. Although it says its a ArmA game I dont feel as if it compares to its counter parts. Yes, a graphical update has been put up for the game itself but after playing ArmA 2. I dont feel the immersion of ArmA:Gold Edition and ArmA 2 in ArmA 3. but, it does have alot of neat things like futuristic vehicles, amazing hud system, stance system, amazing animations, ability for both customization over weaponary/uniform and a bunch of downloadable mods/maps that can keep you playing for hours just like ArmA 2. I'm just disappointed that they didn't take their time on this game. Why couldn't they have made this game better by looking at what players loved in the previous games like the ACE mod or even some of the other cool things like I44, VTE, and etc. Although all the bad things I have said its still a game in development and could possibly have a big turn around. I just hope this game becomes better in the future so I can start enjoying it again.

review: I used to play a little bit of Arma 2 back in the day, but Arma 3 sure takes the series to the next level. The game runs better and smoother in general. The graphical detail is sure as hell better, it's basically a repackaged Arma 2 without cheap and incorrect copy and paste like EA's BF4. Most of the games content is user created; by you and others within the Arma community so you'll never get bored. It's Arma so it's buggy, but that's fine. If you played or like Arma 2 or Operation Flashpoint, there is no reason that you shouldn't buy this game. Excellent Game, best $35 spent on Steam. 9/10. I'd give 10/10 if there was more official content. Start by playing the base game and it's campaign and server downloadable mods, then download yourself some proper mods like Battle Royale or Breaking Point.

review: This game where do we start..... Well for starts is a good game with alot of game modes by default. King of the hill is probably one of the good ones for solo players or domination if you like teamplay. So this game is by no means bad vanilla but there is a problem, it suffers from the same thing that titanfall does. It lacks content of course there are a plethura of things to do but what the game does on its on really isent enough. That being said this game truely shines with its modabilatiy and is best played with mods as they improve the gameplay alot. So overall its a good game and I would buy again if it were lost somehow.

review: This is one of those games you get because of the mods. The core game is nice, but the mods is what really makes it. Battle Royale, Arma 3 DayZ, Altis Life RPG, and many more things to do with this masterpiece military simulator. It's a big step up from Arma 2, however Arma 2 (inc. Operation Arrowhead) have a few more things this doesn't have (like Island Life). Great game overall.

review: This is my first review. Arma 3 is one of the most realistic military sim you'll play in awhile. The realism beats battlefield, but is slower. At first if you're not use to it you will wonder how you died. After awhile you will realize that you were shot around 500 meters away. ARMA 3 is for the players who want more realism than battlefield.The game has many positives and some negatives that I can note. Positives: + Amazing graphics in some places + Big maps (2 really big islands, with one about 270km squared) +A decent amount of vehicles / weapons +Alot of uniforms for player customization (using the virtual ammo box, that is present in some servers) + A very good editor and a real time edior named zeus + Life like situations with other players + No annoying kids like Call Of Duty Negatives: - The campaign does not have a story that leaves an impression - The AI downright has no IQ - Needs a good computer - The map though big in some places are really just open land - Hard to learn The game has it's shares of positives and negatives, but will not be like any other game you've ever played. Don't buy this game if you won't take the time to learn how to play. That is because it will overwhelm you if you perfer games like Call of Duty.

review: If you're looking for a great game to give you some adrenaline, then Arma 3 is the right choice for you. Warning: This game involves massive team work on a large scale, if you like playing alone then this game may be too awesome for you. But other than that, work together to succeed! ( It Is Singleplayer, but I dont recommend playing alone ). War has never been accurate in a video game like it is in arma 3. Instead of run & gun combat, you experience patient and heart pounding moments knowing the fact that if you die in a mission, it's a game over. Work with your friends to find advantage points to your enemys and call air support if a tank has you under fire. And If you get it in maybe the leg or arm, you can always bandage yourself to avoid bleeding to death. Many missions usually last many hours so be sure to have nothing to do during the day and time in your hands. And if Arma still feels like it's missing something, visit

review: It is completely undeniable that the Arma series is one of the finest series of video games on the market. And the latest installment, Arma 3, is no exception. The endless amount of hours you will sink into this game unkowlingly is beyond belief, and every hour is justifiable. The countless mods and gamemodes at your disposal is borderline spectacular, and not only Bohemia Interactive; but also the community, put an extreme amount of blood, sweat and tears into making every second as enjoyable as the last. From a casual player, to a Mil-Sim enthusiast, this game will be enjoyed and appreciated by most. As well as this, Arma 3 incorporates some of the most astonishing graphics, mechanics and customization options that many games fail to even begin with. I am truly impressed with this game, as some aspects are just flat out upgrades of the series' predecessor, Arma 2. However, this is not to say the game hasn't got flaws. Optimization has always been a problem with the Arma series, and that is definitely something I, and many other members of the community believe should be addressed. The game also has minor problems that do occasionally affect the gameplay, and in some cases, the immersion. Nevertheless, I am confident that the simply brilliant developers over at Bohemia will address not only these, but all issues they encounter with Arma 3. Overall, this game has got some minor flaws, that get completely outshadowed by its complexity, graphical fidelity, mechanics, customization and so much more. If you are currently thinking of making this purchase, I'd think no more. Even at full price, it is worth every penny. This game, and the Arma series in general, have not just received my respect and appreciation. They've earned it.

It's freaking awesome. Vanilla I don't like the gameplay and their are only a few weapons. But with some mods this game has no limits. Try to find a group or clan who makes their own missions and you will have an amazing time. If not, good luck with the single player.

review: If you play solo using AI allies against AI enemy this game is a 7/10. BUT with the right mods it quickly becomes an 8/10. Then add in muliplayer, open modding, PVE, PVP, friggin zombies!, a bazillion weapons and equipment, sound packs, then forget that they added gokarts ( I think the devs were on meth the day they came up with that idea ). In my mind you simply cant find any current or past milsim game that can offer anything close to what Arma 3 can. This isnt your little brothers Call of Duty or Battlefiled, 1 shot can and will kill you thats what the kiddies dont like, but guess what thats real sonny boy.

review: One of the best games you can get, building on the old Arma games, this is a new chapter in the Arma-verse that allows you to create realistic (or not :-) military scenarios. Unlike COD or BF4, Arma 3 is a game that you can make what you want in it, Take a look at armaholic for example, its not a storepage of hats to buy, but a list of mods that add to the game, you can edit, create, adjust so many times. Half of the game is creating the missions, let alone play them. If you want to make the best of Arma 3, join a group/clan and get in on the dedicated missions, ALTIS life has its place, but does not compare to actual teamwork.

review: GENERAL. Arma 3 is an amazing game that simulates real military action,objectives and tactics.Once you start the game for the first time you will see that there are tonns of controls and commands,but you'll get the hang off it eventually. We'll start off with the campaign.You play as corpral kerry in the NATO forces.Altis and Stratis the two main islands are being invaded by CSAT(bad guys).Even though there is nothing you can do about it,the NATO forces are trying to force them back,and near the end of the campaign you have two choices, try and find out where james(friend) is or play a part in the final stand against CSAT,depending on the choice you choose you could win or lose.The map editor is a good addition, it alows you to create your own missions or you could just tour upand down the islands like i do.The scenery on the islands look amazing and realistic and driving at night is even better. The realistic weather is by far the best weather you'll see in a long time,like if the start of a mission is suny the weather will probably change drasticaly.It is also very easy to get lost in the vast open world at night but the accurate star map should help you find your way. Also look out for animals like goats,deer and rabbits on land,in the sea there are fish,turtles and sharks to make you nervous when diving. There is a dedicated community on steam workshop,they create player made missions, weapons,vehicles and mods. There are also updates rolling in frequently to improve the game. AIRCRAFT. The aircraft in the game look well designed from helicopters to jet fighters but you do have to be a certified aircraft pilot if you want to play multiplayer or a lot of people will laugh at you because you crashed the 3 million dollar aircraft. LAND VEHICLES. The land vehicles also look well designed.The selection of tanks in the game are plentiful.The civilian cars are good for exploring the huge islands and The infintry transport look and drive just like they should. WATER TRANSPORT. There aren't as much boats as there are land vehicles but there doesn't need to be.There are 2 civilian boats and 2 military boats. There are also submarines as well. Pros 1 Great simulation. 2 Big open world to explore. 3 Amazing scenery. 4 Well designed vehicles. cons 1 Hard to learn aircraft piloting. Over all score 8/10

review: OK first things first. This game has endless possibilities, great campain, PVP modes king of the hill or wasteland, even better PVP in battleroyale, role playing games like altis life and arma 3 life, Zombie(dayz) mods like breaking point. In fact when you get arma its like you got 10 different games, which is awesome! My first day in altil life looked like this: i go get my licence, buy a car, get a delivery mission. I got one farest, like 26 kilometers acros altis. Got on a highway, after couple of miles, i crash into abandoned vehicle on the middle of the road without toolkit. Some guys found me on the road and gave me their truck so i could continue(awesome guys). Couple of miles ahead guy jumps in front of my truck trying to rob me, and he did robbed me. He walked back into his chopper and somehow insta chrashed(talk about insta karma?). I picked up his money and procced, only to be pulled over by a cop for speeding, he wrote me a ticket. Finally after 2 hours a got to my destination and delivered a package, i was so happy. 10/10 would recommend to anyone!

review: Very Good game for those who like to be tactical, i dont recomend this for lone wolves you may just die alot of times , compared to arma 2 the AI,campaign,multiplayer and custumization have significantly improved. If you are used to playing any call of duty series this game isnt recommended. Perhaps 60$ is alot but this game is worth it to me. It may be a bit glitchy at times but the gameplay makes up for it.

review: One of the best games you can get, building on the old Arma games, this is a new chapter in the Arma-verse that allows you to create realistic (or not :-) military scenarios. Unlike COD or BF4, Arma 3 is a game that you can make what you want in it, Take a look at armaholic for example, its not a storepage of hats to buy, but a list of mods that add to the game, you can edit, create, adjust so many times. Half of the game is creating the missions, let alone play them. If you want to make the best of Arma 3, join a group/clan and get in on the dedicated missions, ALTIS life has its place, but does not compare to actual teamwork.

review: Do you like a good shooter? Are you a strategist? Are you more inclined to play on hardcore servers in other games when you get the chance? Then this might just be the game for you. The realism and beauty in Arma 3 will blow you away. With heaps of multiplayer game modes avaliable for you to play, there will certainly be one that you will enjoy! And if multiplayer isnt your thing, then why not download one of the many custom made, high quality scenarios created by the community? Steam workshop integration allows for ENDLESS fun, on scenarios that you can enjoy alone, or with friends! This is a game you really must try.

review: This game is not for the console kids that play COD all day. This is a difficult but fun game. If you look at the negative reviews on it the reviewers have 300 to 700+ hours in this game... thats not the amount of hours you put in this game if you dont like it.... I dont get it.. Anyways. If you choose to buy this game get VAC. It will save your life. The community behind this game is huge and there is always new player created missions and content available. Theres also breaking point mod for arma 3. Basically Dayz for Arma 3. Which I think is better than SA. The guys saying they get low fps... one saying he gets 10 frames?? Its a demanding game... play it on something besides the laptop you bought at Wal-Mart... Bohemia labels it a military sim... thats what it is. It's most def not a run and shoot.

review: I could tell you all about this game after near 800hrs (790hr at the time of writing).. but I won't because I don't want any Call of Duty or Battlefield Fanboys coming in and ing up my game :) - I mean, really i should tell you to buy it because the only thing Arma shares with CoD and BF is that you shoot people..OK well CoD I haven't liked since Modern Warfare 2 and BF I grew out of as it was a good series that basically just got  all over by big companies seeking quick profits. Anyway Arma on the otherhand has been around just as long as these two but perhaps didn't spend so much on its marketing campaign and put more of its budget into making their games? I can't say for sure, but if you're into realism (not photorealism, like you call of duty cs) and Military Simulation types whether it be Tank Sims, Combat Flight Sims or just good old fashioned FPS types of games, you're probably going to enjoy some part of ArmA.. Thats one group of people that could enjoy this, then theres the creative types.. Have you ever wanted to drop a Fishing Trawler from 20,000ft onto an Airport runway filled with fuel trucks, planes, helicopters, tanks, cars whatever you fancy, just for fun.. to test your PC's capacity or performance? you can do this. Have you ever thought of a scenario and wanted to see how it might play out with two or more opposing factions in some kind of freaky multi-national royal rumble in the middle of nowhere with armour, air and infantry forces going at each other ? I know I never did until I played with the Mission editor in Arma 2, I played around making small missions in the previous games but not really until arma 3 did i experiment with weird  like that.. it's quite fun for wasting time, and it looks great.. Anyway, you guys could keep reading or you could be downloading it as you read.. its worth whatever the price is at the moment.. I don't really care how much it is, it's worth it. I've been playing this series since 2001 in the very beginning back when it was a Codemasters game Operation Flashpoint.. ing awesome game. If you're currently in the military, plan to enlist in the future or have previously served and want realism - buy Arma.. join a tactical realism clan or milsim group depending on your preference.. they're both the same to me.. immersive groups are best. **Warning** not so much a warning, but if you have PTSD and are triggered easily, perhaps this isn't your thing having PTSD myself I can safely say, this game will scare the absolute  out of you occasionally, depending on how you play and what triggers you or maybe just ease into it I can't tell you not to get it, it's an awesome game.. just try to remember that it's just a game. Easier said than done in some cases like mine.. I couldn't play properly for a week but that's another story that I don't think you need to know about ha.. Best game ever - possibly not best storyline, I liked Arma 2's campaign better but everything else in Arma 3 is ING AWESOME! - Don't take my word for it though, try it out - oh did I mention upto 64 player online multiplayer coop, pvp etc and thousands of servers internationally (I'm Australian and even we have low ping servers to  around on).. ahh I think that's it.. I chose not to technically review the game because it doesn't need a review, there are plenty out there just don't go with any saying anything negative about it, there's very few things that I don't like about it.. and the list gets smaller each day with the devs constantly releasing new fixes or DLC buy this game, I bought it in it's Alpha stage and the list of bugs was relatively small back then so you can imagine what it's like now after having been out officially over a year now ;-)

review: This game grew on me. One of my favorite YouTubers plays this somewhat often so I was decently familiar with the idea of the game before a few friends told me to get it. We've played a few of the multiplayer modes and recently been playing the Battle Royale mod, (which is a BLAST when you finally get into a reliable server). As others have mentioned, this is more of a combat simulation. It's unforgiving, which is why players need to use actual tactics to accomplish a goal. Sometimes things get slow, but that only helps to make confrontations way more exciting. I'm looking forward to trying out much more of what this game offers, which is a LOT.

review: Forget CoD, forget BF or any other pseudo military FPS. This is game is the real deal. I can not express how much fun and how into this game I can get. Every aspect of it is amazing; on ground, flying a jet or operating a tank. This is as close as you can get to the real thing. Graphically (and audio) beautiful and divine, realistic in every aspect. What more could you want? You can't, because this game is it. The thing I love about Arma (and always have) is that, it's the game you make it and want it to be. You want a non-broken DayZ? Breakingpoint. You want sector control? King of the hill. You want a death match? Wasteland. Team co-op? Invade and Annex. I could go on. If you enjoy games where you actually have to work, think, become involved and immersed then Arma3 should already be on your steam list.

review: GENERAL. Arma 3 is an amazing game that simulates real military action,objectives and tactics.Once you start the game for the first time you will see that there are tonns of controls and commands,but you'll get the hang off it eventually. We'll start off with the campaign.You play as corpral kerry in the NATO forces.Altis and Stratis the two main islands are being invaded by CSAT(bad guys).Even though there is nothing you can do about it,the NATO forces are trying to force them back,and near the end of the campaign you have two choices, try and find out where james(friend) is or play a part in the final stand against CSAT,depending on the choice you choose you could win or lose.The map editor is a good addition, it alows you to create your own missions or you could just tour upand down the islands like i do.The scenery on the islands look amazing and realistic and driving at night is even better. The realistic weather is by far the best weather you'll see in a long time,like if the start of a mission is suny the weather will probably change drasticaly.It is also very easy to get lost in the vast open world at night but the accurate star map should help you find your way. Also look out for animals like goats,deer and rabbits on land,in the sea there are fish,turtles and sharks to make you nervous when diving. There is a dedicated community on steam workshop,they create player made missions, weapons,vehicles and mods. There are also updates rolling in frequently to improve the game. AIRCRAFT. The aircraft in the game look well designed from helicopters to jet fighters but you do have to be a certified aircraft pilot if you want to play multiplayer or a lot of people will laugh at you because you crashed the 3 million dollar aircraft. LAND VEHICLES. The land vehicles also look well designed.The selection of tanks in the game are plentiful.The civilian cars are good for exploring the huge islands and The infintry transport look and drive just like they should. WATER TRANSPORT. There aren't as much boats as there are land vehicles but there doesn't need to be.There are 2 civilian boats and 2 military boats. There are also submarines as well. Pros 1 Great simulation. 2 Big open world to explore. 3 Amazing scenery. 4 Well designed vehicles. cons 1 Hard to learn aircraft piloting. Over all score 8/10

review: Very fun to use. The graphics and realism aspect of the game is extreme. The firefights are intense, and it's easy to be immersed into the combat. The vehicle (Including Aircraft, submarines, helicopters) interiors are nice to look at as well. Zues: Before this addon I couldn't get up close to watch a firefight without getting shot. This makes a great RTS, and a pleasurable theater of war. Go Karts: I was kind of confused about this addon. "A war simulator with Go Karts?" I got it, tried it out, and to be honest it wasn't that bad. Bohemia Interactive was trying something new. it was apreciated.

review: Buy it and start with the Battle Royale mod (which is excellent for both solo and coop play) if you like super tactical shooters with roaming like far cry/crysis games. The map is 270 km2 and super varied so the encounters are always different. I've played 110+ hours and i still haven't seen everything on the map. I experience immersion in this game like nothing else i have played for a long time. There is a lot of potential in the mods. The value is good because it's future proof due to mods and updates. You can really stress out your high-end rigs with this game, and the optimization isn't terrible - it runs better than Arma 2 and Dayz. I tried the game with a 7 year old rig and it was playable. The game is pretty much reliant on mods so you should be prepared to install some, they are easy to install though The game is definitely not bug-free at this time, and the physics are questionable. You'll get stuck inside rocks and walls, shoot invisible obstructions, and die some unfair deaths. The controls are also really technical, so it is best for hardcore and patient players, maybe as an evolution from Battlefield-like games

review: Mixed emotions about this one... Bought it when it was 40 bucks, kinda wish I didn't. Only real good parts about this are customizing levels of your own. Custom KOTH servers are good too. Other than that, I didn't really enjoy this. I was hoping a lot more from Arma 3. Arma 2 still has unlimited gameplay in it. RP servers, and normal servers. If you want a good war sim, this is pretty good. If you want a semigood war sim with basically unlimited gameplay, Arma 2. I don't exactly RECOMMEND this game, but it's pretty okay. 6.4/10

review: Good game... better than Arma 2 or Operation Arrowhead.... BUT and a BIIIIIIIG BUTT. please please please please FIX THE FREAKING AI PILOTING AND DRIVING ALREADY!!!!!!!!! Ex: Yesterday I'm playing Arma 3 (Bennys CTI mode), I have 7 M4 Scorchers all parked at HQ with 1 gunner in each. The plan is to sneak in at about 500m from the objective, use the M4s to eliminate all opposition, then take the objective single handed while the rest of the team is attacking another objective. I hire a quadbike w/driver, assign the driver as Green Team and jump on the back. I tell him to move to the next town, and I open the map to select my best approach to the objective. After selecting my approach I go back to 3rd person view. We are about 10m past our HQ. The AI is crashing into a small rock on the side of the road. Over and over and over and over and over and over again. To my left there is apx. 10m of wide open road. :S All I can say is WTF. A statement, not a question. WTF. Not WTF?. WTF. Get it. Anyways good game. No other game is as extensive as Arma. I would even call it more a "sim" than a game. Not a true sim, but a sim none the less.

Customization for soldiers... wicked!!! I would recommend this game by my fullest ability. No game can beat the realism of this game. "It's just simply Astonishing & Jaw-Dropping"

review: Arma 3 is a wonderful platform for military simulation. Where the game truly shines is with the extensive modding community. You will do yourself a disservice if you do not check out any of the multitudes of mods for this title. The game itself with out the mods is a great improvement over prvious titles like Arma 2 for example. Personally I used to be big on the Battlefield series but once I started playing Arma it was Arma or nothing for my modern day first person shooter. The depth and scope that you can get into here with the combined arms focus is truly amazing. Everything fromt he graphics, to physics to sound effects are really good. Oh and if You don't want to use the vanilla stuff, again there's mods, even full conversions that bring all the assests from previous games into this one. There's also a really fun multiplayer mode called Zues, which is essentially Dungeons and Dragons meets first person modern day shooter. One player acts like the "DM" and the others play in his / her world. Allowing you to create dynamic ever changing and unique situations on the fly. This one gets my whole hearted thumbs up.

review: This game is a definite improvement over it's predecessor, despite the optimization issues for those running lower level Intel rigs or mid-high level AMD rigs. Even on low this game looks impressive and if you have an Intel CPU (or high level AMD CPU) & Decent GPU (Either brand) you should be able to run it on high where the visuals are sure to impress. The AI has improved over ARMA II, though not tremendously, You will still have issues commanding your squad to do exactly what you want them to but they're not quite as derpy. If you decide to get this game you're definitely going to have fun with it, I strongly reccommend to google custom optimisation settings and tinker with it until you have the most stable frames you can achieve. Finally, the modding community for this game is excellent, there are plenty of great mods on the workshop and community sites like ARMAHOLIC.

review: With the right mods and people, this is about as close as you want to get to actual combat [at least for the ground warfare] Arma's best feature is the dedicated modding community, you can find a mod for just about anything for Arma. the game simulates fatigue, breathing and pain effect, as well as weapon weight, meaning that there won't be anybody out shooting a sub machine gun with a long rifle after being shot in the chest at near point blank range. There is a pretty good balistic simulation for vanilla arma but you can find mods for very realistic ballistics. I love pretty much everything about Arma except these two things, of course, nothing is perfect. The game requires a pretty powerful computer setup to run effectively, even with my Nvidia 770 graphics card, larger battles decrease frames quite a bit. And finally, Arma's controls can be rather clunky at times, the stance/lean controls specificly. It can be a problem at close range where a real human could move much faster. Overall- 9.5/10 definetly worth the price if you can run it and enjoy Teamwork and tactical combat.

review: Arma is a great series of games and the scope of each title is always more impressive than it's predecessor. Yes, like those it follows ARMA 3 has it's bugs, but these are in no way irritating. At most, they are hilarious.... because you become immersed with experience of being a lethal weapon, methodically removing enemy AI from their short lived lives, when all of a sudden the yells and laughs of comrades "hoovering" in a tank or being insta-killed by randomly exploding vehicles that touched a small pebble, breaks the cycle! It's a game you have to try out. You can get into the game quite easily and add to your knowledge as you go. But don't be a lone wolf and complain it was boring. Arma is about team work... and not your Call of Duty or Battlefield TDM capture the flag balls...but actual teamwork where communication and learning your place in a squad keeps you all alive! The A.I. on this game is "effective" - they will suppress, they will surpise and they definetly do more than just flank you from obvious places. It's very dynamic and lonewolfs die quickly... a good squad will have a much higher survival rate! So get yourself in a game, be a local on the server and join in with "regulars" to have the best experience. There is a lot to learn, but ARMA 3's new tutorial system is far superior to older versions of the game and many of the players online are very helpful. Heaps of content & the workshop has lots more additions. Goto Armaholic for the best and widest range of addons. My only gripe is that they can still be somewhat difficult to install. So it maybe best to use a loader. I'm a big fan of the Arma series and this one has raised the bar again! Get your 's off COD & BF and play a real game!!! 11/10

review: You like realistic military games? Than this game is for you! Arma series has impressed me yet again. STeam workshop for this game pretty much adds a brand new game to arma 3. I use to play the deathmatch for arma or the coop for arma but now i find myself playing stratis life which is a life simulator. game gets updated a lot and adds new stuff every month. game is worth every penny Pros open world military game everything is driveable small caves firefights are intense Cons Dlc are overpriced buggy

review: Bought this while it on was on sale for 50% off. So far it has been well worth the money and I plan to keep playing for quite some time. So far I have experienced hilarious moments with friends and in online servers but at the same time, I've experienced "milsim" roleplaying and taking scenarios and missions much more seriously which is a blast as well. Although there can be an FPS problem at times, which I have not experienced very much at all, I highly reccomend the game. With the in depth combat gameplay, amazing graphics, and and huge mod selection, I can't complain much. Highly recommended.

review: I think this Is a great game. You will probably learn alot of It, depending on how you play It. You can play either ways, the typical action game way or the simulator way.

review: Arma 3 is a wonderful platform for military simulation. Where the game truly shines is with the extensive modding community. You will do yourself a disservice if you do not check out any of the multitudes of mods for this title. The game itself with out the mods is a great improvement over prvious titles like Arma 2 for example. Personally I used to be big on the Battlefield series but once I started playing Arma it was Arma or nothing for my modern day first person shooter. The depth and scope that you can get into here with the combined arms focus is truly amazing. Everything fromt he graphics, to physics to sound effects are really good. Oh and if You don't want to use the vanilla stuff, again there's mods, even full conversions that bring all the assests from previous games into this one. There's also a really fun multiplayer mode called Zues, which is essentially Dungeons and Dragons meets first person modern day shooter. One player acts like the "DM" and the others play in his / her world. Allowing you to create dynamic ever changing and unique situations on the fly. This one gets my whole hearted thumbs up.

review: This game is an incredibly realistic and tactical shooter, with the addition of the Editor mode, this game becomes so much more. It has it's bugs but still they are forgiveable, Altis Life and Battle Royal are extremely fun and addicting. A warning before you buy though; Practise your skills in the editor before you move onto multiplayer, requires a fairly good pc, make sure you watch some tutorials and gameplay before buying since if you buy this game and find it won't run on your pc, or you some how simpley don't like the game $60 is a fair bit of a waste of money. Overall I give ArmA III 9/10. Hope you found this review helpful!!! =p

review: This is THE most realistic you will ever get in a military simulator. I have over 50 hours on it and have never been so amazed by the content it has to offer. Not only do you have all this great stuff as in, Sniping, CQB, Tanks and vechical combat, but there is an editor for testing and making missions scenarios. There has also been a new Bootcamp update added in that lets mods and more expirenced builders (of missions) expand their ability to create missions.

review: TL;DR: 9/10 rating. Why not 10? Multiplayer FPS and stability problems. Why nothing less? Read below. ARMA 3 is one of my all-time favourite games. Yes, I don't have thousands of hours in it... but after getting back into King of the Hill (currently level 54 on it with 300+ hours in that mission/mod alone), I plan to change that. First game of mine to break 1000 hours... here I come! Singleplayer runs beautifully though note that, even on regular difficulty, the AI can, and will, shred you unless you play to the absolute best of your ability... but even then... Multiplayer, while not being the best in terms of stability and/or framerate (whether that be the fault of the servers or game's code), excels in other ways that games like Battlefield don't. Easily my favourite gamemode/mod/mission is King of the Hill -- 3 teams all fight it out in a ~500m radius circle. What makes it better than just 'run in and kill' like the Battlefield series? Vulnerable progression. You start out with a TRG 5.56mm; it's okay but you're going to lose most gunfights without the element of surprise. You want that next gun, scope, launcher or vehicle? Work for it. You earn money from vehicle destroys, kills, revives, healing teammates and sitting in the AO (the circle). There are other great modes such as Wasteland which is similar to King of the Hill but, instead, everyone's spread far out across (typically) Stratis. You can group up with people or go lone wolf. Kill people, loot them, get money, buy things, kill more people. The thing that I dislike about Wasteland in comparison... is the lack of progression. It's just a sandbox pick-up and play gamemode/mission. What I'd like to see happen with ARMA 3: - improved multiplayer performance and stability - free, non-DLC weapons and vehicles ported from ARMA 2 (and Chernarus too) - more than just 2 sniper rifles in Marksman DLC -- so many people are disappointed with the lack of content coming from these DLCs - something valuable and proper in the expansion of Late 2015

review: I barely got this game and let me tell you I had the most terrifying experence ever (to me that is) I just finished Basic Training and finally knew how to play and understand this game, I joined a King of the hill server with 103 people in the game. As i joined i bought the first gun given to you and went on, I marked where my objective was at and catched a ride from a fellow teammate flying a helicopter over to the objective. I introduced myself to him, He Introduced his name as well. His name was John, as we were waiting for more teammates to join us on the ride to the objective, We chatted about this war (Trying to RP Here and he joins me in RPing) As we were chatting he told me that he been playing this game for 769 hours now, and that he was going to quit soon. I told him i understood why, The helicopter was full now and we began to lift off and go to the objective. As we were going there we were shot at and began to crash everyone jumped off and was killed, Me and John were still inside the helicopter that was falling slowly He told me "Jump, go now you er." I jumped and made it into the ocean with a broken leg, I swam up as fast as i can, and saw the helicopter slowly fall and crash into the mountain side, and then exploded. I swam to shore quickly and patched my leg up and ran to crash. I found his dead body and said in chat "RIP IN PIECES John." i took his gun which was better then mine and ran to the battlefield. As i made it to the battle field, there were explosions, gunshots, Helicopters crashing and then exploding, and People dying right in front of me. I have indeed seen some , I saw a fellow soldier on the ground i asked if he was ok he replied" Does it look like im ing OK?" "I'm crawling for s sake when i could be running at the hill and be taking it over." I said "Ok, ok here" I dropped a med kit and ran to the Hill we were suppose to take over. I saw 3 enemies run pass me, i shot at them and killed 2. One of the enemies saw me and began to fire at me and shot at me chest once. I ran and the enemy followed. As i thought i was going to be found and then shot, I attempted to heal up but then he found me and was about to fire when 2 teammates came to me and killed the enemy. I thanked them, healed up and ran to the belly of the beast. I met a teammate being shot at heavily and was wounded I told him to run to me, he told me he couldn't he was hurt and couldn't run. I threw a gernade at the area where all the enemies were shooting at and got a double kill but 2 enemies survived. He had time to run towards me and survive but as he tried to run towards me a Sniper got him in the leg and made him crawl, as he was about to die he told me to run, the sniper finished him off and hen payed attention to me. The sniper shot me injuring me and i began to crawl. 4 Enemies ran toward sme and all four shot at me. And i respawned. 10 out of 10, will get shot at by 4 people and wounded by a sniper again.

review: power of arma is in modding and community, it is improved a lot since previous titles and BIS will support its development further. (good side) nice graphics improvement from arma 2, the game has an editor that let you do what you want on a huge map and multiplayer is fun. (bad side) The campaign is ok, fps drop in towns and the game is hard for beginners and bad vechiles physics. conclusion Best military simulation I have ever played, and possible one of the best games.

review: Ahhh Arma 3 the third expansion of the Arma series. I love it and hate it at the same time at different moments. The increased modding capabilities really made me really interested. The main thing that REALLY disappointed me was the lack of variety in the weapons and vehicle department. They weren't really unique but the gear system helped add more variety to the cosmetics of the characters but, that doesn't really help due to the fact the weapons don't have much variety. I love the Arma 3 campaign, not as personal and deep as the Arma 2 campaign but still fun. There are still SOO many bugs that need fixing and Optimization for multiplayer FPS wise is very bad at the moment too. I still give this game a 7/10 since it has many abilities from Arma 2 and is still fun. Expect a lot of bugs though and a few random FPS drops but, that doesn't really effect the gameplay as much.

review: The third game in the ArmA series brings the series to a new level. The first thing i noticed was that the mouse-acceleration from ArmA 2 was gone, a welcome change to me. And the physics system got a great overhaul, from being nearly nothing (ArmA 2) to be one of the best to date (may get better when we get the full release) The graphics are really good, the textures are big, and the shaders are gorgeous. And best of all, the bugs/glitches are close to none. The gameplay doesnt differ too much from the prequel, though there are some improvments; More positioning options (prone, low-crouch, crouch, high-crouch etc.) and toggleable sights (RDS and scope), of course there are many more, but these are the ones that stand out from the previous game. Also worth to note is that the game is built upon teamwork in the multiplayer mode, In othe words; One does not simply walk into enemy territorium alone... Overall the game is really good, even though its still in Beta. There are room for improvments, and there has to be more content (tanks, jets etc.) But still i enjoy it as much as i enjoy ArmA 2; if not more. Final Rating: The alpha was a bit too buggy to be played 6/10 The Beta feels much more reliable, but we still need tanks ;) 8/10 If it continues on the same path as right now, the full realese will get a 10/10 Nothing to complain about (its Beta after all). I just got one final word to say; BUY! Edit: Tanks etc. are added, but there are still some glitches that make the game unplayable at points. But I'd still give it a 9/10

review: Arma 3 is a great military simulator which allows you to explore a VERY large map called Altis and a smaller map called Stratis with other players which leaves you fighting off the enemys who have control of the island. Just recently Bohemia servers have shut down due to Steam buying out the Bohemia and for some unknown reason, we Arma 3 fans are still waiting for the servers to go online. It has been almost 3 months now and still no sign of the servers. This game is best when you are able to play with friends as I dont reccomend purchasing this game until Bohemia Interactive and Steam sort out the server issues. Unfortunately, Arma 3 is going to be sitting in my Steam library gathering cobwebs until the servers are back online.

You always must use caution you never know if/when you will be shot at from any direction, any height, any distance and from any type of challenge wether it's Planes Boats, Tanks, Mines, Enemies aka Troops and Paratroopers you name it.. You can also create Missions for you and your friends to play, you can also do anything set on your mind.. But you must follow Server Rules, if you don't want too be Kicked/Banned. You can also do Solo Missions, the Campaign, Training ANYTHING! This game has a ton of Mods! So what are you waiting for BUY NOW!!

review: This game is just what you would expect from the Bohemia Interactive devs, a great game that is fun with a group of friends. You have many recuring mods in the ARMA series such as island life, wasteland, domination, and even an ARMA 3 port of DayZ, there is even a gamemode only in ARMA 3 called King of the hill. With the multiplayer basis out of the way what about singleplayer? ARMA 3 provides a story driven campaign, and a couple of showcases i.e. Infantry Combat, Aquatic Warfare, etc. ARMA 3 is also returning with a more user friendly mission editor/creator, here you can make your own missions that you or some friends can test out, or upload it to the Steam Workshop. Along with uploading you can also download others missions, some serious, some not. But other than that you should have a great time with this game. Now for the cons (every game has some) just as expected this game is extremely CPU intensive, and GPU intensive, so if you are getting this game make sure you have a good computer. P.S. FPS will be drastically higher in singleplayer compared to multiplayer i.e. SP 45-60 MP 15-30 depending on the server (some are crappy) BEWARE!

I have played the introductory showcases which shows you infantry, armor, and air elements of the games to get started. The campaigns were also an interesting experience as well but lacked that live squad tactics that I desired. Consequently, I transitioned towards multiplayer to see what it had to offer. At the current time, Invade&Annex (capture the town objective), Breaking Point (Zombie RPG), Atlis Life (RPG), and Wasteland (Dynamic Missions and RPG) remains the most popular maps on the servers. Invade&Annex is probably the closest to a military element out of the 4 and the other four are probably experiences that can be better found in other titles. A game model built in realism, infantry tactics, and armor assets should be better utilize than just simply playing RPGs. In search of a more military experience, I discovered Endless Survival, Whole Lotta Atlis, and private gamemaster games more enriching. I found some things that you can't simply experience on those common maps & servers mentioned in the previous paragraph. When can you say that you were able to fly the A10-C Thunderbolt II, parachute into the AO next to your squad, or evacuating out of a hot LZ after protecting the president at the hospital? These were just some of the satisfying environments in which I have played in. In hopes of playing with more like minded fellas and pushing for milsim, let's play! I'm always glad to meet new friends. Strength and Honor, timh1203

review: Bohemia Interactive have really created something special here, top of the line military simulator an experience like no other. For those unfamiliar with what a Military Simulator game entitles here is a few of the things you will be doing in Altis and Stratis the two maps in game which are ridiculously huge: - Gokarting - Flying helicopters to the max height and then skydiving to your death - Dealing drugs and becoming terrorists in Altis Life - Having a great time attaching .50 cals to your gokart and killing your friends - Great community workshop maps and missions such as 'The Lost Doge' and 'Skytrack 3000' - Having intense raves with glowsticks and coloured smoke The list goes on, in conclusion BUY THIS GAME

review: Definetly a step-up towards more realistic gameplay than CoD and Battlefield series. Steep learning curve with all sorts of options in how to affect your avatar in the environment - too many for most of us - so it really takes time to get into. Huge sandbox environments so plan on spending several hours in a match rather than your typical 20 minute arcade-shooter match. Some of the options and controls do feel a little clunky at the moment. You do need a pretty decent rig to run on full graphic settings to get the most out of it. Challenging - very challenging. Great realism - it can be fustrating for new players so expect it going in.

Insomniac Games really outdid themselves on this one. 8/6 would eat without package.

review: I figured it was about time to right a review about this beautiful game. First off, this game, in all actuality, is more of a sandbox, and a gaming platform, with a military theme than it is anything else. People will fanboy out and say that this is a hardcore military simulator bla bla bla, but really it is what you make it, and it depends on how you play and who your playing with. For example, like survival based games? Wasteland! Into roleplaying as police or rebels, Altis life. Like large scale team on team pvp? King of the Hill by Sa-Matra. Like the hardcore military aspect arma has to offer? Find a good tacsim clan. And there are quite a few. The thing about ArmA is it is designed as more of a platform for things to be developed on, such as the mods that the wonderful community has designed. In our clan we use quite a few mods ranging from sound mods that add more realistic and adrenaline pumping sound effects, to weapon and vehicle packs to give us weapons used in real life by the military units that we essentially try to recreate. The problem with some people is that they expect bohemia to add all of these features and what not such as a medical system, or more realistic this and that, but the problem is if they did things like that the entire community would be effected, not just say the military simulator players of arma, and at that not all clans wish to play the same way, so if ArmA added say a much more realistic medical system, some clans wouldn't like that and it may mess up there playstyle, which is where mods come in, so clans can adjust there gameplay to how they see fit. Overall this game is amazing, I have spent many hours playing on our tactical realism server, and i have spent MANY hours up all night with friends in skype and teamspeak on wasteland servers, playing with extreme military tactics in a post apoc. world gathering gear and taking out any and all contacts. This game has the pontential to bring you hours upon hours of entertainment. Forget all the complaints of "lack of this and needs more that" b.s. This game can be what you make of it and most of us have chosen to enjoy it! There are some amazing things being devoloped for this game such as the A.L.I.V.E. mod which adds a very realistic living breathing ArmA world where enemies have there own objectives and behave like real humans being controlled with real tactics and objectives in mind. Things like that make this game amazing and I expect to be playing it for many years to come. I've been with it since the first month of alpha and it never ceases to get more and more amazing weather it's updates to the engine, or updates from the large and amazing community. There is so much that I can't even begin to cover in this game but from the experienced I have had in this game, it is easily my favorite game of all time, even though it may have some querks here and there, it is amazing - 10/10.

review: Simulation isn't the defining aspect of Arma. It's scale. The enormity of the map is the foundation for the experiences that distinguish Bohemia Interactive's flagship franchise. It's what makes radios, topographical maps, binoculars, and compasses practical equipment in an FPS. It's what allows for kilometer-long headshots and coordinated convoy raids. It's what makes using your eyes to spot hints of enemies--muzzle flashes, tracers, gunsmoke--as valuable as being a crack shot. The scale of Arma 3 dwarfs everything in the genre, including Arma 2 . Altis , a keyhole portion of which is seen in these screenshots, is a Mediterranean island-nation assembled from ruins, airports, coastal villages, solar power plants, military outposts, salt flats, and tank-friendly scrubland. It's a variegated backyard for you to play war in, but what's more significant is that Arma's landscape finally has the technology it deserves. Arma 3 represents an aesthetic overhaul of the series. Unbelievable dynamic lighting, a volumetric cloud system, genuine vehicle physics, 3D weapon optics, ragdoll, noticeably improved weapon audio, and other grainy, eye-level details await scrutiny inside Arma 3's macro elegance. The best improvement is the merciful cutting of Arma 2's rigid, Tin-Man-without-oil combat animations, which makes infantry combat more responsive in your hands. A half-year in paid pre-release has given Arma 3 time to gestate, but the final build is far from being a comprehensive reinvention of the series, and some long-standing blemishes that arise from its nature as a gargantuan simulation linger. Even on high-end hardware, my framerate dips under the spectacle of some multiplayer missions. Friendly AI units, though marginally better-behaved, still depend on the player to be their brains, an issue that's circumvented by playing Arma the way God intended it: cooperatively. With voice-connected friends and a good user-created mission, Arma 3 is an unparalleled war story generator. On Operation Fault Line with a gang of Steam pals, I had to drive a clumsy, eight-wheeled transport called a HEMTT across the map. To protect this elephantine truck we had a IFV-6c Panther, an APC with a mounted grenade launcher and 12.7mm MG. Minutes after leaving base, our tanky bodyguard eats a land mine, ruining its left track. As we get out to survey the damage, rockets streak across the valley. Everyone's okay, but the Panther is immobilized. Dumping the APC is the only option. We clump into the fragile HEMTT, burning diesel to get off the exposed ridge. Green tracers track the truck, eventually pricking some of my tires. The wheels don't deflate enough to go flat, but the suspension slumps to the left. For the rest of the mission I have to drive lopsided, constantly counter-steering just to keep the truck on the gravel road. But everyone works together to keep our war bus on track--my teammates give turn instructions, read the map, and scan the road for more mines. When we're free of immediate danger, we send someone back to base to retrieve an ATV so that we have a forward scouting element. At one point we position two machinegunners with nightvision scopes at the lip of a valley to provide cover as we drive the HEMTT down an exposed valley, then taxi them back to us on the ATV. The sequence of events, the chatter, the wounds and kills we rack up, all developed because we happened to run over a mine and our tires got shot up. Getting flexible Arma's capacity for stimulating camaraderie, atmosphere, and problem-solving, in other words, is fully intact. The feeling of ownership that arises over these moments between you and your squadmates sticks in your brain. Central to this fun is how malleable Arma continues to be for its community, which before launch day had published almost 1,500 missions to Steam Workshop . Assuming you have an internet connection, this well of content compensates for the absence of an official campaign at launch, which will integrate in three free monthly installments beginning in October. On the ground, a new stance adjustments system is the best thing that's ever happened to infantry combat in Arma. Holding the Ctrl key as a modifier while tapping W or S cycles between nine vertical stances, and you can also take a horizontal step in addition to using Q or E to lean. You feel articulate--making small body adjustments while behind cover initially feels like finger gymnastics, but the system makes more types of cover viable and more types of weapons viable in that cover. Coupled with the general smoothing of movement and the near elimination of Arma 2's uninterruptible, sluggish animations, running and gunning should finally feel comfortable to average FPS players. On the opposite end of your gun, though, AI remains a shortcoming. Arma 3's enemies share plenty of their ancestors' DNA, which means that they oscillate between being eagle-eyed snipers at one moment and static, dumb, 3D silhouettes evocative of a light gun arcade game another. Their greatest flaw is that they lack personality, which mostly resigns them to being targets rather than soldiers. A few sparks of intelligence did impress me--after we killed the rest of his squadmates, I watched a rifleman flee for the first time in Arma, setting up a tense shot where I had a narrow few seconds to snipe him in the back before he disappeared behind trees. This is the sort of human behavior I'd love to see more of, stuff like blind-firing, limping, throwing smoke grenades for cover, claiming abandoned vehicles, or looting bodies for supplies--anything that would lessen the predictability. Friendly AI is even worse, unfortunately, because they're typically your responsibility. It's absurd that my squad's medic won't patch me up when I'm bleeding right next to him unless I order him to. Pathfinding isn't reliable, either: I spent five minutes repeating the Move to and Get in vehicle commands, trying to convince a freed hostage and my squadmate to cross the map so we could finish the mission. They wouldn't budge. The crux of the issue is Arma's mile-long command menu, which scatters dozens of commands across all 10 numerical keys. Like the enemy AI, though, there are glimpses of authentic behavior. I felt like a proud parent when my AI fireteam, unprompted, broke formation and spread themselves behind cover during a raid on a cluttered factory. Breaking formation Bohemia's graphical improvements are substantial enough to make Arma 3 one of the most visually impressive games on any platform. Altis (and its little-brother island Stratis) are rendered with incredible clarity, illuminated by lighting that produces pink sunsets, blinding solar glare, and golden afternoons. I love the way the earth feels textured as you jog and crawl through it--gravel, sand, and grass all emit different sounds under your boots. I'm mostly happy with the graphical performance I've been getting on the three configurations I've been playing Arma 3 on. The caveat being that my framerate varies based on where I am on the map, the number of objects and enemies, and if I'm playing online. On a Core-i7 X990 at 3.47 GHz and two AMD Radeon 5970s on Very High settings, I've gotten 17-25 FPS on one single-player mission and 40-50 on another. Multiplayer is where I found the least-consistent performance. On a Core-i7 870 and GTX 780, I can get 55 FPS in a tight, six-player scenario on Very High, but 20 in a large-format mission like Wasteland . Tinkering with Arma 3's 25 configurable video settings allowed me to improve these numbers a little, but even dialing down the quality to standard or low on my rigs barely helped while playing large multiplayer missions. The scripting or complexity of some scenarios simply seems to bottleneck performance regardless of your settings. Some specific actions also consistently produced framerate dips for me, (Sorry ran out of words)

review: This is an interesting game.. It features a unique experience from mil-sim to even a "life" simulator. it is a community driven and built game that allows community built missions, modes and mods, which makes it the ultimate sandbox for anyone. My experiences come from a realism unit focusiong on USMC structure and we use mods for comms and weapons/vehicles. My derp around screw around, comes from mass server altis life and wasteland. I'm also taking an introduction into coding and this game has opened me up to a world of creation, of which can be shared by the click of the button to all of Steam. Also, this game has its issues, its Arma. (slang for, This  is normal). Low scoring or reviewing this game is not logical or well-supported. Play a game or two of Arma 2 and tell me, animations/physics/lighting/mechanics/engine/graphics/rendering/ease of use hasn't improved. The game is a massive upgrade from its predecessors, however lacking a lot of content, and in the end, is an excellent infantry simulator. I gice the game a 10/10. Simply for its improvements and the abilities given to the community. This game will surely grow to be greater then the developers could ever think to make it, if it hasn't already.

review: Arma 3 is a great military simulator which allows you to explore a VERY large map called Altis and a smaller map called Stratis with other players which leaves you fighting off the enemys who have control of the island. Just recently Bohemia servers have shut down due to Steam buying out the Bohemia and for some unknown reason, we Arma 3 fans are still waiting for the servers to go online. It has been almost 3 months now and still no sign of the servers. This game is best when you are able to play with friends as I dont reccomend purchasing this game until Bohemia Interactive and Steam sort out the server issues. Unfortunately, Arma 3 is going to be sitting in my Steam library gathering cobwebs until the servers are back online.

review: Look at the amount of hours I have played and guess if I recommend it. Good: Military realism Large map Can't run and gun like COD Almost everything about the game You can be/do pretty much anything in this game. Even a stupid mod that's highly popular called Atlis Life where you.. well... live life as an avatar. Graphics are always a plus, if your computer can run it. Bad: Even after a year of full release, it still has glitches. Fatigue system is a pain in the , but realistic(ish) It's plain and simple. If you love a legitimate military tactics, movement, feel over all, then this game is for you. The modding community is over the top and will release content for this till arma 5 comes out. (Notice I skipped arma 4, that's how dedicated people are to these games). If you like running and gunning.... you'll rage quit within the first day. Highly recommended. Join us on EUTW

review: It's the dead of night on the CSAT-occupied island of Stratis, and the peaceful darkness is about to explode into chaos. I'm leading one of two spec-ops teams on a mission to liberate the leader of a local guerrilla faction and return him to the much larger island of Altis. A British squad is in charge of the actual rescue. Our job is to cause as much trouble across the island as possible to distract the CSAT forces and give the British the opening they need. Over the next hour, that's precisely what I do. Inserting by boat from the northwest coast, I head south and raid an ammo dump before cutting across to the eastern shore to destroy a heliport. Then my squad suppresses an enemy encampment from a hillside near the centre of the island as I swoop in from the west to flank them. Yet before we can regroup, my entire team is killed by reinforcements descending from the north, and the British still need more time to complete their mission. Alone, I rush to the southernmost tip of the island, where I blow up a fortified anti-air position before escaping by riding a quad bike back through the swarming enemy forces to the extraction point, where the boat takes me home. Arguably the biggest complaint about Bohemia Interactive's post-Flashpoint games is that their campaigns haven't used the magnificent landscapes they create to their full potential. The first Arma's campaign was a hastily cobbled-together disappointment, while it took a certain zombie-survival mod to harness the austere and foreboding power of Arma 2's Chernarus. That Arma 3 uses half an island for just one of its twenty-odd missions is indicative of Bohemia's effort to resolve this ongoing issue. Indeed, taken as a whole, Arma 3 strives to make this deep and impenetrable military simulator series a more comprehensive, more engaging and more user-friendly experience. It isn't completely successful, but I had an awful lot of fun watching it try. While Arma 3 was officially released back in September, the campaign has been portioned out in three substantial chunks over the last six months. Each chapter is a self-contained entity with its own story arc and theme; combined, they tell the tale of the excitingly named Corporal Ben Kerry and his role in the war over the fictional Mediterranean island archipelago of Altis and Stratis, waged between four different factions. The first part, Survive, is geared towards introducing players to Arma. It takes place entirely on the smaller of Arma 3's two islands, Stratis, and sees Kerry banding up with a group of NATO survivors after the local Altian Armed Forces, backed by NATO's eastern equivalent CSAT, rise up against the local US garrison. For the most part, missions are small-scale skirmishes that keep you firmly in the "follower" category while teaching you the basics of minimising your daily lead intake. Rescuing a downed helicopter crew instructs you on establishing a defensive position, while a midnight liaison with local militia explains how to flank and clear buildings. It's hardly the campaign's most spectacular stage. Story-wise, it's let down by voice acting that ranges from passable to cringeworthy and a script that understands military radio chatter but not how human beings interact with one another. Even here, though, Bohemia's approach to maximising the assets it has built is apparent. Missions are nearly always multi-staged, with objectives being added and changed as events rarely go according to plan. While it smoulders rather than sparks, Survive concludes strongly and the momentum is carried over into Adapt, definitely the best of the three chapters. This introduces Altis, a masterwork of environmental design. I could write another 1000 words on its remarkable sights and sounds: its misty dawns, crimson dusks and streetlight-speckled nights. But what's most important is how the detail that's gone into mapping the landscape's undulations - the lumps and bumps, hills and valleys - plays into the game's combat. A little rise in the ground might be the difference between life and death as you throw yourself down in evasion of the fiendishly accurate enemy AI. When they stop to reload, you'll rush to locate a better vantage point, order your men to "find cover" (an extremely handy new command) and plant half a dozen bullets in your opponent's surprisingly tough body. Tactics are vital in Arma 3, but it's terrain that really makes the difference between success and failure. It's crucial to learn this before Adapt begins, because the difficulty suddenly ramps up. The first mission sees you alone, unarmed and with a city full of enemy soldiers between you and any kind of safety. At this point, setting saves to unlimited using Arma's highly customisable difficulty levels becomes a necessity. Fittingly, after Survive, you will die many, many times. That said, it's important to note that combat is more satisfying than before thanks to improved animations, smoother weapon handling and better optics - meaning the challenge stems from your opponents rather than clumsy controls and slow-to-aim weapons. Adapt also changes the way you play. It gives you a squad to control, which is a mixed blessing. AI units tend to be much more perceptive of enemy locations than you are and are especially useful when facing down tanks and APCs, but they also require a fair amount of babysitting to keep them alive, and the lack of changes to Arma's squad commands means this can be a chore. Especially problematic is AI ammo management; your teammates go through bullets like a swarm of locusts through a corn crop, and resupplying them in the field is a nightmare in Arma 3's clumsy interface. Alongside its story missions, which include the brilliant raid on Stratis described above, Adapt also introduces an open-world component. From your base you can go out on "Patrol" and complete multiple optional objectives, from clearing enemy checkpoints to smoking out a sniper hidden inside a labyrinthine industrial complex, all while collecting weapons, ammo and equipment to use during the main missions - though the clunkiness of Arma's inventory management means this is less enjoyable than it should be. If you want to bring stuff back to base, you need to find a vehicle and load it item-by-item from your own inventory, while before each mission the game defaults to a standard equipment loadout and items you previously had can be lost in this process. After the meatiness of Adapt, the final chapter Win feels fleeting by comparison, with only six missions to its name. But they're also the most spectacular, displaying vast, combined-arms battles that cover sweeping areas of Altis. It's strongly reminiscent of the opening of Operation Flashpoint, but with you in control rather than being led by an AI squad leader. In these closing stages you can call in devastating artillery strikes and helicopter assaults, simultaneously demonstrating the sheer destructive power of modern warfare and your own insignificance in the scale of things. Story-wise, it's also the most interesting segment, making unsettling use of its near-future setting and offering a branching conclusion that is fascinating, whichever direction you take. Arma 3's campaign is a big, powerful, deeply engrossing thing, but there is one disappointment: its lack of vehicular missions. Since the story focuses on one not particularly interesting character who is ultimately a grunt, there are no tank missions, no helicopter missions and no jet missions. I can understand why, to a point: Arma's vehicles, especially its airborne offering, take time and effort to learn to control. Moreover, in these kinds of games infantry combat tends to be more enjoyable anyway. On the other hand, Flashpoint offered plenty of vehicle engagements during its campaign without any issue, and it's frustrating that, 13 years on, Arma's campaigns still lag behind it in terms of breadth of experience. 8/10

"Arma 3 Karts" I thought it was blasphemy, a ruse if you will, but after throwing my money at the screen, then realising that buying things on Steam doesn't work like that, I purchased the DLC. The handling is supreme, and Arma 3 is now what I'd call a finished game. 11/10 would Go-Kart again

For the Multiplayer, well i bought it just for "Altis Life" - Mod :D But this Mod is Awesome! Altis Life is an Role Playing Mod with Standart RP Rules (on the most servers). You can chose to be a Normal Guy, Farming Salt, Gold, Diamonds or go Fishing, selling the Stuff for better equipment, Cars or Helicopters. Or.. you can Farm Cannabis, Cocain and Heroin. Become a Rebel and Fight the Police and the System. Steal Money from the good people and so on. Every Cop inside the Game is a Real Player! You chose !

This game is as close to the military as your gonna get without giving up your life for 4 or so years (at least from a civilian's point of view). Enough content to cover land, sea, and air.

review: Arma 3, contrary to popular belief, is a very good game. It really just depends on who you are, or who you play with. If you spend your entire time playing Arma 3 hoping to have an experience similar to Dayz, you won't have much fun. What you really need to do is join servers that are running gamemodes such as Domination, and coordinate with your entire team. Keep in mind that Arma 3 is nothing like Battlefield or Call of Duty because you have to pay attention to the global picture of the entire map rather than just what you are currently aiming at. You have to talk to your squad, even if it is people you don't even know very well, because everyone contributes to the well being of the squad. All in all, Arma 3 is an extremely fun game as long as you play it correctly.

review: ArmA 3 feels like a step down compared to ArmA 2 with its smaller samey feeling arsenal (That doesn't even include some short of shotgun.You heard me NO shotguns.) and rather boring missions. It's poorly optimized and needs a lot of work to become a proper successor to its more entertaining and vastly superior predecessor. Recommended for ArmA fans that are far more hardcore than me who have probably already bought it. For a finished game it sure is buggy :/. Do you have a beefy PC but are still unable to run ArmA 3 with a consistent FPS higher than 30? Left click on ArmA 3 press properties click launch options and insert the following: -noSplash -cpuCount=8 ultra If your CPU count is lower change it to 4. If you are still getting bad FPS change ultra to high or very high. Running ArmA 3 on higher usually makes it run better then when it's lower. Logic, right? I get 50/70 frames. Very random.

review: As the 3rd installment to the Arma series the quality that this game brings to the table is unpresidented in any other Arma game. With the RV4 it adds in DirectX 11 to bring stunning new visuals never seen before in the franchise. The clunky mechanics from Arma 2 have been reworked and are now fluid as ever in Arma 3. Although the game was rough at launch with performance the series of patches have vastly improved performance and by far is the smoothest Arma to date! Multiplayer is better than ever with the new vehicles new guns! Overall i'd recommend this product to anyone who likes realistic shooters!

review: Arma 3 is a war simulator unlike anything you must have ever seen, it develops the ArmA legacy even further. If you've only played FPS shooters like Call of Duty, Battlefield, Crysis and the like, then you've been living under a rock all this while. You've let the class of "War Simulators" completely pass you by. In a nutshell, Arma 3 is an open world war scenario with two intricately detailed maps featuring places for all kinds of warfare. Whether your choice is to wage war in the complex blocks in Kavala on a sunny morning, or you choose to dive in and assault a coastline on a cloudy night at 11 PM, ArmA 3 is a thing for everyone. Anything in real life combat, can be done here. ArmA 3 has unprecedented levels of sandbox freedom, allowing you to script and create complex scenarios in and outside the editor. Arma 3 lets you customize your weapons extensively. Choose your ammunition, gun and attachments and go out on the field to decimate your enemies. Accurately designed ballistics ensure you always have a winning edge on your enemies. So what do you wait for? Strike hard, Strike fast.

review: Well am an Arma 2 Veteran i was skeptical on getting the 3rd game of the series and man am I sad to say this game is a blow to the series while there are many new things that do look and feel rather amazing most of the content was cut out by the DEVS due to unknown reasons,lack of weapons,vehicles,maps and general content makes the game feel rushed and unfinished. I have been there since alpha and yet not much honestly has changed I think the creators let this game slip with intention since little information is given about new content from the community managers and DEVS themselfs making this just another generic OCD/ADD combat shooter. It may best to say wait 5 years until most of the content will be added by the fanbase and community modders . . .

It has a great modding community and most content from the previous games can be used in this one if you own them. Try the demo of Arma II because this is very similar except for the updated engine. DO NOT expect this to be Call of Duty, they are not comparable. It is a millitary simulator that requires teamwork and leadership to become successful at. I believe this is the best millitary simulator on the market to date.

review: Terrible game, developers highly ignored optimizing and fixing bugs in the game. Almost unplayable on multiplayer because of the lack of hit detection, sky rocketing desync, and minimal power usage resulting in less than 20 fps at times. Keep in mind I have a $1200 rig. Now for the good: The concept and basic features of the game are wonderful. If the developers worked out the kinks involved with the networking/performance aspect of the game it would be a five star game. That is the only reason I do not recommend it. Fix the bugs and it's a wonderful game. As of right now it is unplayable.

review: Never played an ARMA game, but I really liked BF2 Project reality and Early Tom Clancy FPS games. The pre-order was half of the future retail price and included Alpha and Beta access--so I thought I would give this a try. What I found was a half baked game that was overly reliant on expected croud sourcing assets. The game was bare bones with almost no missions, the engine was sub-par, controls not thought through, and gameplay generally uninspired. If I'd bought a physical copy, I would be selling it right now. Huge dissapointment. If you aren't already a fan of the franchise, you may want to pass or at least wait until it goes on sale for <$10.

Apart from these issues, Yes. Will i support any of there future titles? HELL NO

review: I'm not sure, this game was in Beta test for quite a short time, yet in Alpha test for a decade (bought it in Alpha). Now, you'd expect almost all the issues/bugs would be removed in the beta state, yet not with this one. It still is riddled with bugs and most of the vehices aren't even added. When I made this ''review'', there was only 1 plane, yet there are choppers/tanks, but considering their recent titles that one plane isn't enough especially when the game's actually not optimized properly and still causes lag issues on multiple platforms in multiplayer. Not to mention they didn't have the single player features (campaign) added, it was added about after a month when the game was already RELEASED. These things should of had all been done in Beta!

review: Mechanically, Arma 3 is outstanding, with controls that are smooth while still portraying the weight of a human body. Weapons feel great and firefights remain intense both against AI and other humas. Atlis is an impressive map with each square kilometer offering interesting options for firefights. The first two episodes of the campaign are good, and there are some great mods and modes already showing up like Breaking Point and the Universal War Sandbox. It also happens to be the best looking open world game around in terms of sheer realism. I'm genuinely excited to see how this game develops in the coming years.

review: Revised Review: Being a veteran myself I can honestly say that Arma 3 is probably the closest you will get to an accurate military simulator on the combat side. Massive battles that are done tactically, using infilitration, parachuting, convoys, or simply being flown in by another player on a blackhawk. This is war. The first thing I'm gonna get out of the way is the only bad thing I can think of, framerate. I have a decent computer myself but still suffer from 20-30 fps at best. It's not terrible, but can become frusterating. The graphics of the game are well done. Nothing insane here but for how large the maps are, the terrain, vehicle, character, and weapon models are all done very well. Animations are pretty smooth for the most part, and weapon models are accurate to their real life counterparts. Audio in the game is great. Helicopters can be heard, even when they can't be seen, gunfire echos through the streets, and tanks can be heard rumbling their way through the hills. The gameplay is where Arma shines. There is virtually unlimited possibilities to what you can do since the game has mod support. There is an astounding number of weapons and vehicles in the game, and the amount of control you get over them is fantastic. Multiple game modes, such as wasteland (similar to the DayZ mod), RPG (you earn money for new weapons), deathmatches, and large scale warfare on giant maps, with multiple objectives. Many other game modes exist and some are really great. Join in squads with your friends and have a role for each of you, then attempt to escape the island while enemy forces hunt you down. Arma really brings excitement when it comes to firefights, with accurate bullet drops and mechanics, making some fights last awhile, or some simply be over in seconds. The campaign is interesting and will keep you entertained for hours alone, then you can jump into the vast amount of multiplayer options. Altogether, this game is a must have for any military, Arma series, or shooter fans.

review: Got the game recently (having never played an Arma game) and although i had heard that the controls were difficult i was willing to spend the time learning them, what got me is that as soon as you enter the multiplayer, you hit walls upon walls of text that the game doesn't tell you anything about.I understand most of it is user-created content but that doesn't stop it from being incredibly confusing joining a server and being told little to nothing about what is going on, you just know its either "Altis Life" or "King Of The Hill" etc. It kinda makes you think they could've done with a few tutorial servers with different game modes so new players aren't extremely confused from the off. Well the first time i went in to a multiplayer game (in a server about 2/3rds full) the chat channels were completely dead, all i heard was what presumably was a fellow noob constantly saying "Hello" (There was someone else talking occasionally but the sound quality was so grainy i couldnt make out anything he was saying) . I figure everyone is on the teamspeak server as from what I'd heard "everyone uses ts on Arma" but nowhere in game did it say where the name/address of the ts server and when i asked in the sidechat the other lobby members told me to stop using sidechat. Similar experiences occurred on the few other servers i tried going on as well. The game shows a complete lack of effort to help anyone who has never played an ARMA game before, how to play the online, and the people playing it seem antisocial and uninterested in helping either. Judging from some of the reviews. the campaign isn't very good either but at least its playable, I'll probably end up on that for a bit in the hope that one day, if i ever manage to get my head around the multiplayer, i won't get constantly mowed down and showed up for the complete noob i am at this game! Overall probably a good game for those new to the Arma series if you have a spare 20 odd hours you are willing to put in to figure out the what is going on in the online game modes, what addons and mods you will need for the game, what ts servers you need to be in, what the controls are, then you will probably reach a stage where you can enjoy the game. But if you don't have that amount of spare time to search the internet for help guides, tutorials, and server info, then you will probably find the game very frustrating. Not at all noob friendly.

review: Finally a game that is not casual targetandshoot, in ArmA you first have to plan your mission and then 95% of the time run around. But that feeling when running to an OP, taking position, knowing that you are gonna open fire soon...Just awesome. As in the old ArmAs you get a lot of online mods, but also a very complicated control system and not much for your hardware. But i mean: It still looks very well on a Mid-End PC. Also it is cool that Vehicels are powered rightly (some a bit OP, Bohemsia keeps patching, so...) and that you can discover the Whole huge map So, I would say definitly buy, if you are clear that this is a simulation, not just a Battlefield or CoD

review: So I played this game when it was free for 3 days and I only played it for a little while. First of all the game was not very well optimized and I found it to be pretty laggy especially in multilipayer with around 50 people playing and bullets and missles going everywhere. I thought that this was a really releastic game becuase of just how many people there are in a game and how its like a big fire fight. I would have to say for people who have lots of money to spend on games, go ahead and buy it if you have a gaming machiene that can handle this game and get playable frame rates. (Recommend an $1000 PC Minimum) But if you play free games like me and don't have an extreme PC build I don't really recommend the game that much.

review: Part of the appeal of this game is the realism (i.e. ballistics, stamina, environment), which positive reviewers rave about. The realism makes this the most exciting and action-packed pc game I've ever played. The majority of the game is sprinting for five seconds to a badly rendered bush or maybe a tree with three sides, then having to pause for 30 seconds so that your aim will calm itself. How did the game know I have Parkinson's? You'll unload three clips trying to shoot one contact 100 yards away in an open field, and feel ecstatic after staring and shooting at one another for a good minute. It's almost like playing tag with good friends, except for the part where someone gets tagged. I did enjoy the sounds of bullets whizzing by, and I'm sure the AI experienced the same bliss since we did nothing but lie on the ground and fire seemingly randomly at one another. Ironically, when well- hidden behind a tree or rock (or other random cover) and peek around the corner, the AI suddenly becomes an expert marksman and kills you with one shot. That'll teach me for trying to be tactical. Save points are set within the game, and waypoints are even more predictable, leading to non-frustrating replays and non-existent monotony. There's no real way to be stealthy or use environmental advantages because the AI has Xray and auto-aim, so that's a relief. Your squad will most likely make all the kills, and leave you in the dust since stamina does not affect them the way it affects you. Also, certain characters have infinite health so there's no real urgency in helping with firefights. Time to kick back and let everyone else have fun. Then there's the weird controls, which will have you rolling on the floor (literally) out of cover right into incoming fire. That's the last thing the enemy expects! You'll try to scavenge weapons and ammo from fallen soldiers, only to be shot dead while trying to navigate the extremely simple and intuitive equipment interface. I guess that's my fault for not being able to perform 400 actions per minute. As a plus, you can steal clothing and make yourself wear glasses or bandanas which have no real tactical advantage besides trolling a fallen soldier. I forgot to mention that you'll bleed out and die if you don't bandage your arm with a first aid kit after being shot anywhere on your body. That's actually pretty realistic, since it's a medical fact that your arm is the hub of all your blood circulation and health. As you're wounded, aim and mobility decrease to the point that's so real you won't be able to contribute in any positive way, except to be cannon fodder for the enemy. It's ok though, when you die you'll get to respawn with full health. But then when you restart the checkpoint, you can't fire your gun because there's apparently a glitch in programming (or is it?) which doesn't allow reloading. This is great, since the game already saved your progress and you're stuck with one bullet you can't fire anyways. The realism is scary. I would not recommend this game for $60, or even on sale for $30. I would wait till the price increases to at least $99.99, so that way you'll maximize your regret for spending so much money on a game that's so realistic, you could go outside with an airsoft gun and have the exact same experience. Just make sure you're terrible at everything and the illusion will be complete. Sorry, not illusion; simulation.

review: A highly tactical kind of FPS, what with it being a mil-sim and all. This is a great game for those who want to take FPS at a slower and more calculating pace, and it definitely rewards you for being a professional player. That said, the player base that actually has groups to play with are very professional, regardless of age. I do recommend this game to those who seek a quasi-realistic experience at being a soldier.

review: Although not impressed with the "Futuristic" setting (equipmemt wise) ARMA3 is the best choice for those who seek "the something else". Mainstream/arcade-ish game-modes from other games are already there for those who wany "Something easy" while you can also achieve maximum complexity in custom missions with custom community addons. Almost ANY situation/equipment CAN BE created/recreated in ARMA verse -especially with the updated engine/functions. Of course..it's not a secret IT IS a VERY demanding game on your hardware-but performance optimizations will be more visible by the time. Bohemia Interactive have never let their ARMA fans without support/optimizations/free content in the past. I don't have reasons to believe something will change in the wrong way in the immediate future :)

review: Much improved over Arma II. Loads of downloadable content especially for multiplayer/co-op. The AI is smart enough so that each scenario is not exactly the same every time. On the down side, development seems to be a bit slow. There are still some glitches, and patches aren't released regularlly. Some of the keystrokes take some getting used to. If you are using mouse/keyboard, do yourself a favor and practice flying the helos before attempting to use them in missions. 4/5 stars.... with potential! Loads of fun to play

review: Arma 3. The first of the Arma series I've ever played, and I'm regretting the fact that it is. Arma 3 is a immense game, full of content, incurable graphics, and a great military simulator. Arma 3 isn't for those expecting fast-pace action like the Call of Duty titles, or Battlefield. This isn't a shooter you can just go running in gun's blazing and come out with 20hp after defeating five enemies. Arma requires you to be tactical, strategic, calculated, and defensive. The A.I. are quite capable of dropping you with one shot if you don't use your surroundings to there fullest, (even on recruit settings they are more than capable). Arma 3 does have some bugs, but these bugs aren't game breaking like some titles. FPS can drop suddenly, A.I. is sometimes broken, you can become stuck in walls or on a rock, then be crush, and sometimes vehicles tend to not respawn to control's. (This is rare though). Arma 3 overall is a great game. Were this military shooter really shines is the multi-player, and it's modding community. There are a ton of different modes out there for your game play. From custom missions, to Co-op, and even RPG with a big community support. This game, with friends, and even by yourself, is great. Overall, I give the game a 8/10 and I'm looking forward too many great times on this shooter.

review: The single player campaign, despite being released in 'episodes' is one of the most immersive and exciting Single Player games I have played. A wide variety of missions, a storyline that that keeps you interested and obvioulsy great locations from both Stratis and the huge Island of Altis too. If single player isnt your thing, then there is sure to be an 'infinite' amount of co-op missions made by players and mods for the Multiplayer as well that will always be entertaining. Still doesn't cut it? Learn to use the map editor and create your perfect scenario that you would like to play out in Arma 3 either by yourself, with a mate of with all of your friends if you so desire. 9/10, definitely recommend! Altis was very poorly optimised on release but it has improved a lot since then. Even I can run it on medium/normal with a 560 ti and an i7 2600 at a respectable framerate in most cases. Hope this helps! See you on the battlefield!

review: ARMA 3 So when I saw this game for the first time, I thought that soon will release another excellent piece ArmA. However, the first disappointment was already in anticipation, as the extremely small amount of technology and absence campaign. But this disappointment disappeared when issuing the first chapter of the campaign was excellent and the new technique also appeared. But I will not criticize. I must say that the guys from Bohemians are struggling and working hard to repair, etc. Graphically it's a big shift but a new engine this could offer more. The playing area is huge and real and opens new possibilities for mods. Technical equipment and weapon was terrible at the beginning and the newly added equipment was broken but gradually improves and fixes. Despite this, however, it is compared ARMA I and II, step backward. Personally, I think that would Bohemia Interactive could use a better future. On the other hand, however, the campaign is excellent, what more can I say. Final verdict: ArmA III is an improved forward, but it is incredibly untapped potential. If it Bohemia Interactive put in the time and dedicated technicians and armor, or even a new engine, so it would be something completely different, much better. 8/10

review: In brief: - If you're an Arma enthusiast, Arma 3 is a _must_! - If you don't know the Arma series, this game is a MUST :) ! Infantry simulator, with the ability to drive vehicles (Land, Air, Sea) with high degree of fidelity and real simulation. Physics, gameplay, story (for single players), graphics. The game is just awesome. Warning: if you're picky (might commit suicide on the first pseudo-bug encountered) or you like FPS action, John-Wayne-style, this IS NOT for you. This is more a simulator than a shoot-em-up game, where tactics, speed of wit and experience play an invaluable role in the missions. And sometimes, things don't behave as expected... But rarely... But it happens... However, if you like to zero up/down your sniper scope to compensate for the distance, if it makes you happy to carry a couple of weapons in your backpack, your magazines in your bandolier and night vision goggles on your combat helmet, if it matters for you to enter a vehicle and find most of the internals working (like speed/fuel/RPM gauges, mirrors, screens...), if you like UAV's and small drones that fit in your backpack, if you like to select your ammo type (tracer, belt, regular mag), if you find it awesome to play in an environment with kilometers of view-distance, if it engages you to play a game where there is no health bar, but every bullet counts (both the ones you deliver or receive), if you like to customize the game and create your own scenarios and campaigns and play them with your friends, if you like to play Zeus (yup, the Greek God, with the Lightning bolt)... If... If... If all (or most) of the above apply to you, well, this game is for you. This is one of the games I can't recommend enough.

It's simulation, so no 360quickscope, no gender-related bashing, no "noobs vs pro" to a certain degree, Simply one of the best simulations game in existence. It's basically a military simulations, with multiplayers and good gameplay, with multitudes of community mods. With massive content created by community, you buy this game, you could play more than just 1 game. Yeah, wanna play The Sims? Arma 3 have it. Wanna play Tank Battle? Arma 3 have it. Wanna play Ace Combat? Arma 3 have it. Wanna play racing games? Arma 3 have it. Wanna play... oh come on, try them for yourself! I'm not paid to write long review, so I'm gonna leave it here. Oh, and zombies... Hehe, what's better than playing zombie in Arma themed world? Download a zombie mod, use a script to spawn tank, and have fun!

review: ArmA 3 is an excellent game for 2 reasons. Number one, its engaging and immersive and fun, and number two is the fact that Bohemia Interactive cares about its modding community (Hence the competition "Make ArmA, not war"). But ArmA 3 comes with a few flaws. Chief among these, in my opinion, is optimization as I own a very good mid-level PC and I seem to be getting around 16 to 20fps. Also is the lack of vehicles and weaponry, although I know that is set to change, I would have liked the game to be complete and not an "about to finish up Beta". But if you have some friends that are interested, then why don't you visit the islands of Altis and Stratis. Live a new life in Altis or Stratis Life, fight for survival in Wasteland, or work together to defeat OPFOR AI in Invade and Annex. Just bare in mind that this is a Military simulator, so no run and gun or Rendezook's here, just good ol' fashioned tactical warfare.

review: This is not a game, this is a simulation if anything. Admittedly its not really war, and its not a good representation of the horrors of conflict, but its significantly better than Call of duty's over romanticized grade 6 representation. As for worth, this is not a game you can really quantify. Unlike many games where the campaign length or the multiplayer dictate its quality, this is much more than a game. If you played and liked Arma 1, or 2, buy 3. And if youre thinking about buying Arma 3, do it. The endless modibility, the mission creation and steam workshop, and the rich community are what make the Arma series a true beauty. Not to mention the Multiplayer and Campaign are kick .

review: I got the game while it was free for two days and it was awsome, I loved everything about the game, but it was a little to graphic for my windows 7. But trust me this is worth 59.99. But make sure your PC can take the graphics.
game-hours: 566.4
review: Despite many of its early faults, Bohemia Interactive - as well as the always extremely-active ArmA community of modders et al - really pulled the ArmA universe to a whole new level. The graphics are only the beginning of the immersive environment: realistic projectile ballistics (as well as surprisingly detailed terminal ballistic effects), well-done animations (especially of essential combat tasks, like reloading), and the variable stance/lean system. Unfortunately, there are a few problems that have plagued ArmA since the beginning of time, namely the AI. I say this because even after becoming intimately familiar with the game and the teammate command system, detailed commands are bulky at best. AI as a whole tends to be relatively oblivious when it comes to medium- and "crew-served" weapons; the suppressive fire command does absolutely nothing with your machinegunners and autoriflemen, and anti-tank gunners apparently forget they have 15 pound rocket launchers strapped to their backs and decide their small arms are the most effective weapons against MBTs. The aerial platforms' damage models could be improved as well (i.e.: losing parts of the aircraft when you clip a tree or wires rather than just exploding), however, this would require a lot more work than may be worth it at this point - perhaps later in A3's lifetime. Fortunately to me, despite these (at times) fatally annoying flaws (*cough* AI *cough*) nothing in the virtual world comes close to the level of accuracy (both from the vanilla BI platform and the ArmA communities' multiple mods) that ArmA 3 delivers.

review: This is, hands down, the best military simulator available. There is a steep learning curve and it's not very "plug and play," but A3 can deliver an incredibly rewarding experience if authenticity and realism are up your alley. The Arma series has proven to be both a fun combined arms shooter as well as an invaluable training tool.

review: Arma 3 is a eagerly welcomed upgrade from Arma 2. The new stance system, upgraded engine, and water gameplay truly helps you experience the life of a military operator. The best part is that the modding community is stronger than it was for arma 2, with mods ranging to advanced AI to weapon resting, and custom gear to real world weapons, this game does everything better. Arma is the only game you're going to find where it's a good idea to find you're grandpa's old army handbooks.

review: I had 1071 hours of pure awesomeness so far Cars, Trucks, Tanks, Choppers and Aircrafts are plentiful! You can even get the Kart-DLC just for fun! Not to mention the variety thanks to mods where even more is to come! Even more so are the maps! Locations never get boring. No Mission needs to be the same. Several huge scaled, fully open maps. Even the same mission can be done endless different ways. Thanks to Zeus playing with others while being watched by a Gamemaster the possibilities go through the roof! Play it casual on "King of the Hill" or team up and join a group with regular training sessions with your very own missions. Need to take a break from military duty? Enjoy yourself in "Altis Life" Mod. Just join the Servers and try your career as a Trucker, Bandit, Rebel or Cop! Maybe you'll find a Server where you can join as a medic or you want to play the role of a cult leader? Or just  around with the cops and organize a rally to legalize weed? If you're tired of jumping, hyperactive kids on battlegrounds join the "elite". You sure will find a group to join that will teach you the ways of ArmA, because it's community is awesome.

review: Bugs, Hackers, glitches, Unfinnished patches, Unreleased vehicles, Just right there would be enough to steer away anyone from purchasing this game. However, even with all that I still will play Arma III. The online multiplayer experiences are pheonominal, and definetly unique. If you've ever played massive online sandbox fps, for example, Planetside 2, you will know the kind of online experiences to expect, however unlike other sandbox MMOs, the experiences you get with Arma, are changing. Its not a repetitive, boring, same old grind. Depending on what server you want to play on, you can find yourself, playing with other players against AIs, using modern military tatics and utilizing resources to save a down player pilot, or you can find yourself running drugs in the cover of night trying to evade player police. As long as I have played Arma III, I cannot say that it has been boring for me. However this game is not for everyone, so if your not into the sandbox effect, i would continue on with your day, but if you enjoy unique experiences, and a endless interaction, then I highly recommend Arma III.

review: The quintessential first person military sim for the seasoned military shooter fan or first-person shooter players looking for a bit of depth and substance in a game. This aint arcadey casual rambo CoD or Battlefield rubbish folks. This is the real-world modelled experience every FPS player *should* be looking for. And if you haven't been... you need to take a long hard look in the mirror and tell yourself to lay off the drugs.

review: Only played about an hour so far however, I have enjoyed that small time very much! Way more realistic than ARMA II, which I enjoyed as well. Attachments, costume customization, ragdoll, graphics, swimming, extra animations and improved sniping adds for a great game... Well done although, I cannot rate this yet. If you're looking for a war simulator, this is for you. The graphical optimisation still makes me want to vomit and I have not currently found the character customizer yet. Snipe on!

review: While I do recommend this game, it's only thanks to Arma's modding community. And well in advance. Because, while there already are some very good mods and missions for Arma 3, the vast majority of them simply is additional content ported over from Arma 2. As for the game itself in its vanilla form: thumbs down. Bad net code, bad design, awful single-player campaign, terrible bugs (like AI twitching when you hit them with your fire). Technologically Arma 3 is stuck in 2009. Graphics don't age well, it already looks outdated, while being very demanding resource wise - bad optimization. Unfortunately, Arma 3 doesn't have any competition in simulating combined arms warfare. While every aspect of Arma 3 is done poorly, it's the only game that comes with all of it in one package.

review: There are so many mods and gamemodes for ArmA III that there is no way to "do it all." My favorites include Battle Royale (a Hunger Games PvP mod, sort of), Altis Life (Heavy RP) and Wasteland (pew pew!). It's hard to recommend any game for $60 because almost no game is worth that, but that's what I paid for this one and I have certainly gotten my money's worth in memories since.

The community made content is fantastic and the multiplayer is great if you find a decent enough server. However it does carry over quite a few problems from it's previous installments, some of these incluce -Extreme difficulty navigating buildings due to weird responsiveness of controls -Nearly all of the building are unfournised -TOO MUCH WASTELAND SERVERS -A lot of MP servers are laggy as hell -Vehicles made out of ing paper That aside, It's still the best shooter I have played as of yet.

Like most multiplayer games, Arma 3 works ALOT better with friends becuase it allos for you to have more coordination, which is a very important factor in Arma 3. Its fairly system intensive , but has gone through alot of optimiztion patches, but you should still look into the system requirements before purchasing. I would highly reccomend it, especially if you have friends to play it with.

review: Have you ever been kidnapped before? Well i'll tell you one thing it's terrifying. Me and my 2 armed other friends just fueled up our car and we started leaving the gas station. As we we're leaving 2 men in a suv parked they're car right infront of ours and told us to get out. We we're scared so we attempted to drive away. All of a sudden rubber bullets started flying everywhere. They managed to knock out my friends. I was still conscious but I was terrified. They tied us up with zip ties, put us in a suv and took away our phones. As we we're being kidnapped, I noticed a man hiding behind a building. We we're brought to a junk yard with a tall crane. They brought us all the way to the top. At this point I knew it was the end. They were gonna gonna kill us. All of a sudden I noticed a man at the bottom of the crane. Then I saw 3 cop cars driving towards the junk yard. The 2 armed men started shooting at the cops. As they were shooting I saw a helicopter flying towards us. I was happy and scared at the same time. Bullets started flying everywhere almost hitting every part of my body. One of the kidnappers started climbing down the ladder towards the bottom. Some how I managed to break free of my zip ties and I pulled out a gun and shot the armed man shooting at the cops. Me and my friends started screaming saying we we're the victims. One cop climbed up the ladder and told us to get to the bottom immediately. So we did and as soon as we got to the bottom we asked questions about the situation. We got pardoned of our crimes for killing one of the kidnappers. All of a sudden I heard gun shots flying everywhere. I noticed they were rubber bullets because I saw many cops getting knocked out. I looked up and saw the helicopter flying away probably requesting for back up. I looked back down and noticed everyone knocked out and tied up. The only ones who we're still free was me and my friend. My friend started shooting at the armed man. I tried to peek and see if could get a clear shot but as I peeked gun shots flew near my head. So I looked for cover. I saw my friend on the ground unconscious. I saw the armed man walking towards my friend tieing him up. I had the perfect shot, I aimed my gun slowly towards head and took the shot. I quickly ran towards the police and unrestrained them. They quickly unrestrained my friends. We ended up driving to Kavala in shock of what just had happened. We kept driving and never looked back. That doesn't just happen in any other multiplayer game. I thought it was all just a movie, a show or something. I never knew that could ever happen in a videogame. If you're looking to buy it YOU MUST DO IT NOW. If you ever want an expereience like that then this is the game you should buy. 11/10 -IGN

review: The greatest military sandbox I have ever played, Arma 3 is a lovingly crafted game, giving you an endless amount of scenerios to enjoy. Singleplayer gives you the option to screw around with the editor and either create the insane or the epic. It's a challenge to learn but well worth it. The main campaign can be frustrating at times, but overall is a very excellent experience. User-made content and scenerios add another layer of depth, and Zeus gives an easy integration of that and multiplayer. Multiplayer is by far the strongest point of the game, giving an in-depth experience in many a situation. You can play it as a roleplayer, joining Life servers. You can be a survivor of the wastes in Wasteland, or you can join in many user-made situations. The greatest of the options, however, is proper, team-based objective gameplay. With the right men, squads can work together to accomplish tasks against insurmountable odds. It gives a very strong sense of satisfaction to be part of such a team, and finishing the mission only solidifies that feeling. If you want a very-well made military simulator, offering wonderful graphics, processor-melting situations, teamwork, tension and combined-warfare operation, Arma 3 is for you.

For what an Arma game have and for what the community build for the game its a pretty cheap price you are paying.

review: After recently playing a lot of Arma II, mainly on the game modes 'Island Life' and 'Wasteland' I decided that I absolutly must have this game, and when it went on sale this summer sale (2014) I snatched it up right away; and I can tell you I do not regret it a single bit! Wasteland is a little different to what I was used to on Arma II after only playing it for a short while but fun nethertheless, Zeus is where the game has really caught my attention! Read up on Zeus and give it a shot, you wont regret it if you want more depth to a shooter.

review: Life-like graphics and immersion would give any veteran ptsd. This game will turn anyone into a adrenaline junky instantly. The realistic gameplay and balistics are punishing, but at the same time very rewarding. This third installment of Bohemia's army simulator set in the near future on an existing island offers tactical gameplay and is enjoyed best playing in a squad. Although lone wolfing can be done your survival chances will be smaller. The base game includes access to multiplayer mods like Battle Royal, Wastelands, King of the Hill, Altis Life and Breaking Point. High replayability value and a mission editor for those who like scripting all makes Arma3 worth your money. Requires a mid-high end pc to run properly. The gameplay can be slow. Some mods don't run as well as others and suffer from desync. It has a few bugs and glitches, though nothing game breaking I've experienced so far. The movement can feel clunky and the controls/keybindings may take a while getting used to as there are just so many. I would reccomend Arma3 to anyone who enjoys a serious militairy simulator.

review: There is nothing quite like this game when you are in a full scale firefight, exchanging rounds, helicopters flying over head, your squadmates moving to flank the other team. You aren't alone in this battlefield though, many other firefights could be taking place anywhere on the map. You have free range to go where ever you'd like on the maps which are HUGE. Be forwarned though, you'll want to either ride or drive a vehicle if you have to run anywhere over a couple kilometers. Another warning that this game is NOT like Call of Duty, or Battlefield. It has a much more realistic feeling and is much harder, doesn't have an rpg system of leveling up, and you there isn't a scoreboard. That being said when you pull of something tactical with your squad, or do a combined strike with your team it is so rewarding and fun. There are mods for those of you that don't like just the base game. I haven't played breaking point, but I believe it is much like DayZ (a zombie survival mod with perma-death). There is also king of the hill, wasteland, and a few other things. I mostly play the game for multiplayer, but there is a mission editor to make missions, or to just spawn stuff and fight. There is also an episodic campaign that BI is releasing. Mod tools have just recently been released. The game is early in it's life and is going to hit full stride in a matter of months. If you want to see what's capable check out how ARMA 2 is now. Now on to opinions of techincal things. The sounds in this game are amazing, and the graphics are also phenomenal for such large maps. The lighting is crazy good especially at night. The physics are a little iffy, and there are quite a few bugs. This is to be expected with such a large world though. This is the only game where I actually jump when I get shot at, and find myself instinctly ducking at my computer. There are only two maps, Altis and Stratis. The enviroments have a great mixture from grasslands and forests to villages or cities. In terms of content ARMA 2 has much more, but I believe as the game starts to get older the community and BI will start releasing A LOT more stuff. ARMA 3's urban fighting is awesome. I love it, but ARMA 2 does long engagements better I think. The game is pretty demanding I run it on high with a 7850 XFX Black Edition 2GB, 12 GB RAM, Phenom x6 Thuban 3.2GHz and get okay FPS. The community isn't awful like other FPS games. I love this game for the realistic, tactical, and strategic fighting that everyone has to do. There are mods for other things which makes me think this game has something for everyone. I would recommend this game to someone who is looking for a more mature, serious, and hardcore community than most other first person shooters, as well as looking for a game that is more realistic and team based. If the person loved to play lone wolf, wanted anything they wanted in content right this second, or was easily angered by a bug here and there I wouldn't recommend it to them. TL;DR - Graphics, Sounds, Lighting all amazing. Urban combat is better than ARMA 2. This game is for the person who wants a hyper-realistic first person shooter with heavy emphasis on team work that doesn't mind a bug here and there, and isn't bothered by waiting for more content for a little while.

review: I do recomend this game but it has its flaws. Its a tone of fun and multiplayer is fantastic if you are willing to play a long time. Ussaly in multiplayer their are three types of game modes. RPG,Player vs Player or Player vs AI. In all three it takes some time getting used too, their is a lot of walking and not always in your face combat like cod or bf4. Its a simulator, a really really buggy simulator. And here is where the flaws come in. The game is so buggy and poorly optimized it takes more hardware then is nesseary to run it at good fps. People with some of the latest graphic cards and cpus still get low fps, and the ai is horrible, Not as bad as arma 2 but its not great. With a $100 grahics card and $100 cpu you can play this game on low graphics after tweaking it a bit tho. But that being said the game is really fun still and defintaly worth your time if you are willing to put effort in learning how its played. Also you do not need this game for anything that deals with DAYZ. Dayz standalone does not need this game to run and for some reasion a lot of people thought this.

There is many glitches and long waits to do a mission, but you can see through that and notice the beauty arma 3 gives. There is many fun game modes and even mods to spruce up the adventure. So, pick up a gun a helmet AND GET OUT THERE SOLIDER.

review: This game is plagued with awful optimization issues that make the game practically unplayable in certain mods. For example, in Wasteland, one of the more popular mods out there, the game will literally crash my entire PC every 10-15 mins. I do not have this problem with any other game and have run stress tests on my PC several times. Arma has had optimization issues since Alpha and this really needs to be looked at for Radeon card owners like me (HD 6870). I've done everything from reinstalling drivers to amping up the fan speed to maintain at a very reasonable 60C. Chances are you won't run into this problem. But then again you might and if you do, you're in for a world of frustration. I don't have problem is most other modes. This game is very finnicky and like I said there are some optimization issues as people with weaker specs may be able to run the game better than someone who meets/exceeds recommended specs. Most of my friends have also experienced a couple of crashes in their time with Arma 3. So crashes are not at all a rare occurence in Arma from my experience. Do I recommend this game? Hard to say. Mods like Wasteland and City Life are what really make this game worthwhile and there's a half decent campaign going for it. Grab it at a discount but don't pay full price. Overall: 7.5/10

If you're tired of jumping, hyperactive kids on battlegrounds join the "elite". You sure will find a group to join that will teach you the ways of ArmA, because it's community is awesome.

review: Arma 3 is a very fun game to mess about on but it is quite hard to play seriosly as the AI are absolute  and becuase crashing into a fence at 2 kmh in a car kills you. Apart from this it is a very fun game to play on Altis life but i wouldn't really recommend it that much who actually want to do millitary stuff on it.

review: Fantastic Game!!! It really does need some patches, more weapons and animation fixes (Especially with reloading). But other than that, if you love extremely hardcore games (AND ONLY HARDCORE GAMES, THIS GAME WILL BE BAD IF YOUR GOING TO PLAY IT LIKE COD OR BF), then this is the game for you. Considering the state that its in, i'd give it an 8.5/10 . But when the DEV's fix the glitches and animations, this game will easily score at least a 9.5/10 for a Military Simulation. It has a very steep learning curve, but in 5 hours or so you should get the hang of it :D

review: Not for the light hearted. If you're looking for an easy game/shooter, this is not the one for you. Arma III incorporates aesthetically realistic and functionally sound elements which require not only multifaceted operation but also reticulated execution as such. Arma III caters to the serious gamers who adhere well to solidarity in teamwork and efficacy in realistic measures. With various elements in play such as air support in many forms, ground armour and true ballistics, one needs to be on their top game to prosper in the battlefield of Arma 3.

review: if you are a fan of games that involve warfare, and fps, i strongly reccomend this game. i'll assume that you're not an ARMA veteran, becuase if you are, you dont need to read reviews to know this is a good gam.. simulator. War simulator. good and bad side: it is very hard to learn (it's good because its a simulator not a game, and war is not easy, as CoD would suggest. and it's bad because you're going to die a lot) good side: it is higly entertaining and challenging, the developers worried about things like fatigue and shooting stances and it's effects on accuracy. bad side: tutorials could be better, squad commanding engine is clunky at best, your units will present the bug where they no longer move wuite often, forcing you to continue alone against what you fight with a squad, or loading the game to it's last saved point... what can really piss you off. but the goos outweight the bad. 8.0/10

review: The community is trash, its a mix of team killing, autism, and milsim faglords making  overly complicated. As usual with arma games the optimization is absolute garbage and no matter what you do, you wont hit 60fps consisstantly in online. The guns feel great but have the impact of a pellet rifle, especially the 9mm sidearm NATO gets. The story doesnt make sence but its arma, you dont play it for the singleplayer (i was very disapointed however that the singleplayer was not co-op like in 2). The only way to make this game good is by A) Having a squad that fits you, whether it be autistic milsims, people who are just playing to  around, or a mixture of both, who is in your squad ultimatily deterimines your fun B) MODS MODS MODS MODS. The massive amount of weapon mods spices up the gameplay with familiar faces like the AR platform and ak platform rifles. It makes the game much more realistic ironicly. C) Having lots of patience. Good luck finding a server that is consitantly good that doesnt have faglord admins (Ive been banned for saying "wat" isntead of "what", asking someone to turn down their mic, and using opfor weapons while playing as blufor). 6/10, 8/10 with mods Be advised, when you download mods, even if its something as small as a retexture, you will NOT be able to join 50% of the ing servers because arma doesnt like having us filthy modders join vanilla servers. So the servers will be split and you will be getting upset because of the lack of a filter between vanilla only and mod friendly servers.

review: LITERALLY THE BEST GAME THAT EVER EXISITED EVER

review: Lets start off by saying that, this game is great. Totaly worth all the money. Now this games does have its flaws. the controls are hard to get used to, almost every key on the keyboard is used for something, or multiple things. Also the game engine is broken. if you want this game you need to have one heack of a PC. On single player, full graphics, usually runs nice for me. i do have a GTX Geforce 660 TI and a 4.33 GHZ prosseser. but sometimes on single player, there are massive framerate drops. on multiplayer, running as low as this game goes, im getting about 20-30 FPS. But not always. And now lets get to some more good things. The vide and screen shots dont seem to capture what this game can really do. You can build your own battles, so much to do in multiplayer like regular battles to survivals to get a jjob make money and live your life out with the need to buy guns and fight the rebles and the cops, or be a reble or a cop. the underwater diving and submariens are fun. There is litearaly SO SO SO many gear types, clothes back packs guns attachments, and alot more. so yes, i do highly recomend this game, but only if you have the PC for it.

review: Arma 3 is a combat simulator, meaning that it is realistic and has great physics. The campaign is interesting and has enough combat and action so you don't get bored easily. There are many modes/mods to play on Arma 3 like Wasteland, Altis Life, Domination, King of the Hill, Team Deathmatch, etc. Arma 3's editor is awesome and allows you to make simple bases, missions, or expirements or complex bases, missions, and expirements. The game is $60USD but is definitely worth buying if you're interested in games that include a sandbox, several gamemodes, and many ways to play. If you don't believe the game is worth buying, check out videos on YouTube about several of the game modes in the game and decide off the gameplay you see.

review: This game has me feeling mixed emotions. You jump in to the singleplayer and find the game to be very tactical and have a lot, and I mean A LOT, of controls. Then you get into combat and see that it's not as forgiving as other games. The challenge does make for some entertainment though. After you may want to check out multiplayer. You'll find that there is TONS of servers. Most of them playing mods like Altis life and Wasteland. These are indeed fun. As soon as you jump in you'll see tons of problems. None of which I've seen in singleplayer. The cars will be flying, animations crap up, and horrific frame rate drops. After all of this, I had a lot of fun. I did have friends to play this though. I would recommend this game, BUT it may not be as enjoyable without friends as with them. 8/10. All criticisms aside, it's still a game that is worth your money.

review: Oh yes ArmA 3, one of my favorite games on steam! I dont have almost 300 hours on it for nothing. This is a military simulation game that is set around 2025. But they did not over do it and set it in the future where theres space ships and all that. Even know it does not feel like the ArmA 2, in the way that it is not feeling like it is a true military game, with all the tactics that arma 2 had. But other than that one problem that I have. (Lack of content to) It turned out to be a very fun game that me and my friends love to play. So much to do as in multiplayer, steam workshop with so much into it, you can even get creative with it like my hunger games mission! All in all very fun!

Its tough and unforgiving at first, but when the games mechanics click into place it becomes a tactical battle. The game is great for its multiplayer components and the modding community keep releasing some fantastic mini campaigns and scenarios. The world is huge and the selection of vehicles and weapons gives enough diversity to keep the game fresh. Theres a lot of running and moments where nothing much happens, but this gives you time to admire the impressive graphics and vistas that are on show. Would highly recommend to anyone looking for a patient, realistic and tactical experience of warefare.

review: I have been playing the series when it was first introduce under another name many years back as Operation Flashpoint all the way up to Arma 3. The game is a sandbox of which you can create any battlefield with any numbers of players or AI. IT has many vechicles to use from tanks to chopper to fixed wing military aircraft. The weapons in the game alsohave attachments that change the look and functions of the weapon. It is a very cooperative experence, from many team oriented aspects. You can have one team member flying a jet to provide air cover, to another team member operating artillery, to another team member giving fire support with his 50 cal rifle to a tank giving fire support far off in the distance. The game includes a editor to create your own mission and soon will have a Game master mode (FREE DLC Zeus) to dynamically change any mission while it is being played by many people. It also has a amazing and talented modding community to has been with this game series since its very early incarnations. The developer has also released all the DAta files from Arma 2 and its standalone expansion (Arrowhead and DLCs) to be used to important any of that content into A3. Bohemia Interactive has also provided the tools to use for this such as its 3d modeling software Oxygen. Possibilities The possiblities are nearly endlesss in this, any battle you can imagine can be created with the game in its locations and has far more gameplay depth than most shooter out there. It may be difficult to get used to the gameplay because it relies very heavily on planning, observing and teamwork, as characters and PC's in the game die pretty easily. Graphics 10/10 Sound 10/10 Singleplayer Story *Feel game is not worth $60 without one Multiplayer 10/10 Reviewers Tilt 5/5 10/10 NOTE*** Singleplayer story is coming episodically with each major update to A3. I feel the game at $40 USD it well worth the money, though at $50-$60 USD only worth it if you played a lot of Arma 2 / Operation Arrowhead and want a major upgrade.

review: The best thing about Arma 3 is the open ended content you can play on it, and you can get on a server with 10+ of your friends and play together against the computer or other people. The game has it's glitches (network blips) that can be mitigated by going to a strong server host / game type and making sure you are close to it geographically. This is because the game world is huge, and you can see multiple kilometers away enemies running around and can snipe them from a distance or rocket their vehicle. I am glad that DayZ got me interested in the Arma series as I have had a blast with them so far.

review: Let's get something straight right away: I HATE shooters. I've always been the type of guy who likes RPGs and fantasy/sci-fi games. For me, shooters are just too, how to say this, similar for me. Sure, when you first play a shooter you feel engaged in this world where the battlefield comes to life and every action could have an equal and opposite (i.e. death) reaction: it's really fun. But, as I played more and more shooters, they all started to blend together: play the campaign that involves either terrorists in the Middle-East, Russia vs. America, or a black op gone rouge, and once you're completely bored with that, spend hours on end in the multiplayer. There wasn't that exploration, decisions (in regard to gear and strategy), or overall autonomy that many RPGs offered. Then, I found Arma II. This was one shooter that I absolutely loved, and I easily poured hours into it. The fact you could tackle any mission with any strategy (even going in with no combat appearel), find a server devoted to almost anything (i.e. DayZ, Chenarus Life), and the variety of missions all entranced me, but the main seller for me was the content creator. Never before in ANY game had I been able to create what I wanted to at a moment's notice. Found a mission in the campaign to be unsatisfactory? Just create your own better rendition of it, or even your own original idea from scratch. I had spent days in-game, and when Arma III was announced, you can bet that it was an instant seller for me. When I got it for $60, I was awed by the improved graphics, more introducable interface in the creator, and Workshop content that was amazing. For the first time in a while, I felt as the battlefield had come alive, and every choice I made had dire consequences. It was like I had played a shooter for the first time, which is a magical feeling. Sure, the campaign may be run-of-the-mill, but you can always make your own mission or even campaign. I do have complaints about some of the physics and glitches, but (1. It does its job, and (2. The game has to load a minumun of 17+ spuare kilometres. In comparison, Grand Theft Auto V had a world size of about 32 miles at most. Arma III's biggest map is 270 km for Pete's sake! I'd be suprised if the game only had twenty known glitches. All in all, Arma III is worth more than what you pay for it, and is definitely head-and-shoulders above Call of Duty and Battlefield. I saw a picture on the internet that sums up my feelings: "Command a soldier (image of COD), Command a squad (image of BFF), or command an army or squad or soldier (image of Arma III)". Too whoever posted that picture: I deeply concur with you!

review: This game is breath-taking, whether you like fast-paced gunfights, long-range sniper duels, monster-trucking it with M1A2 Slammer tanks, playing Ace Combat with incredibly fluid movement, raiding a small outpost of hostile forces with a attack helicopter, playing a role in week long, server-wide wars, doing night raids on an enemy research facility, setting up a UAV to perform reconnissance on enemy camps, packing your scuba gear and checking out the lost treasures of Altis and Stratis, or just hopping in a plane and enjoying the wide, vast, beauty of this game! ArmA 3 really dominates the "realistic, military, video game/simulator" genre. Combine some wicked creativity with ArmA 3's mission editor mode and you can create your own missions and scenarios. In the past people have used this to make their own additions to the game, such as new weapons, vehicles, clothing, and even entire maps! ArmA 3's customization is endless and will keep you constantly changing guns, attachments for them, and other equipment to match the situation your in. If you feel like playing solo, ArmA 3 has totally revamped its Campaign mode to keep the player's attention and actually immerse you in the ArmA universe, or forget the single-player all together and go play good cop-bad cop on Altis Life, a user created gamemode, or blowing up tanks and getting in random firefights with other players in Wasteland, also a user-created gamemode. If none of this satisfies you, then you can always just build your own mission, so that you and your own private team can go and enjoy a experience that I guarntee you is as close as you'll get to war before enlisting!

review: Do NOT expect to find a completed Military Simulator upon downloading the game. Do a little research, get the mods from the modding community, and then play. This game will not have many of the most requested features, it's always been up to the fans to mod the game to perfection, don't expect that to change here. WIth the right mods, this game can take hours out of your life. Without the mods, this game will fall short of your expectations. DO NOT get this game if you don't like having your game modded. If the mods aren't out there yet, give it some time. Arma II fans, welcome to the next installment, its about to get intense.

review: Arma 3 is a game that is at its best with friends and well made community missions. -The single player campaign can be difficult for impatient players or someone who is generally "bad", but a "good" player will be able to get through it. -The ingame editor is what gives Arma games the ability to endure, and allows new missions to be made or for weapon testing. However some scripting knowledge (even if its basic) is needed for more dynamic missions. But for some people, 70% of their time may be here. -Multiplayer can be tricky if you can't find any descent servers to play on or don't know a single friend that is willing to play Arma often. -The graphics when set to low-standard quality will not look half as good as any other mainstream FPS, but a computer with a descent graphics card and good cpu will have no problem (unless you take the settings to the extreme). -The Upcoming DLCs and Expansion are hopefully going to add a nice amout of ingame content. -The modding community itself acts as a hub of occasionally quality addons. -Current problems that do still exist in Arma 3 however, area the AI; environmental damage physics; and a lack of diversity in each factions arsenal. -Some pluses for the game are (as mentioned): the communities divotion to the series, the only other game I've personally seen with such a dedicated modding base recently is Skyrim. Another one of the points towards Arma 3 is the maps, not only are they massive in comparision to stock military games, but they also have similar amounts of detail where the developers saw fit. Finally, despite the occasional AI issues, the game really does give players a different experience everytime (once my friend and I fought valiantly against overwhelming odds and lost, we played again and won, again we got wiped immediatly, and again we saw the AI flip their IFV over which was funny (all on the same mission "Combined Arms")). *Old (Currently, Arma 3 is a 7/10 but depending on Bohemia's roadmap, Arma 'could' end with a 9/10.) *New; After Bootcamp and with the Helicopters DLC about to be released (not to mention the Make Arma Not War entries) so far the game is moving along and becoming better as was intended and my score for it has risen from 7/10 to a 8/10.

review: ARMA 3: Arma the almighty miletary sim, Which may catch your eye with the immersive feel and the futuristic feel which i will get to later. I feel that this is a good arma but not on the same par as arma 2 which can i tell you can be either a bag of piss or alot of fun to play with bugs and  ai to some of the most action packed immersive combat you will experience to date. Arma 3 delivers what it sets out to do an invasion of a made up map and you need to help secure it (sorry if you would class that as a spoiler). There are few if any bugs and beautifull graphics great multiplayer improvement from arma 2 but as a fan of the series i am a bit dissapointed in bohemia with their choice of a futeristic feel which i dont personally like compared to modern combat. If you are a laid back gamer you will still enjoy this title due to the community, multiplayer, beauty, editor. The editor is my favourite part of the game as it lets you be creative and put what you would want in a campaign mission into your own. Overall i would reccomend this game but if you are looking for an army sim go for arma 2 by far.

review: If you like DayZ kinda action, and you are willing to RPG. Altis life Mod for Arma 3 is verry Cool, look up a good community and get your life going. Get a job: Pick Apples, peaches, Mine for Iron, copper, Salt and even Diamonds. Become a criminal, and pick, process weed, cocain or heroin. Become a Cop, arrest ppl. Search vehicles, and hunt people that have a price on their head. You can even become a rebel. Before you get a life on a server, read the rules of a server, the rules may vary on each server, if you want to become a cop, most of the time they want you white-listed. The server i play on the most: Serverfilter: Trinity Join me.

If you think battlefield or call of duty is too hard core, this game will hand you your  and send you back to the forums crying. There's a reason some military groups use it as a training simulator. It's not for punk kids.

review: This is like a drug. Murder simulation, the sound is probably the best thing about this game. The first time you fire a simple 6.5mm round you realize this game is on a completely different level from anything else. Some games can be more fun, but none are more real. Sometimes you'll have memories of killing people on certain maps and you'll wake up in the morning and remember it, that place you went to and that person you killed. Genuinely a feeling of disconnection will grow when you play other games because you don't feel like they properly exteriorize a sense of realism compared to ARMA 3. The sunlight is like video game wizardry i'll never understand. Closing this review i'll say you should have confidence in yourself, play the multiplayer from the start, switch your rate of fire, run and kill kill kill.

review: My initial review said that ArmA 3 would be a great game by late 2014 when more mods and content were released. I am glad to say that this became true several months before I expected. Between the incredible Zeus game mode (an on-the-fly mission creator) and excellent mods like Advanced Gameplay Mod, Task Force Radio and ALiVE this is one of the best co-op games available. You will need at least 4-5 people to really have fun in multiplayer, but there's really no other game that offers what ArmA does.

review: This game is a perfect choice for those who love themselves military simulators. While this game does have it's downfalls, AKA it's glitches, they however, are not game breaking.

review: Great game. Awesome alternative to Battlefield 3, if you're looking for a slower paced more tactical game experience. Amazing visuals tempt me to lose track, and just fly around the map, to just explore. The main map of altis has over 200km of shoreline, with over 270 Square KM of map space. (arma 2, Chernarus was 225Km2) With the new Lighting and physics added to the Engine, Night conflicts are no longer a pain, but Great to play. Ragdoll Physics in the game are tastefully done, in my opinion. I recomend this game, the addition of the ease of modding, makes this game perfect to tailor to your perfect prefrences.

review: When Operation Flashpoint came out in 2002, I was pleasantly surprized that the Bohemia Interactive Studio creators of the game managed to finally make a military simulation that surpassed all other competitors. I still play it, but its successors, ARMA, ARMA2, and now ARMA 3 take this sim to new heights. As a US Army combat Veteran, I can state from my military experience that ARMA 3 tops the list of all FPS sims to date. ARMA 3 involves teamwork, self-discipline, and developing strategy to defeat the enemy. This sim is not for "run and gun" players.

review: ArmA is military simulation with military venicles,helicopters,... and weapons.ArmA III is good simulation,but body armor is garbage.In ArmA II you kill everything (without tanks,choppers,...) with one bullet.In ArmA III you kill a soldier with cca 2-5 bullets to torso,to helmed is cca 2-3 bullets and to face is cca 1-2 if you if you aim well.But in ArmA III is the greatest island of the ArmA series.Altis A.K.A Lemnos is large with much cities and villages.Stratis (i dont know how this island was called in real live) is the second island with cca 2-3 towns and 1 city called Agia Maria i think.I play this game with some addons and i can recommend addon called Speed Of Sounds.This addon adds to the game a real sounds of weapons recorded from the firing range.ArmA III includes mission editor where can you create your own mission or campaign and awesome multiplayer.The venicles is good,but in most cases the venicle is remake of the for example NATO AR-2 Darter (quadrotor) is remake for the all fractions (NATO,CSAT,AAF) without FIA.In year cca 2035 is a invasion of Hecler and Koch machineguns and grenade launchers.The joke is in the infantry weapons.I dont see any infantry weapons from Hecler and Koch without addons.Lets go to final verdict...This game is fun but the body armor must die.Venicles and technic is good,but its a remake in most cases.BiS dont exploited the potential of year 2035 and nearly vehicle according to the real originals without some features.Mission editor is good and multiplayer is awesome.You can create a mission and you can play it with friends.I give this game 8/10 or 85/100% who want this score.I hope that my review will be helpful when you buy this if you buy this :)

review: A good soldier is fast, accurate and effective in dealing with his weapons - all weapons in Arma 3 have realistic ballistics and handling. Adjust your weapon to compensate for the bullet drop, go into a squat or on the floor to reduce the recoil, and fire at short intervals in order to reduce scattering of ammunition. If you do not observe these points, your opponent has easier time to gain the upper hand. With 270 km , the island Altis is the real star in Arma 3 From large-scale cities over rolling hills to wind and solar farms - regardless of whether the layers flattened rolls with your tank in the south or cause an asymmetric war of the hills in the north, the landscape of Altis offers extremely detailed locations with numerous combat options. One of the best military simulators at the time, along with the stunning new engine, and the variety of mods a good game. 79/100

review: Ground zero for the big boys here... Where to start with Arma 3 coming from the first installment of the franchise back in the late 90s Operation Flashpoint I remember playing through the demo over and over again with it being different every time i was blown away by the size and scope of the war simulator and coulnt wait to get my hands on it. Playing Arma, Arma 2 and all DLC that followed and now to Arma 3 in 2013. If you are a fan of simulators and anything that has to do with war Arma 3 is for you. Arma 3 is your playground to create any scenario you could dream of playing out any scene from a war movie you like you can do that in Arma 3 and then some. Arma 3 is a sandbox experience on a scale nothing else has come close too I really appreciate the introduction to underwater operations with diving etc. I have put in 73 hours into the Alpha build playing coop missions with my crew and have had amazing runs from infiltrating a enemy camp to assassinate a officer with out being detected to running intense CQB ops with your buddy's or doing helo runs on an enemy convoy Arma 3 is a one stop shop for all your war sim needs.

review: I recommend this game to anyone who likes a more realistic type of shooter. This game also has a big modding community so there are tons of different ways to play the game. Controls are most fluid then Arma 2 and it feels more natural and less mechanical. It does still have a slight mechanical feel but that just goes with the genre. Every act requires you to take a second to complete that task just like RL. I didn't log many hours when i first got it but iv recently found servers that run the SC (Sector control) game mode and its fantastic. You gain levels by being in the target sector and money to buy new gear. Il keep this brief but its a great game and keeps getting better with every update.

You can also install mods from a website called Armaholics which adds a higher score in my rating to the game.

review: Arma 3 is not quite a first person shooter, it really is more of a "war simulator" overall. It is highly detailed and looks great visually but there can be a bit of a learning curve. The games strong point, in my opinion is the way it tries to do multiplayer, where you make missions and what not. I find this single feature what makes Arma stand out the best. More shooters should have the level of control Arma 3 gives players. There were a few "cons" to all of its "pros" though, so I will list my biggest as follows. 1. Multiplayer Servers (if not set up properly and efficiently) can make the game squat down and take a huge dump on your FPS (frames per second) 2. I feel the multiplayer user interface could use some work. making the game more accessible to new players. 3. Better single player. Arma may be best for its multiplayer but I think overall more work could be done making the single player experience more enjoyable. All in all I think Arma 3 does the "shooter/ war simulation" best, it may not be as popular as games like COD or Battlefield but thats not a bad thing. Imagine if it was that popular, then we would be dealing with those "guys"...

And if you play online, it only gets better with Altis life and Breakingpoint. Even Milsim.

review: This game is a branch in a dynasty of games, that have been plagued by bugs, glitches and errors alike. Some are really funny, some are plain frustrating. All together, the game can let itself be hated, yet, the player will likely clock many, many hours none the less. Why? Because in what other game, you get to play in a variety of gigantic maps, to play epic missions, made by good mates? In what game, will you play in tense, long-duration military environments with complete strangers? This game will let you experience open-world combat simulation at its finest. Along with bugs. And glitches. And desyncs. But considering the overall awesomeness of the game, those eventually become quite funny, or at least acceptable. Reccomended for: The patient, mature teamplayer The military addict Not reccomended for: The immediate-satisfaction gamer

review: Arma 3 is by far the most realistic, most entertaining, and most intence war simulator of all time! If the technology is availible this game should come out for next gen. consoles. Not only is this an amazing sandbox but it also blows every other war game out of the water! Keep up the good work Bohemia Interactive, and step aside Battlefield and COD because a new age has started. The age of a real war.

review: I really love this game. There is some glitches though not that much and is very fun to play with friends or teamamates. There are things like role-playing servers where you have to act just like you act in life and another is wasteland which is just trying tu survive. You need to find your stuff and survive, I really like this game and I could play it for days striaght without stopping because it's just so fun. Add me as a friend and we could play Arma 3 sometime , I am always on :)

review: This game is armazing! While its prety hungry I can roll it on lowest settings and it still looks alive and wonderful. Machanics work great. Altis life is really fun. It is obvious that they've leveled up from AmrA II. II was sort of phasy, while ArmA III still have that problem it isn't an issue anymore. The fun part of AmrA has always been the fact that YOU MUST BE TACTICAL! Treating a delicate game like ArmA like CoD will result in failure, frustration, getting trolled by ten year olds and all in all your little brother will film you freaking out over it and put it on youtube. Amazing game. So worth the money. Buy it.

review: This game is a must have if you like MilSim. It is very realistic, and has a great community. Wasteland is for those who enjoy killing everyone in sight even if they are wearing the same camo. Deathmatch is meh. CoOp Missions are some of the best game modes. If you are new to the series, check this out, The controls are a little strange at first, but you will grow to love them.

review: This game is a lot smoother and has much better gameplay than people give it credit for. Animations and stances as well as squadplay in this game are efficent and smooth. The campaign is an epic story about your average foot soldier changing the way a war is playing out just by doing his part and staying alive. I have played an extensive amount of multiplayer and campaign and I have to say that it is an experience most can enjoy if they pay attention. While I literally can't say anything about the unfolding storyline without spoiling an entire episode of its three, I will warn you and clarify that if you like explanations to everything this game is not for you. You will be a Sergeant a low ranking soldier with mind, experiences, and skills are his most effective tools. This means he doesn't get the classified info of let's say a Colonel, or a Brigadier General, or the President. Absorb information and make your own conclusions because that Spec. Ops. Captain over there sure as hell won't. This game won't make any shortcuts for you to recap its story so you better keep your head up the whole way through. The military strategies and plans carried out are phenominal and deserve a much bigger spotlight other than its famed multiplayer. Considering I got a solid 30+ hours playing through the campaign alone I call that a BIG win, let alone held up against today's standards. Hopefully you get a good picture of this game's features and don't worry the campaign will help explain them as well. Happy hunting and don't forget. Survive. Adapt. Win.

review: I really recommend this game because of its nice graphics, great Singleplayer/Multiplayer. I bought the Arma 3 Limited Deluxe Edition for $55,47. It contains Arma 3, a map of Altis and Stratis, an awesome keycard, ARMA: Cold War Assault, a keyboard layout, a digital soundtrack, a digital tactical guide, digital maps and all DLCs. For its price it is just a bargain. Buy it and you won't regret! :)

review: Besser als der Vorgnger, schon in der Alpha gefllt mir die allgemeine Spielmechanik. Die Grafik ist schn anzusehen und die bugs sind bei der Alpha nunmal nicht anders zu erwarten. Trotzdem besser als Battlefield 3 und der andere Shooter Mll. I can already say that I like the Alpha from Arma 3 more then Arma 2 with better game mechanics and beautiful Graphics. The bugs aren't unusal for an Alpha version. But I still prefer Arma 3, rather than the rest of the "shooter-crap" like Battlefield 3.

review: ARMA 3: Arma the almighty miletary sim, Which may catch your eye with the immersive feel and the futuristic feel which i will get to later. I feel that this is a good arma but not on the same par as arma 2 which can i tell you can be either a bag of piss or alot of fun to play with bugs and  ai to some of the most action packed immersive combat you will experience to date. Arma 3 delivers what it sets out to do an invasion of a made up map and you need to help secure it (sorry if you would class that as a spoiler). There are few if any bugs and beautifull graphics great multiplayer improvement from arma 2 but as a fan of the series i am a bit dissapointed in bohemia with their choice of a futeristic feel which i dont personally like compared to modern combat. If you are a laid back gamer you will still enjoy this title due to the community, multiplayer, beauty, editor. The editor is my favourite part of the game as it lets you be creative and put what you would want in a campaign mission into your own. Overall i would reccomend this game but if you are looking for an army sim go for arma 2 by far.

review: If you like DayZ kinda action, and you are willing to RPG. Altis life Mod for Arma 3 is verry Cool, look up a good community and get your life going. Get a job: Pick Apples, peaches, Mine for Iron, copper, Salt and even Diamonds. Become a criminal, and pick, process weed, cocain or heroin. Become a Cop, arrest ppl. Search vehicles, and hunt people that have a price on their head. You can even become a rebel. Before you get a life on a server, read the rules of a server, the rules may vary on each server, if you want to become a cop, most of the time they want you white-listed. The server i play on the most: Serverfilter: Trinity Join me.

First for it being the game coming out after the previous Arma 2 i was expecting certian things to be added, like better ai, a PHYSICS engine, and a much better map. I think i expected a little to much. Some ups about the game is its FUN! yeah get it like srlsy

review: This game is the best simulation FPS ever made. Sure it still has to expand. But even at this point you have unlimited hours of playing with super realistic challenges, mission editor, campaings, different multiplayer games etc. The game gives you a variety of options from squad commands to character and vehicle movements (you have submarines too :P). The shooting is as realistic as a game can offer you nowadays. If you didn't like Arma 2 don't think that Arma 3 is the same. You must check it out. In the end I think that you should buy this game if you like a bit more realistic FPS and want some real challanges to face. See you on the field soldier!

review: One word can describe this game: Awesome. Arma 3 is a realistic military sim. Even with that in mind, for those who don't enjoy the realism, this game is one of the best FPS ever created and offers something for everyone. Map sizes are ridiculous, think of an average GTA IV map, times that by ten. Vehicle mechanics are greatly improved over Arma II, which makes them fun to drive, and gives you another sense of immersion. When your driving an armored vehicle, you actually feel empowered. As for weapons, the quality of the models, and the sound bytes are amazing. It's not like your average FPS....With headphones, every weapon sounds exactly like it would in real life, not some PEW PEW sound. I would definitely recommend this game to anyone looking for a boredom cure, with community made mods and game types, there is something in it for everyone.

review: The problem is, is that BIS have gone full psycho. They say they want their game to be a big sandbox that everyone can mod on, and that was true of Arma 2. But now, in Arma 3, there are very few vehicles, and they're all sci-fi. Theres a TON of bugs, the game is only half finished, and they tricked everyone into paying $60 for it, saying it would be finished upon release. Which was a total lie. Now, if you complain about that on their forums, your banned without any explanation. They even ban your IP so you can't make another account. Its also a steam game, so the producers lurk on the steam forums, and if they see you complain on there to Steam, they ban you there as well, since they have mod status. And now, even if you say "oh well, its half baked", and start making suggestions for improvement, they ban you for that as well. So basically, you can't say anything on their forums now. Unless its to kiss their  and tell them how wonderful they are. The Arma forums are a ghost town to everyone but fanboys. Everyone else has been banned. Its a shame, because it was a good game / sim. But the greedy as.s.holes at BIS have turned into worse than EA, and all they care about now are lies and money.

review: Great game to play especially in multiplayer with friends. The combat system is top notch and the graphics are great if you have a good enough PC to run the game in multilayer. The game has its flaws at times with fps dips on some servers but if you can get past that, the game is amazing. The mods for this game is where it shines for me personally. Mainly the wasteland mod and the life mod. On the right servers you will find yourself hundreds of hours of fun easily just by how tense the game can get. My recommendation is to only buy this game if you have a few friends who are willing to play with you. Also, if you want to play wasteland only play on sa-matra servers, this way you can reach 60fps quite easily in ultra if your PC is good enough, otherwise you will have to play on the not so optimized regular wasteland servers with low fps (30-40 or less)

review: You are kidding me right? You are selling the completed version of the game that should have been released in the first place for $20 more have you idiots fallen out of your tree? It was my understanding that you sold the other version because you couldn't finish the single player campaign in time for your release date. Things you need to address you need to work on your multiplayer experience we your customers love and support you guys cause you have a great lineage but don't piss down our backs and tell us it's raining!!! Please, move from the same gamespy technology that you have been using for over 20-years old and get something more updated also spend a little money on the community by getting us some local servers that WE YOUR CUSTOMERS CAN USE here in the states without a damn 100 plus ping!!! Get your in game comm's together to optimize bandwidth. The sounds in ArmA 3 are still a little campy I know you don't want to have to pay for a sound engineer to actually do some sound mapping from real guns but guess what this is a real gun sort of experience so suck it up and get it done! We are your customer not some blind village idoit you can simply pick pocket when you want more money so don't treat us like one! Regards, Tat

review: Great game when played with the right group of people. Single player campaigns, while challenging, can be a little dull after a while, but this seems to be the way of life for games these days. EDIT 16/05/2014 - The new campaigns added since i left my review have made the world of difference. Changes have been made to the game itself and it looks, simple beautiful. There are lighting effects that make your choice of where you shoot from and approach your enemy critical. Arma 3 is simply awesome, and if you're the kind of player to expect one shot kills with an assault rifle from 100m, then go and play COD, because you will be sorely dissappointed. If, however, you`re after a genuine challenge of realistic warfare, then get this game, convince some buddies to join you, and get tactical!

The game does have its bugs, but in reality every game does. They may or may not get said bugs worked out, but we can only hope. If you want to screw around on a MilSim that has many things to offer Arma 3 is the game you want to pick up.

review: I absolutely love this game. And it just keeps getting better so I can only love it more. At first it may seem daunting to dive into and get familiar with. But after a while of playing, getting used to the controls and then learning some of the more advance controls, you can wage an entire war by yourself by commanding squads or with friends by playing cooperatively. With the Steam Workshop you can also find hundreds, if not, thousands of user created missions that are a lot of fun. I personally suggest Dynamic Universal War System for a fun but brutal gamemode that is really good for Co-Op or solo play.

review: I recommend this game to anyone who likes a more realistic type of shooter. This game also has a big modding community so there are tons of different ways to play the game. Controls are most fluid then Arma 2 and it feels more natural and less mechanical. It does still have a slight mechanical feel but that just goes with the genre. Every act requires you to take a second to complete that task just like RL. I didn't log many hours when i first got it but iv recently found servers that run the SC (Sector control) game mode and its fantastic. You gain levels by being in the target sector and money to buy new gear. Il keep this brief but its a great game and keeps getting better with every update.

review: ArmA 3 shows numerous marked improvements over its predecessors, but little has changed about the developer andcommunity attitude since ArmA 2. ArmA 3 is a good game. It feels very refined, like a proper triple-A title, which contrasts immensely with the very unpolished, rough, but still charming ArmA 2. ArmA 3 improves on just about everything from the entry before it. Movement is fluid, smooth, and no longer clunky. The controls are far less complex and much easier to master and memorize. Vehicles handle much better and have fully rendered, animated interiors. I personally found that the game ran a bit better on my system, but it can be taxing when a lot of buildings and objects are involved, as the CPU often fails to keep up. That said, ArmA 3 does fall short in a small handful of aspects that ArmA 2 does better. Some people may be turned off by the future setting, although it doesn't affect gameplay much. All together it is smaller in scale, with fewer vehicles, factions, and maps than ArmA 2. Still, ArmA 3 has its strong points. There is a new Zues mode in which one player is an omnipotent, "dungeon master"-like figure who places enemies and allies. There are multiple ways to mix and match Zues, and the game can basically be made into an RTS. There can even be competing Zues'! However, the game does have pitfalls of its own. The AI, a much chided problem of the series, doesn't seem to have any improvements. It continues to be brick levels of stupid while also having improbable accuracy. allied squadmates almost never follow orders, making parts of the singleplayer (particularly the second act) more frustrating than fun. A new stamina system was implemented that adds a new, interesting dynamic to multiplayer, but since the singleplayer wasn't designed with it in mind, the campaign is basically unplayable. This to me speaks volumes about Bohemia Interactives design philosophy, and I have to wonder how much effort is put into testing patches and hearing player feedback. Speaking of players, you will find the greatest challenge of ArmA 3 is the community. Most of the community is hospitable enough, but there is a rampant elitism that pervades the community and makes many players seem like complete twits. More often then not threads criticizing the game will devolve into "this isn't Call of Duty you filthy casual" or something of the like. Furthermore, this makes finding a unit a very tough search, as many are not immediately accepting. This can be a challange, as multiplayer is the key focus of the game and it is hard to have fun without a coordinated group. Another major issue is that the mod developers are often overprotective of their mods to say the least, with almost all of them refusing to use the integrated workshop or allow any change to their mods. These attitudes can be stifling at times. In the end, my recommendation on ArmA 3 is based mostly around 1 principle: do you have friends you can play with? If the answer is no, I would say wait until you do or find a potential group to hook up with. Singleplayer-wise, there isn't a lot of enjoyment to be had, although user missions keep it afloat for a bit. If this is a non-issue for you, than I definitely recommend ArmA 3.

review: This is like a drug. Murder simulation, the sound is probably the best thing about this game. The first time you fire a simple 6.5mm round you realize this game is on a completely different level from anything else. Some games can be more fun, but none are more real. Sometimes you'll have memories of killing people on certain maps and you'll wake up in the morning and remember it, that place you went to and that person you killed. Genuinely a feeling of disconnection will grow when you play other games because you don't feel like they properly exteriorize a sense of realism compared to ARMA 3. The sunlight is like video game wizardry i'll never understand. Closing this review i'll say you should have confidence in yourself, play the multiplayer from the start, switch your rate of fire, run and kill kill kill.

review: At last Bohemia Interactive have got their military simulation (you can't call it an FPS because it's so much more) finally nailled. The singleplayer is fine and without the game breaking bugs riddled within ARMA 2. There are also still many more updates to come and the latest one is focused on multiplayer. The only thing that really annoys me though is that everytime a new update is released, it negates all your save games! This is is so much of a wind up that i've set Steam not to update the game until I've finished the singleplayer campaign and solo missions. Is it really so much to ask considering the vast majority of games update perfectly well without rendering your savegame positions as useless? Another plus with this game is that it's designed to be easily modded and with the Steam Workshop also added, you can be sure the new missions, campaigns, etc, etc, will add many. many more hours of engrossing gameplay (look at the success of the Day Z mod for ARMA 2 for example). Don't expect to go running around expecting to shoot everything in sight. This is a simulator where one headshot from an enemy will kill you on the spot. You have to change your stances and find cover according to the situation you find yourself in and work closely with your squad. As you work towards promotions which eventually give you full control over your troops and air, land and sea units. So I'm extremely glad to finally be able to recommend this 3rd instalment in the ARMA series. There are still some bugs to be found, but nothing signifigant thankfully and nothing to spoil your enjoyment. One thing I didn't like is the price, 39.99 for a game that isn't finished yet?!! I was lucky and got my version for 23 in a sale, but charging full price for a game they admit isn't finished, leaves a nasty taste in the mouth. They're not the worse culprits by any means GalCom 3 - 76 for an alpha version!! Before that it was Planetary Annihilation for nearly 100!! That is a shameful way of marketing and Steam censor any negative comments on the games' Discussion forum! Early Access was set up to help small indie developers charge a small price to help then get funding to finish their game and get it beta tested for free at the same time. So I find it deplorable that big publishers are using the system to charge grossly inflated prices FOR AN UNFINSHED GAME!! Plus these are games that are part of a well known and critically acclaimed franchise which are guaranteed to sell well anyway. It seems Steam's reputation for integrity has been ditched ("f..k the integrity, just give us your money, no matter how shady the marketing ploy!"). Which I think is a massive disappointment from somebody who has been a member and fan of Steam for many years (I wonder how long it will take them this time to close and 'delete' this post - they seem to have moderators everywhere!). Anyway, bearing all this in mind on the nearly final game, I can recommend this to anyone who like their games to be military simulations as opposed to your bog standard FPS. The UI is a bit too clunky but apart from that, this is the best game of it's type around. There aren't many, because it takes a long time to achieve excellence in a genre which takes great pains to model everything on a modern battlefield as accuratetly as is possible. Bearing in mind it's not entirely 'finished' you might maybe hang on a little longer and buy it in a sale when by then, it should be entirely 'done.'

review: Bought it back in april, pretty bad. Gave it another shot in January, holy  it is good. The custom maps and content are amazingly fun and the campaign seems pretty good as well. The games controls are horrifyingly complex and non-intuitive and the game intself can be a little buggy seeming but the combat realism and graphics are so sexy. No shooter in recent years has provided me with the proper fear of that unseen sniper 800m+ away that Arma 3 has. 9/10

review: Arma 3 is arguably the single most realistic and immersive experience you can find today. It took me quite a while to get it running well, however after its up and running you wont be able to put it down. The maps are insanely huge, allowing for intense tactics. The realism of the guns is where this game really shines. while some may complain that the kick is not entirely realistic you have to adjust the sights for distance. If you get shot even once you will either be dead or have an injury such as a broken leg which only allows you to walk. Overall this game is a 9.5/10. aside from some performance issues this game is nothing short of amazing

review: My first game on A3 brought me the most horrific experience I've ever had in any game, ever. We're on our way to the objective, a small dump east of a town occupied by enemy forces. I'm leading a team of 4 men. We come to a crossroad and I sprint across, telling my men to hold back. I cross a few more times, trying to get a response from any snipers. Nothing. I run, my SAW gunner runs, my medic runs. But I kept my Marksman on the other side to make sure we'd make it across. Anybody seen Full Metal Jacket all the way through? Remember the sniper scene? The marksman takes a round in the leg as we're running and goes down. He then takes two more in the chest. The kid who was playing had some mad acting skills, he played it up to 11 here. He screams as he's being shot. Crawling, drenched in his own blood. "SARGE? YOU AIN'T LEAVING ME OUT HERE LIKE THIS, RIGHT? I-I WANNA GO WITH YOU GUYS! C'MON SARGE, H-HELP ME! C'MON! PLEASE DON'T LEAVE ME!" he died after that. I cried and he respawned. 11/10, would recommend getting.

review: This is not a game for people who want fast action movie style gaming, this is a game for people who appreciate the finer things. Having done both military service and picked up MILSIM airsoft as a hobby this game is the closest you will get to what goes on in reality. There are experiences you will have in ARMA 3 that can not be had in COD or BF, experiences that will have you shaking from the adrenaline release. One that comes to mind was a mission to destroy an enemy comms tower, I was squad leader of 8 or so AI:s. As we approached the Comms tower and I told my men to go stealth, no firing unless fired upon. We moved slowly taking advantage of terrain, keeping an watchful eye for enemy patrols. Once the tower was in visual range pace slowed even more and I spent the better part of 30 minutes just looking for enemy patrols and advancing to about 200 meters from the tower. There I positioned my men to cover a wide firing arc as I had spotted quite a few patrols moving in and about the tower. I considered opening fire and probably being able to drop a good portion of the enemy before they could zero in on our position. But a firefight is always a risk, and these AI had been around for a few missions and I had started to anthropomorphize them a bit and secondly I might get hit and killed. As I considered how I would start the engagement a sudden hole opened up in the patrol pattern, I realised the tower is unguarded and I had an opportunity to do something I had not considered. I got up and ran as fast as I could towards the tower, all the time expecting the bullets to start cracking above my head. I kept scanning as I ran whizzling through bushes trying to pick a path that the least visibility to any patrols. After what seemed like far too long I reached the tower and threw out a satchel charge and another for good measure, if one would not bring the tower down it would sure attract attention. I turned around and made my way back, as I closed on my men I started ordering them to fall back, hope growing that I might get out of this alive. Falling back to about 400 meters I finally detonated the satchel charges and the tower fell, from there it was just a short run to the truck and back to Command. I had done it. I had pulled off the perfect mission, not a shot fired and all under my command back alive. That is what this game is about.

review: Oh man. Where to even begin with this one. It would be an extreme disservice to simply call Arma 3 a shooter, as it is so, so much more than that. Arma 3 is a military simulator. This is a distinction that its developers hold sacred and are proud of, and one to which I can attest is completely accurate and deserved. But its even more than that. Arma 3 is a gaming platform, upon which so much has already been and will continue to be built for years to come. At its core though, Arma 3 in a supremely excellent military sim. The graphics are stunning, the gameplay is excellent, the mechanics are solid, and Bohemia Interactive has done an absolutely amazing job packaging this all together. New comers to the Arma series (as I was) may initially be overwhelmed by the games complex mechanics and decidedly different pace from your typical FPS/shooter. Enemy engagements happen at much greater distance than is typical in the genre and are often brief, brutal, and more times than not will conclude with your demise. There is no handholding here. No mini-maps, no enemy UI icons/indicators, no hit markers, no health bars. If you get shot a couple of times, you will find yourself unceremoniously dispatched. While this creates a high barrier for entry and a steep learning curve for new players, it provides a unique and distinctive play style. Situational awareness, cover, teamwork, suppressive fire, and generally moving purposefully and as if your  depended on knowing what was behind the next ridge or hiding in the bushes are paramount to your success. Add to these infantry mechanics the amazingly rendered vehicles, armor, helicopters, and planes, each with their own realistic mechanics to learn and master, and you end up with a truly amazing military simulation experience. Out of the box, Arma comes with a great single player campaign comprised of 3 separate acts, each containing ~12-15 missions. The campaign focuses on a well crafted story of a military conflict that has erupted over Arma 3s two HUGE islands of Stratis and Altis. You play the part of a NATO soldier who finds himself stuck in the middle of a complex engagement. The campaign is rewarding, and challenging. (I have yet to complete it as Im stuck on one mission that I simply cant seem to complete.) However the single-player campaign is FAR from the end of this title. The mission editing tools have allowed this amazing community to develop some absolutely awesome single player missions, all of which can be downloaded free of charge from the Steam workshop and numerous other sites around the interwebs. I would also recommend you check out the supremely excellent full game conversion single player mods Whole Lotta Altis and Dynamic Universal War System which will provide countless additional single player hours and could be completely stand alone titles in themselves. Oh and the multiplayer, oh god the multiplayer. Wasteland, King of the Hill, Invade and Annex, Battle Royale, Breaking Point, so many Co-Op opportunities, the amazing looking upcoming Epoch (currently in closed Alpha). Im sure there are so many others that I havent even discovered yet. Each of these represent COMPLETELY USER GENERATED and totally disparate ways to play Multiplayer within the Arma 3 platform. By purchasing Arma 3, you immediately have access to each of these completely gratis and each could essentially be considered totally separate game. In wrapping up this lengthy review, Arma 3 is an amazing experience and a true accomplishment in game development. It is the only game in recent memory that I can say with confidence that I never get bored with playing. Bohemia Interactive has made it clear that they plan to support this game for years to come, and they have built something amazing on which the possibilities are truly endless. Purchase this game. Purchase it now. Thank me later. (IF YOU DO NOT FIND MY REVIEW HELPFUL, please leave a comment as to why. I welcome the constructive feedback.)

review: Can't tell you if you should buy it or not, but I can tell you this. You will find annoying bugs, highly requested features that isn't there and lack of content if you're not satisfied with what you have. But when you really get down to it, and experience some of the awesome scenarios you can get in multiplayer and custom sp mission, it's something magical you just can't find in any other game. Arma is not a game which you pick up at launch, play the campaign and a bit of mp, and then trow away. You buy it, love it or hate it, and then play it forever or trow it away immediatly. Arma is a game which you can never called finished. There will always be added to it, be it user or official content, fixes, features or optimizations. Hope I expressed myself correctly and that you learned something from it :) If you like realistic shooters and organized large scale multiplayer warfare, this will be your gem! I'll give it a 9/10, simply because: screw bugs, I've used hundreds of hours on Arma 3 that I would never take back. READ: I will not accept random friend requests!

review: I have owned this game for a number of weeks now and I have been completely hooked. Great game for the more serious war gamer, not for those who prefer the fast paced combat that you get from Call of Duty series which I consider more for the younger gamers anyway. Arma 3 moves a lot slower and is more squad based than other war games, similar to Battlefield series only slower than that when playing online and you may find yourself on 10 minute helicopter rides just to get into the battlefield and you will be highly satisfied with each kill you make as you know a single round landed by your enemy could be fatal regardless of the weapon they are using. You will have to make good use of any cover you can find and hit the dirt as soon as you hear a bullet crack over your head and then very carefully survey the surrouding area and work out where you are taking fire from as it will usually not be obvious where the fire is coming from and you will find yourself having to hold up for 10-20 minutes in a single location (sometimes longer, I personally have gotten pinned in one location for over an hour) because you are either pinned by enemy fire or it is too dangerous to move forward. You will need to buffer up on your mic communication skills as most players use proper phonetics etc when relaying information to each other on the battlefield such as coordinates and other reconaissance. You can not respawn as quickly as you can in CoD if you are taken down by enemy fire so staying alive is more crucial than any other war game you have played and you wanna hope you are moving up with a squad that has a medic. The graphics are great, the game is a little glitchy at times and the controls take a little getting used to. I recommend buying this game to any serious war game enthusiasts who want to get as close to war as possible (unless doing paintballing or airgunning), and if you do buy the game - I recommend completing the whole VR Tutorial before actually joining a server or playing the Campaign as you will need to really learn all those different keys that may make the difference in a hairy situation in game.

review: If you're coming to Arma 3 as an Arma series veteran, you already know what to expect. For the most part, the game hasn't changed since the last installment, but then it's always felt a little bit like Bohemia Interactive are still building on the groundwork laid back in 2001 by Operation Flashpoint, in the world's longest ever game of 'development Buckaroo'. Thankfully, the whole thing has yet to fall to pieces in any significant manner; it's quite happy to continue wobbling uneasily for now. Arma has a reputation. It's known to be frighteningly obtuse, bewilderingly complex, and often hilariously broken. I can tell you right now that Arma 3 is no different, and absolutely still deserves that reputation. Thankfully, I don't think it's unfair to say that this is the closest an Arma game has come to being 'user friendly'. The controls have been tweaked, and the interface refined a little to accommodate more modern tastes. For these improvements alone, I do recommend it to newcomers to the series over any previous entry. Coming from any other modern FPS game, it will still take a good few hours of what can feel an awful lot like hard work to get to grips with the controls, but I honestly think Arma 3 will see a far lower 'drop-out rate' of newbies who were frustrated to the point of giving up by the previous games. At the time of writing, the elephant in the room is the lack of content available. When compared to Arma 2 (which is handsomely bolstered by an array of official expansion packs), the amount of hardware available to play with is frustratingly slim. In many cases, opposing armies are equipped with identical vehicles which get a slightly different paint job at best. For anyone used to the myriad of variants and oddments available in Arma 2, Arma 3 can feel awfully disappointing. Fortunately, this is alleviated to some extent by the strong mod community. It has long been the case that the best parts of the Arma games are the parts not developed by Bohemia Interactive themselves, and Arma 3 is most definitely continuing this 'tradition'. Nevertheless, I can't help but feel that the game could've done with a few months more time in the oven before full public release. Speaking of the mod community, I think it's criminal that almost none of the best, near-indispensible mods from Arma 2 have been officially integrated. For a self-professed 'war simulator', Arma 3 is hugely lacking in basic features like being able to rest your weapon on surfaces (even with a visible bipod), or tow damaged vehicles. For all its flaws, though, Arma 3 is still a blast to play. If you can find a decent group of like-minded gamers with access to a voice-over-net server, you're in for some of the best gaming you'll ever experience. Sure, you'll probably have to load up on mods to satisfy your need for variety. And sure, sometimes the game will crash spectacularly, or the physics engine will flip out and kill you for standing too close to a wall. But when you're standing on a hilltop, looking out over an enemy outpost with your squadmates while a CAS helicopter strafes an enemy APC and spots targets for a distant sniper team; when everything clicks together in the way that only Arma can manage, you'll be glad to have been along for the ride.

review: ARMA 3 So when I saw this game for the first time, I thought that soon will release another excellent piece ArmA. However, the first disappointment was already in anticipation, as the extremely small amount of technology and absence campaign. But this disappointment disappeared when issuing the first chapter of the campaign was excellent and the new technique also appeared. But I will not criticize. I must say that the guys from Bohemians are struggling and working hard to repair, etc. Graphically it's a big shift but a new engine this could offer more. The playing area is huge and real and opens new possibilities for mods. Technical equipment and weapon was terrible at the beginning and the newly added equipment was broken but gradually improves and fixes. Despite this, however, it is compared ARMA I and II, step backward. Personally, I think that would Bohemia Interactive could use a better future. On the other hand, however, the campaign is excellent, what more can I say. Final verdict: ArmA III is an improved forward, but it is incredibly untapped potential. If it Bohemia Interactive put in the time and dedicated technicians and armor, or even a new engine, so it would be something completely different, much better. 8/10

review: Arma III What should i say, i love the game and have been a big fan of the whole series, as you can see i have put allot of hours in this game and i have bought it since alpha and seen the progress. yet i am abit saddend about the progress, i had high hopes they made the engine better on the AI part that is, yet that still kinda sucks and i can imagine it is hard to make it better because the engine they use is just a improved version of the same engine they used in Arma II. neither do i see allot of content on weapons and vehicles which kinda bums me out, and i think the main reason is because they want modders to add that content and fill the gap, problem is no one including me wants to download allot of separate files just to play on one server unless its pretty amazing. and again dont get me wrong i love this game, i just think the main focus on this game has been badly placed and with the setting the game is placed in (the future 2030's) they have allot of free space to use their creativity. i do need to add that the movement system has improved insanely from its previous game. other than that it is still a game i would recommend you should buy if you love military sim games where tactics overpower the opponent, or games where you need to roleplay as this game is a perfect platform to do so.

review: Great Game, very friendly community and so much variety within the game itself, as well as the mods made by other users like me and you, which believe me are great! The graphics and quality is magnificent for this map size and even player count. Some servers have the ability to hold over 100 online players; you cannot get these numbers on any other game as far as I'm aware. The performance is great on Nvidia, however I am not sure it works as good on AMD.

review: This is, hands down, the best military simulator available. There is a steep learning curve and it's not very "plug and play," but A3 can deliver an incredibly rewarding experience if authenticity and realism are up your alley. The Arma series has proven to be both a fun combined arms shooter as well as an invaluable training tool.

review: A worthy set in the arma trilogy, it takes place in the future which allows for more unique weapons/vehicles, though this some times can feel like a discomfort. Vehicles, Weapons, and Movements at disposal are all vasely improved and refined as well. With such an active modding community and develepors that are constantly improving the game, this is an expierence you can't disregard. And for the graphics the lighting effects are the best I've ever seen in a Video Game (ever).

review: 1st/3rd person military shooter with vehicle combat. One of a kind "modern" military shooter, with very large battlefields. A lot of clothing, armor, weapon variations, weapon modifications, ammo types, grenades, utility tools and different kind of equipment. Large variety of civilian, military, armored ground and air vehicles. Game has great modding tools and support. Single player missions also included, as well as co-op and multiplayer modes. Game has great visuals, texture quality, animations, environments and good voice acting. Inventory is hard to navigate at first, and needs getting used to. You tend to die fast, and for some people it may be a challenge to stay alive. Game supports large player count on any given map. Personally I think this is good improvement over Arma 2.

review: Very good game, I would highly recommend this to anyone that likes a semi-realistic war sim. This game struggles heavly from optimization issues. I have an i5 3570K at 4.4 GHz and a GTX 760. At best this game will use 60% of my CPU and or GFX card and only getting 25-40 FPS at 1920x1080 in a busy server. In single player I can get up to 80-90 FPS. Changing my GFX settings really wont change my FPS more than about 10%. 9/10

review: As a veteran of Arma 2 and its expansions, I was fairly eager to get my hands on this game. However, upon playing Arma 3, I found the game lacking, particularly in its lack of variety. Unlike its predecessor, Arma 3 only hosts a handfull of units and vehicles with each side getting a tank, two or so helicopters, and a few light vehicles and APCs. The same goes for the available weaponry in the game although this part is balanced out by a wonderful ability to customize most rifles and machine guns with a list of accessories ranging anywhere from red dots and holo sights to infra-red lasers and tac lights. Arma 3 does include a fairly detailed campaign as well. The campaign allows for an open experience by allowing to choose between what patrols to take priority over and actually allows for the player to simply leave camp and initiate a solo patrol. All weapons, gear, etc. are saved when returning from each patrol meaning that what you come back with sticks with you until you change your loadout otherwise. However, since Arma 3's campaign was incomplete upon release date, those luxuries are short lived. Being incomplete, the updates that finished the campaign make it inconsistant in its mechanics and by part 3 the whole idea of FoB based warfare is forgotten along with loadout customization. Some could even debate wether the campaign is even yet completed or not since the final mission and epilogue are reminiscant of Arma 2's Eagle Wing. But despite its dissapointments and setbacks, Arma 3 still offers perhaps the most advanced war sim on the market. This and the active modding community that easily fills in whatever the game lacks in make Arma 3 a worthwhile buy.

It's simulation, so no 360quickscope, no gender-related bashing, no "noobs vs pro" to a certain degree, Simply one of the best simulations game in existence. It's basically a military simulations, with multiplayers and good gameplay, with multitudes of community mods. With massive content created by community, you buy this game, you could play more than just 1 game. Yeah, wanna play The Sims? Arma 3 have it. Wanna play Tank Battle? Arma 3 have it. Wanna play Ace Combat? Arma 3 have it. Wanna play racing games? Arma 3 have it. Wanna play... oh come on, try them for yourself! I'm not paid to write long review, so I'm gonna leave it here. Oh, and zombies... Hehe, what's better than playing zombie in Arma themed world? Download a zombie mod, use a script to spawn tank, and have fun!

review: An undeniably accurate military simulator, no other game like it (yes, COD boys and BF fans, this is very different indeed). Developed by actual military personel, this game is designed to be as realistic to military combat, tactics, and realismas humanly possible. I've played ArmA II for years and never did I imagine a game, designed for the sole purpose of military simulations, take on the challenge of becomeing a modern day platform of ArmA III.

review: If you enjoy having to trek 3 Kilometers to take out one soldier and then trek to the next objective for another 20 minutes (real time), then Arma is your game. Arma is as close as one can get in a game to real-life combat procedures. Taking one hit will usually result in death or severe injury...and you don't wanna take a hit when you're 3 Kilometers from an objective and have to walk there... There are a few things that you should know first: 1) Combat is slow-paced and tactical 2) There are a lot of different controls that you'll need to know 3) The online community is great for help 4) With enough time and imagination, there are very few things that you can't do/create in Arma The guides that come in-game are very useful and are a must-read if you want to have a good play experience. All-in-all, for the amount of content that comes with Arma 3 and the amount of content streaming-in constantly from users as well as can be made by you, this game will give you unlimited hours of entertainment, provided that you put the time into learning the controls properly. This is a steal for $60, and anything cheaper is almost a crime for the amount of value that lies within this game. Even if you're not into military shooters, this game has more than just "something" for everyone.

review: This game will not measure your KDR, this game will not have you grind to unlock weapons or attachments, this game will not release 4 expensive DLC patches every year, but this game will be more immersive, epic and thrilling than any other. It will make you feel like a part of something bigger. Arma is not for everyone, one should not be fooled into thinking so; the willingness to train, practice and execute are not traits everyone posses. However, should you choose to don the desert camo of Blufor, the quicksand colours of Opfor or the grass greens of Greenfor, know that you have become part of a community which will grow, advance and perfect their craft. If you're willing, and if you want more than a game, Arma is the pinnacle of milsims to date. UPDATE: the new Zeus game modes are amazing (currently availible on the dev build), it is difficult to sum up the essence of the gane mode, but it is very interesting, and my new favourite game mode, which is quite an achievement considering I've been around since Arma: Cold War Crisis (as it is bow known) and the OPF games.

Shoot a guy in the knee and laugh at him because he can't run anymore? Run in to battle in your undies? (Note: theres a bug that doesn't allow you to go naked) Do a back flip in a chopper? Get into a tank LAV and go down the highway at 100km/h then hit a rock and go flying. And a lot more! Who said this was a war simulator you can play this game your whole life and not need to shoot one bullet? Remember Men Play ARMA!

review: This game looks gorgeous on Ultra settings and is great for benchmarking, this game requires a hefty rig to run Stable 60fps 1080p which is a big factor on whether you take a risk on purchasing the game if you have a low end system, the multiplayer is very CPU intensive and could lead to unexpected drops of frames even on the most beefy of PC's. This game however is packed with singleplayer content and a large variety of multiplayer modes, the game also features a mission editor so you can make your own missions or download them off the Steam Workshop. With the peformance issues in mind this still is an amzing game and is worth a fullprice purchase if you have friends which can play with you on it. 9/10 Great game but low-medium end rigs or even pc's with a not great CPU be weary.

review: For me this was in my list of one of those legendary releases of 2013, this is a perfect game for an open-sandbox reaslitic military shooter and has numerous gamemodes instead of just being the typical army type first-person shooter where you just do a mission shoot and it's over. One thing is to make sure you have a great gaming rig because this is a very demanding game and is still going through some updates to increase optimization.

review: for making the game more arcady then the previus ARMA 2 Game. While the controlls ware refined and improved. the graphial fadality is amazing. The game lacks in content. And optimization. A major issue being the fact that if the server host is experiancing 8 FPS. So will you. no matter how many nividia TITANS you rig together. And how many I7's you overclock to . While ArmA 3 is alot more complex. engaging. And immersive then olther tittles out there. Such As Carl On duty Black cops. And Battlefield. It is indeed a thinking mans game. Where map reading. Team co ordination. And communication are key. It does not acheve the level of immersion and simulation that ArmA 2 With mods such as ACE and ACRE acheive. I defenitly reccomand the game to newcommers to the arma series. But ArmA veterans may be dissapointed. To newcommers. ArmA arma allways had quite alot to take in. To learn. to unlearn things you are used to doing in first person shooters. It requires them to learn to use their compass to alert friendlies of contact. How to operate as a team. And even how to operate their weapon system in a proficent manner. Accounting for distance and target movement. But somethings will be new even to arma vets. Such things as the Stance Adjust system, And the awful arcady grenade throw. bound to G. To any arma 2 Vet trying to fiddle with his gear. Thats bad news.

review: This game is amazing .. That is all I have to say about that .. IF you into games that allow no limits to what you can do with it .. Arma is the game for you. With Modding supported from the start of the game and really the core of arma. Spending 60 bucks on Arma is more then worth it. I have over 1000 hours now into the Arma series and have yet to play any of the campian that BI made. Most of my time has been into Mods like Dayz and Epoch. The Communtiy in Arma is amazing. Modders put their heart and soul into making content for this game. Arma 3 is a game you will for sure get over 5 years of content for free out of. It is a must buy for any Hardcore FPS player, Hardcore RPG player or any one into Mil Sim stuff.

review: Seriously, it's not your average Battlefield or Call of Duty shooter... FAR FROM! this is real war simulation what all possible factors included! If you want to wage war like a real soldier in life-like situations, this is a game for you. This game however has many different controls and doesn't exactly have a user-friendly control because you need to press multiple buttons mostly to even execute one action, apart from basic movement and such, but if you've ever played any other Bohemia Interactive game, you should already know that. other than these hard-to-master controls, this game is truely amazing, breathtaking, and even let's you use an editor for putting together your own missions. I personally like it for combat flight simulation.

review: This game is just awesome. Ppl may complain its too expensive, but they are rly wrong. For what an Arma game have and for what the community build for the game its a pretty cheap price you are paying. Expect to have hundreds of hours of gameplay, because you wont master all the skills necessary to enjoy the full content of the game in just 10 hours. This game is not for casual Players.

review: After recently playing a lot of Arma II, mainly on the game modes 'Island Life' and 'Wasteland' I decided that I absolutly must have this game, and when it went on sale this summer sale (2014) I snatched it up right away; and I can tell you I do not regret it a single bit! Wasteland is a little different to what I was used to on Arma II after only playing it for a short while but fun nethertheless, Zeus is where the game has really caught my attention! Read up on Zeus and give it a shot, you wont regret it if you want more depth to a shooter.

review: Life-like graphics and immersion would give any veteran ptsd. This game will turn anyone into a adrenaline junky instantly. The realistic gameplay and balistics are punishing, but at the same time very rewarding. This third installment of Bohemia's army simulator set in the near future on an existing island offers tactical gameplay and is enjoyed best playing in a squad. Although lone wolfing can be done your survival chances will be smaller. The base game includes access to multiplayer mods like Battle Royal, Wastelands, King of the Hill, Altis Life and Breaking Point. High replayability value and a mission editor for those who like scripting all makes Arma3 worth your money. Requires a mid-high end pc to run properly. The gameplay can be slow. Some mods don't run as well as others and suffer from desync. It has a few bugs and glitches, though nothing game breaking I've experienced so far. The movement can feel clunky and the controls/keybindings may take a while getting used to as there are just so many. I would reccomend Arma3 to anyone who enjoys a serious militairy simulator.

review: Arma 3 is a game that is at its best with friends and well made community missions. -The single player campaign can be difficult for impatient players or someone who is generally "bad", but a "good" player will be able to get through it. -The ingame editor is what gives Arma games the ability to endure, and allows new missions to be made or for weapon testing. However some scripting knowledge (even if its basic) is needed for more dynamic missions. But for some people, 70% of their time may be here. -Multiplayer can be tricky if you can't find any descent servers to play on or don't know a single friend that is willing to play Arma often. -The graphics when set to low-standard quality will not look half as good as any other mainstream FPS, but a computer with a descent graphics card and good cpu will have no problem (unless you take the settings to the extreme). -The Upcoming DLCs and Expansion are hopefully going to add a nice amout of ingame content. -The modding community itself acts as a hub of occasionally quality addons. -Current problems that do still exist in Arma 3 however, area the AI; environmental damage physics; and a lack of diversity in each factions arsenal. -Some pluses for the game are (as mentioned): the communities divotion to the series, the only other game I've personally seen with such a dedicated modding base recently is Skyrim. Another one of the points towards Arma 3 is the maps, not only are they massive in comparision to stock military games, but they also have similar amounts of detail where the developers saw fit. Finally, despite the occasional AI issues, the game really does give players a different experience everytime (once my friend and I fought valiantly against overwhelming odds and lost, we played again and won, again we got wiped immediatly, and again we saw the AI flip their IFV over which was funny (all on the same mission "Combined Arms")). *Old (Currently, Arma 3 is a 7/10 but depending on Bohemia's roadmap, Arma 'could' end with a 9/10.) *New; After Bootcamp and with the Helicopters DLC about to be released (not to mention the Make Arma Not War entries) so far the game is moving along and becoming better as was intended and my score for it has risen from 7/10 to a 8/10.

review: My initial review said that ArmA 3 would be a great game by late 2014 when more mods and content were released. I am glad to say that this became true several months before I expected. Between the incredible Zeus game mode (an on-the-fly mission creator) and excellent mods like Advanced Gameplay Mod, Task Force Radio and ALiVE this is one of the best co-op games available. You will need at least 4-5 people to really have fun in multiplayer, but there's really no other game that offers what ArmA does.

review: This game is a perfect choice for those who love themselves military simulators. While this game does have it's downfalls, AKA it's glitches, they however, are not game breaking. Slow paced gameplay but not so slow as to get boring. I recommend that if you can find a clan, group, or server that is great and lots of fun, stick with it.

review: Do you love 10 FPS? Do you love bushes that can blow up trucks? Do you love buying DLC that is overpriced? THEN THIS IS THE GAME FOR YOU! Welcome to Arma 3 a game that can give you hours of fun while making you ask yourself why you paid $60 for the game and $15 for the DLC. This game will give you so many funny memory about how you drive on a rockwall with a tank and exploded and hit a bush with a truck and your wheel broke. I have a top of the line graphics card, processor, and internet but I still can't paly this game on high/ultra and get about 25 FPS. Best war simulator 2014.

review: So within 5 minutes of playing the game I was approached by a player named "Megatron" who offered me and my friend cocaine and $1,000. While high on cocaine a masked man came up and killed my friend. Then some awesome medic in a helicopter revived him. Shortly after someone kidnapped my friend and killed him while prenting to masterbate. I'm hooked.

review: Well, being a veteran of this game, with over 430 hours on end, I can proudly say, this game awesome. So much to do, guns to shoot, vehicals to drive, vehicals to FLY, and items to wear and use. I do remember my very first time ever playing, I booted up the game into altis life, and as I sat on the porch of my home, I watched as a police officer arrested 4 men in their underwear. As they all kept screaming "APD (altis police department) IS ILLUMINATI". And as the officers kept repeating "NO WE ARENT SCRUBS". As I progressed through the game, discovering new modes, maps, missions, and more, I grew a liking to king of the hill, me and my buddies would roleplay it so hard. We would sprint through the all out war field, wondering if we would make it out alive, as my head medic, takes a sniper round to the leg, and hits the ground. I looked to the sky, making sure it was clear, I saw an enemy parchuting to the ground, obviously ready to kill us, I raised my rifle, and shot, and I watched him fall to the ground, dead. I read the kill feed "Jesus Christ was killed by Moist Potatos". My team yelled "YOU KILLED JESUS! RIGHT OUT OF THE SKY!" I advanced to my wounded soldier, and I stated "youll be okay, its just one shot". He looked me in the eye, and said, "its okay boss, its my time, let me go in peace". As my eyes began to water, and drip, I told him I would fill his request, and I clicked, "Cancel Revive". The water from my eyes splashed onto the keyboard, my palms began to sweat, and I became shaky, I yelled to my team to keep going to the objective, and I laied down next to my dead medic, and waited for the sniper round to hit, me. As the bullet landed right in my head, I went happy, I did not regret my choice. As I respawned, and I saw my medic standing at the base, I cried, again, and shot that little mother f*cker for not getting revived. So, he shot me, and I got mad, and force shut down my computer. Ill never forget that game. The game my medic puss*ed out, and turned into a lil b*tch. Ill always smile when I think of that. 11/10, this game deserves a bigger fan base than it has, it is SO worth it. Not tired of it after all these hours. Buy it.

The Arma series is a 3rd and 1st person combat simulator with unlimited game modes such as Breakingpoint, Dayz, Altis Life, and normal seize and secure objective missions. Jump in with millions of players and experience realism like never before. And for all the fans of Call of Duty and the Battlefield Franchise your in luck because this game has campain for you to enjoy with no 360 no scope . Strategize, Compromise, and Defeat your enemies one by one in this tactically realistic military simulator. Worth every penny!

review: Arma3 I must say is ummmm... Lets start over, Arma3 is a well thought out game by far. The mods are wonderful and most of the time you can't go to sleep after logging on :). My opinion. I believe with a little more optpmizing on server side/ Company side this game could not be beat out by any other game on the market. Arma3 is a mix of things. If you want fast paced. BAM - ARMA3 If you want slow paced. BAM -ARMA3 If you want great and releastic gun fights/military simulated. BAM - ARMA3 If you want a very minimum amount of hackers (as in I have encountered 0, YES 0 in 258 hours time played. Then BAM -ARMA3 If you want great AI encounters. BAM - ARMA3 Want to pick from many different mod's... Epoch, Battleroyale, Altis Life RP, Wasteland, King oh the hill, choose what you like best. Choppers, military vehicles, awsome guns, what more can you want.. oh yea 1000000 FPS :P A few negatives are the bugs. 1. Dying randomly from stairs, getting in vehicles, falling 5 feet, falling 2 feet, running to fast :P, 2. vehicles blowing up for no reason, blowing up in garages from spawning in diferent directinons. 3. umm nothing else i guess :) Arma3 I would by far recommend to any and everyone my first hour of gameplay I quit, uninstalled and did not try again for 4 months. Well then I was hooked. As long as you can run it due to the optimization your good to go, Hopefully in the future the updates will get pushed faster and less bugs but that wont stop me. Give it a try you wont regret it.

Then going out to be a Rebel or be a Cop or just a normal Civilian. Me and my 3 friends are enjoying this game ALOT. And you will aswell. And if you dont want to play Altis, then you can also play the Campaign and that is really fun aswell, im not a big fan of it but you might be. This game is for every guy who likes the realistic military gameplay and realistic gameplay like the real world. You can also get the DayZ mod and the Battle Royale mod. I havent tried the DayZ Yet but the Battle Royale is REALLY good. Its a great mod and it should get into the game itself instead of being a mod that you can download. But this game is really all the money worth.

review: Me and one of my friends are playing on a Insurgency Startis server when is heli goes down. I get sent out on a rescue mission when my chopper, which is flying over him, gets hit by Anti-Air and goes down hard. He comes over and revies me only to relise that we are right next to an enemy base with a MORA circiling it. We manged to take the zone only left with the MORA still rolling. My friend picks up a launcher with only one rocket. "Make it count" I say. He misses. The MORA turns and sees us then we scatter. Behind the MORA was a Offroader with a machien gun mounted on the back, which we imediatly run for, relising its our only chance. We make it. I drive while my friend shoots all the while the MORA is chasing us. Bullets are flying in all directions. We finnaly lose the MORA and end up in the AO, Agios Efstratios. Im driving with my friend on the outskirts of town when we get blow up. By four IED's. I die but my friend lives. We then come under motor fire, my friend still somehow, alive. He revives me and make it across town. We've captured the AO and everyone on the servers celebrating, except or OPFOR. One of them snipes my friend in the back. while the sniper reloads, I fireman carry him over a hill under cover. I patch him up and we rain motor fire all over the city. 9/10 would swim with fishes again.

review: Arma is the most impressive, ambitious, challenging, and rewarding game I have ever played. Arma is best enjoyed with friends (and Teamspeak). The mod community is outstanding, and our clan has really gotten into map/scenario-making. If you are new to Arma, I'd recommend first hopping in to a King of the Hill (Hostile Takeover is pretty good). You can "lonewolf" it by casually moving with teammates; you can take the next step and ask if someone has an in-game group going and move with them; you can take the greatest (and most rewarding) step and join a group in teamspeak. Feel free to reach out to me, personally, for tips OR if you'd like to play with our community:

review: An infinite playground. Feel like some competition play? Boot up multiplayer and hop on Wasteland or TDM matches. Scenario play? Join one of the massive missions kicking around online. Extremely cool and unique singleplayer experiences? Hop on Steam Workshop and get one of the top rated missions. Want to goof around with your friends? Fire up a co-op mission. There's no game that offers you this much flexibility and this much room to stretch out in. If you're an ArmA vet, you know this already. Unlike the previous ArmA games though, despite some bugs, it's not completely inaccessible to the public. The server system is incredibly easy to use. Steam integration is fantastic. The player models and controls don't feel like operating heavy machinery (except when you're operating heavy machinery). Infantry controls are fluid. Helicopters take time to master but are a joy once you do. Tanks and armored vehicles are appropriately weighty (if a little low on torque and climbing power at times... I often wish I had manual gearboxes). Play ArmA III. You'll have a lot of fun.

review: The newest installment in the Arma series has shown itself to be capable of becoming a valid successor to itself. The new features in this game can make an interesting urban firefight into a strategic and well-thought out plan. In Arma 2, there were very little options for infantry mobility, in Arma 3, consider that no problem. Enhanced moving capabilities make popping in and out of cover much more intuitive and conveinent than in Arma 2. Arma 3 is rapid growing game, with a lot of different gamemodes too. Worth every penny.

review: ArmA 3 is an amazing Military Simulator that treads a line between ultra Realism and Arcade shooter. While the strange controls and not so eazy to adapt to type of tactics may seem intimitdating. Dont let that put you off. this is an amazing game. with a very powerful editor and tons of multiplayer and singleplayer scenarios on the workshop and with the game you will have a lot of fun. there is no campaign and not too many vehicles compared to the last game currently. But the devs behind this awesome game have let us know these will come in due time. (I hope they still put in Capture the Island)

review: Let's get something straight right away: I HATE shooters. I've always been the type of guy who likes RPGs and fantasy/sci-fi games. For me, shooters are just too, how to say this, similar for me. Sure, when you first play a shooter you feel engaged in this world where the battlefield comes to life and every action could have an equal and opposite (i.e. death) reaction: it's really fun. But, as I played more and more shooters, they all started to blend together: play the campaign that involves either terrorists in the Middle-East, Russia vs. America, or a black op gone rouge, and once you're completely bored with that, spend hours on end in the multiplayer. There wasn't that exploration, decisions (in regard to gear and strategy), or overall autonomy that many RPGs offered. Then, I found Arma II. This was one shooter that I absolutely loved, and I easily poured hours into it. The fact you could tackle any mission with any strategy (even going in with no combat appearel), find a server devoted to almost anything (i.e. DayZ, Chenarus Life), and the variety of missions all entranced me, but the main seller for me was the content creator. Never before in ANY game had I been able to create what I wanted to at a moment's notice. Found a mission in the campaign to be unsatisfactory? Just create your own better rendition of it, or even your own original idea from scratch. I had spent days in-game, and when Arma III was announced, you can bet that it was an instant seller for me. When I got it for $60, I was awed by the improved graphics, more introducable interface in the creator, and Workshop content that was amazing. For the first time in a while, I felt as the battlefield had come alive, and every choice I made had dire consequences. It was like I had played a shooter for the first time, which is a magical feeling. Sure, the campaign may be run-of-the-mill, but you can always make your own mission or even campaign. I do have complaints about some of the physics and glitches, but (1. It does its job, and (2. The game has to load a minumun of 17+ spuare kilometres. In comparison, Grand Theft Auto V had a world size of about 32 miles at most. Arma III's biggest map is 270 km for Pete's sake! I'd be suprised if the game only had twenty known glitches. All in all, Arma III is worth more than what you pay for it, and is definitely head-and-shoulders above Call of Duty and Battlefield. I saw a picture on the internet that sums up my feelings: "Command a soldier (image of COD), Command a squad (image of BFF), or command an army or squad or soldier (image of Arma III)". Too whoever posted that picture: I deeply concur with you!

review: This game is breath-taking, whether you like fast-paced gunfights, long-range sniper duels, monster-trucking it with M1A2 Slammer tanks, playing Ace Combat with incredibly fluid movement, raiding a small outpost of hostile forces with a attack helicopter, playing a role in week long, server-wide wars, doing night raids on an enemy research facility, setting up a UAV to perform reconnissance on enemy camps, packing your scuba gear and checking out the lost treasures of Altis and Stratis, or just hopping in a plane and enjoying the wide, vast, beauty of this game! ArmA 3 really dominates the "realistic, military, video game/simulator" genre. Combine some wicked creativity with ArmA 3's mission editor mode and you can create your own missions and scenarios. In the past people have used this to make their own additions to the game, such as new weapons, vehicles, clothing, and even entire maps! ArmA 3's customization is endless and will keep you constantly changing guns, attachments for them, and other equipment to match the situation your in. If you feel like playing solo, ArmA 3 has totally revamped its Campaign mode to keep the player's attention and actually immerse you in the ArmA universe, or forget the single-player all together and go play good cop-bad cop on Altis Life, a user created gamemode, or blowing up tanks and getting in random firefights with other players in Wasteland, also a user-created gamemode. If none of this satisfies you, then you can always just build your own mission, so that you and your own private team can go and enjoy a experience that I guarntee you is as close as you'll get to war before enlisting!

review: Now Arma 3 is a awesome game but were here to talk about more than the fact its awesome, Graphics are amazing well the way i can run it, Arma 3 can bring someone's FPS to -100 depending on your comp. so if it is lagging i highly suggest you lower the settings down ALOT. What can you do on Arma 3: You can do Atlis Life (Alot of Role play, it has a bank and cops so there you go), Battle Royale (Hunger Games but in Arma 3), Dayz Brecking point (Arma 3 Dayz Mod) Now about brecking point its a pain just to login to it so i suggest you play Atlis life and Battle Royale, And it is a 1rst/3rd person shooter i rather allways be in 3rd person for certin reason's that im not gonna disscuss. There is alot more gamemodes but those are my things. Is it worth the money, Depending on your comp. Yes As allways my rateing for this game is 10/10 REMEMBER THIS IS ALL MY OPION SO DO NOT THINK ITS ALL HERE. THANKS FOR YOUR TIME

review: Awesome game, for what it is designed for. ARMA is a military simulator. And that brings good and bad things. You can't go guns blazing everywhere like you would in CoD. Get shot 2-3 times, you're dead. That's it. Your tank gets hit by a single missile? You're dead. You get sniped from a mile away by someone hiding in the bushes? You're dead. This game aims for realism, and it definitely achieves that. Buy this game knowing that it is very different than typical FPS shooters, but it is so much better in so many ways. The tactical abilities of your soldier, the controls to move your soldier, the gameplay with your friends and THE MODS THAT ARE CREATED ARE AMAZING. The mods seriously make this game come alive. This is a great game. Different from other shooters because it's in its own category.

review: Arma 3 is an amazing game! This game is great for anyone who likes shooters or RP games. This game is one of the best first person/3rd person games I have ever played. I have played Arma 2 and I have to say Arma 3 is so much better than Arma 2. The only problems about this games that really game to my attention is... First off glitches, they're not too bad but they can get annoying every now and then. Also servers is a big problem, there aren't many servers out there for a variety of gamemodes, the ones that I commonly see is Deathmatch or Battle Royale, Breakingpoint, King Of The Hill, and some others, but other than that this game is really fun and an enjoyable experience for players that are new or old to the 1st/3rd person shooter genre. I really recommend you get this game, especially if you're coming from Arma 2 or even Battlefield. Thanks! I hope I helped you out!

review: Arma 3 is arguably the single most realistic and immersive experience you can find today. It took me quite a while to get it running well, however after its up and running you wont be able to put it down. The maps are insanely huge, allowing for intense tactics. The realism of the guns is where this game really shines. while some may complain that the kick is not entirely realistic you have to adjust the sights for distance. If you get shot even once you will either be dead or have an injury such as a broken leg which only allows you to walk. Overall this game is a 9.5/10. aside from some performance issues this game is nothing short of amazing

review: So the campaign is complete. A lot of folks are still having the BF4 or A3 discussion (argument). Here's what I found. A3 is not without its faults. One of the biggest apects of the game is that it's aimed at the "thinker". What I mean by that is that you have endless ways to achieve your goals, but yes in being a milsim you can be taken out by a lucky shot from a guy you never saw (with pinpoint AI targeting) from 500yrds away. For some folks that's the heart of endless frustration and this is not the game for you. BF4 shouldn't be bashed either, it's simply for a group of folks that want action and eye candy - and it delivers on both of those in spades. A3 has amazing visuals in my opinion, yet they are harder to appreciate because so much tweaking is required to get decent FPS while keeping some of the visual goodies. It's the fact that A3 is ridiculously hard sometimes, and requires a huge time investment compared to most games, that make it so satisfying when everything finally goes right. A3 gives you a sense of accomplishment like no other when everything hits the fan and you (or your teammates) quick thinking pays off for a win. Being able to jump into almost any vehicle or aircraft leave you feeling that you can be the ultimate ____________ (tank driver, helo pilot, fixed wing ace etc...). Yes BF4 has some of these components, but delivered in a completely different way. Run, gun, get shot a bunch of times, hide, heal, and do it over again. And that's completely ok if that's you're style of gameplay and what you enjoy. A3 plan, plan, plan some more, cross a huge amount of terrain that can literally take hours on foot, and get shot by a dude you never saw, or...) make the hard win. You will dump huge amounts of time into A3 to be decent at it (plenty of folks don't have that kind of time to commit). BF4 get on..play for a match or two and leave if you want. BF4 has some great DLC's the latest carrier edition looks awesome. A3 has mod...after mod...after mod. With a workshop full of missions (horrible to great), plus a community that's pretty engaging and helpful. For me it's A3 all the way!

review: Where to start, ok on whole Bohemia games are just that little bit more special than most other games. The reason is not that they have the greatest graphics or smoothest game play, infact if you was judging their games on that alone then i wouldnt be writing a positive review. No the great thing ( and i used the word great as that is what Bohemia do ) about the games made by this Indie company have a very realistic feel to them. Granted Arma3 compared to previous Arma releases is way out infront iin the graphics stakes, but as i have already said, there is so much more to the Arma series than just graphics alone. Some of the mods made for them have gone on to be legends ( or rather A LEGEND ) in its own right. But even if you end up buying Arma 3 and never adding a mod to it, it is still worth every penny that your going to spend. I think its fair to say that these days spending under forty english pounds on entertainment wont get you much, Arma 3 breaks that trend. You will get hour after hour, day after day and if your not careful month after month of realistic heart pumping excitement from this game. Infact calling any of the Arma series a game is not doing it justice. Arma is not only entertainment its something a little bit special. If your at College i suggest not purchasing this until you are on a break, if you have a fulltime job then maybe now is the time to use those days off you are owed. And if you have a partner then tell them you think you should have a break for a while. YES IT REALLY IS THAT GOOD.

review: The Campaign: Firstly, I must address the "campaign" in this game. I have finally bit the bullet and played it. I did not enjoy it for a single second. The AI seems to be 10x smarter within the campaign. You would think this is a good thing because it would pose more of a challenge, but no, this is not the case. The AI seems to have X-RAY, Aimbot, and Sixth sense all in one. At times I am completely hidden and they will spot me instantly, not missing a single bullet and kill me within seconds. The First mission of Adapt is by far the worst thing Bohemia has ever created. You are one man vs. over 40 foot soldiers and 1 annoying chopper. You can pick up ammo from dead bodies that are generously placed about the map, but that won't do you any good once you are getting shot from every single spot you could possibly imagine. I cannot fathom Bohemia Interactive's thought process behind this thing they have the audacity to call a "Campaign". I advise anyone to steer clear of it if you ever decide to give it a go. Its not worth the 5 hours you will put into it. I regret every second. -- The Editor: By far the best thing about ARMA 3. Being able to put your own spin on the game creating the missions you want to play. Just a little note: ANY user made campaign is better than Bohemia Interactives "Campaign." The editor is what has led to me putting over 200 hours into this game; Its so fun to create a scenario to play your way. If you have a desire to create your own missions and even campaigns, ARMA 3 is the game for you. It does have a bit of a learning curve if you want to add tasks, complex waypoints, your own music, etc. -- The Multiplayer: I have also put a huge chunk of time playing the multiplayer. Whether its the ANNEX mission, or Wasteland, the muliplayer of ARMA 3 offers so much to do. The multiplayer is one of ARMA 3s best features. You can play online with I would say over 50 people at times on the vast 100km+ Altis and Stratis. Depending on the mission/game mode you play, you can easily waste away 20 hours a week on the multiplayer. -- Graphics: This game has beautiful graphics. An enormous improvement over its predecessor, ARMA 3 has luscious environments. Whether its at the depths of the ocean floor, or running up to the nearest hill, ARMA 3 has amazing graphics that you will notice straight away. The maps are so detailed and colorful with plentiful vegetation that makes the huge map of Stratis and Altis feel alive. Realism: This game is the best Military shooter to date. If you are an avid fan of Call of Duty/Battlefield, this game is no where near comparable. Its aimed to be the most realistic military sim in the market. -- -- Overall: I recommend this game to anyone who enjoys military simulators and doesn't mind a shooter being slow paced. This game requires a lot of patience. My final verdict is 8/10. This game is way better than its predecessors but still lacks a lot of things.

review: Arma is a game that takes a type of person to like it. It has its glitches, and its awesome things. Altis Life is something you should check out if you are more of a casual RP player. If you are more serious, try out a mil sim server where literally everything is simulated like the military. There are also domination servers where you capture towns from enemy NPC forces. If you have no patience, there is always wasteland, or king of the hill, where you can shoot people on sight without worry of a ban. Personally I think arma is a great game. I would give it a 8.5/10 due to the "arma glitches" and learning curve. They are working on fixing the learning curve though. I would like to see more out of the devs, even though I believe they are working hard. Most of my time is from playing on an altis life server - Therevolutiongaming. Finding a good community for casual RP is what I look for and have found it there.

review: Arma 3 is a really good game. If you feel like a real army game, go and play arma, good tactics etc makes your team win. For the RolePlayer's out here, they are also at the right addres, arma has an RP mod called "Altis Life" this is fantastic for people who love RP with good graphics. I really recommend this game for actually every player who loves an army game and for people who seek real RolePlay

review: Best game i have ever played. The Arma series is realy improving from Arma2 to Arma3. The graphics are superb, frame rate is good, overall it still needs some work on campaign and map design. I recently read a post from the mayor of Altis and he said that it "Turend their peaceful little island into a battleground and that it showed a local buisness factory that is private and secret." Overall i rate this game a 4 out of 5.

review: ARMA, to me, used to remind me of a quote I read that war is long periods of boredom perpetuated by small moments of sheer terror and excitement. This was the exact thought running through my head as I was driving a HEMETT truck to the port city of Kamino. Apparently a Commander had requested logistical support then hauled  back to the city, but for what no one knows. I find out a few moments later as my Squad Leader yells for me to stop the truck at the site of a large explosion that claimed the Commander's truck. What follows, and I won't describe it for sake of spoilers so I'll only tell you includes a lot of frantic running and shooting, is the most impressive mission that Bohemia has shown in any of their campaigns. It isn't impressive by scale in relation to other missions, but it sets the scale for the rest of the game and immerses the player and makes a promise to them I never imagined they could deliver on. And that was for a very tense and exciting game with absolutly no pause button. ARMA III is, of course, the third independent installment to Bohemia's award winning military simulation series. Depending on what you do in the game, whether it be the multiplayer of the campaigns, you play a Corporal Kerry, a Special Forces soldier in the United States Military, or you play as a soldier within this conflict taking play in 2035 on an island-nation called Altis and then Stratis later on. Being a simulation game there is massive attention to detail when it comes to scenery and the hardware available in the game. The developers actually take real life geography and copy it into the game creating very believe-able and real life environments, not to mention law suits and jail-time for some devs all in the name of treason. Along with that the weapons, vehicles, and general kit used by the soldiers of these games are amazingly authentic in usage and design with life-like audio to boot. Along with the genuine looks of the game theres the true to life gameplay. Arma seems to be made by one of those few groups of humans on earth that believe guns actually harm people. When the bullets do finally fly in these titles you can guarantee that someone wont get back up after even a single round is fired, meaning that players have to actually take cover and think with their head and their teammates during an engagement, counting doubly so for those wishing to drive/fly any vehicle on the game. Speaking of those strange things going in the same direction as you are (for all those rail-shooter inclined), these are called teammates and they are very helpful in your success and you may want to find a means of communicating with them to achieve anything. Pick a job within a squad, whether you decide to be a grenadier, marksman, AT specialist, SAW gunner, whatever! And you don't even have to be limited to a class. As long as you got the knowledge to use the tools of your desired, destructrive trade. The only lacking I've ever found in Arma games is that they are pretty boring despite the scale, however this is a problem thankfully resolved in Arma III. Most firefights in older titles were very distant and felt more robotic that an actual struggle between two groups of people. Not so for Arma III. This time around firefights are much more fluid and exciting. Fights on the streets are quick and brutal and leave you on edge for the next go around. Skirmishes on open ground aren't the usual long distance punching matches between two groups of heads bobbing up and down, but are now dives for any sign of cover followed by frantic firing in your enemies direction as they either advance on you or you advance on them. Its a feeling that is difficult to create in a shooter that is excellently executed through Bohemia's much improved immersion with character movement and authentic scenery, weapons, vehicles and just plain everything, and that feeling is actual adrenalin fueled fear for biting the big one. In an overview, Arma III is a game of amazing scale that creates the feel of an real combat area with the true to life detail of every possible aspect of a shooter from the landscape to the weapon in your hands. The fighting in this game is brutal and surprisingly fast paced compared to earlier titles, making the usual emphasis on teamwork and cooperation even greater and more important. Its as close an I can imagine any gamer can get, or will want to get, to the real deal and serves as a surpisingly fun entry to the franchise. My lack of experience in this game with its new features and gamemodes keeps me from giving this game a full look-around. All I can really say is that if you are a fan of a more team based game, instead of the usual Call of Duty or Battlefield clones that seem to be par for the course, it is worth your time. Give it a try with some like minded people you known and/or have to tie to a chair and desktop to get them to play something and you won't regret the experience. Or you won't like it in the slightest, in which case may whatever deity you love have mercy on your poor soul.

review: I had got addicted to ARMA 2 combined operations before this game. The semi-futureistic feel this game has did not grab me at first, by after a while I loved it. Great game for modding also, in-fact, it is so good for modding that my mod folder is now more than 3 times the size of the game folder. Bohemia interactive did a very good job on this game, I recommend. I give it a 9.5/10. P.S. Do not stand on jagged rocks or rubble - the result is not favourable.

review: as all arma games they are hard to figure out the controls but bieng the next step after the most realistic game in the world its understandable.Arma three has greatly improved its campaign after arma 2's rather terrible one Arma #'s is actually worth playing.When it comes to multiplayer in a arma game there is nothing like it ranging from altis life(role play) to conquoring the whole vast 270 sq kilometers of altis.I would definately recommend this game to anyone that has a computer that can handle it.Nomatter if you have the recommended requirements or not as you can imagine this game puts a load on computers.

review: Arma 3 has a lot of detail when it comes to its graphics which is good but it can also have some bad points, Although it is realistic half the time you can't see your enemies because the sun is in your way. A massive problem with Arma 3 is the AI, They are totally un-realistic i once used a sniper to shoot at an AI who took cover on the ground and as it was long distance i missed using a sniper, He stood up and returned fire hitting me with about 3 of his 4 shots. At the distance he shot at it would be impossible with an assault rifle. I've never really found ArmA as a game i would play by myself because it becomes boring and repetitive especially when you keep dying and most of the game consists of travelling to the battle. I like ArmA 3 and i would suggest it to everbody because you can have some good times on it. But the game itself needs to have a lot of work for it to be a game i would consistantly play.

review: So far it's pretty much the best milsim out there, bar none. I do wish for a mod to include realistic reloading animations and a mechanic that recognizes bullets in the chamber. Negatives are the extreme amount of Wasteland servers out there, and complete lack of proper pvp servers that are friendly for playing without friends. For better or worse, unless you, for some inexplicable reason, actually LIKE the Wasteland mod, you're better off playing the co-op servers where it's you, 20 or so other folks, customizable loadout ammo crates, and places on the map to clear of enemy AI. Game looks good, and it's a real treat for such a milsim to look good, and have alot of potential draw distance.

review: Arma 3 is the current pinnacle of tactical military sims. The multiplayer is home to diverse community driven missions, mods, and addons--the scope of which is ever expanding. The single player campaign, though clunky at times with trigger based scripted events and obtuse progression, is engaging and immersive. The maps are incredible. Stratis is a fantastically detailed, compact island only ~20 sq km. It features rugged terrain, a city, small villages, an airbase, and FOBs of various size. Altis offers a massive experience at ~270 sq km. It's a fantastically beautiful Mediterranean environment with cities, towns, highways, military complexes, airports, airstrips, fobs, resorts, energy stations, ruins, castles, islands... critically one of the best environments in gaming.

review: Arma 3 is a combat simulator, meaning that it is realistic and has great physics. The campaign is interesting and has enough combat and action so you don't get bored easily. There are many modes/mods to play on Arma 3 like Wasteland, Altis Life, Domination, King of the Hill, Team Deathmatch, etc. Arma 3's editor is awesome and allows you to make simple bases, missions, or expirements or complex bases, missions, and expirements. The game is $60USD but is definitely worth buying if you're interested in games that include a sandbox, several gamemodes, and many ways to play. If you don't believe the game is worth buying, check out videos on YouTube about several of the game modes in the game and decide off the gameplay you see.

review: Arma 3 is a game that you love, or hate. If you liked the previous Arma-Games, you wont have a lot of problems getting into Arma 3 quickly. Pros: +Improved HUD +Improved Movement and more control over your Character +Great Graphics +Good for Simulation, but also provides a lot of fun due to the variety of missions you can play, from racing to a Life Simulator, you will find something that fits your taste +Amazing Player Interaction and great to make new friends, overall fun to play with other. +A variety of Workshop content Cons: -The controls, while being better than in Arma 2, are still rather unresponsive -Very demanding when you want to play the game at high setting and a good framerate, especially when youre playing online -Altis and Stratis are very boring maps that dont bring a lot of tactical possibilies nor are they really fancy (fences and rocks will be your worst enemies) -Very few weapons and equipment to chose from This list might be uncompleted, I will add further points when I encounter them while playing. The Devs are still working hard on this game and are releasing some reasonably priced DLCs that add new gameplay elements such as new vehicles, new mechanics or new weapons, aswell as free updates to balance and fix any issues that might accure. After all, I highly recommend this game, wether you like military simulations or not, you will have a lot of fun with the variety of possibilities this game gives you.

review: THIS is an AWESOME game to play. The developer team is really caring about the community. The workshop and map editor helps you to do a LOT of things that no other games can. The hardward requirement is pretty high and you will not get the best experience if you can only run on low or medium. PLUS, if you one of those people who play COD or battlefield a lot, you may need a few hours to L2P this game. ARMA 3 is seriously an simulation game, any gun can pretty much 2 shot or 1 shot you at any distance(and the AI is pretty good at aiming). Stay in cover, move quick and you will enjoy this war on the island.

review: Let me start off by saying this game is great and the workshop makes it 20x better. But in order to give a good review I must give both sides of the story. This game is very complex and can be intimedating for the noobie, but one of the greatest parts about this games loyal comunity is that no matter how stupid a siduation might be, they will still role play it out. That is partially why this series seems so realistic, the community is great. Of coarse there are always those people who would rather complain about how bad someone is instead of helping them to become better. But most people are willing to help with anything you might need. The next thing is to learn the controls. It will make your life so much easier, there may seem to be many controls, but you only use a few of them unless you are a commander. Also this game is beautiful and usually runs desently well on a mid range pc. Now I must give the downsides. The campaign is ok but it is not arma 2 quality. That is the main theme here is that it is not arma2. I dont know why but this game is missing something that both arma2 and arma cwa nailed. It seems more directed and controlled that previous installments of the series. One will need a mid range ish pc to run this game. All in all this is a great game with a wonderful community and it has endless mods from the workshop so if you are debating weather to get the game or not, let me make the decisioin for you. Get the game.

review: This is not a game, this is a simulation if anything. Admittedly its not really war, and its not a good representation of the horrors of conflict, but its significantly better than Call of duty's over romanticized grade 6 representation. As for worth, this is not a game you can really quantify. Unlike many games where the campaign length or the multiplayer dictate its quality, this is much more than a game. If you played and liked Arma 1, or 2, buy 3. And if youre thinking about buying Arma 3, do it. The endless modibility, the mission creation and steam workshop, and the rich community are what make the Arma series a true beauty. Not to mention the Multiplayer and Campaign are kick .

Like most multiplayer games, Arma 3 works ALOT better with friends becuase it allos for you to have more coordination, which is a very important factor in Arma 3. Its fairly system intensive , but has gone through alot of optimiztion patches, but you should still look into the system requirements before purchasing. I would highly reccomend it, especially if you have friends to play it with.

review: Have you ever been kidnapped before? Well i'll tell you one thing it's terrifying. Me and my 2 armed other friends just fueled up our car and we started leaving the gas station. As we we're leaving 2 men in a suv parked they're car right infront of ours and told us to get out. We we're scared so we attempted to drive away. All of a sudden rubber bullets started flying everywhere. They managed to knock out my friends. I was still conscious but I was terrified. They tied us up with zip ties, put us in a suv and took away our phones. As we we're being kidnapped, I noticed a man hiding behind a building. We we're brought to a junk yard with a tall crane. They brought us all the way to the top. At this point I knew it was the end. They were gonna gonna kill us. All of a sudden I noticed a man at the bottom of the crane. Then I saw 3 cop cars driving towards the junk yard. The 2 armed men started shooting at the cops. As they were shooting I saw a helicopter flying towards us. I was happy and scared at the same time. Bullets started flying everywhere almost hitting every part of my body. One of the kidnappers started climbing down the ladder towards the bottom. Some how I managed to break free of my zip ties and I pulled out a gun and shot the armed man shooting at the cops. Me and my friends started screaming saying we we're the victims. One cop climbed up the ladder and told us to get to the bottom immediately. So we did and as soon as we got to the bottom we asked questions about the situation. We got pardoned of our crimes for killing one of the kidnappers. All of a sudden I heard gun shots flying everywhere. I noticed they were rubber bullets because I saw many cops getting knocked out. I looked up and saw the helicopter flying away probably requesting for back up. I looked back down and noticed everyone knocked out and tied up. The only ones who we're still free was me and my friend. My friend started shooting at the armed man. I tried to peek and see if could get a clear shot but as I peeked gun shots flew near my head. So I looked for cover. I saw my friend on the ground unconscious. I saw the armed man walking towards my friend tieing him up. I had the perfect shot, I aimed my gun slowly towards head and took the shot. I quickly ran towards the police and unrestrained them. They quickly unrestrained my friends. We ended up driving to Kavala in shock of what just had happened. We kept driving and never looked back. That doesn't just happen in any other multiplayer game. I thought it was all just a movie, a show or something. I never knew that could ever happen in a videogame. If you're looking to buy it YOU MUST DO IT NOW. If you ever want an expereience like that then this is the game you should buy. 11/10 -IGN

review: The greatest military sandbox I have ever played, Arma 3 is a lovingly crafted game, giving you an endless amount of scenerios to enjoy. Singleplayer gives you the option to screw around with the editor and either create the insane or the epic. It's a challenge to learn but well worth it. The main campaign can be frustrating at times, but overall is a very excellent experience. User-made content and scenerios add another layer of depth, and Zeus gives an easy integration of that and multiplayer. Multiplayer is by far the strongest point of the game, giving an in-depth experience in many a situation. You can play it as a roleplayer, joining Life servers. You can be a survivor of the wastes in Wasteland, or you can join in many user-made situations. The greatest of the options, however, is proper, team-based objective gameplay. With the right men, squads can work together to accomplish tasks against insurmountable odds. It gives a very strong sense of satisfaction to be part of such a team, and finishing the mission only solidifies that feeling. If you want a very-well made military simulator, offering wonderful graphics, processor-melting situations, teamwork, tension and combined-warfare operation, Arma 3 is for you.

review: First thing about this title, is that it may be called a game, but it is a simulator. There is a big difference. If you buy this looking for CoD or Battlefield type game play, you are going to be extremely disappointed. You cannot sprint around forever. Your equipment weighs you down and gets you tired. You can die of heat exhaustion. Running a kilometer and going prone doesn't allow you to shoot the wings off of a fly, you are going to have to wait till you heart stops pounding and your hands stop shaking. Guns use ammo, ammo which you don't get from running over the corpse of someone you killed. It needs to be the right caliber and in a mag that fits the weapon you are using. And that's just the beginning. The gameplay has evolved a bit since Arma 2, you can dive in the water now and there are a lot of different stances to help with firing from or getting behind cover. The inventory system has evolved greatly, but still not very user friendly to those not familiar with the arma series. The story so far is not the reason to buy the game, actually, the story is pretty weak. Where Arma 3 shines is the user created content. User missions, user mods. Arma is one of if not the most moddable game I've ever seen. From full conversion Fallout / Stalker type game mods, to dynamic user missions that pits you against insurgent activity and linked side missions that pop up all over the map. (IE stop an enemy convoy from getting from a to b, so that b's defenses are weaker, take out the radio tower so they cannot call for backup, kill the commanding officer to put the others in a state of chaos.) All in all, an ok game on it's own, but an awesome game because of the modding community. The one thing that I hold against it is that Bohemia has yet to release a working 3d editor for it. The community has made some awesome mods to make up for this, but that does not let Bohemia off the hook for not having a working one out already, especially since modding and editing is the only saving grace for this game.

review: Arma 3 is not quite a first person shooter, it really is more of a "war simulator" overall. It is highly detailed and looks great visually but there can be a bit of a learning curve. The games strong point, in my opinion is the way it tries to do multiplayer, where you make missions and what not. I find this single feature what makes Arma stand out the best. More shooters should have the level of control Arma 3 gives players. There were a few "cons" to all of its "pros" though, so I will list my biggest as follows. 1. Multiplayer Servers (if not set up properly and efficiently) can make the game squat down and take a huge dump on your FPS (frames per second) 2. I feel the multiplayer user interface could use some work. making the game more accessible to new players. 3. Better single player. Arma may be best for its multiplayer but I think overall more work could be done making the single player experience more enjoyable. All in all I think Arma 3 does the "shooter/ war simulation" best, it may not be as popular as games like COD or Battlefield but thats not a bad thing. Imagine if it was that popular, then we would be dealing with those "guys"...

review: I have Autism and I recommend this game.

review: This game has outstanding potential hidden inside it. Over ArmA 2 and Arrowhead, both graphics, features and gameplay has improved significantly. Unfortunately, cannot say the same thing about performance. Not only you need a beast of a PC to run it at a decent framerate on singleplayer, on multiplayer, that thousands of dollars worth PC won't help you, since it's completely down to the server hardware. Every AI unit you add to the battle might and will impact your framerate. If there are 30 units, kiss 10 frames goodbye. If there are 100 units, that will sum up to at least 20 frames. Engine itself, is heavily dependent on CPU and by that I mean it's clock speeds. At this moment, AI runs on the main game/server thread to combat any desynch in multiplayer in turn, tickrate hits the dirt. Considering game is not multi-core optimized at all, neither Hyperthreading nor Octacores will help you. If you do not have a Nvidia card and you are planning to run the game with a CPU that's a little better than what's recommended, don't bother, it will slice 10 from your frames, culprit, PhysX. Even with the top of the line CPU and GPUs in SLI, do not dream about anything over 60 frames on a populated CO-OP, Single Player or Multiplayer mission. You WILL get dips below 40 at times. Graphic settings won't impact your frames much, as long as you reduce CPU hogging settings such as clouds and drawdistance, you can run the game at ultra without much of an issue. Framerate impact is completely because of CPU under utilization. Mechanics are amazing, gunplay is exceptional. AI can be extremely clever and they communicate, flank, use supports and can make your life a misery if you aren't situationally aware. Single player is extremely interesting and mission editor gives unlimited content possibilities. On development branch, Introduction of Zeus DLC wasn't in vain. It's such a great addition. Consider it as a more user friendly mission editor that comes with the game plus, you can adjust EVERYTHING in real time. It will make you forget about the performance. For $35.99, it's a good package. But if you aren't really into such a game, I say wait for a better discount.

review: ARMA 3 is very different from ARMA 2, It is not a game for people that want fast action gaming, this is a game for people who appreciate the small things, this game requires patience and tactical skill, There are experiences in ARMA 3 that you will not experience in Battlefield, or Call Of Duty, for example the tactical aspect of ARMA 3, if your lucky enough to be part of a tactical community then you can get the full benefits of playing ARMA 3, not like wasteland or altis life. ARMA 3 has burst up from the old ARMA's from the help of Dayz, i'm not saying Dayz game arma all the populatrity but it defintly gave them the boost they needed. I remeber when i first joined a tactical server, i was a noob, i had no clue what these call signs ment, or any command chain. But i was rushed to a heli and placed into bravo squad, i was told to stick next to the medkit, when i look back i think i chose the marksman load out, i was not very useful to the group in till we revived a lot of heavy fire, once are squad lead went down, it was just me and the medic, as the medic couldn't go down i had to rush out into the feild, dragging theese random people back to cover, now i did not know any of theese people, but in the moment it felt like i did, i felt like i was part of the team. Once i dragged half of my bleeding team out, i was assigned a special job, i was given satchel charges to blow up the objective, when i came up to the tower i had a little trouble setting it, but never the less i manage to place down the charge, as i ran back in a big rush to the heli evac, i looked around and saw the tower blow, it came crashing down into the hill. At the moment i relised this is what ARMA 3 is ment to be like. 9.5/10 -Lewis

review: I love this game! When it works... Lately I've been unable to play multiplayer (any type of singleplayer mode works fine) as it just causes my computer to freeze when I join a "lobby". It forces me to quit the game through the task manager (doesn't always work) and even then causes things to not work at all forcing to do a restart. It's a shame as the game itself is amazing... Sadly there doesn't seem to be any clues as to why this is happening or of a fix, even though there are several reported instances of this happening from many other people. Hopefully someone figures out the cause of this and it get's fixed.

The only downfall is the AI (If you have no mods on), the settings for their skill levels needs a bit of refining. It's either they're as dumb as a stump or so smart that they drop you before you can even get ready. Definitely recommend.

And if you ever do get bored with the vanilla game there are mods. A lot of them too. You can also download so many different mods. There are downloads for missions, guns, cars, and a whole lot more. There are also different game modes and scenarios that change how you play the game. This is by far one of my favorite games. So I truly do recommend this game!

The Campain is dinamic allowing you to go on patrols or scouts after every mission and the story line is amazing , not gonna give too much away but you are Cpl. Kerry from Bravo Squad stationed on the island of Stratis staying behind to make sure all NATO elements evacuate the island , unfortunaly things go south and they get attacked by *** forces (Independant) and leaving Kerry alown with his Sgt, they get saved by a British squad who moved onto the island and fight to recontrol the island, and i am not saying anything futher exept for that the Editor has been redone , looks alot more fancy and the customiseation options in the game are well done .

review: While this game had some major bugs at the begining, it has started to smooth out to be one of the best simulators of all time. Lets start out with the actual simulation. Well you are defaulted to be in First Person everytime you spawn but you can go to third person if you have the keys binded. There is bullet drop, weather, vehicles, weapons(Not real time weapons), and lots of customization options for YOUR soldier. There is tons of fatigues and weapons to choose from if you're playing vanilla. Now if you're playing with mods in your game, you are going to have a even better time playing. Mods can help with AI and add new clothes for your soldier, I.G Helmets, vests, facial protection, and fatiuges. Just a really big tip is if you don't have anyone to play with on this game, find a Milsim unit and I guarentee you won't be bored. 10/10 would join milsim unit again Thx Bohemia Interactive

review: Man where can I start. This game has made me forget any other game out there (including BF4)...so many options and possibilities. After surviving a really intense firefight our squad made it out alive. We requested to be picked up and the nearest vehicle was a M939 truck I believe. We replenished our ammo and equipment and on our way to the next target our driver fell asleep and we all got killed in the crash...good times. WARNING: If you do not want to spend hours and hours playing do not buy.

review: An incredible creation for those with right tools, I simply cannot reccomend this more to those of you with a good amount of RAM and a half decent graphics card, otherwise you are in for a hard time. I like to look at games on how good they can be, not how good they are on a crappy little e-machine. On ARMA3 I have had some of the best memories in PC gaming thanks to the great community that plays it and the ahrd work Bohemia Interactive has put into this masterpiece. Pros: -Active modding community -Great graphics/attention to detail -Engaging and exciting storyline with memorable characters Cons: -You will need a beast PC to have an enjoyable experience -Pricey DLCs -Some issues with FPS (BI says it is related to the engine and will be optimized) Overall I really do reccomend ARMA3 to the military enthusiast to the casual FPS gamer:) Enjoy.

review: This is not your typical shooter, it is more of a simulation game with firefights usually at football feild lengths away unlike the close quarter battles in CoD or MoH. This is not a Shooter with tightly scripted fights and cynimatic bravado, it is a sandbox game in the truest sense of the word especially with the games support of the mod community. If you have basic scripting knowledge or patience then the game opens new possibilities with the fantasic mission editor that alows you to set up single and multiplayer firefights in minutes. Lastly the multiplayer is fun though I find multiplayer is better at a smaller scale with friends on custom missions though if you can get into a warefare game it is a lot of fun playing a large scale realistic RTS/FPS.

review: Rant about why I enjoy the game -Great game! I love the campaign so far, user made content is brilliant, and so far my favorite multiplayer game mode is King of The Hill ( 3 teams fight for one objective), it's nice because it has a leveling system and saves your level and gear. I also enjoy wasteland, a gamemode where players have to fend for themselves or band together and build massive  shaped forts! (Just kidding but if that was an option, it'd probably happen) Wasteland is a nice gamemode because there are tons of vehicles just lyin about, loaded with guns and ammo, and the moment you get near it an attack helicopter piloted by AI swoops in to say hello, at least that's how one of my many lives went, AI don't roam freely in wasteland, but are side objectives in the game, and if you kill all of them, you could get anything from a box with guns in it to a helicopter loaded to the max with missiles and bullets (But of course it doesn't have fuel, so fresh spawns can't roll up and steal your helo while you are taking out the AI guarding it) Cons - AI can be a bit tricky to deal with, making campaign a pain in the  at times - AI take a moment to ragdoll upon death, and I find myself empying half a magazine directly into them not realizing that they've died - Vehicle mechanics could be better, although they aren't terrible - VAULTING!!! I find myself vaulting my way through objects, and into rocks and all sors of terrible things like that, not sure why devs didn't add jumping, or something with less potential to cause problems OVERALL Is it a bad game?  no, I love it, even though it doesn't have the best mechanics *COUGH* (vaulting), BUT, if you are looking for a nice singleplayer experience, I wouldn't necessarily reccomend the game to you unless you plan on spending hours raging at the AI in campaign, although the campaign is quite amazing in itself it is also quite challenging. Basically if you want to get the game, get it if you have a few friends or if you'd like to make a few on multiplayer, otherwise maybe not the best game for you, I bought the game after playing a little bit of ArmA II on my uncles PC, I enjoyed it, but the AI were overpowered, and I saw that this was coming out so I took a go at it and really enjoyed it, and I think you probably will too!

review: Before playing this game you should ask yourself - what military operation would you like to play? Do you want to be a sniper? Do you want to be a part in a big combined arms operations? Do you want to ride a tank? Helicopter? Kart? Do you want to be a civilian and simply role-play your wild dreams? Do you want to play as a god? Really, there is not much to be said about ARMA that has not been said - yes, there are bugs, yes it is still a bit laggy, but it gets better. And it will get better because developers still update game and listen to fans feedback. You can have hundreds of mods, do whatever you want to do or simply follow missions. It is all up to you. This is main difference between other military shooters - it is a sandbox concept, which means you are buying lot of games in one.

review: Disappointed in the full release. Copy-paste content between the factions (static weapons, launchers, pretty much all vehicle turrets, drones) really kills it. Seriously. 3 factions, and all 3 of them use the same AT/AA launchers, retextured UAV/UGVs, MRAPs have the same turret, the 2 AA and mobile arty vehicles are just the same retextured turret on a tank base. AI is still ridiculously stupid. At huge ranges they are superhuman, relying on pure aiming ability to be amazing, but at close range often ignore you when you're in front of them, blundering all over the place and eventually shooting the floor in front of you... Drivers crash into walls all the time, tanks don't engage the way you ask them to, gunners sometimes continually fire even though you'd told them to hold fire many many times. The action menu is still in. Disgusting and annoying. Optimisation is horrific, as usual. Hundreds of square kilometers of map to play on, but place down any more than 20/30 individual squad groups and the game grinds down to a halt, especially ruining multiplayer. Sure it's pretty, and Altis is beautiful, and the stances are a nice addition, as is PhysX on vehicles. But a lot of the major points they made got glossed over massively. They said it was set in the future to allow artistic freedom whereas what we've got is altered modern day vehicles (e.g. the Merkava), copy pasted turrets, and retextures of just 1 model on some of the biggest new features (SDV, UGV, UAV, Quadrotor). Same launcher for most factions. All statics/mortars the same for every faction. Same missiles on aircraft. Only 1 jet. Campaign not on release. "Release" was just Altis+some new vehicles. Basically, to me it looks like they got lazy. I hate that idea, so instead I guess they must have run out of time, copy-pasting turrets and vehicles and static weapons between the factions, skimping on promised features, and ignoring big issues, to get Altis out on the date they said they were going to. They bit off more than they can chew, and they're still refusing to acknowledge this. A real real real shame. 6/10. Game is wonderful... but it could have been so much better if they'd just delayed their "release" a few months to actually finish the thing. This crossed with Arma 2's range of content, plus actual optimisation, would be a godly game.

Yes, you do sometimes have to be quick with a rifle, but a lot of the game is getting the right rifle into the right place at the right time. Plan your attack. Prioritise your targets. Place your team. Only then, do you open fire. And remember, in every war, there's always luck and chance that plays a hand. It's a great game, if you are prepared to to put the time in to play it properly.

review: My friend shot me in the foot and left me to die. 10/10 But in all seriousness, ArmA 3 is a beautiful game and is tons of fun. There is a lot to do with this game, from booting up the editor and having you and a group of friends do a mission, to helicopter flight practice. Playing ArmA 2 with the Dayz mod has really gotten me into ArmA, and I enjoy it.

review: Arma 3 is probably one of the most 'moment' making games I've ever played. When I first began and still to this day when I play it, every now and then I get some awesome "Holy , that was awesome!" moments in there that no other title that I personally have experienced was able to deliver quite as well as Arma 3 does. For example times where I was able to blow up a convoy of armored vehicles, and helicopters flying low with just a red pickup truck that was missing a wheel, or another where a few friends, and I were able to bring a team together and establish a base stocking it with vehicles to then fly squads out while blasting 'Fortunate son' on the vehicle channel. The graphics are also absolutely stunning, especially with all the incredible amount of detail that Bohemia Interactive have put into this game for example: That the rear, and side view mirrors on cars actually work or the fact that your character's mouth actually moves when you speak in game. I can't say much about the Singleplayer for Arma 3 other than that it has one, it's not my thing but it may be yours on the other hand the Multiplayer is where the real meat of the game is at. The Community is still thriving even after the game has been out for just over a year. You'll be able to find a clan to play with if you wish to do so, or always be able to find well populated servers. There are quite a few things you can do in Arma 3 just to name off a few: King of the Hill, Wasteland, Battle Royale, and Co-op missions. It also has a mode called Zeus where a person plays as a 'Game Master' persay where they get an up top view on the battlefield and have the ability to be able to spawn vehicles, enemies or various other objects along with create objectives and missions on the fly for players on the ground in real time. It's very cool and fun to play around with once you learn the ropes. The game played solo can be quite fun, but to get the most out of this game you have to either make a few friends, or bring some of your own along for the ride. Communication, and teamwork are quite important to the game and will increase your chances of success. For the downsides of the game is that it has a decent learning curve on new players to the series like flying a helicopter or plane, and simply just learning the controls. The game is also decently demanding on PCs especially when servers get populated over 60 players you may experience some drops in the FPS. At the end of the day I'd recommend this game to anybody who loves military shooters and absolutely love having unique and amazing moments, or stories to tell. I give this game a 9/10 Boasting hours upon hours of content to be played either just the vanilla game or the large amount of community created content and scenarios. I just keep wanting to come back to this game just to experience one more of those amazing experiences that Arma 3 continues to give.

Take good ol' Delta Force 2 and Rainbow Six, let them have fun in the closet until they appear back in modern days, and you got ArmA3. It won't give you any mercy, you die a lot, but I'm 100% sure this game will teach you how to be better soldier also in real life. Never gonna miss those headshots again. Over and out.

review: ArmA III: Is a outstanding fps simulation, that has great graphics; fluent and realistic gameplay. Although it is 39.99 it is worth the money. The open world is amazing it includes;a underwater world enviroment; cool new vehiciles like the Hunter, bodacious air play with planes, ospreys and helicopters. Finally immersive infantry gameplay with awsome weapons. Thats why you should definatley get if, also i want someone to play ArmA III: with me.

I got arrested and went to jail for 1:10:00 minutes. The guy in the Helicopter tried to break me out of jail. I only then realized that u cant get in copilot if u dont have DLC. I am not a wanted fugitive and have 3 bounties of 10million on me. 100/10

review: So you're laying behind a rock listening to bullets crack by and looking out a few feet to your side at the body of your buddy wondering if he's just passed out or if he's been killed like the rest of your squad was. Suddenly all you can hear is the roar of the A-164 cannon as it screams overhead and the sky goes red with the fire from explosions. You peek out at the burning remains of the enemy forces and breathe a sigh of relief for the first time in the last hour. Those moments are why you play Arma.

review: Other than the fact that Bohemia has to yet add bipods and IED's, which I find quite lame and  because they are basic concepts to a sim shooter(I shouldn't have to put a trigger down for a proximity IED, should work just like a mine). Luckly their are mods and the game is very fun once you get used to using mods. Playing this game with a group is a must as the AI are not the greatest on pathfinding, but are fully capable of sniping you across the map. Arma has a great modding community and tries to cover for Bohemia's shortfalls and does a great job. In game mission editor is very similar to the Arma II mission editor, but the modules system helps it stand out. It gives you hints on how to use the modules and doesn't rely on you having to put in a bunch of scripts. However you still can use scripts for greater flexablity. I will personally be wasting more hours on this game.

review: A really fun game that is a great improvement compared to arma 2 when it comes to combat and animations as well as the variety of gamemodes. However, the game is a little "unfinished" or requires a little more refurbishment when it comes to general points such as audio and factions (combat audio such as firefight sounds including distancing of gunshot sounds is disapointing). However, overall, the game is a deffinate must buy and some improvements can be made with few simple mods easy to download.

review: Arma 3 is a really niche experience. It is refreshing to play an Arma game when the market is so saturated with MW type military shooters. To truly appreciate the realism and immersion of Arma 3 you have to find a good server to play on. I have not played a game in recent memory that provides the realism that this one does and the community is really the driving force behind that. The gameplay is solid, but the learning curve is somewhat larger than your average shooter. Combat is not in your face, but tends to be long range engagements that last a significant amount of time. The single player options are decent, and provide a good means for learning the game, but you should not buy this game if you are looking for a single player experience. My only other significant complaint is how poorly optimized this game is. It is a pretty game, very pretty actually, but it runs so poorly on even decent rigs that it can become quite frustrating. 7.5/10

review: Arma 3 is a very diverse game with many different games modes and mods. Some of the popular gamemodes are King of the Hill, Battleroyale, and Wasteland. There are also many co-operative mission you can do with people if you choose to do so. You can instlal different mods like guns, vehicles, missions and other things. Then theres Breaking Point a mod that involves zombies (be warned it is a very big download like 20+ GB) it can be hard to survive people and most people will try to kill you so be warned. Last note is there is going to be a Arma 3 Epoch Namalsk map coming.

review: This is not your typical shooter, it is more of a simulation game with firefights usually at football feild lengths away unlike the close quarter battles in CoD or MoH. This is not a Shooter with tightly scripted fights and cynimatic bravado, it is a sandbox game in the truest sense of the word especially with the games support of the mod community. If you have basic scripting knowledge or patience then the game opens new possibilities with the fantasic mission editor that alows you to set up single and multiplayer firefights in minutes. Lastly the multiplayer is fun though I find multiplayer is better at a smaller scale with friends on custom missions though if you can get into a warefare game it is a lot of fun playing a large scale realistic RTS/FPS.

review: Having played ArmA 2 for almost two years before ArmA 3 came out, I had high expectations for ArmA 3. Now, Before I get into specifics about the game, I have to say ArmA 3 is one of the best games you can get without having to buy any DLC to enjoy a full experience. ArmA 3 is an amazing first person shooter that involves a bit of strategy to win. Whether it means inserting into an enemy camp via SDV or hiking it across altis just to take an enemy helicopter for a spin, You have to come up with a plan to have a successful mission. Now, ArmA 3 isn't just about objectives and killing virtual entities. ArmA is about a massive multiplayer community made up of players, Mod Makers, Scripters, Cinematics Creators, and many more. If you think vanilla has an extremely large amount of content, Wait til you get a look at all of the mods and missions created by just the player base. Pros Extremely fun and adrenaline pumping gameplay Crazy amounts of mods available Extremely large and diverse player base Very well made models and objects High end graphics Not very many hackers Large amount of servers to choose from Lots of updates Cons Physics can sometimes be a bummer when attempting unusual missions or actions Can be hard to run for some people Can be a little hard to learn how to play Again, Physics Overall, I give ArmA 3 a 10/10. This game has exceeded my expectations. I can replay this game everyday for a week and still not want to put it down. If you are looking for a first person shooter that involves a crazy amount of strategy and content, This is the game for you.

Once my exams are over im going to get so many hours on this amazing game! :D This is the story for my first day in Altis life... I join a nice server which seemed to have nice people and they seemed to beonly rude to the cops. I am invited into a little group by this one guy to have some fun with.. 20 minutes later im in the back of a truck with a guy holding a gun to my face and im  my pants here.... So they take me into a hideout where they make me sing for them and then they kill me. As i wait for a medic im being t-bagged by like 10 people which is not cool. Once the medic came they killed him too and started t-bagging him. I then respawned a new man with a horrible past :( Great game overall :D 10/10

review: If you have to read a review of Arma 3 to decide whether or not to jump in, buy the game.... Seriously.. You've played shooters before I'm sure, and you've thought to yourself "I wish you could do _______" Enter Arma 3, where doing _________ is what you do.. Whatever you can imagine, you can do... If it doesn't come out of the box, someone has probably made it. Mods, team play, and strategy is what it's all about.. You're not usually playing AGAINST other players... Instead you play WITH other players, against some of the most realistic AI I have ever seen.. All Arma games to date have been amazing, but ARMA 3 takes a leap, simplifying the controls, while providing more and exciting options for the seasoned player.. It is truly the culmination of all we've wanted in a decade of ARMA... Buy it.. You'll love it.. There are too many features to list here, but let's just say, you'll get in, and you'll never get out...

review: This is a great game for anyone with experience with first person shooters. You might not want to buy this as your first FPS game becasue of the steep learning curve and the amount if controls. but after some time it becomes a lot of fun. i have had a lot of good experiences in this game that i dont think i could get from another FPS. It has many cool features that you just cant get from other games, like for example the ability to make use of any vehichle around you and use that as an advantage in the field. or maybe get a laser deignator off an enemy body and use that to mark targets for your friends. there is even gamemodes for roleplay. like altis life, and arma 3 life which can be fun if you like to roleplay with other people. I think the possibilities in this game are endless. you can make your own missions and submit them to the workshop for other people to download and rate, etc. I have had more than 500 hrs in this game and i think every one was a lot of fun. 10/10

review: ARMA... I play the series of ARMA / Operation Flashpoint (Cold War Assault) since ... I think more then 12 years now. Of course I had some breaks, played many many other games, but I keep coming back to it again and again. ARMA 3 is hmm, how can I say - an uncut diamond. At the moment there is a great base for the community, as there are many bugs annoying the community. We wanted it early, we got it early, so now we have to deal with the consequences - bugs, beta stadium campaign / scenarios. It already is a great tactical shooter just like the ancessors, I give both of my thumbs up - with one pointing at Bohemia Interactive (I adore you guys) for wanting them finish the game once.

review: Probably one of the best FPS, military simulator, with endless user add-on and mods I have ever played in my life. It's to the point this game is the only one I still play. It's far from Call of Duty and sort of reminds me of the old Battlefield games but better. I give it a 10/10 not for the game only but the the continuous community and their mods.

review: I can't complain, this game delivers on what I was exspecting. I have all other games in the Arma series aside from a small few of the Arma 2 expansions. I love the ballistics, you get a more realistic feel for how a real firearm operates. There is much more to take into account than your simple fps. The series is great and worth a try, the controls can be intimidating but they are managable if you invest some time in training and getting a feel for it. This is a simulator so things are gonna be alot tougher than your typical war game. The AI friendly AI could use some more fine tuning and tweaking, I have had to put a few bullets into a couple insubordinate AI team mates for laying fire on targets a 1000 meters away thus helping bring more aid and attention to the base we were originally assaulting. The game is not without its bugs, and it is also a heavy on your processor much like Arma 2 was but indeed it is definatly a step up in graphics. It could use a larger armory, but there is a great mod cummunity that works on things like that to help the process along. Can't wait to get my Saitek x55 Rhino pro H.O.T.A.S. to be able to enjoy the helicopters alot more.

review: My first game on A3 brought me the most horrific experience I've ever had in any game, ever. We're on our way to the objective, a small dump east of a town occupied by enemy forces. I'm leading a team of 4 men. We come to a crossroad and I sprint across, telling my men to hold back. I cross a few more times, trying to get a response from any snipers. Nothing. I run, my SAW gunner runs, my medic runs. But I kept my Marksman on the other side to make sure we'd make it across. Anybody seen Full Metal Jacket all the way through? Remember the sniper scene? The marksman takes a round in the leg as we're running and goes down. He then takes two more in the chest. The kid who was playing had some mad acting skills, he played it up to 11 here. He screams as he's being shot. Crawling, drenched in his own blood. "SARGE? YOU AIN'T LEAVING ME OUT HERE LIKE THIS, RIGHT? I-I WANNA GO WITH YOU GUYS! C'MON SARGE, H-HELP ME! C'MON! PLEASE DON'T LEAVE ME!" he died after that. I cried and he respawned. I would recommend getting :)

review: Arma 3 is a very diverse game with many different games modes and mods. Some of the popular gamemodes are King of the Hill, Battleroyale, and Wasteland. There are also many co-operative mission you can do with people if you choose to do so. You can instlal different mods like guns, vehicles, missions and other things. Then theres Breaking Point a mod that involves zombies (be warned it is a very big download like 20+ GB) it can be hard to survive people and most people will try to kill you so be warned. Last note is there is going to be a Arma 3 Epoch Namalsk map coming.

review: It's ARMA II with better graphics, don't get me wrong, that's not a bad thing. + Looks great, the graphics are excellent, sharp textures and nice lighting. + Real Virtuality 4, a better engine. + Mod support, this is what makes the ARMA - series unique. + An okay-ish singleplayer. + Multiplayer, Battle-Royale in particular :) - The futuristic setting doesn't feel futuristic at all, it feels boring. The RHS-mod fixes this, but still... - A little variation in the weapons, all NATO guns look and feel the same, a on of bullpups in the game aswell... - Multiplayer issues, the server's performance affects the player's performance, meaning if the server runs like crap and is filled with script, expect your framerate to tank, a lot. - Clunky animations. - Vehicles are like paper. Not much bad things to say about this game. The mods will keep this interesting for a long time. 9/10

review: There is nothing more to say about Arma III than WOW. Ive been an owner of every single installment in the franchise from the days of the original Operation Flashpoint. The leaps and bouds that the developers have made over the course of the years is astounding. Arma III is absolutely astonshing as an improvement from the rest of the series. Its far less buggy than its predecessor and is updated very regularyl. The multiplayer capabilities are awesome and you can lose many hours with your friends developing all kinds of scenarios. If you were a fan of any of the previous games this one will not dissapoint.

review: This game was a bit frustrated after Counter Strike, but after a few hours of playing, I realised, it is not so bad. It is a totally different, and I must learn how to play this game. After a while, I understand, the flow of the game, so now I like it much better. I recommend this game, for those, who like open area combats, and slow gameplay compare to Counter Stike. It is more like real world.

review: Don't mistake this game for an FPS, some people enter into this game expecting COD ...it's not. ARMA is a full battlefield simulator which it does well at. In ARMA you're not meant to feel invincible, if you don't take cover you'll die, if you don't communicate with your squad you'll die. It has an insane learning curve that will take most people a long time to get used to, but only makes it very satisfying once you finally figure out how to fly or use artillery or...anything. The complicated controls at first can seem annoying but once you're used to them you'll be grateful you can stick your head up just enough to see an enemy out of a window without exposing your whole body. The games mod-ability makes it possible to play an infinite array of game modes making it difficult to get truly boring. While there is a battlefield like mod called king of the hill the size of the maps alone makes the game vastly more complex and that's saying nothing of the array of vehicles that can completely alter the game from just one player knowing how to fly or range a sniper rifle. Unfortunately the ARMA engine is well known for how glitchy it can get, Most of this has been ironed out and the presence of hackers ruining servers has been greatly reduced since early access. At times clipping through a wall or falling through the floor of a building still happens but it's not so common that it ruins things. At the end of the day the game requires being patient and on your toes while communicating what you see with teammates. The different mods and game modes give the game infinite potential but the glitches can create issues sometimes. ARMA 3 is a military sim not "insert FPS here" don't get attached to scores and if you find yourself complaining over global that someone using a plane is "cheap" or a "noob" close the game and reevaluate who you want to be in life.

review: Game = Mods Great game! Constant hours played on 'Altis Life' and 'A3L'. The fact is this game is pretty boring without the mods added into it, most will agree with me! I think the highlight of what made Arma 3 a popular game was the Altis Life Mod which made a fun environment where communities could form and do RP within the game, that mod is recommened. However despite having nearly 150hours just on Altis Life, a new mod 'A3L' i has sparked up and taken over in opinion. The mod is a other RP mod like Altis Life however more shops, a new map [Lakeside] and is taken more serious but is more fun to be fair. From robbing banks to being in a high speed chase as a cop, you can do it all for yourself here. Arma 3 is the game for you to get into the modded games community for sure, you may even make your own community out of it [own a server]. Note this game also has improved graphics from arma 2 and really is smooth when playing [NO MORE DESYNC]. Ratings below: Arma 3 [No Mods]: 5/10 Arma 3 [Mods]: 10/10 Thanks

review: So far i have put hundreds of hours into Arma 3, I spent most of it on a game mode called Altis life which i am sure most of you have heard of, It is incredibly entertaining but that is not all that comes with Arma 3. I recommend the campaign for its interesting and fun story alongside some awesome gameplay you wont see outside of the campaign, there is also wasteland you can try as it offers constant pvp while aiming for interesting objectives, and i also recommend battle royale that you can download from Play with six. Over all this game is absolutely worth the money, I personally spent 20 on this game when it was on sale and I do recommend purchasing it for around that price, as 35 is a bit much and if you got to sites like  you will get it for a nice price, So yes please do yourself the favor of purchasing the game as it will bring so much more to your gaming experiences.

review: Arma 3 is perplexing, actually. On the surface, I find I tend to sit around and do a whole lot of nothing when playing. Standing around and driving from point A to point B is the norm. However, there is a certain quality that makes it terrifically addictive. I don't know what it is, but I enjoy the game thoroughly. There are plenty of exciting moments and when you're done with a match (that often takes hours to play) you're filled with a sense of accomplishment. I don't even need to mention the community around doing mods and such. It adds to the game immensely. 10/10 would play again.

review: So you're laying behind a rock listening to bullets crack by and looking out a few feet to your side at the body of your buddy wondering if he's just passed out or if he's been killed like the rest of your squad was. Suddenly all you can hear is the roar of the A-164 cannon as it screams overhead and the sky goes red with the fire from explosions. You peek out at the burning remains of the enemy forces and breathe a sigh of relief for the first time in the last hour. Those moments are why you play Arma.

review: This my first ever game review so, I'll try my best. Basically, what you get with ARMA is open-world warfare. The size of the maps and locations in ARMA bring it to life more than a simple Call Of Duty Map. The graphics are beautiful and show off the true extent of PC Gaming, Simple things such as the movement of smoke whilst flying through it with a helicopter or jet pay off big time. There is a huge extent of weapons and vehicles to choose from to explore the vast world. Multiplayer is fantastic with there being many "Altis-Life" servers out there such as EUGL or Darkside Gaming. These online servers give you the oppurtunity to make it big as a drug smuggler or serve Altis in the Police Forces and work your way to higher positons. My only let downs with the game is the driving/flying/boating physics and controls. It definately isn't the best game when it comes to vehicles with the steering feeling delayed and sloppy and the damage can be sometimes, ridiculous. There was a time where I drove a vehilce into a tree at around 10 km/h and it blew up. Then another where I crashed a heli out of the sky and everything was fine besides the rotors. So to sum up the game, if you are looking for an open-world warfare with a great multiplayer community you should definately give it a go, Even though I have never played this as a single-player game it still gets an Easy 8/10 from me.\\ -HDWizzard

review: So much game for the money. It's more than just another shooter game, there are loads of mods available which increase playability of this game hugely. From dayz style zombie survival mods to flappy birds style atv flying. Race around Altis in go-karts or try and complete the sky track in a 4x4. Get serious with a sniper mission, or get scared on a horror map trying to find the mothman. Have a second life, rob people, sell drugs and buy a house on Altis life or survive and build your own base on Overpoch. Team up with friends and take over a village from terrorists or become superman and take on an army yourself. Some of my favourite mods include Overpoch, Altis Life, Wasteland and Battle Royale. I highly recommend Arma3. You all should get it! Lots of hours worth of gaming here. Entirely worth full price, even better value if you get it in a sale.

review: I have a FX-8350 and an r9 270x OC. On singleplayer ultra I get around 40-70 fps, AVG 50 |render distance at 2500. Multiplayer gamemodes with Persistance High 15-30 fps |Render Distance 1000. Severs without persistance around 45fps VeryHigh-Ultra |Render Distance 1500. There are other MODS like breaking point and chenarus that are persistant, but I run 80 player servers at 40fps ultra. But this game BASE is mostly persistant servers with 60+ people. So I suggest a MUST BUY if you have a i5 or i7 CPU and a NVIDIA GPU. If you have a AMD rig, buy with caution. But further than specs, this game is really well crafted and is a magnificent game. There is nothing like it on the marketplace. At times it is a little un-realistic with weapon sway, and OP NPC's btu past that, PVP is awesome, the mods are awesome. 100% must buy for multiplayer.

review: If you have to read a review of Arma 3 to decide whether or not to jump in, buy the game.... Seriously.. You've played shooters before I'm sure, and you've thought to yourself "I wish you could do _______" Enter Arma 3, where doing _________ is what you do.. Whatever you can imagine, you can do... If it doesn't come out of the box, someone has probably made it. Mods, team play, and strategy is what it's all about.. You're not usually playing AGAINST other players... Instead you play WITH other players, against some of the most realistic AI I have ever seen.. All Arma games to date have been amazing, but ARMA 3 takes a leap, simplifying the controls, while providing more and exciting options for the seasoned player.. It is truly the culmination of all we've wanted in a decade of ARMA... Buy it.. You'll love it.. There are too many features to list here, but let's just say, you'll get in, and you'll never get out...

review: This is a great game for anyone with experience with first person shooters. You might not want to buy this as your first FPS game becasue of the steep learning curve and the amount if controls. but after some time it becomes a lot of fun. i have had a lot of good experiences in this game that i dont think i could get from another FPS. It has many cool features that you just cant get from other games, like for example the ability to make use of any vehichle around you and use that as an advantage in the field. or maybe get a laser deignator off an enemy body and use that to mark targets for your friends. there is even gamemodes for roleplay. like altis life, and arma 3 life which can be fun if you like to roleplay with other people. I think the possibilities in this game are endless. you can make your own missions and submit them to the workshop for other people to download and rate, etc. I have had more than 500 hrs in this game and i think every one was a lot of fun. 10/10

review: I never expected i would get into these kind of games, im really the last one who is playing millitary simulations but with some guys the kind of the hill mode is really fun. If you never tried the game you should try it BUT a big but the game is horribly optimized, it crashes often, low fps, laggy.

review: I've had tons of fun in this game already and I'm far from done. Singleplayer can sometimes be a hassle. I've come across a bunch of issues in missions forcing me to restart them, but I suppose that goes for every advanced simulator. If you're playing with friends you'll never get bored. Any sandbox gamemode will do. Wasteland, Altis Life, Invade & Annex and so on... This game does require an above average gaming computer.

review: There are so many mods and gamemodes for ArmA III that there is no way to "do it all." My favorites include Battle Royale (a Hunger Games PvP mod, sort of), Altis Life (Heavy RP) and Wasteland (pew pew!). It's hard to recommend any game for $60 because almost no game is worth that, but that's what I paid for this one and I have certainly gotten my money's worth in memories since.

review: Best War Simulator ever! Fans of ArmA 2, if you are fan of modern, not futuristic combat, you can still enjoy this game! With the arsenal of mods coming to it at the moment, it will soon go back from 2035 to 2014. Still, the Vanilla game is great too. The first 2 campaign episodes are great but the third one lacks of depth. I strongly recommend it to experienced ArmA fans. (Please kids, don't buy this and infect our gameplay! This game is made for mature war sim fans.)

It has a much better optimization than Arma 2, but is also more graphically intensive due to being a newer game. Modding community is very developed and mods are plentiful. Breaking point mod highly recomended for those who enjoy DayZ. All together an amazing game and a huge step-up from Arma 2.

review: Me and my friend were driving along in a truck. I asked my friend "Are there any tanks in ARMA 3?" He replies "Tanks in this game are like unicorns, you get them if you wish for them." A minute later we come across a tank parked at the side of the road. "Hmm did I just get my wish granted?" We get out and inspect the tank. It appears to be not occupied. We turn to leave and hear a sound. Suddenly we are both shot in the back. As I lay there, with my life slowly draining out of me, I see the tank blow up our truck and drive away. "Goddamm it why did I have to wish for my stupid unicorn!" Then I respawned. 10/10 would wish for unicorn again

review: I've only been playing for about 86 hours this last week. What I've learned.... Modded with Epoch on a PvP server - Got shot right out of spawn Went back Got shot again Went to different spawn Didn't get shot right away Heard constant "Mooing" sound after running about 500m from this spawn Looked for Cow Not a cow Armless Zombie (How dangerous can that be?) Shot it with starter pistol Pi**ed it off It ran at me Emptied Mag into it Didn't stop Blew up in my face Dead again 11/10 going back for more punishment I've died and had my heart stop and almost crapped my pants so many times. It's nerve wracking and buggy at times but NO WHERE NEAR the bugginess of Arma 2.

review: The only problem with arma 3 is... the lack of content. The arma 2 had such a great community and mods and even the game had more guns and armor at the start than arma 3. I just can't understand why devs did not put in stuff like bipods, advanced first aid, helicopter features, portable MG's, and on and on, that arma 2 had. So if you buy arma 3 you get a bit more "polished" arma, but with the lack of good multiplayer servers and simplicity in game experience. So if you are new to the arma 3 its fine you wont even know what im talking about and go ahead its a great game. But if you were a fan of arma 2 like me, you will just be dissapointed, about the multiplayer content and community pick. And Bohemia Interactive seems to like EA principles of marketing game. Its hilarious that they are trowing out DLC's that enable you so basic thing as a rope hook on a helicopter for 15$! Which it should have already be in the game?! So the final tought is still, a good game but the devs ed it up big time. 6.5/10 So wake up Bohemia and stop being so lazy and dull to the fan base. And if you have to rip people off with DLC's put at least a fair price of 5$ instead of 15$.

review: Like most of the reviews of this game on steam, this games first 30 hours will be the most painfull time spent trying to learn the basics. With that in mind, I highly recomend this game to those who played the first two games in the ARMA serise. While the learning curve for the game may take some new players days to learn, it is a game that can not truly be judged by how difficult it can be. When first getting into a game you will realize that the games controls can be extreamly difficult to learn, but upon playing for 30+ hours, you will learn all of the in and outs of the complex controls. Many would be quick to assume that this is just like any ordenary shooter were you run to one objective to the next shooting everything in your path, In ARMA 3 this is simpily not the case. Getting into your first only match you will realize that there will be some situations that may take you 10 minutes of sitting there and waiting for the enemy to make the first move. Needless to say this game is extreamy hardcore, and should be part of your library if you enjoy stratigic games that require communication with other people to win. What is good: Graphics Gameplay Online Gameplay Community What Sucks: Learning curve Server-Side lag Large system requirments My Score- 87/100 -A must buy for those who love stratigic 1st/3rd person shooters. - 170hrs of playtime at time of review.

Even with the settings turned down the animations are horrible and the guns are garbage - I cant even hit a window on the side of a building. Bohemia needs to take some pointers from other shooters, refine the animations, fix the guns so they actually can shoot someone, and fix the jerky animations and lag so that whopever you shoot at, is not ghosting and jerking around like someone having a seaizure.

review: First off, this game is amazing. It has something to suit everyone, even though it is a military simulator. This is because of a dedicated community of modders. So if you don't want to be a soldier, get on an Altis Life server and fish or something. If you want the fight a gladitorial battle to the death, try Battle Royale. If you're into zombies there Breaking Point or Overpoch. If you want a strict PvP mode that plays similaryly to BP or Overpoch, get Wasteland. There is so much that this game has to offer that I couldn't begin to list it all. This game like every other is not without flaws, however unlike many games, the dedicated community of modder also takes care of that with their own patches and fixes. Seems like Bohemia Interactive did everything right with Arma 3, and the opposite with DayZ Standalone.

review: I typically do not write reviews or recommendations on Alphas or Betas of most game titles but it is important to note that even in its Alpha stages, Arma3 is an awesome experience. We all know that A3 is not built on a new game engine and that it is really a polished enhanced A2OA game engine with popular community add-ons integrated into its core combined with a graphic overhaul... but you know what.... thats fine, even knowing all that, its a sweet first person experience. If you do not believe in paying for Alpha access, then buy the game at the now reduced rate and do not play the Alpha but wait for the full release, but buy it, its worth it.

Whether you prefer to role play, simulate actual battle scenarios or simply blow stuff up with advanced modern weaponry this game can cater for it all.

review: Just purchased Arma3 on the 50% of sale. I have to say I am a huge Arma2 fan, but I was blown sky high when I started playing Arma3. The reviews somehow just did not do it justice for a big Arma2 fan. I actually did not know if it was that much different form Arma2. I was so wrong. Arma3 is better in every way so far. Weapons, graphics, sound, player interaction, UI menus, etc. etc. I have only had it for one day now, and it is by far my best PC purchase in a long time. Also, I have bought into all of the survival games on EA to which even though I am happy to support the games i chose to support, none of them have become fun to play for me. I like DayZ Mod and let me tell you Breaking Point for Arma3 is the answer! You get a zombie game plus all those vehicles and weapons! The Epoch servers are also so much fun in Arma3, vehicles everywhere on some of them, planes, helis, tanks...etc. So much fun. Good Job Bohemia Interactive and Good Job to all the modders out there!

review: ArmA 3 does a good job at improving many aspects that were lacking in their previous versions. Most notably, in my opinion, is the ability to dive underwater without dying. Helicopter flight dynamics seem to have improved, although they are still not realistic. I would like to see vortex ring state (now implemented with Helo DLC, thanks!), limited power during hot/heavy/high altitude operations, and a wider ability to slingload realistic loads (partially implemented in Helo DLC, thanks BI!) into battle.

review: This game....Ooooh this game...Is amazing. It's a first/third person realistic tactical shooter. If you are a person who plays Call Of Duty and think you can run into a room witha sniper rifle and "G37 Th053 SW33T YY360QuIcKS20p3S 1adDerSTA1ls", then this game is really not for you. The campain is "meh" but the multiplayer is where the fun comes in, you have Altis life a sort of rpg gamemode, Patrol Ops (My favorite) where you look for enemy encampments or chemicals and deal with them, teamdeathmatch, and tons of others. If you have played previous ArmA games you will know that the controls are a bit...odd...Well, in ArmA 3 they are still kinda odd, but they are better. There is an entirely new mechanic in 3 called the "stance system." Basically, if you are standing you have four different poses that can help with almost each and every situation, same goes for the four crouching, and four prone. There is a decent range of weapons and atachments and no limit to clothing options. The one big, and noticable problem with Arma...is it's optimization...The game doesn't run well on some systems for seemingly no reason.

review: The Arma series is the best by far. in my opinion no game can top it for simulation or realism. Arma 3 could do better tho. (no offence)... ... ... as it says in the description "Experience true combat gameplay in a massive military sandbox...". I would love to have Arma 3 go a little bit more into detail with some aspect's of the game. But becides that it is amazing. I would recommend this game to anyone who like military game's. If ur a COD or Battlefeild (Which I am but not as much as Arma 3) fan watch out because Arma 3 is the next big thing. > Profile Name <, Game On!

review: Arma is not a game, in the same way that a word processor is not a document. Want to play Call-of-Duty-level stuff? It's got that. Want to play RPG stuff? It's got that. Want to play survival horror? It's got that. Want to play a flight simulator? It's got that. This software's so good it will convince you to strap things to your head for headtracking and that this is perfectly normal. However, you will probably find you get the most out of this if you play with a clan. From we-want-to-pretend-we're-in-the-army level of committment to the it's-saturday-and-we're-drunk-and-on-the-internet level of committment to the we-have-small-children-and-this-is-what-we-do-to-chill-out levels of normality, there are clans out there for anyone's taste and needs. And hell, if you're a misanthrope, the singleplayer fun is still pretty damn awesome.

review: Arma 3 is the deciscive military sim for the hardcore military gamer. With excellecnt graphics and fun gameplay for hardcore fans, the 3rd iteration of Arma is a huge step in the right direction. However, the game suffers from poor optimization and bad ai. However, with a decent enough pc, any gamer can play. The ai however, cannot be fixed by a simple computer. They sit and dont attack, zig and zag instead of dive for cover. Overall however, I would give it a solid 7.5/10.

The game is enriching and engaging, there is no shortage of mods and the game keeps getting better by cnostant developer updates and the community contributions. Everyone in their right mind who claims to be a PC Gamer should play this game. EDIT: The third campaign was a major disappointment, and with the modding contest looming things are starting to take a bad turn.

review: I don't believe that content-wise ArmA 3 lives up to its predecessors, however in terms of mechanics, graphics, interface, and controls, it is definitely worth it. If you want to know who I am, I am a guy who flipped off my Guidance Councillor and used his iPhone to buy the Supporter Edition of ArmA 3 THE MINUTE it became available, after he had shut off my computer station. I live ArmA, I love ArmA. Nothing on the market comes close. Mods and the comunity really bring this game to life and are its reason for being. I strongly recommend it for anyone looking for a hardcore, insane, serious, zany experience. You can literally do anything you can set your mind to. Happy Operating my friends.

review: To sum up Arma 3. Amazing workshop community, and creations. The Singleplayer scenarios are great and well put together. On the other multiplayer can be a little spotty at times, FPS could be much, much better. Your FPS is somewhat dependant on the server your playing on, which is kind of unfortunate. With that being said, It is an amazing game or milsim which ever one you like to call it. I would recommend it to anyone with a decent enough computer and a knack for hardcore military gameplay. -The Only God

review: Awesome game, fluid graphics, perfect for creating a battlefield set for a group. The only downsides are the small equipment, etc., but that's if you compare it to arma 2, which had 3 DLC's and an expansion; and also if you don't mind small bugs and glitches due to just classic arma physics :p. Any vet of arma(people who've played previous releases in the series) will say that there are bugs, but the gameplay exceeds the bugs :) Best part about it is that there's less 10 year olds than COD or BF >:D

review: This game is great but I expect more thoe, but anyways its a great game. I haven't tried the other mods yet and this game is still great. So this game has a lot of content. Also its sad that it the DLCs are a bit overpriced for the content it offers. Also one of the things I don't like about ArmA 3 is that they didn't use real names of weapons and vehicles. Even has fake guys like the MX Rifles. Considering this to be a Military Sim, I expect real weapons and vehicles.

review: ATTENTION! -------------------- If you are looking into to play with your friends across the globe, you'll need Hamachi, as many people are having non-dedicated server issues, but Hamachi works fine. I will begin the review here.. This game is amazing, it has everything from tactical gameplay with teams, custom user-created gamemodes like Altis Life, wich is an epic civilian, rebel and police based Rp experience, and Domination, the tactical player versus AI online gamemode, it is absolutley worth it if you have a group of friends, a mic, or just want to have some tactical gameplay! I have spent almost half a thousand hours on this piece of digital code! But that is because it is amazing! To put it in a smaller perspective, here are the pros and cons. PROS: Tactical, teambased. You need to THINK before you Run'n Gun. Or not Run'n Gun at all. Take cover, realistic bullet deflections etc. It's a new hell for COD and Run'n Gun players, welcome! Overall moderate to get used to, but for me it was easy. Mods. Mods. Modded Gamemodes. Mods. CONS: Erhm.. Let me think... -Somewhat laggy at times, but easely adjustable via the video settings. -Not as many weapons, units and vehicles as in Arma 2, but MODS. :D Now, hard to think... Hmmm.. -If some  Zeus (Gamemode btw) spawns a bullet hell and squad wipes you and your friends, you have to walk ALL the way back. +/- You need a beefy computer to get the ultimate experience, but I prefer High, as it does not lag and works fine on i7, 2.4 GHz, I am too lazy to check my full specs, SOWWY. And mods.

review: Genau SO stellt man sich eine echte Militrsimulation vor! Arma 3 spielt ein paar Jahre in der Zukunft, weshalb Umgebung, Waffen, Rstungsgegenstnde, Fahrzeuge usw. auch moderner sind, als man sie fr gewhnlich kennt. Das soll aber nicht heien, dass alles nur Sci- Fi ist und frei erfunden wurde. Alle Waffen und Fahrzeuge existieren bereits im realen Leben. Allerdings bisher nur als Prototyp :D Trotz der fortschrittlichen Technologie, bleibt das gewohnte Shooter- Gefhl am Leben, obwohl es ja im eigentlichen Sinne kein Shooter ist. Genau das ist einer der Faktoren an die sich ein typischer CoD Spieler (mich mit eingeschlossen :D) noch gewhnen muss, denn hier ist wirklich jeder Schritt, den man tut oder nicht tut entscheidend. Handelt man einfach mal unbesonnen und rennt einfach mal los, ohne dass der Team leader ein Wrtchen gesagt hat, liegt man schnell zerfetzt am Boden. Mein Fazit: Arma 3 ist einfach nur episch. Das Gameplay, die Atmosphre und natrlich auch die Grafik berzeugen. Einen Minuspunkt bekommt Arma 3 von mir aber trotzdem, weil in den Grafikeinstellungen zwar viel Platz nach oben fr richtige Gamerkisten gelassen wurde, aber durchschnittliche PC's leider bereits auf niedrigsten Grafikeintellungen mir einer Framerate von 20 herumschmieren.

review: While some may disagree, this game I find it a whole lot better, the physics of the bodys and the whole interface is quite realistic as to were in Arma 2 they all had the "all hail" death animation, and while being a little glitchy'. The game is super optimized, so if you run Arma 2 on medium or high, expect to run this on ultra with very similar preformance (disable some of the Anti-filtering). This I would give a 9/10 its a GREAT game and will be sure to waste some hours of my life in this game, all in all BUY...IT...Just look at the graphics and tell me this game dosent look SEXXAYYY!

review: The latest in the ArmA series, this is the best military simulator out there, and it sure does live up to the hype, with a fantastic graphic upgrade. Apart from just upgrading the graphics, it has created 2 new maps for you to go crazy on in this sandbox military simulator where quite literally, the sky is the limit. Engaging Close Quarters Combat, entertaining infantry combat with a load of other people and AI with vehicles to back you up, the amount of scenarios you and your friends can experience is endless, due to the thriving community that has come from ArmA 2 and Operation Arrowhead, to make these games even better. Whilst even without any mods, this game still lives up to the standard that is expected from Bohemia Interactive in this long running series of military simulator/sandboxes. They added new movement, new weapons, new vehicles. Whilst no classic weapons like the M4/M16/AR15 series don't make a return, along with the AK47/74/74su, they are replaced with new weapons that are more towards the future. The game itself is set in 2035, when the Republic of Altis and Stratis is facing a civil war, NATO comes in and attempts to help the AAF in the war against CSAT, they are turned on and the AAF teams up with CSAT to destroy NATO forces in this gripping fight between yourself and loads of tough AI. In this futuristic settings, along with new weapons, new toys have been added to your arsenal to mess about with. New vehicles include submarine type transport vehicles, amphibious armoured personnel carriers, and scuba-diving equipment. It all totals up to a crazy sandbox experience with a load of missions and scenarios from the community, from Altis Life to Wasteland.

review: This game is so amazing. It's made to be a fun, military simulator but its so much more. There are game modes for every kind of person, or all people. Let me name a few: RPG, Zeus, Big team, Wasteland, Epoch, and much much more. The community is great. There is nothing wrong at all to say about this game. Just go ahead and buy it. Okay, I have a cool story just to tell all of you guys. This isnt my only one, I have alot. Me and my friends are in a gang war with some enemies and have been searching for them throughtout the map or an entire hour. We eventually decide to do a drug deal with them because the drug traders arent safe. We go to the airport and I set up in a tower to watch over while my leader is outside the building and my frends are outside. All of the sudden our leader gets taken out and to guys go over to loot his body. In the meanwhile, they've got a heli flying over and guys infiltrating the building my friends are in. I immediatly take the two guys out from the tower and move to a different position. One of my friends was shot in the building and the other took the enemy out. We eventually clear out the building and the heli flew away. I hope this helped. You really need to gett this game its worth well over how much they price it at. I also wanted to tell everyone that this game isnt about the gameplay. It's about the experiences you have in the game. 11/10 Would reck a squeker again

review: Just purchased Arma3 on the 50% of sale. I have to say I am a huge Arma2 fan, but I was blown sky high when I started playing Arma3. The reviews somehow just did not do it justice for a big Arma2 fan. I actually did not know if it was that much different form Arma2. I was so wrong. Arma3 is better in every way so far. Weapons, graphics, sound, player interaction, UI menus, etc. etc. I have only had it for one day now, and it is by far my best PC purchase in a long time. Also, I have bought into all of the survival games on EA to which even though I am happy to support the games i chose to support, none of them have become fun to play for me. I like DayZ Mod and let me tell you Breaking Point for Arma3 is the answer! You get a zombie game plus all those vehicles and weapons! The Epoch servers are also so much fun in Arma3, vehicles everywhere on some of them, planes, helis, tanks...etc. So much fun. Good Job Bohemia Interactive and Good Job to all the modders out there!

review: ArmA 3 does a good job at improving many aspects that were lacking in their previous versions. Most notably, in my opinion, is the ability to dive underwater without dying. Helicopter flight dynamics seem to have improved, although they are still not realistic. I would like to see vortex ring state (now implemented with Helo DLC, thanks!), limited power during hot/heavy/high altitude operations, and a wider ability to slingload realistic loads (partially implemented in Helo DLC, thanks BI!) into battle.

review: The interface, allthough improved, can still be overwhelming. I don't know how many times I have reloaded my weapon when I wanted to open a door or how many times I have thrown a grenade when I wanted to look in my backpack. It doesn't help that Bohemia changes the default keys for every installation of ARMA. However, this can be changed to your preferences of course. Another factor to consider is that it is HEAVY on your computer. Make no mistake about this if you want to view all the bling-bling it has to offer. It seems that it's terribly hard for Bohemia to optimise their engines. This is true from the first Operation Flashpoint to DayZ SA. You need spend some TLC on the options to make it run smooth and even with a beast of computer, ARMA3 can bring it to it's knees without sweating. With all this said, I have played all the ARMA games in the hundreds of hours per installment. And except for Operation Flashpoint, which had an excellent campain mode, the single player is not the reason for why I come back. Quite frankly, they might as well have left it out. No, it's in the multiplayer mode (being Wasteland, Life ,Zombie Nation or just a regular all out war session) that it really shines. It defines sandbox fun. Rarely does a game cause so much emotions and I frequently end up sharing "warstories" with colleagues and friend. It has the feature of drawing you into the gameplay and no other game gives me sweaty palms like the Arma-series. So, if you are prepared to spend some time to learn the game, you will have a gem that litterally has a mod for anything you can think of. Kill zombies? Sure. Want some stealth play? Sure. Want to live your life as a drugbaron? Of course. Want some chaotic all out tank/air/land battles? Definitely. And if it doesn't have what you can dream up, you can always create your own content.

review: It is hard to review Arma 3 without using the word platform, because it is one. Arma is one of those game where you first see the horrid UI and you go: there's no way in hell I'm playing that. And then you try that thing and another one... and the magic happens. For instance, optics are actually useful in this game, and when you see the little 4 on the RCO (sort of ACOG scope), it's not just there to look good... it actually tells you where the bullet will hit 400m from you. And it's in the little details like that that you understand you're not gonna play any game, you're playing Arma. It would be all good like that, but it gets better. The community of players is amazing. Ever wanted to play a proper tactical game? Just plug your mic in and coordinate your attack with 2, 3 or 20 teammates (or even more!) you just randomly met on a server. (a coop server, otherwise prepare yourself to get killed pretty darn fast.) Oh, and forget about COD/BF fanboys... they're simply not there. And griefers and other trolls are probably jerking off on DayZ, so it's all good! That's about it, I think. I played 170+ hours and I still can't get enough. I found a miriad of like-minded gamers to play with, and I never cease to be amazed by their skills and willingness to cooperate to get things done. Get this game, get over the UI (might take a couple of hours at least) and find a good community... you'll forget about other FPS in a the blink of an eye.

The game is constantly evolving and constantlly being tweaked and fixed. The progression on the game from alpha to the latest version is by far some of the best work and dedication I have ever seen out of any dev teams, even that of some triple-A titles. If you're looking for a serious gamestyle there are many different realizm groups around to show you the ropes. If your more of a relaxed weekend warrior, the winners of the Make Arma Not War competion for multiplayer missions, Kink Of The Hill has what your blood thirsty hands are looking for. From survival to out right blowing  up this is what your looking for!

review: Alright, let's write an honest review of ArmA 3. IT'S . I HATE THIS ING GAME. WHY, YOU MAY ASK? BECAUSE THE GRAPHICS ARE TOO ING GOOD. I'M SICK OF MY  PC. IT'S SO , THAT I RUN THE GAME ON THE LOWEST RESOLUTION. I COULD SMEER  ON THE SCREEN AND IT WOULD LOOK BETTER THAN THIS ING ARMA-. TRUE MILITARY SIMULATOR? SINCE WHEN WOULD GETTING HIT BY A TONNE AND A HALF BUS BREAK YOUR ING LEGS? DO THAT IN REAL LIFE DEVS, SEE WHERE IT GETS YOU. ING SILLY . THE GUNS ARE , I'M PRETTY SURE FIREARMS DON'T BEHAVE LIKE THIS IN REAL LIFE. IF I WAS SPRINTING FOR FIVE MINUTES AND I AIMED DOWN AN IRON SIGHT, I'M PRETTY SURE IT WOULDN'T SWAY ACROSS YOUR ING SCREEN LIKE A DOG'S WAGGING ING TAIL. HELICOPTERS ARE . COULD THEY HAVE KEPT THE SAME CONTROLS FROM ARMA 2? NO THEY ING COULDN'T, BECAUSE BOHEMIA IS A LOAD OF  WHO LIKE TO OVERCOMPLICATE THINGS. I'M TIRED OF SHOOTERS. WHY DO THEY HAVE TO PRODUCE THIS  CONSISTENTLY? IF THEY JUST UPGRADED ARMA 2, WE'D ALL BE ING HAPPY. BUT NO. YOU HAVE TO MAKE A  SIMULATION OF A GAME. AND IN REAL LIFE, I'M PRETTY SURE YOUR ING VIEW WOULDN'T BE 800x400 SO FOR  SAKE, OPTIMIZE YOUR GAME FOR LOW-END PCS. YOU ONLY DEAL WITH ING 680s WITH THE ING WORLD'S BEST ING PROCESSOR. WHY?! I WANT TO DO MILSIM AND REALISM UNITS. BUT NO, ING LEWIS DOESN'T GET TO DO . BECAUSE YOUR REQUIREMENTS ARE ING AWFUL. SUCK A FAT  BOHEMIA. 0/10

review: If your looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if your looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place. Ingredients: 1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter 2. 1/2 cup white sugar 3. 1/2 cup brown sugar 4. 1/4 cup water 5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon 6. 1 pinch salt 7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced 8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie Directions: 1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). 2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside. 3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices. 4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal. 5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust. 6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.

review: This game is amazing, so far its the best game all around I have played. It has amazing graphics, lots of differant simulations, and endless replay value. The main campaign is not part of the game at launch, but is a free DLC in 3 differant installments. The fact you can play this game in first or third person, increases the amount of people this game can apeal to. The learning curve is a little rough, but after a few times running around doing missions or just playing around, its super easy to pick up. AGAIN graphics, A++ if you dont have this game yet, its worth the money, I got the game during alpha, I got one for my wife in Beta, and now the full games out, and it just blows alpha and beta away with how amazing the game turned out to be.

review: This Game is just bout the most amazing thing I've ever played, and the Zeus DLC adds on tens of thousands of hours of gameplay onto the already huge playability factor... Some glitches, lots are pretty funny to witness in a subtle way... And the Modding community is crazily active. I would buy this again if I had to, steep price, but it is entirely worth what you pay. This game coming from people who have had contracts with different governments to make accurate virtual battle enviroments for training. ---GET IT---

review: First impressions with the game. Download arma 3 check! Play singleplayer passed.. Go to multiplayer check! Find a sandbox server check! Spawn check! Buy a vehicle che.... "Wait a minute... What am i hearing outside of this building?" Went to the door and as soon as i opened it i saw a frigging tank standing in front of me WITH RAINBOW COLORS!! Didnt have time to close the door and i ran in the other side of the building. I was terrified. I heard that the tank was circling around the building and i had no where to go. finally i got out of the building and the thank started to chase me so i went back in. I bught uav and had no idea what to do with it. Well apparently i didnt do right thing with it cause i launched a missile while i was on the ground and blow up my uav, my friends uav and 50k helicoper. After a while my friend came in the same building and he bought uav also. we hopped to the controls of that thing and my friend drove the uav right next to that tank and i launched the missile. Went to see what happened and i saw this tank upside down on the ground. Driver comes out shoots me in the back of my head and then i respawned. 10/10 would play again !

review: Arma 3 is a shooter that breaks the Arcade FPS paradigm, the versatility of this game engine and features presented therin are absolutely unmatched. Worthy of the title "military simulator" completely. Fly aircraft, drive vehicles, logistics with team strategy, tact, and disciplin this is the closest to a real combat environment you can get without selling your self to the man. Other big title shooters out there have gone the way of the "run and gun shoot em up" arcade styles and require very little forethought. If you desire an experience that will rock your fiber, and boost your blood pressure all the while training your brain? Arma 3 is the game for you!! Much recommended for sensible, mature players.

review: Great game, I like the King of the Hill mode, they seem to be improving it really well. just a lot of buttons, and the steam workshop is a nice touch. Only downside is this games horriable engine. The engine its self is from 2001 and its been pushed beyond what it can really handle on the clients side. Once you start to add about 20 AI or players the engine starts to use the CPU or Video card less and less cuasing a performance drop. I seen maybe 30% CPU/GPU usage on a 106 player King of the hill match with 30 - 35fps hile on armory I can pull well into the 80's with a few players. Thats my only gripe about this game. If they would fix that then I would have no complaints at all.

review: DONT BUY IF YOU WANT TO GO MULTIPLAYER. UNLESS YOU HAVE AT LEAST A 3.5GHZ INTEL i5 The game itself is a very nice realistc game with many weapons and attachments, many vehicles, many unique features and 2 GIGANTIC maps (about 300km). BUT: -Multiplayer FPS still not optimized (was promised) -Collision-Detection still not improved (its obvious that something is wrong with a 3d game where you cant jump) -AMD Hardware optimization not even began.... (15-30 FPS in multiplayer...they couldnt care less bout AMD users) -AI is a not-so funny joke -Ground-vehicle behaiviour is far away from being realistic or enjoyable (they obvious tried both and failed) -Official Servers????? NOPE!!!!! -Matchmaking????? NOPE!!!!! -CoOp play singleplay campaign?????? NOPE!!!!!! This list would be endless. they should REALLY outsource the engine development, due NO PROGRAMMING SKILLS. DayZ SA is the same  but even crappier (10-15 FPS in Towns while arma 3 gets around 20-30 FPS on a 50 Player Server). They should have learned form ofp and arma1&2 that they are unable to programm a stable and performant game engine. So why dont spend some of the earned money to the development process (as promised in the EA phase) and buy a decent engine from someone, who is able to programm such an engine (UE4, Cryengine 3, Unity)???????????? they set the wrong priorities and ignore the simplest rule of programming: ______________________________ *****KEEP YOUR CODE CLEAN AND FAST***** ----------------------------------------------- they earned at least 200million$ with dayz(>10mil. copies sold) and about 30million$ with arma 3(>1mil. copie sold) what are they doing with the money? the development team is <100 persons its not personal costs. its not sound recording. its not the mocap sessions. its not engine optimization. its not even design or modelling. its their ING OWN POCKET, where the money goes. They are taking our money with hands WIDE OPEN (spend about 50 for arma 3 and about 23 for DayZ), promise to use it for the game and dont spend it in the development process as promised. Bohemia Interactive has great artists and designers + a good know of realistic weapon behaviour, but the dev-team leaders, and programmers are even stupid as hell or only want your money for no effort.... i really hope, that they are opening their eyes and start optimizing their company, or no one will ever buy another arma or dayz. i wouldnt. i made my experiences with Early Access and Bohemia Interactive, and must tell: THEY ARE LAZY AND MERCENARY. Update Cycles from DayZ are a bad joke. take a look at H1Z1. It was released over a year later, with a MUCH smaller budget, and has updates AT LEAST EVERY 2 Weeks...

review: Arma 3 is a ridiculously complicated military simulator which includes 7 buttons just to look around (that is if you're too special to use the mouse like everyone else). You can play through a bunch of single player scenarios which subject you to taking down the odd bad guy, while knowing that a single stray bullet could end your life. These scenarios are all pretty much the same, move on to the next town, take out the five random guys that are wandering around armed with assault rifles, then repeat. It's multiplayer that makes this game shine, a bunch of modded servers like the immensely popular 'Altis Life' mode in which you can play as a civilian or cop. As a civilian you'll buy your drivers license, set off to a life of adventure, get robbed, stripped naked and kneecapped before being abandonded in the desert. In your next life you'll probably head over to the cocaine field to try and make some easy drug money, right? Wrong. As you fill your pockets with unprocessed cocaine (which look suspiciously like rotten cabbages) you'll likely run into a group of like-minded rebels who will make it their business to brutally kill you and take all of your items which you worked so hard for. Then you respawn with nothing and do it all again. As a cop you'll try to stop this from happening, but you'll probably just taze the wrong guy, run him over, then try to pretend like you never did it. You'll brutally murder a bunch of people completely on accident, that is to say, you pull a guy over for speeding, he annoys you so much that you shoot him with your tazer. Then he has a bad reaction to the tazer and the next thing you know you're cleaning up a dead body. Honestly, do I need to say anymore?

review: No other game offers such a high quality go anywhere do anything experience like Arma3. In Arma3 you can fly and drive any vehicle you can think of - or scuba dive, sky dive or just take a long walk and admire the scenery - whatever floats your boat or more likely sinks it. Graphics are some of the best in the industry and the size of the sandbox makes almost all other games look silly. You can choose to play it in an ultra realistic mode or just for enjoyment in casual mode and even if military games/sims are not your thing you can play one of Arma3's RPG's online - like Altis Life or Wasteland etc. There are literally 1000's of community made addons / mods and missions for you to play in either in SP / MP or Coop mode - check out Armaholic and the Steam Workshop. And the powerful easy to use mission editor is the benchmark in the industry. No other game offers such amazing value for money !

review: Attention: I am NOT reviewing Arma 3 solo play. I am reviewing the online multiplayer in Altis Life and Asylum.. First of all, let me just say that a majority of the people I've come across in this game are complete s. They'll kill you, take your stuff, harrass you, etc; all while you have your back turned. HOWEVER.. the rest of the gameplay makes up for it. This is one of those games where you need friends. Don't have friends? Make some. It is so unbelieveably easy to make friends in this game and at that point you can actually have a promising team to get  done. You WILL NOT succeed on your own. Sorry, if you're a solo player, you're gunna need a team at some point. Altis Life is a game mode. It's fun, and there's no limit to what you can actually do. Be a cop - Check. Be a rebel - Check. Be a taxi driver - Check. Be a paramedic - Check. I love this game for the time I've played and I recommend it to anyone who's willing to die over and over, to eventually succeed.

Out of nowhere a helicopter loaded with enemies was flying directly towards me and i decided it would be a good idea to shoot at drawing attention to myself.

review: I would say that the best way to describe ArmA III would be to say that it sends you to war. Be it through having your helicopter shot down in the first five minutes of you being in the game, and ejecting just in time to avoid death, then crawling to an outpost on your broken legs, to defend it to your death, or be it in having your Humvee hit by an RPG and having your commanding officer's head shot off by a sniper. The game is what you make it, but I will say this. This is not a casual game by any means. If you are a fan of games like COD or BF you will not be happy with this game. The hyper realism makes it often incredibly challenging to survive, but I can say from experience that when you do succeed, you will be as excited as ever. I would reccomend most players to start out playing online, because that is where most of the fun is. The multiplayer modes and the variety of them make a nearly infinite replay value. The game's sandbox nature make it a blast to play with friends, though it does lose something when playing alone. I would reccomend playing with friends. I give it a 8/10.

For ultra settings you need at least i7 and 2 gfx cards. i play on standard to ulta setings with 40 - 80 fps. What definitly need a big update and fix is terrain builder and other tools for making maps and mission. for game i give 9/10 need more optimization for editor 5/10 need a lot more work and better setup, guide and documentation... too long learning curve, hard to make decent maps without help from youtube and lots of forums reading and searching.....

Heres some of the things I like: 1) The graphics are amazing. 2) The multiplayer is not buggy and it all works fluently and without bugs and glitches and it is impossible not to enjoy every second of being connected to a server. 3) All of the game mechanics work fluently and the animations never bug out. 4) The sounds are all good quality and you cant hear white noise in the background for the voice recording so all of that is good quality. 5) The parralax effects and occulent occlusion and bloom always look perfect and the effects all add up to high quality audio to make the perfect immersion. But most of all its fun! I run into a building kill two guys downstairs with my Katiba carbine and move upstairs at a slow pace and I find another guy so I shoot him in the head and I take his Lynx sniper rife and look out onto the streets below. I look about 40 meters down the street and see a guy getting out of a truck so I shoot him and then his friend comes into the same building as me so I hide on the balcony and camp the stairs getting ready to shoot him when I take a shot to my back because someone in an adjacent building had shot me with his handgun. At this point I turn round and the other guy comes up the stairs and gets the killing shot on me so when I die I see a viwe of my body from above and see the guy that killed me gets shot at with an RPG and the entire building falls down! 10/10 for graphics, 10/10 for realism, and 10/10 for a good community full of dedicated gamers who take the game seriously and you know that when you play this game you are playing in a generally friendly environment. (awesome)

review: Arma 3 is a great open world Simulation Military Shooter. It's not like your normal run and gun shooter. The game focus more on the realistic side where tactics and team work is key on being successful. Arma 3 give you a large variety and options, kind of like battlefield 4. Youre able to be just a random grunt or you can fly a helicopter (not as easy as other games) or drive a tank. Bohemia Interactive did a great job on the graphics of the game as well, it can be hard to find camouflaged players that are not moving unless you have thermal optics or what not. I recommend this game to more of the hardcore gamers who looks for a realistic game. I dont recommend it if your just trying to find a shooter to pop in and out like counter-strike.

review: I had about 2k hours of pure awesomeness so far DLC Policy: If you buy it you get the little extras like gear or vehicles. Don't like or need those? Never mind then, you can still play with others who use them and still take a seat as a passenger. In regards to content the masses of Mods will provide for all your needs anyway. All players also get new developments on top. The Helicopter-DLC for example also comes with new physics and whole new difficulty level and even really nicely working sling ropes. Without buying the Marksmen DLC that adds some scopes and guns, you also now have weapon resting, usable bipods, improved weapon sway and exhaustion. And more to come - continued developement for free! Even replacing mods. The audio improvements are convincing, but of course you can prefer mods and still use those. And there so many more mods which will add countless more vehicles and weapons, maps, visual effects, uniforms, medic and player interaction systems, whole new scenarios of battle robots or dinosaurs... ArmA has so much to offer for everyone, casuals to special forces, it is worth every cent. It does take some effort to look things up though. The basic game is big enough already to overwhelm newcomers. The bootcamp mission takes care of that though and explains easy to understand everything you'll be confronted with. When it comes to mods you'll probably already be part of a group by then to show you how those work.

review: Breathtaking graphics, fantastic gameplay, and a superior feeling to the controls since Arma II. The Mod community are already blowing up on this. For those who enjoyed Arma II this is a must buy. For those new to the Arma series, jump straight in on this, get mod'ing, get building scenario's and i guarrantee you'll never play CoD or Battlefield again.

review: Is ArmA 3 for everyone? No ArmA 3 is a military simulator with more emphasis on realism than action or fun. Those who enjoy the experience will find it incredible, but I would recommend doing some research beforehand to make sure the game is right for you. The Good: - Incredibly detailed open world-style maps - Wide range of weapons, vehicles, and equipment - Incredibly powerful editor and high mod compatibility with a large community always creating new content. - Top notch graphics that will strech even the most hardcore gaming PC The Bad: - Very high system requirements, don't expect to get a good frame rate without a decent system - Network issues can be an issue from time to time - Though much improved over ArmA 2, the character movement and vehicle handling can be clunky and a bit glitchy at times. Overall I would say ArmA 3 is a very good game that will continue to only get better over time as the community and the developers create more and more content. However, if you're on the fence about it, make sure you do some reasearch before jumping into this title.

review: I can highly reccomend this game if you are into any sort of simulators, or realistic combat. I have had extreme amounts of fun with all of the user created missions, with or without friends. I reccomend once you have purchased this game to follow these steps to have an early look at the Zeus free DLC as it can add a whole extra level of enjoyment with the mission ever changing due to your actions, in the state of mind of the Dungeons and Dragons Role Playing Board Game. This is ow you can have early access to the DLC: >Purchase and download ARMA 3 >Right Click "ARMA 3" in your steam library >Click "Properties" >Up the top, you will see a "Betas" Tab, click it >The click the dropdown arrow next to "Opt out of all betas" and change it so you are opted into the betas >Click ok and return to your library, you should see an update for ARMA 3, around 1GB >If not, launch hte game, the update should now start >Once the update has finished, launch ARMA 3 >From the main menu play multiplayer >From the server browser, find any server that is marked with a [DEV] tag, this will be running the Zeus DLC >Play around on a couple servers, find which one takes your fancy >Enjoy! That should be all I need to say, oh, have i told you to buy this game yet? Jus jus just.... do it. Take a leap of faith.

review: Fun times to be had. Ignore all the issues and play the game. When you get down to it killing hapless peasants at range with a 50 cal and thermal optics is just as fun as gunning them down from across the street with a LMG. This game is at its best when you are on your own behind enemy lines with nothing but Abdul the condenscending Persian and your T-100. You can fire from behind a house or in a hull down position at the backs of unsuspecting armor, infantry, or the occasional aircraft. Fall back and repeat while the smoke fills the sky and peasants burn to their horrid deaths. In the end the game has some flaws but thats to be expected in a game this size, regardles of that; I love this game. 9/10 Would use as trophy wife.

review: It must be said again and again: The ArmA series is NOT compareable to any cinematic driven, action packed shooters! And if you don't like teambased multiplayer, you won't get too much fun out of it, since the singleplayer campaign seems to be more like an extra. This said, the third Armed Assault gives you everything you need for the most realistic and intense battle experience possible! You might complain about the near future setting, which made it even harder for me to leave my beloved Chernarus (ArmA 2) behind, but you won't stumble over pulse rifles et cetera. Furthermore you'll get a huge sandbox world, an editor to do in it whatever you want and a fine community that never sleeps! So, what else should I recommend right now? Buy it! Don't wait for more content and lower pricing, the war has already begun! Edit: Best Game ever! =)

Community support is excellent, with mods and scenarios created by the day, keeping the game fresh for a long time. A must buy if you are looking for a more "serious" shooter than your average Counter-Strike.

review: The greatest accomplishment a game can have is to leave lasting memory with the player. I find that this is especially true for memories that you can share. ARMA 3 can provide these in abundance. It is easily one of the best sandbox games I have ever played. Ill never forget escaping from a temporary prison with a handful of friends, spending hours slowly and stealthily making our way to a heavily guarded communication tower, taking out an entire platoon in a surprise attack, and finally making contact with friendly forces for extraction, only to be told to rendezvous on the opposite side of the island. Of course, the enjoyment of these games is also dependent on the people that you play it with, so be sure to pester all your good friends so that they can play this with you. For as graphics and physics heavy as this game is, it handles surprisingly well. Gameplay wise, you will have to relearn everything youve been taught for FPSs. If youre not extremely careful and working as a team, youre going to die swiftly and painfully. The number of player made missions is amazing. This game has a bit of a learning curve, but not nearly as much as the previous titles in the series. Please, if you want to have some fun with friends, get this game.

review: ARMA 3 is a solid military simulator that really gets its legs from the modding community. Many ppl are familar with the ARMA series for one reason alone and that is the DayZ mod, it's even a well known fact that the game ARMA 2 sold more copies shortly after DayZ was released than it had since it's initial release. Not having played much single player besides a few short training sessions this review is going to be mostly focused on the multiplayer mods, gameplay and engine in general. First of all I want to say that this game may not be for those with underpowered PCs ESPECIALLY IF YOU ARE PLAYING MULTIPLAYER. While the engine performance is dramaticly improved over ARMA 2 unfortunently it seems that in multiplayer performance will suffer especially with high player counts due to a combination of server performance (running an ARMA server is very resource heavy especially cpu) and netcode shortcommings. The graphics have been improved over its predecessor as well as performance allowing for even greater view distances than I was able to pull off in ARMA 2 while still having playable framerates. Lighting in my opinion seems to have been improved the most leading to many atmospheric moments when I would find myself taking a screenshot. Models have all been improved quite a bit with the character models receiving the greatest leap in graphic fidelity, I can almost feel the stubble on the manly mans face sitting next to me in the attack chopper its the future I tell you. As you would expect in a military simulator there is a huge variety of boom sticks and vehicles to play with and not having a knowledge of military equipment or really a lot of experience with ARMA 2 I won't go into what guns/vehicles are new or what is more or less realistic. The gun and vehicle models however have seen a fantastic improvement in overall texture detail and resolution and the animations in general are a giant improvement over previous ARMA games with many of them appearing to be motion capped for that sexy smoothness. Gameplay has shown improvement in equal lengths with my favorite additions being the character stance positions, revamped inventory system, and much more natural feeling to movement in general. This is partly due to the fact that animations in general have been improved but also because mouse acceleration and smoothing seem to have been fixed. Combat feels solid and realistic the effects and sounds of warfare do well to set the mood and convince you that you are really blowing the  out of someone or really in the . The positional audio is fantastic and you can tell the approximate distance of gunshots based on their volume, and trust me the sound of a gunshot travels a long long ways. I also want to mention your characters sound effects, visual effects, and ambient animations, I love these and they really pull me into the experience. I have been walking for nearly 30min and I have finally made it to the cocaine fields but someone saw me comming. Oblivious I stand collecting the leaves when I hear something and my heart sinks, the rustling of feet and whispers in the bushes. I panic and turn the way I came bursting into a full sprint as I hear sirens begin to blare out and helicopter blades begin to spin. I'm sprinting at full speed now and the edges of my vision blur as I run blindly into the darkness. I'm breathing more heavily now and my vision is more tunneled than before, the color seems to have melted away slightly and I can't focus my eyes. Still running I'm breathing so heavy now that I gasp for air at times nearly choking on the air i'm attempting to breathe. The sirens are now far off in the distance and the whirling blades of the helicopter have nearly left ear shot, I gasp for more air as I slowly regain a normal rate of breathing. I wipe my brow to remove the sweat and my vision finally clears, I can see the boat I rode in on still there waiting for me I feel much better now. It's these little details that make an experience like that feel personal and real, this was an experience I had playing the mod "Altis Life". Everything in the right situation really comes together to bring you into the game experience and this is somthing ARMA 3 has pulled off well. Now the mods are where I think ARMA really shines as they provide infinite replayability assuming the community continues to develop for the platform. So far I have to say I am very impressed with the creativity of the mods and the scope of the mods in general. Want to recreate a historical engagement, maybe survive the zombie apocalypse, or perhaps selling fish and smoking weed is more your gig? You can do it all with the vast array of mods already available, but I want to talk quickly about my new favorite mod Altis Life. Altis life is a roleplaying mod were you must choose whether you are a civillian or a cop and you must live out you life however you choose. Civs must make a living whether legal or illegal it's you choice and your options are vast for how you do so. The cops must keep the civs in line and enforce the laws, if you are running around smoking weed and yelling F*ck the police you are probably gonna get pulled over, beaten, and arrested. Play it cool and do the speed limit maybe you will get away with that trunk full of heroin and get rich quick. Or maybe you just want to pick peaches, smoke your weed, and claim its for medical purposes when the cops pull you over its your choice and it is really great fun. There is so much more to say about this game and the potential it has with the fantastic modding community but I've written too much here already and i'm tired so i'm going to bed. On second thought maybe ill just do one more run to the poppy fields.

review: Now, this is a story all about how My life got flipped-turned upside down And I'd like to take a minute Just sit right there I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel Air In west Philadelphia born and raised On the playground was where I spent most of my days Chillin' out maxin' relaxin' all cool And all shootin some b-ball outside of the school When a couple of guys who were up to no good Started making trouble in my neighborhood I got in one little fight and my mom got scared She said 'You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel Air' I begged and pleaded with her day after day But she packed my suit case and sent me on my way She gave me a kiss and then she gave me my ticket. I put my Walkman on and said, 'I might as well kick it'. First class, yo this is bad Drinking orange juice out of a champagne glass. Is this what the people of Bel-Air living like? Hmmmmm this might be alright. But wait I hear they're prissy, bourgeois, all that Is this the type of place that they just send this cool cat? I don't think so I'll see when I get there I hope they're prepared for the prince of Bel-Air Well, the plane landed and when I came out There was a dude who looked like a cop standing there with my name out I ain't trying to get arrested yet I just got here I sprang with the quickness like lightning, disappeared I whistled for a cab and when it came near The license plate said fresh and it had dice in the mirror If anything I could say that this cab was rare But I thought 'Nah, forget it' - 'Yo, homes to Bel Air' I pulled up to the house about 7 or 8 And I yelled to the cabbie 'Yo homes smell ya later' I looked at my kingdom I was finally there To sit on my throne as the Prince of Bel Air

review: My Quick review. Arma 3 is probably the most user friendly entry into the series. Not to the mention the best looking, and in my opinion the most fun to play. Now, thats not to say doesn't have issues. CURRENTLY, not as much content as the previous entries, but that said, BIS is working on more and its soon to come. Obviously the modder community is working feverishly away. Steam workshop support for missions is great, and as soon as they add support for full Mods, everything will be even better. The game plays as one would expect. Its a tactical simulator, so that means the average expericance wont be a firefight every few seconds. Tehre is waiting, there is walking, but if you're of the right mindset, it all adds to the experience and build up. Knowing only a few shots can kill you make it quite tense. Key points- -The new stance system is great, a variable height and lean, means you can make the most out of any cover you find yourself in! - The maps are huge and varied, with the scenario editor you can quickly whip up any type of engagement you want. - The game is better multiplayer, if your more of a Solo player, I wouldn't say you'll have no fun, but I think it'd be more limited. - So many mods on the horizon, all will add up to be the experience you want, tailored to you. So, all that said, I love this game. Devs are continuining support with regular updates and additions. Join a multiplayer community and prepare to have a blast!

review: I'm not a massive FPS gamer, but then, I don't really count this game as a FPS. It's not like Battlefied, CoD or any of those types of titles. This is a combat simulator, and I have been immidiately impressed with the single player campaign (which I normally don't play!). The game doesn't feel as responsive as some newer titles (BF4), but it's realism to me, seems excellent. I don't know of course, I've never been in a war, and hope I never have too - but playing this game makes me feel about as close as I'd want to get. I only started playing this game really after playing DayZ Standalone, and will definately be continuing the explore it further.

Tehre is waiting, there is walking, but if you're of the right mindset, it all adds to the experience and build up. Knowing only a few shots can kill you make it quite tense. Key points- -The new stance system is great, a variable height and lean, means you can make the most out of any cover you find yourself in! - The maps are huge and varied, with the scenario editor you can quickly whip up any type of engagement you want. - The game is better multiplayer, if your more of a Solo player, I wouldn't say you'll have no fun, but I think it'd be more limited. - So many mods on the horizon, all will add up to be the experience you want, tailored to you. So, all that said, I love this game. Devs are continuining support with regular updates and additions. Join a multiplayer community and prepare to have a blast!

review: I can highly reccomend this game if you are into any sort of simulators, or realistic combat. I have had extreme amounts of fun with all of the user created missions, with or without friends. I reccomend once you have purchased this game to follow these steps to have an early look at the Zeus free DLC as it can add a whole extra level of enjoyment with the mission ever changing due to your actions, in the state of mind of the Dungeons and Dragons Role Playing Board Game. This is ow you can have early access to the DLC: >Purchase and download ARMA 3 >Right Click "ARMA 3" in your steam library >Click "Properties" >Up the top, you will see a "Betas" Tab, click it >The click the dropdown arrow next to "Opt out of all betas" and change it so you are opted into the betas >Click ok and return to your library, you should see an update for ARMA 3, around 1GB >If not, launch hte game, the update should now start >Once the update has finished, launch ARMA 3 >From the main menu play multiplayer >From the server browser, find any server that is marked with a [DEV] tag, this will be running the Zeus DLC >Play around on a couple servers, find which one takes your fancy >Enjoy! That should be all I need to say, oh, have i told you to buy this game yet? Jus jus just.... do it. Take a leap of faith.

review: Updated review: I have been exploring more features of Arma 3 and I love it! I have been playing a bit of the standard Arma 3 features which are fun, but the sheer number of mods and workshop missions is unreal! This game is so flexible. My most favourite mods and missions I have been playing are: Altis life: think along the lines of GTA, but everyone ever where is a real player, the police, military, bandits, civilians, criminals, everyone. It is a very immersive mission where you do what you want, whenever you want. Earn money through doing legal jobs, or become a criminal and traffic drugs, rob banks, rob other players, do whatever you want to survive, but beware your actions could get you on the police wanted list. Buy food, weapons, vehicles, licenses and so much more, it is a great experience when your on an active server. Escape Altis: an online coop game which can also be played single player, your goal to escape the huge island of altis. You will encounter AI enemy`s in all kinds of locations, choose how you get through, stealthy? Or guns blazing? Do it your way! This mission is very challenging and lots of fun, best with mates! Breaking Point: Think Dayz but on a bigger map, less glitches and now a choice of 5 factions to choose from. Each with their own perks, rules (or none depending which you choose), and appearance. Breaking point provides 5 maps, Altis, Stratis, Thirsk summer and Thirsk winter. The thirsk maps are PvP orientated with survival thrown in for good measure. Stratis is bigger than than Thirsk maps with a bigger focus on survival against zombies and other players. Altis is just huge! While breaking point is still in its infancy, the dev team is working really hard at it and adding new features and maps frequently. Vehicles in this mod are fairly rare, so expect work to be done finding them, you will also have to fix them up to get them working to. I love the Arma 3 engine, it is so flexible and allows for so many different ways to play, it just never gets dull. I highly recommend it!

review: This is one of the most interesting and expansive games out there. The current storyline and background is a bit unrealistic-The Republic of Altis and Stratis has a super-advanced military but the nation has under 50,000 people in its population. The population also is Greek, but for whatever reason all speaks english-even the armed forces. Nonetheless, the mission editing is superb compared to Arma 2, the mechanics are mostly improved (animation and AI needing a bit of a change for realism) the voice acting for British and American English as well as Farsi is superb. Iran has a huge presence in the game, however it is never mentioned and instead goes under the quite unrealistic banner of Canton-Protocol Strategic Alliance Treaty, or CSAT. I really wish that BIS would at least include the Iran flag above the CSAT insignia on the uniforms, for it looked absolutely amazing when this was the case at E3 2011. Physics in the game are great, however the fabled ragdoll physics are a bit dissapointing. All they seem to do is make units die in a more unrealistic-looking way. NATO is portrayed as completely bankrupt which really bothers me-unemployment is at freaking 50% in the US. It is interesting to see future interpretations of the US Army, which use the new multicam pattern in their uniforms. I am bothered by the lack of ANY, yes ANY authentic equipment in the game. This is perhaps my biggest problem, for it gives the developers an excuse to make fantasy content for every upcoming Arma game. Yes, it saves on lisencing, but the developers just launched a 650-thousand dollar modding contest. A fraction of the money could have been spent on making the weapons and vehicles authentic. With a host of friends to play with, some mods, and an open mind, this title is one of the most awesome games I have ever played. The simulation of the vehicles is amazing, with support for almost every joystick, controller, or other external device you can think of. The game fails to provide an immersive atmosphere but is a fun and engaging way to play COOP with friends, strategy being completely necessary. The graphics are in my top 10 games ever, and the performance is better than with Arma 2, especially if you plan on making Youtube videos like I do. (check out my Youtube channel: FistoGames :D ) Go and buy it. With some DLC's that bring it back to where Arma 2 was in scenario, it will definitely be an amazing game.

It runs everywhere but of course the graphics aren't as good as on a gaming pc. The game fearures (the in my opinion) biggest and greatest community ever. There are hundrets of great addons, and they are all free! In conclusion: This game has everything for everyone. Deticated Server for LAN-Parties, very variable difficulty, great graphics, a giant open world, a free in-game editor and much more. Simply a must-have!

review: (Note: This review is based mostly upon the playing of 'King Of The Hill' type gamemodes within the Arma 3 game.) So, Arma 3 ... where to start? Well, this game isn't an arcade shooter. I'm sure plenty of other reviewers have already covered the distinction between 'BF4/CoD/Arma 3' and so I won't touch that subject other than to point you toward other reviewers. This isn't an arcade shooter. This is a military simulator. There is a bit of a difference. You can't jump in this game. You can vault. Seriously, ever tried to jump with a full combat harness and loads of gear on? And carrying a weapon? What you will get from this game: Intense, team-oriented gameplay that strives to put emphasis on realism and the communication factor of warfare. The real feeling of value for mechanized units in war, and the pride and punishment of victory or defeat. A sense of patience when engaging in a battle, such that you will never really get from another first person combat game, because sometimes you just have to out-think your enemy rather than out-gun them in Arma 3. Intense firefights and vehicular combat. Most of all, a sense of enjoyment and fun. What you will NOT get from this game: Jumping. Infinite sprinting and dead-aim accuracy. Single-seat tanks/armor/mechanized infantry vehicles that let you blaze through a town driving and gunning at the same time. (It takes a crew to utilize a vehicle properly in Arma 3) Over-the-top cinematic-style wholescale destruction. Quick rounds/matches that are over in 10 minutes. Easy-To-Fly Jets/Helicopters. Should you try this game? Maybe. That depends on if you want a game that gives you instantaneous, short-lived action. If you want that, you probably shouldn't play this game. If you want a game that immerses you for hours on end and makes you forget about that pot of chili you left on the stove a few hours ago and is now ruined, leaving you to order takeout because YOU'VE GOT TO GET ACROSS THAT STREET AND GIVE MEIDCAL AID/REPAIR THAT VEHICLE before the enemy launches another RPG at your squadmates, then yes. Get this game. You'll probably love it. Now get back into the fight.

review: Is ArmA 3 for everyone? No ArmA 3 is a military simulator with more emphasis on realism than action or fun. Those who enjoy the experience will find it incredible, but I would recommend doing some research beforehand to make sure the game is right for you. The Good: - Incredibly detailed open world-style maps - Wide range of weapons, vehicles, and equipment - Incredibly powerful editor and high mod compatibility with a large community always creating new content. - Top notch graphics that will strech even the most hardcore gaming PC The Bad: - Very high system requirements, don't expect to get a good frame rate without a decent system - Network issues can be an issue from time to time - Though much improved over ArmA 2, the character movement and vehicle handling can be clunky and a bit glitchy at times. Overall I would say ArmA 3 is a very good game that will continue to only get better over time as the community and the developers create more and more content. However, if you're on the fence about it, make sure you do some reasearch before jumping into this title.

review: Definitely the best tactical shooter and shooter in general in the last decade. It is very immersive in that you have so many different controls at your disposal which is a little tedious at first but once you learn them you will be wishing every shooter had them. It's very realistic in that you can only survice about 2-3 shots from a rifle. You can zero your scopes to get perfect shots from a distance. 1st and 3rd person views allow for very tactical gameplay. You can pilot jets and helicopters, drive tanks and transport vehilces, or dominate on foot. The maps are massive allowing for very intense wide scale (or small) fire fights. The mods alone make this game worth getting. So many different game modes available to play thanks to the modding community for this game. Absolutely worth every penny. If you like slower paced, tactical shooters this is your game! Lone wolf or team up, both excel in this game.
game-hours: 380.1
review: Arma 3 is a great military simulator, you won't get the fast paced shooter feel that you get with BF4 or CoD but instead get a slower paced but more rewarding (IMO) experience. The non-combat roles such as logistics and support add an entirely different angle to what you get in other shooters. However it is a game you need to either play with a large group of like minded people or find something on the workshop that you like. I found the campaign had a decent storyline but wasn't particularily fun to play. However, some of the games i've had online have been simply amazing and to me that's what you should buy the game for. Pros- Highly Realistic Amazing Visuals Friendly Community Excellent Mods Available Cons- Not a great singleplayer game Some missions take a while to get to any reasonable gameplay 7/10

review: Bohemia Interactive's Arma 3 is the lastest iteration of a long-running series of realistic military sandbox titles, where the common themes have consistently centred upon player freedom, flexibility of action and movement, an expansive open world setting, an impressive degree of virtual realism and a passionate player community. Set in the near future, Arma 3 presents the player with the sprawling, high-fidelity terrain of Altis, a war-torn Mediterranean island in the Agean Sea caught up in the building tensions between NATO and the growing influence of an eastern military alliance known as CSAT. This simmering geopolitical state of play serves as the core backdrop to the title's 3-part singleplayer campaign and persists as the central theme and justification of the game's simulated conflict. The island of Altis itself is an immense, detailed and truly immersive canvas upon which the player is free to realise practically any military scenario of their imagining; where the journey from point A to point B can easily encompass many kilometres and where topography and geographic features can collude to radically alter player tactics. Based loosely upon the real island of Lemnos, Altis is able to achieve a uniquely natural feel to its coasts, rolling hills and forests and stands as a great testament to the skill and dedication of Bohemia interactive's map designers. Even while pinned under withering enemy fire, one cannot help but be struck by its beauty and authenticity. Arma 3 also offers up a plethora of near-future military hardware; from various firearms, transports, logistical supports, infantry fighting vehicles, main battle tanks, helicopters as well as fighter jets and boats. The assets are generally very well modelled with distinct individual characteristics which make driving a quadbike a very different experience from that of a lumbering metal behemoth. While the helicopter flight dynamics are driven by Bohemia's optional, challenging but immensely rewarding advanced flight model, fixed-wing aircraft in Arma 3 remain the begrudging recipients of a comparatively rudimentary flight model that is perhaps a reflection of the series' traditional focus on ground-centric gameplay. Given the near future setting, it is pertinent to note that much of the title's military assets are modelled upon real-life prototype weaponry, as well as a few present day variations met with a degree of developer artistic licence and fabricated designations. This notable departure from the well-established and popular modern day armaments that featured so prominently within previous titles in the series is undoubtedly a bold move by Bohemia, and one that still remains a divisive point of discussion within the player community. The sounds of Arma 3, traditionally a less impressive facet of previous titles in the series, has undergone a marked improvement in this latest offering, though perhaps still arguably falling short of the hopes of many within the playerbase. To their credit however, Bohemia Interactive have expressed a renewed and sustained commitment to engaging in continual improvement within this area into the future. Despite this assurance, many within the community continue to rely upon the impressive work of their fellow players to provide alternative soundscapes that better cater to their pursuit of aural immersion. Arma 3 also comes bundled with an incredibly powerful mission editing suite which places the player in complete control of the entirety of the game's imposing asset list. It is in this mode, perhaps more so than any other where the title truly shines as a sandbox experience. With a little practice and experimentation, the player is able to construct fully realised military scenarios of varying complexity, for themselves, their friends or the community at large with objectives limited only by the bounds of the author's imagination. This uninhibited freedom, a cornerstone of the series, remains wonderfully present within Arma 3's core offering. It would be almost criminally irresponsible to discuss Bohemia's flagship franchise without a brief mention of Arma's imperious modding community and the staggering host of improvements, fixes, overhauls and tweaks that this vibrant collection of talented indivduals provides. Whether one seeks to reintroduce real-life armies and modern-day weapon sets to their virtual arsenal, to aquaint oneself with a fresh new terrain upon which to wage war, or to apply a simple yet powerful overhaul to realism, the impressive array of user-made mods make this possible. Player created content has persisted as an important keystone of the series' appeal and longevity since its debut and continues to form an integral part of Arma 3's broader experience. Players new to the series may find themselves understandably intimidated by the sheer bredth and depth of the content on offer, not to mention some of the more unforgiving aspects of the simulation. Thankfully Boehemia Interactive have introduced a host of means to facilitate the familiarisation process in the form of an in-game field manual and hint system, an introductory campaign, a Tron-esque virtual reality terrain and even providing the means for more experienced players to act as 'drill instructors' to teach newer players the ropes online. While a handful of frustrating AI, user interface, animation and optimisation/stability querks persist, Bohemia Interactive have created what is easily the most accessible title in the franchise to date. As a reflection of Arma 3's flexibility, this is a title that has come to mean many different things to its expansive playerbase and one that can be played in a huge variety of different modes and playstyles. As a result Arma 3, perhaps more so than any previous iteration in the series, has seemed to grapple increasingly with the fallout of its own versatility. Attempting to establish a consensus on exactly how the game 'should be played' has become an increasingly tenuous prospect and one that is arguably unnecessary. In the creation of Arma 3, Bohemia Interactive has taken upon the unenviable task of treading the fine middle-ground that exists between sustaining the high degree of realism that the series is famous for, while attempting to preserve fun and engaging gameplay for newcomers or those unacclimatised to a realistic simulation experience. 'Realism' itself, has proven to be an immensely subjective term within a virtual setting, and one that invariably means vastly different things to different players. The finer points of the title's realism with respect to certain game features remains a continual point of contention within the player community and one that appears unlikely to abate any time soon. Arma 3's greatest triumphs then are to be found in its versatility and impressive open-world gameplay. Players are offered near total freedom, a staggering choice of armament, and a mandate to pursue their objectives however they see fit employing tactics entirely of their own design. This is a hugely layered and expansive sandbox title offering the player a unique gameplay experience and a gaming platform that has earned the rightful praise of many loyal fans.

review: I have put a few hundred hours into Arma 3 and it's the wackiest military game I've ever played. Here are a list of entertaining things you can do in Arma 3 that I have also personally partaken in: You can set up enemy faction sentry guns to kill you and your team mates- You can tactically scoot on your butt to the combat zone- You can gather your friends inside a bullet proof room and bounce bullets off the walls and watch to see who dies first- You can have your friends get in a truck then proceed to airlift said truck with a helicopter and swing them around below you while seeing how long it takes before you accidentally swing them into your main rotor and crash in an explosive inferno- You can hide in a building while your squade mate crashes heavily armed UAVs into said building trying to kill you- You can hop into a vehicle just to have it explode immediately after and kill you- You can get stranded in the water after your helicopter pilot accidentally sank the chopper in the ocean, then find a civilian driving a boat and kill said civilian to where the boat is just driving itself in circles just to have it smack you in the head so you're unconsious and drown- Hands down Arma 3 is one of the most entertaining wacky military simulator sandbox video games I've ever played. 10/10

And if you aren't satisfied, there's a massive community that's always creating addons, modifications, and even full-conversion modifcations. The community also has another side where you can find friends and formulate tactical squads or even battalions. I highly recommend you check this game out, though do acknowledge that this game isn't perfect and does lack a lot of desired features. However, you can probably find those features within the modding community.

review: It must be said again and again: The ArmA series is NOT compareable to any cinematic driven, action packed shooters! And if you don't like teambased multiplayer, you won't get too much fun out of it, since the singleplayer campaign seems to be more like an extra. This said, the third Armed Assault gives you everything you need for the most realistic and intense battle experience possible! You might complain about the near future setting, which made it even harder for me to leave my beloved Chernarus (ArmA 2) behind, but you won't stumble over pulse rifles et cetera. Furthermore you'll get a huge sandbox world, an editor to do in it whatever you want and a fine community that never sleeps! So, what else should I recommend right now? Buy it! Don't wait for more content and lower pricing, the war has already begun! Edit: Best Game ever! =)

This is a combat simulator, and I have been immidiately impressed with the single player campaign (which I normally don't play!). The game doesn't feel as responsive as some newer titles (BF4), but it's realism to me, seems excellent. I don't know of course, I've never been in a war, and hope I never have too - but playing this game makes me feel about as close as I'd want to get. I only started playing this game really after playing DayZ Standalone, and will definately be continuing the explore it further.

review: Arma 3 is a game, with simulation elements. It's not a simulator. It is also a game for a specific type of gamer that prefers large scale warfare, instead of playing casual fast-paced shooters like COD or BF. If you enjoy the experience from briefing and planning , and executing a plan , no matter how it plays out, the game adapts to any playing style that fits your style. Run & gun still works, but you need to have some uber micro skills.. If your mission fails, Arma allows you to retreat and get out alive, or gives you the oppertunity to get it done in another way. That's a nice touch compared to games that usually let the game end right after a fail. (SP) A bullet in the head will kill you, a bullet in your ballistic helmet might save your life, get shot in your legs and you're have to crawl your way out of there.. Things you have to consider in real life come close to the decisions you have to make in this game. Playing multiplayer with a group of people make the experience even better, but this game isn't really 'finished'. While the tags say it's a full release, Bohemia keeps working for years on these games to improve and add more content. They've done the same thing to their previous titles. If you really care about Multiplayer, I suggest Arma 2 :CO. Pro/cons : + Mission Editor Large scale warfare Mods (Armaholic & Bis forums) Steam workshop - User Generated 'Mission' Content (Mods in future?) All kinds of vehicles (Air, Cars, Armor, Support, and so on) +270 km2 map to explore - Multiplayer performance still crap. AIR vehicle (MH-/AH-) lost turnspeed, please add a slider to have us configurate our own speed on pedals. Setting sensitivity to high, still have slow pedal movement >_< Those small choppers are able to quickly rotate , but now it's a slow , long and horrible turn. No co-op in Campaign?. (Co-op game plox!) AI moves unnatural (They behave like androids)

review: Updated review: I have been exploring more features of Arma 3 and I love it! I have been playing a bit of the standard Arma 3 features which are fun, but the sheer number of mods and workshop missions is unreal! This game is so flexible. My most favourite mods and missions I have been playing are: Altis life: think along the lines of GTA, but everyone ever where is a real player, the police, military, bandits, civilians, criminals, everyone. It is a very immersive mission where you do what you want, whenever you want. Earn money through doing legal jobs, or become a criminal and traffic drugs, rob banks, rob other players, do whatever you want to survive, but beware your actions could get you on the police wanted list. Buy food, weapons, vehicles, licenses and so much more, it is a great experience when your on an active server. Escape Altis: an online coop game which can also be played single player, your goal to escape the huge island of altis. You will encounter AI enemy`s in all kinds of locations, choose how you get through, stealthy? Or guns blazing? Do it your way! This mission is very challenging and lots of fun, best with mates! Breaking Point: Think Dayz but on a bigger map, less glitches and now a choice of 5 factions to choose from. Each with their own perks, rules (or none depending which you choose), and appearance. Breaking point provides 5 maps, Altis, Stratis, Thirsk summer and Thirsk winter. The thirsk maps are PvP orientated with survival thrown in for good measure. Stratis is bigger than than Thirsk maps with a bigger focus on survival against zombies and other players. Altis is just huge! While breaking point is still in its infancy, the dev team is working really hard at it and adding new features and maps frequently. Vehicles in this mod are fairly rare, so expect work to be done finding them, you will also have to fix them up to get them working to. I love the Arma 3 engine, it is so flexible and allows for so many different ways to play, it just never gets dull. I highly recommend it!

review: This is a game you buy for the features, but keep on playing for the mods! Not everyone is a fan of Arma 3's mods and prefer to play it for it's base game, I'm not 1 of those people! It isn't a game for the "COD kid" to just pick and up and play, it requires patience and team work to complete missions. People who prefer the "Run N Gun" approach won't last long in the world of Arma! For me, the best thing about Arma 3 is the mods. As a survival fan I love that I can play Epoch, Breaking Point and Battle Royale on a map like Altis or Stratis (or even chernarus and beyond!). Even if you hate "mil-sim" games, I promise you will love Arma 3 if you like survival and zombie games! Give it a go!

review: There are several types of gudeg; dry, wet, Yogyakarta style, Solo style and East Javanese style. Dry gudeg has only a bit of coconut milk and thus has little sauce. Wet gudeg includes more coconut milk. The most common gudeg comes from Yogyakarta, and is usually sweeter, drier and reddish in color because of the addition of teak leaves as coloring agent. Solo gudeg from the city of Surakarta and is more watery and soupy with lots of coconut milk and whitish in color because teak leaves are generally not added. Yogyakarta's gudeg usually called "red gudeg", while Solo's gudeg also called "white gudeg". The East-Javanese style of gudeg has a spicier and hotter taste compared to the Yogyakarta style gudeg which is sweeter. Gudeg is traditionally associated with Yogyakarta, and Yogyakarta is sometimes nicknamed "Kota Gudeg" (city of gudeg). The center of Yogyakarta gudeg restaurants is in the Wijilan area to the east side of the Yogy

review: There's not much to say about Arma, so many crazy stories come out of it. Once me and Two other friends were scouting around in some woods near some buildings, we were loaded up with weapons and some good backpacks. We spot a building we wanted to check for loot, except theres already about 3 or 4 guys in there from where we could see in the hills. So my friends decide its not a good idea to go down there, I had a grenade on me, I took off my backpack and left my sniper in one place (So my friends could take it for me if I died), Took a grenade and a Pistol. I launched the grenade high into the air where it exploded confusing the enemy, I went Rambo into the building with a pistol and took all the guys out. So Yeah.....10/10. GET THIS GAME!

review: Arma 3 is a simulator First/Third Person shooter, one of the most realistic game's ive seen come by in a long while. You better have a good computer if you plan to play Multiplayer some servers really take a beating on FrameRate, If you like military or just good ol pvp in general this is quite the game to sink some time into... The new map don't hold how special Wasteland was in Alpha/Beta but its still the core mentallity of the gameplay.

review: This Game is absolutely beautiful. Some of my best moments have been on this game, not only is the vanilla game absolutely brilliant but the modding community is also spectacular. You can play as Marines, Army, Navy, whatever you choose. That being said, some further optomization is necessary as this game has major lag spikes and crazy FPS drops, even in singleplayer. I have played for 300 hours and have yet to play the campaign, its great. If you are wondering what this game requires graphics card wise, I am playing with a MSI Radeon R9 270x which is a mid range card, on all ultra at average of 50-60 FPS (On singleplayer). For a long time I was playing with a NVIDIA GeForce 610 which is a low end card but wsa still able to play and had great expierences with. So Overall, no matter what your specs are, buy this game. If your specs aren't quite good enough to run it on ultra or high the sheer gameplay expierences will make you want to invest mor time, and of course more money on PC games. Gameplay 10/10 Graphics 9/10 FPS 7/10 Storyline (from what I've seen from others and from the few missions I have dabbled in) 9/10 Overall 9/10 would play

review: The best massively open world first and third person shooter I have every played. Arma 3 makes Call of Duty Advanced Warfare and Battle Field 4 look likes child play. The amount of detail in all there helicopters, Tanks, Troop Transports, characters, weapons, maps, lighting, effects, go-carts is overwhelming! Sometimes when I'm flying over a city getting ready to para-drop into a hell fire of tanks and jets, I feel like I'm watching a HD action movie of the year! I don't what I love most about this game the most, might be laying in the grass on a hill a mile away from any conflict staring down my scope of my rifle calculating the wind and the bullet drop, then taking the shot. No game has every made me feel so rewarded when I complete a mission. Amra 3 missions are not these 5 minute deathmatches there long fought out high action battles. Also there map is SO BIG its insane, and its not just one island, there's others that are insanely big, I cant even imagine how long it would take to go from one side of the main island to the other flying in a Helicopter going over 200+ miles per hour. Lastly very unique complex non-repetitive terrain. LOVE IT, CARE FOR IT, BUY IT!

review: well I only have 100 hours on this one. But that's enaugh after I've played nearly 2000 hours of ArmA 2 OA with and without the DayZ mod.(440 or so hours wasteland, 220 hours on a single dayz server and about 150 - 200 on multiple other DayZ epoch servers via DayZ commander) The game is simply improved, it runs better than the old one does (at least on my system), looks great, is less clunky. The game is set in future (I dislike this bit) Is a time cow as alaways. To newcomers this game takes time. There are no quick 10 minute rounds. The meat of the game for me is on 120 people wasteland servers, where it takes time to get gear, takes time to travel, takes time to siege and objective and so on. An average paly session will last from 2 hours and up (If you want to acctualy acomplish something). 10/10 would recomend if you can run it. Howerver I'd simply suggest picking up ArmA 2 when it's avalible for 5 or less euros, since the price is quite steep when not on sale and you're either going to love this (like I do) or hate it. It's not comparable to Battlefield or Call of Duty. And even more so it's false to think that liking any of those games will make you like ArmA as well. Also when deciding on making your purchase take a good hard look will you be able to run this game and if can play a game on 30 fps. I'm all PC master race guy with atleast full HD and 60fps as a requirment, however without the latest and greatest rig it's hard to swim around 60fps in this title. SP runs well, very well even, but when it comes to MP your expierence is close to unpredictable. On some servers you'll be running great and on some you'll have 10fps no matter what you do. This game is uniqe. It's more like tools and materials that can be used to create a beautifull house, than the house itself. If you want to expierence the construction of your house rather than getting one already built, there is no better title than this one.

review: "I'm not going to pay this money for this game" - Totally not, you shouldn't. 1st you should get a better GPU, and I mean a VERY GOOD GPU, ARMA 3 still needs better optimization. 2nd wait for multiplayer fixes, it still has some desync insues here and there, multiplayer performance needs improvement. 3rd "Why do i need ot wait for multiplayer fixes when i can play Singleplayer?" - Well ARMA is made for Coop action, and by this I mean join a clan/ group/ unit that knows how to play the game correctly. 4th Buy it and you will see it will be worth it!

review: Well, Arma 3, Arma 3. Personally this is my favorite War game and maybe even my favorite war game of all time. Reason being is due ot it's heartbeating intense firefights. Espicially when you get along with some freinds and mods and completely make Arma into a full on Military Simulator. I honestly think Arma 3 campaign has a great story mode to it, every special part of the campaign made me want to not quit it! Intense scripting and story line for sure! Graphics wise, i think arma 3 has AMAZING graphics for a computer game, however the bad thing is you need a really buffed up computer to do it. Need a new graphics card/video card, and maybe even a new motherboard or CPU will help! Arma 3 multiplayer is OUTSTANDING, it's one of the best multiplayer communitys out there for it's great teamwork players and amazing gamemodes like Altis Life, Wasteland, and Invade And Annex! If you love battlefield, call of duty, or any other war FPS/realism war games this is the game for you and it's worth the money!

review: My favorite game since 2002, and it keeps getting better, and better, and better... Mostly thanks to Bohemia Interactive for making an open scripting command game. Then it was improved enormously by the community and their mods and missions, third party softwares, and blogs/youtubes. In my opinion, the ACRE mod made the immersion so intense that it became essential. We now also have Task Force Radio who is clearly 100% inspired from ACRE but they reacted faster to the porting to Arma 3 (probably because they are open source). The ACE guys made an amazing job at making better weapons, ballistics, medical, etc. etc. etc. Now AGM seems to be taking over that role in Arma 3 (another open source project) Also, VTS with its game master for real time mission creation and adapting, which inspired the MCC makers, and later Zeus... And finally Play withSIX (previously known as Six Updater) which made it so easy to bring all the community mods launchable, and allowed us to create repositories for keeping up with updates and mod changes for long nights of great fun. Even though BI eventually took and implemented pretty much most of what I just described in the last paragraph, it could only be made possible in the first place, because how open this game was made by them. What comes around goes around I guess. And maybe that is why they are having the MakeArmaNotWar contest where they are giving out some money. I just hope that the original community innovators who actually made this game better get some credit/price. IMO, BI started with an excellent idea with Operation Flashpoint, they kept improving the engine over the years, and the openness and the community is what made it what it is today, my favorite game.

Played king of the hill and had to fight my way through the streets of Kavala. Long story short. This game is good, the SP and MP are both good, People are good but some can be annoying.

review: This military sandbox is definitely worth the buy! Some game-modes I like are: King of the Hill: A great team vs. team vs. team game-mode where you fight to stay in the objective area, level up to unlock more weapons, vehicles, and more! Role-play game-mode (altis life, stratis life, arma 3 life, arma rpg) : A really fun mode where you can live your life as a civilian and choose a career, apple farming is good but you will make a bit more mooney running drugs. This game-mode offers great role-play experience that can't be beat. Epoch Mod: A great pvp/survival mod very similar to DayZ, in this mod you can build your team, craft a base, fight off enemy AI, kill zombies, survive, scavenge. A great mod to play if you are a fan of DayZ standalone, Arma 2 epoch. Overall a great game, and with 700 hours played I can highly suggest this game to anyone.

review: This game is definitely a direct improvement over Arma 2. If you are familiar with that game, it is very easy to transition over to this game. I especially enjoy the mission editor. The mission editor has a pretty steep learning curve, but enough tutorials and trial and error will get you competent with the editor's logic. The game is much better optimized than Arma 2 was, but it still runs pretty awful on multiplayer, even with a high spec PC. I ended up having to turn down my view distance to a pretty low amount to consistently get 40 fps on multiplayer, because the fps largely relies on the server's power. On single player or a small server of 5-10 people, I could just about max out the game with a steady 60 fps. I am disappointed with the DLC though, as it really doesn't add much at all to the game at this point, and it retails at $25. I would recommend picking this game up, even if you have never played the other Arma games, because it seems like it has a much smaller learning curve than previous titles, but is still just as in-depth. This game is a good purchase, especially on sale, the DLC on the other hand is not currently worth it.

review: I remember getting ARMA 2 on special back in the day, played it once then put it on the shelf. Then I seen this mod called DayZ and I have been sucked into the ARMA world ever since. More to the point, ARMA 3. A vast improvement on its predecessor but still a game that takes a lot of trial and error before you really get the hang of it and can appreciate the engine. The Single Player Campaign was slowly worked on and released over time, with fixes and improvements over a period of time to end up with a really nice and although linear storyline, they really add elements that allow you to verge away from the main storyline and engage in heaps of other tasks and activities ( I had to play the main campaign twice to appreciate it) The main reason to get ARMA 3 though is the mods. From Breaking Point, EPOCH to a heap of 'mission maps' and game modes, ARMA really throws a lot of diversity at you and is great bang for your buck.

review: This game is amazing although it keeps getting frozen. However its okay my internet provider reads out its constant motto hakuna matata. I was outside in the recent snow and i was asking myself if I want to build a snowman But then i thought i just cant wait to be king of Altis. I died One time with my scuba gear under the sea but everythings better when i am wetter in my own pee pee . I had a recent visit to Kavala and i saw a hobo i thought to myself who is that girl staring back at me. I then saw a Hench Po PO man and i thought i wanna be like you i wanna talk like you i wanna walk like you. So i ran up to him and grabbed his sweaty bicep and said you've got a friend in me. It is best to start of by buying the bare Necessities in altis like backpacks and stuff But think about yourself really its a whole new world out there. However dont insult police because i got shot. P.S i guess thats the circle of life

review: By far the most realistic military simulation game that's out today. If you're a serious military enthusiast this is your game. It also has the most impressive modding community I've ever seen for a game. This is a true PC exclusive. Arma 3 is more than a military game. If you are someone who is very creative and has a vision of an exciting scenario in your mind, this game will give you the tools to make that vision come to life. It does require a VERY powerful CPU to be clocked very high for it to run smoothly. It's rough around the edges, but at the end of the day it gives you so much freedom that many games fail to deliver. 9/10

review: I am truely amazed by how endless the possibilities are with ArmA 3. With the right mods, or just the right friends, you can make anything out of ArmA. If you are looking to play, I suggest you try out Altis life if you like to role-play, Recommended Altis Servers - Black Water Gaming - The Revolution Gaming - Black List Gaming Or perhaps you are looking to do some military type stuff, then I suggest either find a milsim unit. Recommended Military Simulation Units - 40 Commando 31.186.251.180 (TS IP) Or perhaps you are looking just to sit back and kill people. For that, I do not have any recommendations, but look into King of the Hill and Wasteland.

review: -=-This review was written on the 6th of January 2015. Things may have changed.-=- I really want to like this game, and I do very much. For the current 20 hours I have played, it has been very fun. The reason why I don't reccomend this game is optimization. There is none of it. If I can crush BF4 @ Ultra, 1080p in 64 Player Battles running at a smooth 70-80FPS, or CSGO @ Ultra , 1080p with 300FPS, and Payday 2 running @ High, 1080p with a crystal clear 135FPS, why am I running this game, released in Mid-2013 @ Standard with 20FPS? It's honestly madness! One of the reasons why I bought this machine was to play this game, I couldn't do it with my old PC. But when I realise that this $2000 PC can not run this game at Standard it bugs me so much. They need to get this  sorted very soon or their playerbase will turn to nothing, as nobody will run this thing because they can't afford a better PC and can't stand the  framerate! It really can be a challenge to run this. If you are planning to get a PC for this game, please go with Intel and NVidia. This game is definitely not AMD-friendly. I run an Intel CPU and an AMD GPU and because of my GPU I am struggling, even though this game is super CPU-intensive. I love this game, but I can't reccomend it right now in this state.

review: Now where do we start here then :D Arma2: OA was great for mods such as Overpoch and the best thing in Arma2: OA is that there is no physics :D but... Arma 3: Brings allot to the table when fighting in wars I mean when I first played Arma 3 and that was when it was free on steam I instantly played the campaign and it was amazing, Not as great as Battlefield and Call Of Duty campaigns. Now lets cut this boring crap and talk about running the game. Intel HD 4000+ Graphics Card: Will run the game, But on Low settings and will get over 30 FPS witch is all you need really to get a good feel of the game exept obviously crap graphics. It can run Arma 3 on a mixed scaled of Low and Medium settings but will get around 20 FPS depending on what settings you have changed to Medium ( I allways have Vsync off, Not sure if that improved FPS but I do it anyway :p ). However once you are flying in the air in combat like Apache's or Armed Little Birds for example your FPS goes up obviously because it does not render as much stuff around you as when you are on the ground you loose FPS. AMD Graphics Card: Not sure about this graphics card as my old I3 Intel HD Graphics 4000 Laptop can run arma 3 in the ways I spoke about above but lets bring Arma 2: OA back here for a second, On Arma2: OA I get about 40-60 FPS witch is great and in the air about 70-80 FPS and thats perfect but I came across someone who uses a PC with a AMD graphics card and even on low settings he gets like 15 FPS and maybe 25 FPS if he is lucky. So Arma 3 wise I am not too sure on what FPS you will get. I do not recommend anything like FPS boosters or Contig ect, As they may contain a virus and can slow down your computer badly.

review: This game is really good. I would give it a 9/10 and the reason i give it such a high rating is because there are endless things to do. Such as altis life or maybe tactical missions but my favorite part of the game is flying. There is the standard flying which is sorta like a arcade flying but still has some realistic features then there is advanced flying. But besides that this game is just great before i had this game i was a lone wolf on arma 2 but on here i met a awesome group of people that i play arma 3 with every night we even have are own altis life server.

review: Let's see... I have put 530 hours on ArmA II and 230 on ArmA III... Is this a good game? Yes. It is a military shooter that focuses on scale. There is some realism and some not, its a video game so of course there will be reality breaking moments. Do the sounds of rifles crack? Yes. Grenades that explode near you, will shake you up and be loud. The sounds in this game are amazing. From the hum of the chopper as it starts up to the rumble of your tank, you will feel like you are in this breathing world of military hardware the moment the game starts up. The graphics are amazing. There are times when I simply stare off into the horizon, in awe at how large the map is. You can customize your character for a more immersive feel in game. There are mods and various game modes. From Deathmatch to King of the Hill and DayZ Epoch, there is something for every FPS fan. The gameplay mechanics and controls are deep. Be ready for about 8 different key strokes for how you can take cover, but it works in its favor as you want to have the most concealed firing position yet be able to hit your target so peeking around corners, from low to the ground rocks and more make combat from mountains or Close Quarters dynamic and fresh. Piloting a heli or driving a tank is easy to pick up and rewarding when you master it. For airplanes, you may find the controls difficult as having a stick is the best and easiest way to effectively pilot (some players only pilot and use only the joystick in multiplayer). There are really cool workshop game modes you can download and play solo or with friends. 10/10 I highly recommend this game due to its gameplay, controls and graphics. If you enjoyed the ArmA series you will love this game and if you like military shooters with some realism, you will also enjoy picking this game up.

review: It's the dead of night on the CSAT-occupied island of Stratis, and the peaceful darkness is about to explode into chaos. I'm leading one of two spec-ops teams on a mission to liberate the leader of a local guerrilla faction and return him to the much larger island of Altis. A British squad is in charge of the actual rescue. Our job is to cause as much trouble across the island as possible to distract the CSAT forces and give the British the opening they need. Over the next hour, that's precisely what I do. Inserting by boat from the northwest coast, I head south and raid an ammo dump before cutting across to the eastern shore to destroy a heliport. Then my squad suppresses an enemy encampment from a hillside near the centre of the island as I swoop in from the west to flank them. Yet before we can regroup, my entire team is killed by reinforcements descending from the north, and the British still need more time to complete their mission. Alone, I rush to the southernmost tip of the island, where I blow up a fortified anti-air position before escaping by riding a quad bike back through the swarming enemy forces to the extraction point, where the boat takes me home. Arguably the biggest complaint about Bohemia Interactive's post-Flashpoint games is that their campaigns haven't used the magnificent landscapes they create to their full potential. The first Arma's campaign was a hastily cobbled-together disappointment, while it took a certain zombie-survival mod to harness the austere and foreboding power of Arma 2's Chernarus. That Arma 3 uses half an island for just one of its twenty-odd missions is indicative of Bohemia's effort to resolve this ongoing issue. Indeed, taken as a whole, Arma 3 strives to make this deep and impenetrable military simulator series a more comprehensive, more engaging and more user-friendly experience. It isn't completely successful, but I had an awful lot of fun watching it try. While Arma 3 was officially released back in September, the campaign has been portioned out in three substantial chunks over the last six months. Each chapter is a self-contained entity with its own story arc and theme; combined, they tell the tale of the excitingly named Corporal Ben Kerry and his role in the war over the fictional Mediterranean island archipelago of Altis and Stratis, waged between four different factions. The first part, Survive, is geared towards introducing players to Arma. It takes place entirely on the smaller of Arma 3's two islands, Stratis, and sees Kerry banding up with a group of NATO survivors after the local Altian Armed Forces, backed by NATO's eastern equivalent CSAT, rise up against the local US garrison. For the most part, missions are small-scale skirmishes that keep you firmly in the "follower" category while teaching you the basics of minimising your daily lead intake. Rescuing a downed helicopter crew instructs you on establishing a defensive position, while a midnight liaison with local militia explains how to flank and clear buildings. It's hardly the campaign's most spectacular stage. Story-wise, it's let down by voice acting that ranges from passable to cringeworthy and a script that understands military radio chatter but not how human beings interact with one another. Even here, though, Bohemia's approach to maximising the assets it has built is apparent. Missions are nearly always multi-staged, with objectives being added and changed as events rarely go according to plan. While it smoulders rather than sparks, Survive concludes strongly and the momentum is carried over into Adapt, definitely the best of the three chapters. This introduces Altis, a masterwork of environmental design. I could write another 1000 words on its remarkable sights and sounds: its misty dawns, crimson dusks and streetlight-speckled nights. But what's most important is how the detail that's gone into mapping the landscape's undulations - the lumps and bumps, hills and valleys - plays into the game's combat. A little rise in the ground might be the difference between life and death as you throw yourself down in evasion of the fiendishly accurate enemy AI. When they stop to reload, you'll rush to locate a better vantage point, order your men to "find cover" (an extremely handy new command) and plant half a dozen bullets in your opponent's surprisingly tough body. Tactics are vital in Arma 3, but it's terrain that really makes the difference between success and failure. It's crucial to learn this before Adapt begins, because the difficulty suddenly ramps up. The first mission sees you alone, unarmed and with a city full of enemy soldiers between you and any kind of safety. At this point, setting saves to unlimited using Arma's highly customisable difficulty levels becomes a necessity. Fittingly, after Survive, you will die many, many times. That said, it's important to note that combat is more satisfying than before thanks to improved animations, smoother weapon handling and better optics - meaning the challenge stems from your opponents rather than clumsy controls and slow-to-aim weapons. Adapt also changes the way you play. It gives you a squad to control, which is a mixed blessing. AI units tend to be much more perceptive of enemy locations than you are and are especially useful when facing down tanks and APCs, but they also require a fair amount of babysitting to keep them alive, and the lack of changes to Arma's squad commands means this can be a chore. Especially problematic is AI ammo management; your teammates go through bullets like a swarm of locusts through a corn crop, and resupplying them in the field is a nightmare in Arma 3's clumsy interface. Alongside its story missions, which include the brilliant raid on Stratis described above, Adapt also introduces an open-world component. From your base you can go out on "Patrol" and complete multiple optional objectives, from clearing enemy checkpoints to smoking out a sniper hidden inside a labyrinthine industrial complex, all while collecting weapons, ammo and equipment to use during the main missions - though the clunkiness of Arma's inventory management means this is less enjoyable than it should be. If you want to bring stuff back to base, you need to find a vehicle and load it item-by-item from your own inventory, while before each mission the game defaults to a standard equipment loadout and items you previously had can be lost in this process. After the meatiness of Adapt, the final chapter Win feels fleeting by comparison, with only six missions to its name. But they're also the most spectacular, displaying vast, combined-arms battles that cover sweeping areas of Altis. It's strongly reminiscent of the opening of Operation Flashpoint, but with you in control rather than being led by an AI squad leader. In these closing stages you can call in devastating artillery strikes and helicopter assaults, simultaneously demonstrating the sheer destructive power of modern warfare and your own insignificance in the scale of things. Story-wise, it's also the most interesting segment, making unsettling use of its near-future setting and offering a branching conclusion that is fascinating, whichever direction you take. Arma 3's campaign is a big, powerful, deeply engrossing thing, but there is one disappointment: its lack of vehicular missions. Since the story focuses on one not particularly interesting character who is ultimately a grunt, there are no tank missions, no helicopter missions and no jet missions. I can understand why, to a point: Arma's vehicles, especially its airborne offering, take time and effort to learn to control. Moreover, in these kinds of games infantry combat tends to be more enjoyable anyway. On the other hand, Flashpoint offered plenty of vehicle engagements during its campaign without any issue, and it's frustrating that, 13 years on, Arma's campaigns still lag behind it in terms of breadth of experience.

review: this game have the best 'realism' where you can easily die by bullets, high recoil and no terms of 'one-man-army' like most of the game these days. its possible to be OMA but that requires many tries on each levels. THE BAD THING is that the gameplay is kind of BORING because theres too many information that you recieved but less thing you can do. Instructions/Guide while in game sometimes doesnt help a new player to understand this game. Too many button to use! The AI in singleplayer kindda DUMB. The AI doesnt react to our command smart enough. Realism : 9.0/10 Gameplay : 5.5/10 AI : 3.5/10 Graphics : 8.5/10 Physics : 7.5/10 Overall : 6.8/10

review: So immersive when played in multiplayer with a proper team. Map reading is just one of the real life skills you may need to use during battle, as well as using the radio and communicating with your team. Also includes a great editor to make your own missions for multiplayer and singleplayer, and you can upload your own missions to the Steam Workshop

review: The game by itself isn't that fantastic. The graphics and gameplay are good, but it isn't worth the price. Using the Breaking Point mod adds a whole new depth into the game and I would strongly recommend downloading it if you have the Arma III game. Overall I recommend it because I haven't regretted buying it for $60 and therefore hope you feel the same if you buy it. (Best to buy it on special though)

review: This game is a pleasure to experience at times, flying low over the island at sun up you notice how beautiful the graphics are whilst looking out the side window at the ground just whizzing past. Then you face inwards and look around you at your buddies who are chattering away about there lives outside the game, then minutes later the pilot sets you down, you all file out ready for whats next, and everyone is quiet. You tab to the edge of the AO and observe your objective. What you see is small patrols with a couple of vehicles and a tank. Then you look past the area at the sun glistening off the sea in the distance then notice a spec flying towards you and an enemy CAS warning pops up. The heli you arrived in is shot out the sky and crashes a kilometer away. All hell breaks loose, while team leaders relay orders trying to bring control to the chaos but the plan has already gone to s**t! You lay down suppresive fire, then bound towards the town with your fireteam...... This game is a world apart sometimes, its not like call of duty and not a whole lot like battlefield either, this game will have you ducking for cover when you hear the shots crack overhead. Buy it, play it and see how your story ends..... +Also I joined an altis life server filled with french people which I thought would be okay because I speak a little bit of french. I was wrong. It was a bad idea! I approached a police officer making an arrest who immediately started screaming at me so loud I could not understand a word he was saying. So I backed away, turning to run and went around the block, only to round a corner to see blue and red flashing lights screaming towards me! Before I could move he ran me over, then seconds later I got an admin ban for being run over by an out of control police man... Now I live my Altis life far from the law as possible on a different server. Thumbs up, great game and community content will keep it alive for a long time to come! Definitly recommended :)

review: ArmA 3 is a fantastic simulation of military combined arms warfare, successfully creating an authentic envirmoment un-rivaled to any other and hightech modes of transport to visit every inch of it. Though you may need a high performance computer to run this game, even on the lowest settings you can enjoy it. From enthrawling hour long witchhunts on Wastelands to one of the best First Person Shooter campaigns of all time, im sure you will find something that you will look back on and say "That was freaking awesome!" Create your own mission and play with friends with the in-game editor, where you can achieve the same height of perfection as in the Official Campaign. I whole heartedly dont regret any of the hours that I have put into this game and would recomend it to anyone who is willing to play properly, as a team and is willing to follow the rules of the servers becuase when you do, the game turns into a multi-million pound movie in-which you are the main character and you choose what happens. "This game is bloody epic!"

review: If you think this is another Call of Duty knock off, you're far from correct. I know i haven't played for a while, because i got it free this weekend and i dont want to spend the 60$ on it. The game is one of the most realistic games ever. That can be a good thing, and a bad thing. People have been asking for realisitc games forever, but now that we have one, do we want it? Let me just get to the Pro's and Cons. Pro's: 1. Fighting enenmies is actually a challenge. (Unlike many other shooter games) 2. The story line seems to be very good, theres alot of twists to through you off. 3. When you kill enemies, you can loot their body and take their gun, attatchments, and clothes. 4. There arent many dull moments. Like i said, the campaign keeps you on your toes. 5. Open World Thats really where the Pro's end... Con's: 1. Its so realistic, its annoying. Dont we play video games to get out of the real world? 2. If you run for 200 feet or more, you will be fatigued and your max running speed is your normal walking speed. 3. The sway of the scope/sights is so bad. I wish i could show you how impossible it is to kill people from 100m away. Unless you get lucky. 4. The map is confusing to understand at first, theres no legend telling you what everything means. 5. The amount of bullets that it takes to kill an enemy, is the same amount of bullets it take to kill you. 6. AI's will see you from 200-300m away. 7. You have to manually save if you dont want to respawn 30 mins back. 8. Multiplayer was confusing. I spawned in and walked around for a little while, tried to type to people, and nothing happened. So i left. (Maybe its because im new to Arma, and dont know what im doing.) 9. Enemies with grenade launchers seem to have unlimited grenades to launch. You cant move out of cover without being blown up at times. 10. The game thinks you should know what to do, and how to do it. So, it will tell you what it wants you to do, and if you havent figured it out in about 5 mins, it will finally give you and objective point. So, if you're confused at some point, or lost, you get to run around wildly for 5-10 mins. 11. The graphics need to be better. You think its still loading in, but its not. The graphics are just not what i expected. Thats everything I experienced in the short time that i've played. If you do purchase this game, Hope a mod as good as DayZ (From Arma 2) comes out for this game aswell.

review: This is a really great game! This is not a game for people who are going for a Call Of Duty style gameplay. There are some bugs but the developers are usually good at finding and fixing them. Cool DlC's are released frequently. The physics are quite nice, no un-realistic ragdoll effects when you die, nice vehicle handling, just dont fall down the stairs or else you wil die haha, they do need to fix that. The campaign is a thrilling story of a young Corporal Kerry who you'll play as. The maps are EXTREMELY detailed everywhere, there are so many cool and breath-taking areas of the two islands of Stratis and Altis. There are tons of servers and gamemodes so you can't be bored. There is also the option to mod this game in so many cool and fantastic ways it seems endless! But be warned, the controls are not so easy, they are not your simple stand, crouch, prone. The vehicle's controlling is decent but you will likely need some practice for the jets and helicopters which I had to do. The AI's path-taking and combat skills are impressive, at times they can act stupid. This game is a must-have for the computer gamer! I give this game a solid 5 out of 5 stars for its gameplay. I would recommend this game to anyone interested in a next level military simulation game. The developer's team is bunch of people who really do know what they are doing to make this game outstanding to play. This is not a game where you might think of a bunch of kids acting like they are United States Navy Seals or British SAS, you should think this game as a serious, fun, educational game of how military might work and fight in a simulated warzone. I hope this review encourages you to buy the game AND the DLC for it! I know I will be a constant customer with the amount of great work the developers have done to Arma 3.

review: ARMA III has been valued at $60 (49,58) for over two years now, and heres why. If you are a fan of FPS or TPS games, you have probably been playing COD, CS, or BF, ten hours a day, but ARMA III is not a FPS or TPS games, its a Military Simulator. Unlike COD, CS, or BF, ARMA III is meant to simulate war, making it VERY realistic. Which means its very hard to get any kills when you first start out, and unlike in COD, CS, or BF, ARMA III is set in a HUGE sandbox map, meaning: no invisible walls, almost everything is accesible, and snipers are everywhere ;). In order to enjoy ARMA III you have to like VERY slow paced shooters and have a ENORMUS amount of patience. You also must be ready to be killed by that level two sniper hiding in the bushes 1000 ft. (304 meters) away. Even though I said it is VERY slow paced, when you do happen to land yourself in a firefight, it is heart racing and very intense. In order for you to capture a objective in ARMA III you have to do these five things: A: Get a group of 10-15 people together. B: Carefully plan out, minute by minute, whats going to happen, where it is gonna happen, who its gonna happen to, and why its gonna happen. C: Aquire transportation to the objective and exit your vehicle about 500 ft. (152 meters) away from the obective. D: Approach with caution, because you have no clue where their security is. E: Excute with full pride and confidence. PRO TIP: Always be sure to keep in communication with your team and use a compass to give cordinantes on an enemy. ARMA III is a BEATIFUL game which means it has some heavy system requirments, I run it on an Alienware m17 and still get an occasional lag spike. ARMA III is not for everyone, or everyones computer, but for those who can run it, and enjoy this type of shooter, it deserves a 9.5/10 (because of high system requirments I took off half a point which is why its 9.5 not 10)

review: This game is addictive. Yet it has tons of bugs, it's fun. If you are concerned that you won't like it, try watching some Altis Life videos on youtube, and buy the game when it is on Summer or Christmas sale on steam. Now, lets get to what really matters. There are two sides to this game. There are the RP servers, and then there are the MilSims. The RP (RolePlay) servers are easy to get, it deals with Altis and turns your gaming experience into a life, which then you have to develop your character and become friends (Or enemies) with others. You can mug, kidnap, and  (If you're experienced) other people. This gamemode is for if you want to have some laughs, and a  ton of fun. If you are wanting the military simulator part of this gamemode, then go check the Millitary Simulation Servers. There are fewer of them, but they can be still be fun. This gamemode provides a damn good simulation of War on Altis. Ranging from hardcore strategies to commanding your troops, this gamemode emits a real life enviroment for you to practice your gaming skills in. That's all, hope it helped! (By the way, I reccomend this game a lot, mostly for the people without large ing anger issues.)

review: have you ever played Delta Force 2? its a fps game from 1999. this game looks like a HD version of that. graphics are really bad if you turn them down a little bit, otherwise you would need a very hefty machine, even my GTX780 cant give me stable 60 fps on everything maxed. vehicles look like they are made of papers or card boards attached to each other. some people call it a real 'combat simulator', what they do NOT explain is that why there are characters running only wearing pink underwears in a realistic fps game? physics are extraordinary bad, the game is clunky, sluggish and stupid. try to climb a ladder and you would understand the bad physics, as your character would climb on an invisible ladder! looks to me the devs did not spend any time on this game. for a full price, my recommendation is a big NO! i bought it when it was still alpha, and lots of problems were never solved. heck, War Thunder is a free to play game on steam and the graphics, physics, models and environment in its tank simulator looks a decade better than a 39.99 Arma III. also, i must add, there is a horrible customer service and tech support from the devs. combat simulator? real fps game? could someone explain to me if high recoil on any weapons is anything next to realism? for instance, M4 carbine is a very weak weapon in real life, with 5.56x45mm Nato cartridge it has very low recoil for an adult. in this game, it looks like a 8 years old child is firing a M4, the recoil is unrealistic and stupid. BFBC2 is ten times more realistic than this. this game is not optimized well enough. watch some videos on youtube first, there is no environmental destruction what so ever like there is in BF series. AVOID this game. i can not stand it for 10 minutes. oh, the positive side, the community of this game is a very matured, kind, friendly, generous and helpful one. thats the only bright side here. my love and respect to them. wish there were more of these people in BF4!

review: Not a simulator, its a pseudo-simulator. It wouldn't be 50% playable if it wasn't for the community based addons. Bohemia SEMI true sim is sold ONLY to the military. I'm playing since Flash Point, i got a milsim corp since Armed Assault, we gave up since we couldn't play due to BIS patches ( that always ended ing up the addons versions ) bugs, crashes and glitches. It has a MASTER PIECE concept of "Make your own scenario and mission" this is the best concept in a game and what gripped me into the series to be true. I've lost more time making missions than playing then, the editor was actually very fun and easy to operate. However, ARMA 3 doesn't even have a proper armor system for the armored vehicles, you can shoot them with a .50 to death within a minute, physichs will always be below average due to the engine, and, as a great vehicle enthusiast, this is a major fact while driving them ( Very wierd to hear a tank lowering it's sound when it's going uphill when the torque is at maximum so the engine sound should be at the loudest point ) Another major fact is that ARMA is not made for CQB, you will never see good CQB fights or even decent urban fights, you can even see some semi-urban firefights, but you will never experiment a true close quarters firefight simulation in ARMA. I wish we could have some alternative to it, bohemia must chage this engine, and make the game MORE realistic or it will lose it's fan, just as Codemasters with that "cool" Operation Flash Point DR.

review: Not recommended, even for people who like a good military simulation game. Good: - Lots of potential for realism and immersion - Massive variety of ways to interact with game elements Bad: - Lack of variety in terms of gear (three colours don't make three different items) - Lack of any real weapons: it's all near-future stuff - Gunshots sound too mechanical or like movie sound effects - Weapon animations are loose: effects don't sync up right (two gunshots when you shoot three bullets, etc.) - Vehicles are very difficult to control without dedicated joystick/wheel VERY Bad: - Needlessly complicated control scheme which will take hours on hours to get used to (literally) - To say the learning curve is steep implies that there is a learning curve - Many functions of the game are hidden, unexplained, unintuitive, or poorly implemented - Potential for realism is destroyed when each mission becomes a sprint between ambushes There are several different tutorials - some in the "virtual reality", some on the islands, some as text-only, and none of which are adequate. Each tutorial is about ten-thirty seconds long and involves no actual help, assuming that because you pressed the right buttons once, you now know how to do it in combat. The team seems to have put zero effort into making the game intuitive: you will spend much of your time looking up various controls and reading about methods of interaction. This game is not finished. If you're looking for a good, intuitive, fun military simulator to get away from the Call of Duty bullcrap, pick up Operation Flashpoint: Red River. It might not be as extensive, and it suffers from a lack of replayability, but it isn't nearly as frustrating as Arma.

review: I give this a thumbs down, not becaue its a war simulator and Im looking for another COD, but because its so glitchy, that every time I feel like Im starting to be immersed in the game, it knockes me back out. I use the bino's to see where enemy troops are and it just decides that I have selected another item and pulls that out. I change from my rifle to my pistol and it changes back by itself 10 seconds later. It just loses all feel to it, and when it happens and it gets you killed it just makes you think it not worth it. I wouldnt buy till they can iron out these issues. On the posive side the actual game would have good potential without that issue.

review: Arma 3 is an improvement and significant step forward over the previous in its franchise, securing its top spot as the go to for military simulation. Arma 3 makes big steps forward with huge worlds and more varied vehicles and weapons. With the clever integration of the Steam workshop, player-made content has never been easier to install and manage. A smart move by Bohemia Interactive because it's these fan based mods that are the backbone of Arma and will give Arma 3 endless hours of replayability. With the effortless downloading and installation of a huge library of player created mods, from team driven tactical scenarios to the the chaotic survival mods, it's a must have for any shooter enthusiast.

review: Coming from someone that played A1 and A2 when they came out, away before it Dayz Mod. Arma 3 is a big ing cluster crap. There are some improvemnts on the gameplay but the problem in the game is the engine. I have a high-end PC, i can't play it with more than 30 FPS ( singleplayer i can max 50 fps without any AI spawned), with the last updates i am now unable to enter any multiplayer server. I have search for solutions everywhere and nothing. The game is more like a bug that you have to deal with if you want to have fun, a bug that was present in the other Armas but not as bad. Don't buy this game unless its really really cheap, the DEVS don't care about the game, as a long long long time fan of the series, this is certanly the last Arma or product i will buy from this company.

review: It's like Arma 2 but with less content, poorly optimised and cash grab DLC (Loadmasters anyone?). Was hoping it would get better but it's still worse than Arma 2 in almost every way except graphics, I think I'll stick to operating in Chernarus and Takistan instead of a Greek Island that has anti-framerate technology.

review: Game is pretty cool and detailed ... but its aparently going down the pay for any extra content road Im a cheapskate ... paying for extra model just make me sick .... if they would come out with actual add-on Ie wait a year or two finish singling out every issue with your engine then come out with a dlc adding a bit of everythng + some mission i m on thats fine by me i'd buy But here the game does not feel finished to me maybe they need to come out with more DLC's .... Just my opinion

review: This game is far too clunky to even be considered a full game in fact this should be in alpha. The controls are ok but the arma engine just makes it feel unnatural like everything is not smooth at all. the spotting system in this game is totall  by the way. you and your friend could be hiding in deep weeds but if an enemy gets within 50mt from you then you appear on their map, ripe for them to then kill you completing invalidating close up stealth. The game also has hit detection problems, i had the iron sights pointed directly at an enemy a bour 75 mt away and i could see the dust of the bullets hitting behind the enemy. overall i wouldn't get this game for full price, possibly 75% off if you want to play with friends because playing with friends does make the game a little better.

review: It took them far too long to polish this turd for me to recomend anything BIS is involved with. Yeah the game is ok now that they have finally added the features that should have been there from day dot, but I bought a physical copy of the DELUXE EDITION from EB and as such i expected a FINISHED GAME, not the Alpha/Beta i was confronted with. It should never have been on shelves 6 months ago let alone when i bought it back in 2013. And you would think DELUXE EDITION implies that at least *some* of the DLC would be included. Nope. Not so"DELUXE" then is it? Imagine buying a new car, and on your way out of the dealership the shady salesman casualy states 'Oh just so you know even though you have a dashboard, none of the dials or switches work. But as soon as we get some in we can install them for a nominal fee'. Seems a bit rude dosen't it? paying for something and realizing it dosen't even come close to expectations. And the excuse "why not just use mods" is just a sad way of admiting the game isn't finished and/or it isn't any good on its own. And even though i may pick it back up and try again i really don't see myself spending anywhere near the time i had intended to as the experience has left a VERY bitter taste in my mouth.

review: I personally think that this is a love or hate kind of a game, and I hate it, more specifically how it controls. Yeah it looks great but if I cant enjoy the way the character behaves I wont enjoy the game. Its just too clumsy in my opinion. If you dont like arma 2 then you wont like this one.

review: This game could be so much better if they fixed the ai. Was the same in arma 2 and unfortunately nothing has changed. Stealth is dead enemies will spot you in the dark 200 meters away or from a moving helicopter while your underwater. It is so inconsistant and really kills the immersion when concealment is moot. Instead of enemies getting smarter on higher difficulties they just get aim bots. Got to the point where even sticking my head out of cover for a split second meant death from a distant machinegun headshot. Thats not more challenging its just cheap. Best thing about this game is the editor.

review: I'm sorry, I do like this game. It is different from other FPS, with wide open combat and amazing community made missions, tactical multiplayer and interesting vehicles. But if I can crush crisis 3 on ultra @ 1080p, and BF4 on ultra @ 1080p and maintain a solid 60+ FPS what I don't want is to see a game use 25% of my CPU and 45% of my GPU under max load. And since this game is CPU intensive it adds insult to injury. I can barely hold 25+ FPS in big citys on low but somehow I get 60+ on ultra if I'm out in the middle of no where! I swear it renders every texture and unseen geometry... well it does... The game is not optimized at all The game can't utilize hardware at all (Intel better than AMD I must admit) Offering a laggy and unsatisfying experience to people. And I can't imagine what framerates people get on lower spec systems :-/ And bipods aren't a ting. I can see it. I can touch it. But my soldier is mentally handicap, or it is stuck like a stubborn bicycle stand that needs some oil. I will get fanboys arguing with me but to be honest they probably don't care abut graphics... wish I could be like that - I dont want my game to look like it runs on a console tho. My specs: (someone asked) GTX 780 4gb vram - 16 gb 1600mhz quad - AMD fx 9590 (stock clock) so yeah I should be able to run this OS: dual boot - linux + windows 8.1 on an SSD

review: ArmA 3 is an improvement in many aspects from ArmA 2. The graphics are more realistic, the movements are more fluid, and I find the vehicles are easier to control. This is a game that you will either absolutely love and play a lot, or you will hate it. The ArmA games aren't easy to learn by yourself. It takes time and patience to become fluent in the controls. You need to approach them with an open mind. Great versatility for mods and modders. The ingame mission editor is fantastic to use and great for trying out all that ArmA 3 has to offer. 10/10 do recommend

review: This game is one of the best simulators I have ever played. It contains many improvements to the engine, graphics, and controls since ARMA 2. This game has been made better by the steam workshop to host a ton of downloadable senarios. I would recommend you play this game with friends, or some sort of community. Some negatives of this game, is its performance, I requires a powerful computer to play, even then there is some sort of performace drop. Also there was a lack of single player content, but there is now some being released. Im looking forward to the future of this game as it gains popularity, and plus with all the cool expansions ARMA 2 had, there will probably be new content in the future. One more thing is that there is a huge difficulty spike because its a simulator. This is no call of duty or battle field, and requires alot of time to get used to. If you never had any experience with ARMA games and you are not shure if you should get ARMA 3, buy ARMA 2 + OA, it has been on sale recently for really cheap.

review: I play ArmA 3 since Alpha, it has changed alot since first builds all in plus. Its currently best game to buy if you think about Tactical FPS game, and also it isnt just that you buy ArmA and its all you get. ArmA 3 like ArmA 2 is a platform that allows modders to create completly different game modes that developers originally designed, also the game has a lot of devs attention. DLC-s like ZEUS make this game even more interesting and avilible even for non scripting gamer society. Only thing i wish to see in future ArmA 3 development is more DLC (no matter if free or not if it bring lots of new stuff) and Directx12 witch will help to improve performance.

review: Bad optimisation in the engine leads to FPS lag, meaning you need a pretty insane rig to run it, even tho you shouldnt have to. Has A LOT LESS content than previous Arma versions (Not counting community ofc). I enjoy the game, but the FPS issues (which cant be fixed because they have to re-design the engine) and the lack of conent makes it stale quite quickly. Edit: Due to some incredible community members, some missions are now actually playable. Wasteland by Sa-matra is very stable, as are some Altis life servers. System: i5 2500k @ 4,2ghz 16Gb RAM @ 1600Mhz GTX 660Ti OC'd With this, I get around 20-60FPS wether It's on low or ultra, it still runs the same.

review: I really want to like this game, but I cant. The games mechanics, graphics and the characters competency with his rifle is too far below the average shooter for me to enjoy. I find myself yelling at the game to just hold the gun still enough to shoot and find out where my impacts are. The character can not hold his rifle still, to save his life. Ive seen 90 pound women hold them better than the player's character. He feels totally unsupported, like he is floating in the air, even when laying on the ground. I'm fighting the character's complete lack of ability to hold the rifle still constantly. Any reasonably competent shooter can easily track a target from a prone position without needing to fight the rifle's weight to stay focused. The player never feels grounded. Zeroing feature is kinda cool if it made a difference. Ive shot a lot of rifles, and none of them behave like they should in this game. The game says that when shooting close, I should aim lower to compensate. The reverse is true in real life because of height of the sights over the bore of the barrel. If you imagine and draw out an arc, and you sight your rifle to the highest point on the arc, all other ranges besides the one you are calibrated at should be BELOW the highest point. This is of course excluding the fact that bullets don't travel in perfectly shaped arcs. A round could travel very straight and flat then gravity wins out and will drag the round to the ground very quickly before 200 yards, as is the case with the AK47. A rifle like the M16 will shoot a very flat arc to 300 yards and can even stay predictably flat enough to make accurate shots out to 600 yards without a problem. All of this feels like the game completely ignores or has wrong, so using a weapon system that uses a round I know well makes it difficult and frustrating when the rifle wont do what Im asking it to do. For a simulator that is bad, very bad. The game markets itself as a combat simulator, but I find myself fighting the controls so that much the whole "keep it simple stupid" philosophy of combat training sorta gets lost in having to press 3 buttons at once to make an accurate shot. Let alone assembling a drone and using it with any sort of practical use. I understand they want certain aspects of the game so a player feels like he actually has to do HIS job in whatever unit he is in, because everyone has their own roles to play in the war. However that isn't how the game plays. It would be one thing if the missions were objective based and if you are a drone pilot, your objectives in the campign would be different than say the medic, or support gunner. However your role changes from mission to mission, and sometimes even on the fly. This causes you to pause the game and read the field manual, so you don't crash the helicopter and get yourself killed, while in flight. Or sitting there like an idiot trying to figure out how to put a drone together so you can use it to spot a mortar team on the hillside. That complexity would be fine except if I only get a chance to play this game once a month or so, the the particulars of addressing the problem requires me to look them up again. So when I forget how to "switch to secondary sights on a rifle." It isnt a matter of pressing a button, but looking up which buttons to press in sequence. Hell I could have done that in real life with a simple twitch of the wrist, or adjusting my cheek weld. The game would play out smoother if you were to pick a class of soldier to play at the start of the campaign, and played missions with those roles, so you aren't finding yourself learning how to drive a tank when in the last mission you were on foot doing ground recon calling in air strikes. I get it, one hero wins the war on his own, but once again if you market it as a military simulator, I shoudlnt have to memorize and be profiecent at the entire game just to play the game, and do a complicted task maybe once or twice in the campagn. Pilots can play as pilots, officers can play as officers, and scouts can play as scouts. It also adds replay value playing the same missions from a different perspective, and learning a new job in the game. This game makes my eyes hurt. Im not sure what it is about it, but something about the lighting effects tends to cause me to have to stop and close my eyes for a few moments ever couple of minutes or so. The background blur is so bad I can't scan horizons and look for subtle out of place details of a sniper in the brush. Or look down a street without letting the game's blurry lighting effects to catch up with what Im trying to do, which is hunt the enemy. I thought maybe it was my graphics settings at first. No, its just how the engine is made. I'm not a fan of battlefield 4, but at least the game is clear, and I can predict ranges and bullet drop. Its no wonder Im squinting all the time, holding the gun up is often like looking down the reverse side of a telescope. Everything seems shrunk and distant, then "zooming" down your sights looks how it should have to start with. (especially bad with pistols.) All in all, I feel myself in the mood to play the game, only to find myself yelling at the screen for my guy shooting 15 rounds at a soldier standing upright and facing me presenting a perfect silhouette, and not hitting a damn thing because my rifle is floating in the air. If I survive that encounter I find myself looking up which actions to even look up in the field manual just to turn on FLIR in an APC, because I am now apparently a tank driver at night. Then I explode because the AI has to do none of this. So I go back and play something more satisfying like Xcom, or mechwarrior.

review: REVIEW FOR 'WIN' CAMPAIGN EPISODE This Campaign Episode was unfortunatly shorter than the rest, I finished it in 3 Hours and 24 Minutes. While throughout the short time you are presented with Interesting Scenarios and Action Sequences, These are overshadowed by Short Length and a Lackluster Ending. I guess we're waiting for ArmA 4 to continue this story. + Action Packed and Well Acted and Scripted + Update has Improved and Added Features - Unacceptably short length - Lackluster Ending

review: If your looking for a Good Mil Sim game then I suggest sticking with Arma2..Arma3 has seemed to have turned into a Role Playing game much like world of warcraft...mil sim servers are few and far between altis life dayz and the other role play aspects of arma3 have destroyed what the Arma series was meant to be..but I suppose BI needs to appeal to the masses. Its a well executed game..needs some tweaking but I am sure BI will update just as they did in Arma 2..just dont expect too much in the way of mil sim for what your going to pay for arma 3. Would I recommend this game? Depends..for someone who likes to role play like dayz and life games sure..but for anyone expecting what Arma 2 was..dont bother.

review: This is a combat SIMULATION... NOT a FPS. With that in mind: This game focuses on war/combat as a complete package. As opposed to something like Battlefront (a classis FPS where you are shooting/fighting constantly), here you may never even fire a shot on a given mission. I personally fire very rarely. You will spend time in transit to/from multiple objectives. Sometimes this will be in a helicopter, sometimes a truck, sometimes on foot. While there you may spend literally hours stalking/sneaking to avoid detection by groups of enemies that can kill you with a single shot. Yup. Just one. You can also drive a simply jaw-droppingly wide range of vehicles and equipment. You can pilot/ride in everything from fighter jets to tanks to cars top speed boats to even a mini submarine. The game is also extremely extensible, meaning that it is very easy to mod in almost any way you can imagine. While installing some larger mods may take some basic computer knowledge (find a folder, put a certain file in that folder, then specially edit another file, that sort of thing), many addons are as simple as visiting the Steam Workshop *in-game* and subscribing to new content. Everything else is automatic from there. Who will like it: People who like depth and details. You like to plan every aspect of your approach to get the best possible advantage. You like working together with other players (many missions are co-op against a deadly AI). Who should pass this up: People who like constant, violent action. While there are definitely times when you seem to be constantly embattled, this doesn't happen very often.

No but I do think that steam should lower the amount. This game is worth it but steam just needs to look at that because I was playing the free weekend and it should have been like $25 dollars. I at that time had $20 so maybe we should ask steam to make a free full edition weekend where you could download it and keep it after the weekend finished...

review: ArmA 3 is a good successor to ArmA2 with some great improvements to the engine, visuals, vehicles etc. Mainly I have played the Wasteland, King of the Hill and Epoch (Alpha) mods. King of the Hill being the most rewarding and enjoyable over all. I have only just dipped my toes into the campaign, however I will be doing more of it I think. With all the improvements to ArmA, you'll still get those good ole ArmA moments like clipping through walls/floors, and your vehicle exploding on contact with a weed or bush.

review: A great game, fun to play with friends. Honestly, I feel a bit ripped off by the lack of content provided by the developers, and the gameplay seems aimed at entertaining the Call of Duty/Battlefield FPS crowd. They continue to update it with new content, but it just doesn't hold my interest very long. Not to mention the many unrealistic features they added in to make it combat seem more "fluid and fast" If you are overflowing with $$$, and you feel like buying it, go ahead. I would not recommend buying it just yet.

review: Awesome graphics and plot but game's playability is very low. Controls are very hard to use. You can not change them in the way you choose. It is the worst game I ever played for 4-5 years. Really annoying just because of controls. There are universal keys like 'T' for chat or 'Y' for team chat, they are totally different. And another problem is that Bohemia uses the same strategy for their other products like DayZ. Another not recommended game for me.

review: This game is probably the least fun game I've played in a long time. It tries to sell itself as a military sim, but it's as much a military sim as minecraft. Wandering an empty island for hours until you get shot by some guy six miles away is not fun. Also, 60 dollar price tag? Games like Red Orchestra 2 are so much better than this and are much cheaper. You're money is better spent elsewhere.

review: This game is Arma 2 only with enhanced graphics on the same buggy ing engine that hasnt been optimized for Graphics cards.In Campaign mode is the place where your fps will always be its highest. Once you join Multiplayer the FPS will drop fast than a 1990's cellphone call in a tunnel. To truely enjoy the game you have to purchase a monster eight core cpu which can go for around $800 or even $1,000 And I'll be damned if i'm gunna spend that money on a cpu to play a $60 game thats really only worth $20. If you decide to ignore this, or any of the other negative reviews or buy into the lies of the  stains you call a positive review. Then I hope you enjoyed playing arma 1 cus thats what its going to look like if you want any decent performance. The game relies heavily on CPU's which will leave you at times skipping at times that leaves you feeling like your on a laptop with an integrated nvidia 9000GT I have two ATI Radeon HD5770's I was playing with one alone I get 12 FPS after switching to Crossfire the game gets maybe an increase of 1-2 fps. Metro 2034 Last light gets more performance on one 5770. Save your money and go buy something else its not worth the cash. Why you should spend your cash elsewhere. Same buggy CPU heavy engine as in ARMA 2 . Also somewhere you may see something about realistic bullet penetration and that sort of thing. I have shot on occasion several soldiers who have needed more than 9 shots before going down at ranges near of excess of 500 + feet or meters . And you know you hit them can they twitch their bodies at 90 degree angles. The game goes by meters, a meter is 3 feet more than a yard so do that math. So it doesnt have realistic bullet penetration. Again a lousy game Same graphics only with more bloom and water reflections. You can now swim underwater and have a 2 man submarine that is unarmed except for a laser pointer. Still experiences the same crashes and glitches as Arma 2 (ITS THE SAME ING GAME) Too many mods and generic mod servers Like Wasteland, basically Dazy without zombies still terrible.

review: I wanted to love arma 3. so very much. Its the military game i had been thinking about in my head for years upon years. open world. freedom. huge battles, huge armies tearing each other to bits as you either control a tank, chopper oir take part in an infantry skirmish. However thats exatcly what arma 3 fails to deliver! The shooting mechanics are fine, as the ballistics. The sound it complete trash, the guns sounds absolutly awfull. It will certainly be worth your time downloading the sound mod for these, made by some guy in his bedroom it completly trounces the vannilla sounds of arma 3 in every respect. Adding a much needed realism in that department (Bohemia please hire this guy) But back to the crux of what is wrong with arma 3. I realise this game is in beta still, and the main game campaign is unfinished. WHERE IS THE WAR!? every mission in arma 3 be it a user created scenario or the main campaign. Each mission is just a skirmish, a tiny bunch of AI controlled bots versus you and your squad. It lacks impact. it lacks excitment. At no point playing arma 3 was i immersed in what appeared to be a realistic military conflict. Now, this is 2014...planetside 2 an online multilayer game manages to have 2000 players on one map in an incredible seesaw conflict for control of the map...ITS A FREE TO PLAY GAME...why does arma 3 not manage this even in an AI controlled sp warzone? let alone a multiplayer arena. Is it engine limitations? WHY DOES ARMA 3 NOT HAVE A WARZONE MODE alongside its campaign and multiplayer. All i want to be is plonked down in a huge island wide conflict. able to choose one of many mission objectives and actually feel involved it something organic and dynamic! There are a few user created missions that attempt to create this but they fall short, something about this game makes it unable to run a huge conflict without causing serious serious clientside lag. Now ill mention the multiplayer...what a joke...its so laggy as to be unplayable. I dont know why either. There is something seriously wrong either with the servers, or there is something wrong with the way stuff is optimised and implemented in this game. Please note arma 3 has been released for a very long time now, ok yes its not full release. BUT MY GOD PLEASE FIX THE MULTIPLAYER BOHEMIA it makes your company look rediculous. dayz SA is in alpha and it manages to run 1000% better multiplayer arenas. Now my last qualm is the price. 60 dollars for something that has an unplayble mulitplayer and an unfinished single player????? HOLY @$%! My advice is very sadly. do not buy this game until full release :( and even then make sure it works properly or you may be wasting your money

Where do you start all the kinks of arma 2 have been cleared, the engine runs smooth... the animations even smoother and the optimisation is always on the Up and Up. throught out Arma's history it has been clearly building up to this. the Arma game to end all Arma games. IF you are considering Buying remember... this isnt a fast action shoot em'up (But sometimes it can be) this is tactical and stealthy. Also if you buy this game and need someone to play it with you ... Hit me and the 45th up :D

review: A good follow up to Arma 2. With updated graphics and smoother movements, certainly one of my favourite milltary shooterrs out there. However, I am missing the familiarity of guns that Arma 2 had with it's massive assortments of weapons and vehicles. Would definitely like to see more added on to the game on that respect. AI are more intelligent. Maybe too intelligent. However, with great game types like wasteland and an integrated steam workshop, it certainly delivers. Mods may also add on to the game the same way dayz and ACE did for ARMA 2.

review: Call of Duty's more educated and respectable older cousin. An FPS for the thinking man who appreciates the real life brutal realities of combat. This game doesn't grab your hand and guide you to its breast, this game makes you work for your entertainment. Treat this game right, take the time to understand its nuances, and never underestimate it's bite, and you'll have a much more rewarding experience than you can achieve with most FPS games. When a mission is carried out via your own strategic wit and whim, and hours are spent infiltrating and avoiding enemy patrols so that you can make it to that perfect firing position for your sniper, it really makes that one shot a lot more heart pounding than any round fired in any other military shooter. If you have ADHD, watch wrestling, appeared on Jerry Springer, think Call of Duty is a good game, and/or are the offspring of two genetically similar parents, you will NOT enjoy this game.

review: I would not say this game is worth buying at full price, but I can tell you that it's really fun nonetheless. There are a lot of bugs and it feels more like a retextured and updated Arma 2 but there are plenty of fun scenarios and multiplayer is very good. The game requires a really beefy computer to not run on  graphics so if you have a crappy computer and you don't want to see  graphics, then don't get this game. However, if you're up for an intense milsim, then get this game. Rate: 8/10

If you cant pay the normal 60 bucks wait till it goes for les( I got mine for 30 i think) I would call it a military simulation with a shooter twist. A great game thats lots of fun. You can be seriouse and treat it like its real life or just  around like i do most of the time and blow stuff up. If you liked Dayz in arma 2 there is breaking point wich i play and that is pretty good but can get a little frustrating. But over all 10/10 would buy again.

review: It's tough to review this game because Steam doesn't have a so-so category. The game is gorgeous even though it chugs on my rig that works great for any other game. So here's an easy way to review the game: Gameplay - 6/10 - The singleplayer elements... I don't play MP on this yet are really hit and miss. The weapon accuracy albeit accurate still leads to the AI being incredibly cheap. You can hide under bushes and the AI will shoot you from 2 miles away and you will definitely die, you shoot at them 20 times and you will maybe hit them once, but they seem like terminator robots that never go down. This can be incredibly frustrating because you'll get sent back 20 minutes to a way earlier part of the mission to do the next thing that I have a grip about. This game could definitely be called FOREST RUNNING SIMULATOR 2014. You will spend hours running in the forest and really doing nothing at these point to traverse to another part of the island, which is not too amusing when you do this and get hit once and then have to do it all over again. Lastly from the negatives is the control and interface, it's fun to learn and difficult to master is one thing, but this game has it's own language practically when it comes to the bizarre control set. Lots of bugs, but what game doesn't have a ton of bugs... especially games that come out of Eastern Europe. (Note: Not trying to be offensive, it's just that a large list of games from that region started with bugs galore except The Witcher) On the good side of gameplay is the fact that the extensibility of the game is HUGE! So many options, so many details and subsystems that it's honestly cool to see new options you have seen once after playing for a few days and spotting something new each time. The realism factor could either be a great selling point or loss to you. Warning if you are expecting Call of Duty, Battlefield, or even Operation Flashpoint... then you will more than likely dislike this game from a gameplay perspective. Graphics: 6/10 - The game is gorgeous in every single way. Navigating the underwater areas and the night settings are especially a sight to see. The only reason that the graphics score is lower than perfect is the fact that the animations are really hit or miss. This is also particularly clear when it comes to watching people talk during the gameplay. It's something that takes you out of the realism of the game. Sound: 4/10 - The voices and gun noises are pretty awful. They're definitely workable from a gameplay aspect, but sometimes you'll just hear something like one of the truck horns and think, did they record a boat horn mixed with a clown car? -------------- All in all if you added up the score of the game from this little review it would make the game overall be pretty crappy, but that's the beauty of the game so far. It's a work in progress being made by a team that really cares. Each time I play the game you'll see a note from the dev saying that they polished x,y,z or the community addressed the issue. Who knows in a few months most of my gripes may be solved by the devs, but regardless of all of that i'd recommend this game to any hardcore PC gamer.

review: I have played the predecessors for a long, long time and always thought of them (although crooked) the games to end all games for me. Then ARMA 3 came along, and now I know that ARMA 2 and especially ARMA were good games, but far from being the nearly perfect games I made them out to be. Im not on about realism, because it is a game after all. No game can ever come close to the real thing, and it would be a horrible game if it would. Think of realism as things like "take a bullet to the head in game and never be able to play ever again". What I AM on about is the level of immersion. That ARMA 3 can put you under real stress, can make you involuntarily shout out "INCOMING!" or make you race for virtual cover, make you flinch and instill fear for your virtual life. This time around, the experience is hindered by far fewer bugs and glitches than in any ARMA game ever. The inventory system has been reworked, vehicle and aircraft physics have been improved, the engine has been rebuilt from scratch. All while retaining a "feel" very much like ARMA 2. In essence, this game is the best ARMA ever released - improved on all fronts, no features lost in translation. On top of the technical aspect, even though this game hasnt been live for a long time now, it has already been modded, customised and improved by the vast, loyal and savvy community, to a degree that ARMA 2 saw about 2-3 years after its release - and there is far, far more to come. Can I recommend this game? Yes. Is it a game for everybody? No. But it is a game *everybody* should try. This has been the only game I have bought for full price (44.99 ) in years, and I dont regret a single cent spent. What are you still waiting for? get ARMA 3. It will be different from anything youve ever played. Except ARMA 2.

review: I absolutely love Arma 3 and would in every way recommend it to anyone with even a passing interest. There are somewhat valid criticisms of it which I will get out of the way right away, before getting into why the pros by far outweigh the cons. 1. Lack of Content - One of the more popular criticisms of this game is the lack of official content in the current build, especially compared to the amount of content in Arma 2. The two main factions currently (at the time of writing this review) have no fixed wing aircraft, armoured vehicles of different factions have the same turrets and weapons merely reskinned (artillery, anti-air and remote controlled turrets on smaller vehicles) and UAVs/UGVs are identical for all factions except for different camo patterns. 2. Performance - Another often heard criticism of Arma 3 is that it performs very poorly on some machines that it often should perform well on. Like machines with top-end graphics cards and powerful CPUs. Addressing these points one by one, I will say that while there is content missing that even I would have expected the game to have at release, it isn't a whole lot. Arma 2 did not have all the content it does today at it's release either, and much of it is inflated by there being separate entries for guns with different attachment combinations, so that the same gun with four different sight attachments would show up in a list as four different guns. As for the performance issues, the game runs perfectly fine on my middle-of-the-road gaming rig and runs at playable rates on the old low to mid-end machine of my best friend. The performance of the game on some people's high-end machines is in no way a sure indicator of bad optimization, especially when the same game runs great on other machines with the same hardware. Now getting to the real meat of the review. The visuals of this game are amazing, especially if you have the power to crank up the graphics settings. The lighting is great and makes the game look heavenly, especially at night. The texture quality is top notch, especially for foliage and I fully believe anyone interested in first person shooters, should experience one where you can freely roam a huge 270 square kilometer beautifully rendered island with a rendering distance of several kilometers. Other cool graphical features are the volumetric fog and clouds as well as rain that is rendered as independent particle effects for each raindrop in stead of a mere filter or overlay. Audio-wise the game could do with some improvements that are guaranteed to happen over time, if not by Bohemia Interactive, then by community modders, however overall the sound design of this game is really quite good as it is. The gameplay is where Arma 3 really shines over it's predecessor, as controls of your soldier have been improved to feel a lot more direct and fluid than in previous games, though the action menu still tends to limits how good the game can feel in certain situations. The inventory system has seen huge improvements from Arma 2 and is much more streamlined, without sacrificing flexibility. Vehicles are now physics simulated objects, which is a huge improvement over Arma 2's incredibly janky vehicle physics. Underwater gameplay is a really nice addition that looks amazing and gives mission makers a lot more freedom and variety to work with, when making missions and giving the players different approaches to completing them. Firing weapons in Arma 3 feel pretty damn good as most rifles have a good deal of kick to them, making them both sound AND feel powerful in stead of feeling like Call of Duty or Battlefield style bullet-hoses. Different weapon calibers penetrating diferent materials differently at different angles and distances gives both the shooters and the people being shot at a lot of things to think about and decide how to react to in every firefight, which is great in a game that is so decidedly slow paced as Arma is, compared to other first person shooters. If you get this game and want to dive straight into some fun Arma 3 gameplay, I suggest playing though the first episode of the single-player campaign first, to get acquainted with the fairly complex controls and spotting/shooting enemies at ranges that other FPS games would never expect you to. Once you feel somewhat at home in the game, I highly recommend looking for a multiplayer server running the Wasteland mission, which is sort of like a 3-way Team Deathmatch gamemode with survival elements, base-building, resource gathering and impromptu mini-missions against AI that all of the three teams are given and can undertake at the same time, each team trying to beat the others for the promised reward, leading to some very interesting clashes. So all in all, I can barely recommend this game enough, but to get some real enjoyment out of it, you'll want to run it on a decent mid to high-end rig.

review: Realistic warfare to a whole different scale is Arma's specialty, giving players the unique experience to play simulated firefights between either PvP, or PvE. For the most part, Arma 3 has a good community. Most people communicate with their teams to lead them into cities, complete objectives, or simply talking to a pilot to let them know where to drop you off. I do not recommend trying to play as a CoD player in this, trying to use a sniper in a city, or trying to quickscope. You'd probably die really fast. Anyway, there were only some problems with Arma 3, such as minor bugs (that are not that noticible; rare), or major bugs that haven't been fixed yet. Also, some players seem to take this game a little too seriously. I've seen many players who haven't played the Arma series and wanting to try to use vehicles for the first time. Some players don't allow them as (obviously, being a beginner) they're not good, or wasting precious vehicles that could have been useful. Overall, it's a great game, but don't take it too seriously and just remember it's a game, not real life. Graphics: 9.8/10 Sound: 8.5/10 Gameplay: 9.7/10 Community: 7.5/10 Overall: 8.9/10

review: I have to admit I was hating this game in the beginning. I couldn't understand why I kept dying. I couldn't get the controls down and everything felt WAY to complicated. Then a few weeks ago I decided to sit down and learn the game. As other reviewers stated this game is not Call of Duty or Battlefield. You have to be patient. You have to learn the weapons and vehicles. This game is worth every penny as long as you invest a few days to learn the controls. Add in Steam Workshop and other mods (Breaking Point is my favorite) and you have a fantastic war simulator.

review: ARMA II was one of my favorite games (and it still is) but ARMA III is just in a testing (Alpha) version and they upgraded everything which was bad in ARMA II (better physics, ragdolls, animations... and they even added cool new things, such as weapon modifications, uniforms, first aid kits and underwater life) the only bad things are bad optimization and the funny animations when you're climbing a ladder (I don't know why they left that in there unchanged, it was funny as hell back in ARMA II). There are some mods for it already and the game doesn't have even a month, so the modding community will be big, like it was for ARMA II I think. There's even a sandbox zombie mod! :D I really love the graphics, this is the most photorealistic game you can get (Crysis 3 has unrealistic lights). Audio effects are cool too, but not as cool as in Battlefield 3 for example. Gameplay is almost the same as in ARMA II, but there are some new things like your character's stances. I was messing with the editor for like 5 hours in a row and I did some interesting things. The editor has a new look, but works exactly like in the previous game. I think ARMA III will be ever more successful than it's predecessor and I'm proud of our Czech brothers for such an amazing game. My recension will change with the upcoming Beta version. Overall: 10/10

review: I loved (still love) Arma 2: CO and Arma 3 is a brilliant successor. They've added a lot of polish to the game, made movement feel much smoother, and really improved the graphics. With Steam Workshop, new content for the game is just a click away and there are some excellent user-made missions out there. Moreover, there are a ton of mods available which can change various aspects of the game. I've put more than 400 hours into Arma 3 playing and creating missions and that's just in single-player. I can't recommend the game enough to anyone who likes realistic, open-world shooters. It'll be installed on my PC for a long, long time.

review: Arma 3 is a good game and all that stuff but it the most glitchy and laggy gameplay in any game. one of the glitches is not getting into a vehicle but nonstop searching it for weapons so i had to give up a helicopter for that glitch. unless if you want to be realy mad at how you die in about 2 shots and have to giveup vehicles do to glitches thats fine but im sure nobody wants to die in 2 shots and loose about a hour of work getting guns then dieing from thirst or teamkillers / hackers.

review: I highly recommend Arma 3 if you're into Army games with a (high) sense of realism. You can make this game as awesome as you want yourself. Depending on which (modded) gamemodes you play or with who you're playing. I'm part of one of the largest Arma 3 clans out there (Joint Task Force 2) and it really adds to the experience, having a Tactical Realism based clan. Think of stuff like Basic Training, military rank structure, working with a chain of command, teamplay based on military tactics and manoeuvers etc. check us out over at

review: Highly polished Arma II with future weapons, new shooting stances, and vast detailed maps. Like its predecessor the Mod community makes for a highly customizable game experience now backed by STEAM WORKSHOP. WARNING: Some dedicated fan boys of the ARMA Franchise would claim this is a very smooth game, I feel while smoother than ARMA II it's still a far cry from being "entirely" smoothed out. The most popular game mode seems to be "Wasteland" which is DayZ with out zombies. As you can imagine new players often get camped and ed prior to even finding a weapon. Supposedely you can port ARMA II objects into ARMA III, I have not tested this yet, but that proves to be some what promising for custom map design.

review: Amazing level of control and realism. Great variety in gameplay when playing as different classes, with different weapons and vehicles. However, this game still has ye olde ARMA feel to it, meaning that occasionally you'll have to wait a decade to join a server, you suddenly drop to 2 FPS, or get lifted into the air. The amount of FPS you get also is kind of terrible I must say, but hey, it's a beta, and it'll get some kind of polishing before it's released, I'm sure about that.

review: Excellent sandbox simulation, but unlike others I will not say it is a total military simulation. vehicles and aircraft and their controls, pathfinding, etc. need vast improvement for this to even be considered a survey sim. however, ARMA 3 is an excellent infantry simulator and the vehicles and aircraft used as a supporting cast are sufficient. thrown in the community mods, game modes, and missions and nothing can beat ARMA 3. i just wish the grass was not so cheesy looking when you crawl though it, and the graphics were a bit more cinematic. i guess one cannot have everything.

The environments are stunning, the weapon & vehicle details so well done, the guns actually kick, and the voice acting and sounds immerse you into the amazing world of Stratis. With so much land (and now sea) you can really do any scenario on Statis. The modding community is already creating/porting amazing mods into Arma 3 and the community is great. If you want a real shooter that feels & plays great then Arma 3 is your game.

review: I play ArmA 3 since Alpha, it has changed alot since first builds all in plus. Its currently best game to buy if you think about Tactical FPS game, and also it isnt just that you buy ArmA and its all you get. ArmA 3 like ArmA 2 is a platform that allows modders to create completly different game modes that developers originally designed, also the game has a lot of devs attention. DLC-s like ZEUS make this game even more interesting and avilible even for non scripting gamer society. Only thing i wish to see in future ArmA 3 development is more DLC (no matter if free or not if it bring lots of new stuff) and Directx12 witch will help to improve performance.

review: Lemme tell you what i think about arma 3. ARMA 3 is a fantastic military sim game. The physics are great, the graphics are awesome and everything about it i enjoy especially the addons. It's a great improvement and i don't know why dayz isn't running on this amazing engine. The zoombies mod that i enjoyed is gone now thanks to bohemia and dayz. I hope you guys rot in hell. What i hate about this game, comes from a deep part of my soul and also a very external part of me too. The amount of dip and try hards and ing posers i come across rattle me bones like no other. Going into a server with "Spec ops" as your slot to choose to be makes me want to shoot my brains out. The moment i went into these servers felt all i heard was "SPEC OPS READY FOR PICK UP" "THIS IS SPEC OPS GOING INTO FIRE" "THIS IS SPEC OPS SUCKING  FOR CRACK MONEY" that last one was a joke but you can see my anger in this. So i ask in the chat bar that doesn't have a scroll up option for some ing reason, "are you guys in the military or have any of you served" and with a gust of wind that screams oh  here we go, it came "no, we have never served, luckily we have this game" my wtf face was not big enough to show how i felt. These  heads have no idea what it's like to be in combat, i don't know yet my self but i plan on knowing very soon, nor military tactics, nor anything of particular military from anyone not just these "spec op" dumbasses. anyway, i get out of this server cause at this point i am growing a giant vein on my temple because i am holding back my self tearing these guys a new one. "Alright" i tell my self as i decide to browse through servers. "ah, this one must be great, seal team 8" OKAY seriously, i get that you're a ing  and don't want to actually serve, but naming your ing server seal team # doesn't make you look cool. It pisses people off. I go into this server and ask if any served or serving. Noopee, seriously. what the  do you think you're doing? what part of being in a seal team do you ing know besides call of duty or some stupid ? okay, well there's alot of that. let me get to my closing statement. arma 3 is fun, i love the game graphics are nice but the mulitplayer is so un-optimized it drives me insane. Having a nice pc and trying to enjoy games but without devs optimizing their games or using 64bit gaming, EVEN THOUGH THE GAME YOU RELEASED IS A PRETTY HEFTY GAME TO PLAY baffles me. The physics engine is great, physx engine it's called from nvidia, it's some cool , too bad it doesn't look cool at 20fps and i am trying to drive but go right into a ing rock. physics are working though that some good . anyway. also the game feels stripped, like there's nothing compared to arma 2 regarding weapons and vehicles. I would not recommend this game if you have ever served/serving in the Military or you want something casual. If you have served or serving you will want to gut everyone. There's no point in playing a game where no one knows what they are doing and pretends to be some badass that they will never be except maybe online, but the pre pubescent or going through puberty voice doesn't sound like you want to follow them. The amount of posers and wanna be's ruin this game for me. oh and especially the "15th MEU" oh pretends to be a real marine MEU. LIke seriously these guys think they are Marines. Their website says how much of they follow Marines. they even pretend to have medals and shadow boxes. what the  is this . As someone working his  off to join a special group of people i can no longer play this game without getting rage. singleplayer is fun though. i like the single player. mods are nice, and i really can't say much else. I would and wouldn't recommend this game. It's up to you.

review: The enormity of the map is the foundation for the experiences that distinguish Bohemia Interactives flagship franchise. Its what makes radios, topographical maps, binoculars, and compasses practical equipment in an FPS. Its what allows for kilometer-long headshots and coordinated convoy raids. Its what makes using your eyes to spot hints of enemies muzzle flashes, tracers, gunsmoke as valuable as being a crack shot. The scale of Arma 3 dwarfs everything in the genre, including Arma 2. Altis, a keyhole portion of which is seen in these screenshots, is a Mediterranean island-nation assembled from ruins, airports, coastal villages, solar power plants, military outposts, salt flats, and tank-friendly scrubland. Its a variegated backyard for you to play war in, but whats more significant is that Armas landscape finally has the technology it deserves. 9.5/10

review: Arma 3 is easy to explain. Imagine arma 2. Now add proper stances to it, ALOT better performance, alot of fixed bugs (alot more introduced aswell) and on and on. Arma 3 is a good game for what it is. The main problem is: the devs are ing lazy, they didn't bother modelling lots of civillian cars like in arma 2, instead, 4 or 5 that just have different skins. About 1 tank per faction. 3 or 4 Helicopters and  me, only one ing jet. I mean thats ing lazy. The amount of content in arma 3 is ing embarrasing compared to the shear amount of content in arma 2. Bohemia Interactive have done a great job with all the new content etc. but this game should still either be in alpha, or very early beta. NOT a finished game. Overall if your reading this to see weather you wanna get this game or not, its down to you. If you want a game that runs and plays really well, if you can look past the laziness of the devs and the lack of assets, then get it. If you can't however, just stick with arma 2 until the devs actually do something about the lack of assets etc. Again, this game should be in late alpha - early beta. NOT a finished game.

review: While I love the Arma series, this game was not was I was expecting. When you make a game, you have a couple things that need to be set up to make it a game. 1. A setting - They created the island, and it was good, very large and open with a diverse landscape 2. The Engine - Everything works well, even the physics, which Arma 2 completely failed at. Movements are fluid, you got way better animations, so there aren't any complaints....until 3. Weapons and Vehicles - This is one of the most crucial points to add variety to a game, and I am sad to say that BI failed miserably. They created virtually nothing for the game's release, for what reason I don't know, but it aggravates me to no end. You have all the things in place, the tools for people to make their own missions, but there is no variety, same guns, same ammo, and a couple of vehicles. Look at Arma 2, even without the DLC, there was TONS of content to work with, and the DLC just added onto that. My advice? Keep up to date on the status of the game, and once the first DLC comes out, THEN buy it

review: This game has pretty good looking graphics. The options or configure menu could be hard to understand to some players. The controls are overcomplicated. Ragdoll physics is horrible. But the game is trying to be more tactical like,well its not tactical at all most of you enemies run out in the open like 'Hey! Look at me! Shoot me!'. Playing alone isn't to great but with friends you capture the whole experience of Arma 3. The maps are huge so you have to do lots of exploring,pretty cool if you enjoy exploring. The vehicles have their own controls maybe except the land vehicles and some other type of vehicles. The air vehicles are hard to control unless you played the rest of the Armas.(BTW still don't know how to use air vehicles). Is this a full release or a beta? I do not know it has plenty after plenty of bugs to fix. Like when that time I shot some one his body had an oversized neck the body itself had its body armor turned into a size of a pea. This game is 4/10 hard to recommend.

review: This is -the- tactical shooter. If you're tired of the often trite and rediculous "military" shooters out there, and want a more realistic simulation of military endevour, give this game a try. Not for the faint of heart or the incautious, it's by far the best military FPS experience I've had to date. That is not to say it isn't without it's faults or problems (touch on those in later on) but the overall experience, the sense of scale, and the frankly, the amount of fun I've had in this game are what make this game my go-to for tactical combat. PROs - Scale of the environment; you're not going to find anything remotely like this in scale, save possibly in WWII Online, which is comparitively more dated than this. The enviornments are huge, even on Stratis it takes considerable time to simply walk from one location to another. Both maps offer a good variety of cover, concealment, and terrain to fight in, from forested hills and mountains to underwater stealthy goodness. - Realism; What I mean by this is that the game provides fairly realistic expectations on human limitations, such as the amount and types of gear one can carry, fatigue, and the surprising turns of fragility and endurance of the human body. Marksmanship is important and vigilance is key in firefights. It's easy for the unwary to lose track of a target if you don't keep your eyes peeled and your rifle ready, creating a sense of tension in combat unlike most any other I've experienced. There are swells and lulls to it that speak to an environment that lends itself to a more realistic combat experience. - It's pretty; While not the top tier of graphics, this is certainly an accessible and sometimes stunning gaming experience. It takes a poet to describe the sweeping vistas that reveal themselves at the oddest moments. With your intense focus on the environment around you, you can be trekking to an objective location in multiplayer with some friends, and crest a hill to see a marvellous Mediterranean sunset over a quiet sea-side village. And there's a poignancy when that serenity is broken by an artillery barrage from the forward observer on the opposite hill. The character models can be customised in a way previous titles of this series could not, giving voice to the inner tactical fashionista (really, sometimes dressing in all-black gear just feels -good-). - Modding support; Mod support for this game is building slowly but surely, and for a few of my gripes in the CONs section, there are mods that help alleviate the suffering somewhat. As a niether here nor there sort of observation: The game interface is much improved over previous versions of the game, especially the inventory system, which is a marvelous improvement compared to the frustration generated from the previous title. However, it's not perfect, and especially the contextual menu needs some major tweaking and re-examination by BI. CONs - Optimization; the game could do with some. Settings I can use on most games with comprable graphics simply do not hold up in ArmA III, but it's rarely crippling. I still wish it'd be less of a struggle to have settings on a level that makes the game as pretty as it is, without a lagging frame rate. - Lack of choice; this applies more to gear and weapons, than anything. While the stable of available gear for use has been increasing gradually since the Alpha Supporter edition, there's still a surprisingly low number of choices for small arms and vehicles in particular. I'm hoping that the Campaign extensions will also continue to provide more variety to the in-game gear I have to choose from. - Dinky guns; It's a bit of a pet peeve, I'll admit, that some of the weapons feel weirdly underpowered in this. Perhaps its simply because I'm less used to using them, but a few weapons take more than half a magazine at short range to bring down relatively lightly armored foes with well placed shots. I'm looking at you, SMGs and 5.56 weapons.

review: I'm not sure wether I should recommend it or not but it's enjoyable so I will. The game was released unfinished. There were close to nothing to do in the game because of the lack of content. There's 2 factions in BLUFOR I think, and one in OPFOR, one in Independent unless I'm mistaken. There's no weapon variation, there's like 2 weapons per faction if even. Only independent have jets and it's just one jet with another variant of it. The lack of content is what completely ruins this game. The combat, however, is very smooth (unless your FPS is on 20 which it usually is unless you have an absolutely extreme gaming computer), well-made and convenient. There's 9 stances you can take, high stand, normal stand, crouching stand, high crouch, normal crouch, low crouch, sitting (while firing), lying down and lying on the side. There's also a combat pace and a running pace which is great. In the combat pace, you run slower with your weapon up so you don't have to walk to fire like you did in ArmA 2. I love the game for it's mechanics which are much, much more smoother than ArmA 2 but I always play ArmA 2 more because of how incredibly much content there is for it. Especially with ACE. The graphics are awesome aswell. The lightning, the textures and effects are amazing but they'll most likely drop your FPS drastically. Not sure if it's due to bad optimization or if it's because the maps are so huge and detailed. Also, Altis, the main map of the game, I've noticed is very popular and everyone talks about how it's 270km2 or something like that, but travelling from one side of the map to the other is only 20km and takes like 2 minutes by chopper which was kind of dissapointing. It's still a great map though with alot of nice places and things to do. To summarize: This game is really well-made and cool but when it comes to content and features, ArmA 2 beats it by far.

It gets dull and boring if you are alone (like any other game) but with friends the whole satisfaction is improved.

The character models can be customised in a way previous titles of this series could not, giving voice to the inner tactical fashionista (really, sometimes dressing in all-black gear just feels -good-). - Modding support; Mod support for this game is building slowly but surely, and for a few of my gripes in the CONs section, there are mods that help alleviate the suffering somewhat. As a niether here nor there sort of observation: The game interface is much improved over previous versions of the game, especially the inventory system, which is a marvelous improvement compared to the frustration generated from the previous title. However, it's not perfect, and especially the contextual menu needs some major tweaking and re-examination by BI. CONs - Optimization; the game could do with some. Settings I can use on most games with comprable graphics simply do not hold up in ArmA III, but it's rarely crippling. I still wish it'd be less of a struggle to have settings on a level that makes the game as pretty as it is, without a lagging frame rate. - Lack of choice; this applies more to gear and weapons, than anything. While the stable of available gear for use has been increasing gradually since the Alpha Supporter edition, there's still a surprisingly low number of choices for small arms and vehicles in particular. I'm hoping that the Campaign extensions will also continue to provide more variety to the in-game gear I have to choose from. - Dinky guns; It's a bit of a pet peeve, I'll admit, that some of the weapons feel weirdly underpowered in this. Perhaps its simply because I'm less used to using them, but a few weapons take more than half a magazine at short range to bring down relatively lightly armored foes with well placed shots. I'm looking at you, SMGs and 5.56 weapons.

review: This game is Amazing but does have its moments online co-op like getting shot through walls. But this game is well worth the money even though its in alpha its has so much to offer for the engine platform it uses is amazing. the graphics are outstanding for multiplayer. over all I would give the game a 7 out of 10 on Campaign and a 10 out of 10 on Multiplayer just because the Campaign is kinda hard in the beginning of it the Multiplayer you have a good community of players on the coop. I just love it i will keep playing this game until Bohemia Interactive comes out with Arma 4 if they do it will be hard to top this game and the cooperation of other players. they just need to add more stuff but its still in alpha.

review: To be honest like all previous bohemia games Arma 3 is filled with all sorts of bugs and unfinished / half complete stuff , however there is something unique about this game , something special that keeps people playing this game .Graphics , gameplay, campaign are pretty good even though they could be allot better. Even though there are other military sim's that are not bad at all , Arma titles hold the very top . Why, you may ask ? Its because Arma 3 provides the user with the tools to create whatever he wants. You finished the campaign ? No problem , here are hundreds of user created missions for you that you can now play. You dont like the missions ? No problem , here is the editor in which you can make ur own missions. You dont like the Arma 3 Factions/Weapons/Vehicles /Visual FX/Sound/AI/Realism ? No problem , here , download the hundreds of mods available for free. You want to create ur own content ? Here are the modding tools , you can do / create whatever you want with them. And this is what makes Arma 3 special .I am sure bright future awaits this game If the devs listen to the community and the community stays loyal to this game.Recommended.

review: Ok first off HOLY CRAP this game is sweet. If you cant pay the normal 60 bucks wait till it goes for les( I got mine for 30 i think) I would call it a military simulation with a shooter twist. A great game thats lots of fun. You can be seriouse and treat it like its real life or just  around like i do most of the time and blow stuff up. If you liked Dayz in arma 2 there is breaking point wich i play and that is pretty good but can get a little frustrating. But over all 10/10 would buy again. Seriously if your PC can handle it get it.

review: This game is very fun and open and alot of things to do. The singleplayer is very amazing with the stunning graphics and visuals. The audio is somewhat clear, but I can understand people clearly in chat and I can hear gunshots and explosions from a long distances and it is very cool. The multiplayer side is amazing and playing from the combat simulation with others to the Altis Life RPG addon and to the epic zombie survival mod of DayZ to surviving and fighting in the world of Wasteland. Last but not least, the editor for Arma 3 is very good, but very advanced to understand right away, just get used to the basic things of editing until you can create large scale battles with the editor. This game is not for the regular FPS players, this game is way more intense in my opinion than Call of Duty or Battlefield. You actually have to plan and use tactics to get the job done and the maps are very large and you can't run forever. So at first it might be irritating for new players, but you will get used to it. Very fun military simulator and it is very addicting. This game is a thumbs up! :D 12/10

The experience becomes even better if you have friends to play with. Even though the single player isn't very enjoyable, it's a huge leap from that of Arma 2. If you can catch Arma 3 on sale, I definitely recommend you buy it.

review: Disappointing on several levels. Essentially you're paying $60+ for an engine that mods run off. The mods that currently exist are pretty underwhelming, and aren't made by the studio. They have universally low production value, and there are only a couple that are played. The insulting part is the engine isnt even good. It's pretty slow no matter what settings it's on, and this is with pretty decent hardware. Maybe if you can get this game on super sale it would be worth it, but the amount of content in this game in NO way justifies the price

Unless they release proper mod tools, I would not buy until it drops atleast 50% in price.

review: I have to say, this game blew me away the first I tried it. Here's what I think of the game: Pros: -Realistic, if you get shot twice your dead, no regenerative health. -Editor allowing you to create your own missions. -Hard combat makes you think on how to complete said missions. -You don't always have to be the commander, or even fight. -Multiplayer gameplay can be intense and make you think even more than against the AI. -Makes you work with your team to actually get stuff done. -Actual terminal ballistics. -Booming mod community. Cons: -Hard to learn controls (If new to series) -Some minor bugs (This will go away hopefully after beta, so I'm not taking a point away for it) I can't think of any more. So, overall, I give this game a 10/10. EDIT: Just thought of 1 problem that affects a lot of people: Optimization issues. New score: 8.5/10.

review: I was an arma franchise fan, i played Arma 2 and even with it's faults i decided to buy arma 3 while it was in alpha. Initally i was impressed, the game looked decent for such a big map and all of the changes were progress in my mind, but that was in alpha and there is till was a lot of development to be done or so i thought. Cut to 8 months after full release and little progress was made. The game still runs terrible when in multiplayer, the game has constant lag spikes on nearly any server over 40 ppl in it. The content is still lower than arma 2 content on release and very basic thing are still missing. Much of the content the game does have is also not impressive, the 3 teams basically all of the same small arms and vechiles, especially blufor and opfor teams, with only small differences. Perhaps the biggest tragedy is that arma 3 doesnt even have simple "sim" features that many of its competiors have been using for years like weapon resting and delpolying bipods on lmg (ex Red Orchastra 2/RO2 and BF 2 and 3). Then to makes thing even worse and as a big srcrew you to the fans and customers BI decides to simatanously start developing Dayz while Arma 3 is no where near ready certaintly not for $60. If the fans of the franchise are honest with themseleves they will release that BI has simply done a cash grab on the consumer's wallet by launching an Alpha then not developing on it. While simatanously dividing their dev teams to work on the failed Dayz which most likley will have a similar fate of arma 3. Overall, Arma is not an absoulty terrible game i have over 500h+ in but i can not in honesty say its worth over $20, $30 tops, the bottom line is the game feels like a BETA now 8 months after release its just unexceptable and goes to show this "Early access" craze is more lilkey than not a way for unethical companies to profit off of empty promises and slow + lazy development.

review: Boring simulator 2014. Love feeling bored? Is your life not complete without pointless derision? Then Arma 3 is the game for you! You can take long walks with friends and talk about everything from the weather, the first time you got laid, or how you miss mom's home cooking. If you join a full server, and stay in it for 3 hours at a time...you do run the risk of eventually encountering enemy combatants. This occurence is rare but known to happen. Not to worry. You will die instantly and get to start the process all over again. So make sure that you read up on politics, sports, and current events so that you don't bore your online friends while on your long walks together. And for those having trouble figuring out the controls...LShift + Tab + R + T will tie your right bootlace, should it happen to come untied during one of your walks. Substitute R for L if its the left boot that comes untied first. On a side note, this game has a great online community. If you are new and need help...just ask. You will promptly be addressed and told to "Go **** yourself."

No but I do think that steam should lower the amount. This game is worth it but steam just needs to look at that because I was playing the free weekend and it should have been like $25 dollars. I at that time had $20 so maybe we should ask steam to make a free full edition weekend where you could download it and keep it after the weekend finished...

review: [UPDATE] Arma 3 is a great military sandbox game that consists of: Campaign User-made scenarios Multiplayer MANY different game modes DLCs that aren't too pricy (DLC buyers get items, while at the same time supporting the development of arma 3 ____________________________________________________________ Arma 3 in my opinion is a very realistic military simulator. You have a lot of weapons to choose from, and a lot of attachments. There are: 5 pistols 3 Sub-machine guns 10 different types of assault rifles 3 Designated marksman rifles 2 sniper rifles 3 LMGs That's not it though! Leave it to the developers to make even more guns coming up in the marksman DLC. Vehicles consist of: AFV-4 Gorgon AMV-7 Marshal Ifrit Hatchback HEMTT Hunter MSE-3 Marid Strider SUV Tempest Truck Quadbike UGV Stomper Zamak Go kart [Was added in as a joke, but people wanted it in the game as DLC content!] 2S9 Sochor BTR-K Kamysh CRV-6e Bobcat FV-720 Mora IFV-6a Cheetah AH-9 Pawnee AH-99 Blackfoot CH-49 Mohawk MH-9 Hummingbird PO-30 Orca UH-80 Ghost Hawk Mi-48 Kajman A-143 Buzzard A-164 Wipeout To-199 Neophron Speedboat Swimmer delivery vehicle [Submarine] Assault boat Think that's a long list? That's a lot, but not all! Each of the vehicles have their own unique features. ____________________________________________ I bought Arma 3 during the alpha stage, when it wasn't too great, however, Arma 3 has improved so much, and the developers have made a lot of tweaks/fixes.

review: Arma 3 is an ambitious title with a style of gameplay that will polarize players. The many complexities and amount of controls to master can be a daunting task for any newcomer to the series, while seasoned vets will feel right at home (for better or worse). There is a great deal to learn about playing Arma in a way that is enjoyable. The default campaign mode is passable, with all the tropes you'd expect to find in a military shooter, with a few surprises here and there. Missions vary in length and scope, ranging from short range patrols to full on combined operations assaults.

review: I highly recommend Arma 3 if you're into Army games with a (high) sense of realism. You can make this game as awesome as you want yourself. Depending on which (modded) gamemodes you play or with who you're playing. I'm part of one of the largest Arma 3 clans out there (Joint Task Force 2) and it really adds to the experience, having a Tactical Realism based clan. Think of stuff like Basic Training, military rank structure, working with a chain of command, teamplay based on military tactics and manoeuvers etc. check us out over at

review: Highly polished Arma II with future weapons, new shooting stances, and vast detailed maps. Like its predecessor the Mod community makes for a highly customizable game experience now backed by STEAM WORKSHOP. WARNING: Some dedicated fan boys of the ARMA Franchise would claim this is a very smooth game, I feel while smoother than ARMA II it's still a far cry from being "entirely" smoothed out. The most popular game mode seems to be "Wasteland" which is DayZ with out zombies. As you can imagine new players often get camped and ed prior to even finding a weapon. Supposedely you can port ARMA II objects into ARMA III, I have not tested this yet, but that proves to be some what promising for custom map design.

Then a few weeks ago I decided to sit down and learn the game. As other reviewers stated this game is not Call of Duty or Battlefield. You have to be patient. You have to learn the weapons and vehicles. This game is worth every penny as long as you invest a few days to learn the controls. Add in Steam Workshop and other mods (Breaking Point is my favorite) and you have a fantastic war simulator.

review: ARMA II was one of my favorite games (and it still is) but ARMA III is just in a testing (Alpha) version and they upgraded everything which was bad in ARMA II (better physics, ragdolls, animations... and they even added cool new things, such as weapon modifications, uniforms, first aid kits and underwater life) the only bad things are bad optimization and the funny animations when you're climbing a ladder (I don't know why they left that in there unchanged, it was funny as hell back in ARMA II). There are some mods for it already and the game doesn't have even a month, so the modding community will be big, like it was for ARMA II I think. There's even a sandbox zombie mod! :D I really love the graphics, this is the most photorealistic game you can get (Crysis 3 has unrealistic lights). Audio effects are cool too, but not as cool as in Battlefield 3 for example. Gameplay is almost the same as in ARMA II, but there are some new things like your character's stances. I was messing with the editor for like 5 hours in a row and I did some interesting things. The editor has a new look, but works exactly like in the previous game. I think ARMA III will be ever more successful than it's predecessor and I'm proud of our Czech brothers for such an amazing game. My recension will change with the upcoming Beta version. Overall: 10/10

review: Arma three fits into the modern FPS category very poorly, its not a bad game its just not CoD, a better category would be TFPS, Tactical First Person Shooter, cause thats what it is, its also a very fun and challenging game.

review: I loved (still love) Arma 2: CO and Arma 3 is a brilliant successor. They've added a lot of polish to the game, made movement feel much smoother, and really improved the graphics. With Steam Workshop, new content for the game is just a click away and there are some excellent user-made missions out there. Moreover, there are a ton of mods available which can change various aspects of the game. I've put more than 400 hours into Arma 3 playing and creating missions and that's just in single-player. I can't recommend the game enough to anyone who likes realistic, open-world shooters. It'll be installed on my PC for a long, long time.

review: Great gameplay, great visuals, sounds, and the two new islands are frankly wonderful and huge. In my opinion the most noticeable improvement since Arma 2 is that we are now evolving into some realistic and visually credible open world, as opposed to the narrow places kinda looking like more or less similar "checkpoints" in previous games. The gameplay adjusts extremely well to the new terrains, making Arma 3 something closer to an actual simulation than "just" an advanced FPS with "milsim" elements into it. However, it is impossible to talk honestly about Arma 3 without telling what hurts most: the lack of vehicles (planes notably, but not only), the lack of weapons and few annoying Ai pathfinding issues (sometimes even on places where all should normally go well). That being said, I personally can see an insanely great potential behind Arma 3, and the way it will continue to evolve will in my opinion probably make it simply one of the best game ever created. All it needs is some more time to grow up.

review: Definitely the best military combat simulator to date ! Simply a TRUE simulation of combat. The Pros: -Complete combat simulation(Physics taken in account at every bullet,Very realistic movement system and an extremely realistic commanding system) -Mission/Scenario Editor:Make every imaginary scenario real in the huge sandbox that is ARMA III,Which means that you get all the tools and the ability to make missions by yourself and play them afterwards.Is it pitting 100 jets of BLUFOR(friends) against 100 jets of OPFOR(enemies) and watching them fight it out as a civilian caught in crossfire or right in the action as a soldier,Or just spawning a vehicle and exploring the huge sandbox ? Yeah you can do anything ! -Huge sandbox..and when i say huge i mean HUGE.Extreme probably one of the biggest in gaming. -Steam Workshop !!! Simply the ability to upload your realistic or crazy missions online for others to share,or download masterpieces by scenario "artists" of ARMA -Mature,realistic and engaging multiplayer ! No whiny 10 year olds.This is the real deal.An engaged community with a lot of experience in the game and well-built servers The Cons: -Very heavy for your system ! Even with a high end system it will still flinch a bit on very high settings.It's the price you pay for the huge sandbox.But it's worth it ! -Lack of content at the moment.Yes at the moment you are given the huge sandbox but barely half of the stuff you had in ARMA II to play around.This involves player models,guns,vehicles etc.Though as the game goes on the developers add content periodically so no worries,though do not expect it fast.Patience over all ! -It's a hard game to get into and it targets certain audiences.What do i mean ? Well the game is overall complex so if you're looking for a game to quickly jump into ARMA III (or any ARMA in this context) is not suitable.It requires enough of your time.Next if you're looking for an alternative to games like battlefield,COD etc.You're looking at the wrong game,this is not your generic FPS this is a Military Simulation. -----Verdict|| At the moment my rating is 8/10,a good game but feels prematurely released with the lack of content ! Also not for the generic user/gamer,and not for the owner of a mediocre or weak pc.

review: Gameplay is perfect, the idea is perfect. But expect low fps ( even on high end pc's ) Some times my gpu load drops below 20% this happens on low to ultra settings. My friends have the same problem. It happens in the city;s. Not in the open. Looks like this game can't be fixed cause the problem ik the engine were the game is build on. The only fix is a entire new engine. Like they are going to do with dayz standalone. I get 75 fps average but drops which are like in the 20's If you can live with fps drops to 25 buy it. The gameplay is the best part of arma 3. The sound is below average. Not the quality but direction of the sound is coming from

review: ArmA 3 is a good successor to ArmA2 with some great improvements to the engine, visuals, vehicles etc. Mainly I have played the Wasteland, King of the Hill and Epoch (Alpha) mods. King of the Hill being the most rewarding and enjoyable over all. I have only just dipped my toes into the campaign, however I will be doing more of it I think. With all the improvements to ArmA, you'll still get those good ole ArmA moments like clipping through walls/floors, and your vehicle exploding on contact with a weed or bush.

review: A great game, fun to play with friends. Honestly, I feel a bit ripped off by the lack of content provided by the developers, and the gameplay seems aimed at entertaining the Call of Duty/Battlefield FPS crowd. They continue to update it with new content, but it just doesn't hold my interest very long. Not to mention the many unrealistic features they added in to make it combat seem more "fluid and fast" If you are overflowing with $$$, and you feel like buying it, go ahead. I would not recommend buying it just yet.

review: Awesome graphics and plot but game's playability is very low. Controls are very hard to use. You can not change them in the way you choose. It is the worst game I ever played for 4-5 years. Really annoying just because of controls. There are universal keys like 'T' for chat or 'Y' for team chat, they are totally different. And another problem is that Bohemia uses the same strategy for their other products like DayZ. Another not recommended game for me.

review: This game is probably the least fun game I've played in a long time. It tries to sell itself as a military sim, but it's as much a military sim as minecraft. Wandering an empty island for hours until you get shot by some guy six miles away is not fun. Also, 60 dollar price tag? Games like Red Orchestra 2 are so much better than this and are much cheaper. You're money is better spent elsewhere.

review: This game is Arma 2 only with enhanced graphics on the same buggy ing engine that hasnt been optimized for Graphics cards.In Campaign mode is the place where your fps will always be its highest. Once you join Multiplayer the FPS will drop fast than a 1990's cellphone call in a tunnel. To truely enjoy the game you have to purchase a monster eight core cpu which can go for around $800 or even $1,000 And I'll be damned if i'm gunna spend that money on a cpu to play a $60 game thats really only worth $20. If you decide to ignore this, or any of the other negative reviews or buy into the lies of the  stains you call a positive review. Then I hope you enjoyed playing arma 1 cus thats what its going to look like if you want any decent performance. The game relies heavily on CPU's which will leave you at times skipping at times that leaves you feeling like your on a laptop with an integrated nvidia 9000GT I have two ATI Radeon HD5770's I was playing with one alone I get 12 FPS after switching to Crossfire the game gets maybe an increase of 1-2 fps. Metro 2034 Last light gets more performance on one 5770. Save your money and go buy something else its not worth the cash. Why you should spend your cash elsewhere. Same buggy CPU heavy engine as in ARMA 2 . Also somewhere you may see something about realistic bullet penetration and that sort of thing. I have shot on occasion several soldiers who have needed more than 9 shots before going down at ranges near of excess of 500 + feet or meters . And you know you hit them can they twitch their bodies at 90 degree angles. The game goes by meters, a meter is 3 feet more than a yard so do that math. So it doesnt have realistic bullet penetration. Again a lousy game Same graphics only with more bloom and water reflections. You can now swim underwater and have a 2 man submarine that is unarmed except for a laser pointer. Still experiences the same crashes and glitches as Arma 2 (ITS THE SAME ING GAME) Too many mods and generic mod servers Like Wasteland, basically Dazy without zombies still terrible.

They didnt really bother on the whole optimization thing, i guess its too mainstream to optimize your game. Im running a Phenom Quad Core @ 2.8Ghz, 8GB ram, and a Radeon 7770 and i have to put this game on dead low settings just to make it even possible to play. That is just ing ridiculous, when these specs allow me to play any other game at high settings. I loved Arma 2 and arma 3 improves on the series so much but the amount of power it takes to get into a decent size game just is not worth its price tag.

review: ARMA. The most respected Mil-Sim series to date. Serious play, that's the objective. "Fun" isn't a word I would use. It's not casual, you simply can't hop in, play 15 minutes, and then hop out. The enjoyment comes from finding a server and getting to know people. Playing with them when you take on hour long missions, that's the enjoyment. First thing I have to say really, which I almost forgot about, IT'S REAL SCALE. The "maps" really should be called environments. You can't drive from one side of the island to another in minutes. The battlefield is really a battlefield. While most modern games focus on a small segment of a city, town or something, ARMA is about the openess making you sniper bait. You have to look hard for hostiles, they could be shooting at you from a hill across the valley. Performance. Was it terrible the first few days after release. Even still, AI seem to cause a drop in FPS even though they are far away. This isn't latency, this is pure frame for frame output. Never really understood how something unoptimized got pushed out. That being said, they follow Valve's ideas and push out updates for free. I play with a GTX 560Ti and Core i7 870. CPU matters, GPU matters. i3 wasn't up for the task, even with a 4GHz clock. You need an i7 or 8-core AMD heat monster to play with details. If you can push your rig, you get to see things that many don't get to see. N00bs will have a large hill to climb in regards to learning the game. 7/10

Its now Christmas and and whilst there has been other updates for multiplayer, the final 2 DLCs that add the missing single player campaign are no where in sight.... It will probably be years before we see them and the fan boys will consider that good service.... Personally I do not.... My advice... save your money for something else.

Endless mods packs,maps,mission and game modes! You can just can do there almost anything that refers to war and military simulation and even more than that,Starting from making missions in the editor and playing with friend,playing on public server or even joining a clan that suits you,joining a PVP server as king of the hill,free for all or just any other pvp modes also if you feel for some role play there is also some from that as well!! As i said game of endless contact that keeps expanding and getting new thing while thats being created only by the community there are also the devs that are keep updating and making the game better. As you can see i Realy recommend buying this game,worth it! :)

If you're on the fence i suggest you just buy it. There really is a community for just about everyone in Arma.

Most fights take place at 100m+ distance, weapons are laser-like accurate, and the smallest map is about 5x the size of Battlefield 3's largest map. Comes with a robust mission editor and SPLENDID tactically realistic screenshot simulator (heh), the graphics are unbeatable. The campaign is pretty nice as well. +Great graphics. +Great infantry controls. +Interesting campaign, even if the storyline sucks. +Robust mission editor. +Modding tools. +Lovely aircraft sound effects, good vehicle controls. -Hates your computer, doesn't want to run well. -AI is . -No weapon resting on random objects. -Campaign ending was a cliffhanger.

review: Arma 3 does not have time to teach you how to play it. It does not have time to help you find someone to play with. It lacks the common decency to provide a story, of any kind, at release. Bohemia Interactive's sandbox military simulation series began life in 2001 as Operation Flashpoint: Cold War Crisis before the developer retconned its own title, renaming the series Arma. Updating the game for modern PC players was a tall order, and after four long years of development Arma 3 still isn't done. Bohemia Interactive made the decision to release it anyway. Arma 3 may be the most challenging, and the most rewarding, online shooter I have ever played. But it's missing key components  most damning of all a single-player campaign. As a result, it feels more like a huge demo than a finished product.

review: I would recommend the game as played with friends. Campaign alone for example is ing pain in the . The AI companions are  and enemies seem to be at most points superhumans. I mean they aim ridicilously well and they see even the slightest movement in a bush from one click away. I mean, seriously? Then you drop player alone in the middle of these superhumans. "Fun, eh?" Well yeah, if your ing physics would actually work and the forest and bushes would ACTUALLY COVER SOMETHING. I played OPF series from the start and ARMA series from the start, but this campaign and the AI in it is the absolutely worst. But in the other hand when played with friends (with A LOT OF FRIEDS) it is a good game. Player versus player massive multiplayer matches are fun. Their little ing  campaign is not.

review: So this one is a weird one. On the one hand this game can be an amazing amount of fun whilst playing several different mods already integrated into the system. It is some of the most tense fun ive had in a strategic FPS. The game also looks pretty dang good, On the other hand this game screams BETA, with bugs a plenty lack of many features that was avilible in arma 2. For example bi-pod integration still hasnt been going in. That alongside the DLC being added even though the game is extremely unpolished. Simply put: arma 3 is great but also a big dissapointment from me. 6.5/10 p.s performance is still a huge problem for many people so make sure you can run it!

review: I have played this game for around 130 hours now and i just extremely enjoy it. Here are some pros and cons. + In-depth combat + Realistic + Infantry, Ground, Water, and Air combat + A  ton of mods + A  ton of custom missions + All the DLC is basically free. (every new feature will be available for everyone. While you cannot drive certain vehicles, you will be able to ride them as passenger. And when there will be new features like the ability to slingload cargo, you can do it as well without paying for the DLC.) - The game doesnt run that well, even on the highest-end machines you most likely won't get more than around 50 fps. - There arent that much servers, gamemodes like Altis Life seem to have taken over the server list, resulting in a low amount of co-op missions. So expect to bring friends to this if you would like to play missions online. - The game's performance is heavily decided by the server. If the server laggs you will not only get lagg, but a low framerate as well. Here are some final ratings as well: Gameplay / Fun = 9/10 Replayability = 10/10 Performance = 6/10 DLC = 8/10 Servers = 5/10

review: A well made military simulator with a great community. The game puts you right in the action during those tense moments when the bullets flying around you could kill you in one or two hits, making every battle decision worth thinking over. Missions with a team could never be more realistic then when you are just a band of gamers who have never met before, hunched over your computers and just barely making a dent in the OPFOR forces. Even when you are on the move to the action, the game still keeps your attention. The moments when you are completely oblivious, then suddenly ragdoll to the ground with the respawn screen popping up really teach you to be aware. Overall, ArmA III is an amazing game that made a lasting impression on me, considering I'm new to the series. Originally buying it to play Altis Life, I soon found the rich treasure trove of content this game holds.

review: ArmA 3. Game where you need instincts turned ON! In this game when you are in team. You need to work as a team. Leaving your teamates = death. In this game there is no 3 seconds behind wall and fight again. No! When you are shot, you need to heal yourself, conserver ammo. Who loves games that are hard, but giving you a big satisfaction. Then buy ArmA 3. If your bored waiting 3 secons behind cover and go to fight. Buy Arma 3. Map' (there are 2 island) is that huge that even maps of BF with CoD are 1/4 size of it.There are many weapons, vechiles, armors. This is called War! Do you know defition of War? No? I will tell you. It's ArmA! <3

review: After the great Operation Flashpoint (Now Arma: Cold War Assault) the first two ArmAs where not THAT great, but still very good and I enjoyed playing them for a long time. Arma 3 is my favourite part of the trilogy, thanks to a good and thrilling campaign (much better than CoD or BF) and the ArmA formula, that perfectly works now. AI does what you want, their aim is very good and they are very helpful. Enemy seeks cover and is a real threat, which makes the missions very thrilling. Like in the first three Rainbow Six or the first Ghost Recon. The campaign feels very tense, like Operation Flashpoint or the Addon Resistance and I really enjoyed it. The game runs perfect on my two year old PC and it is sure beautiful. The sound is also very good and the rifles dont sound like toyguns which adds to the war atmosphere. Voice acting is great too. The controls are a bit difficult to master at first if you havent played the other games of the series, but you get there with a little practice. The new item system is also very good and now you can quick and easy change weapons, put attachments on your rifle or grab some other gear. Overall this game is one of my favourite games of all time and its a true masterpiece and thanks to the community you have tons of content for free. Get it and enjoy it! :-)

review: A nice game, but not optimised for AMD-multicore users. I'm a big ARMA fan, but its unplayable on my PC. (5-20 FPS) AMD FX-8120 Black Edition GTX780 8 Gb RAM Probably the game uses one core most of the time. There are a lot of such called "tweaks" but they all have the placebo effect. Please Bohemia, fix it. When you have an decent Intel processor, this game runs better. Still thumbs up for the game.

review: This is my first time playing the Arma series and I must say this game has changed my perspective of military-style FPS games. The realism is phenomenal and it keeps me coming back for more. Huge learning curve when trying to remember all the commands associated to the game which can get frustrating at times but once you get handle on those it's a lot easier. Outside of that, this game has something going whether it's the close-to-reality gameplay or all the other mods you can discover or the required teamwork needed to be succesful in crushing your opponent. Hands down my favorite game currently in my library.

review: Absolutely love this game so far! Spent hours and hours only on A3Wasteland and I have yet to try other mods with friends! Optimizing the game for good FPS is a little tricky (considering I'm running 2x 970s in SLI and a 4790k...) but once you hit the sweet-spot in the settings menu, you are ready to go. Like any other games by Bohemia Interactive, it takes a while to grasp the controls and over-all feel of the game. Having previously played over 400 hours of Standalone, I thoroughly enjoy the vehicle and base-building aspects of game modes like A3Wasteland (Atha & DADDY) which is a hell of an experience when playing in a small or even large group. I recommend the [AMG] A3Wasteland Par Antha & DADDY server as I have enjoyed every second on that server. Overall: 9/10.

review: Bohemias gone to immense effort to create real, immersive environments for Arma 3. Across two sprawling islands youll find all kinds of terrain, from salt-flats to forests to stretches of rocky coastline. Even without a directed experience, just spawning into those maps is a pleasurable experience, letting you explore and discover some amazing virtual places. Arma 3 is also that rare  these days  game that will push all but the most powerful PC hardware. It looks amazing even on older systems, but if you want to crank it up at eye-bleeding resolutions youre going to see performance loss.

review: One of my favourite Games ever: definitely my favourite shooter, Almost all of my hours have been placed into Wasteland survival and just practising my helo skills - If you are to pick this game up be aware that there is a steep learning curve and practically every key has a function. I've put 100's of hours into many aspects of the game, and i've still only scratched the surface. One thing i'm eagerly anticipating is the arrival of the 2017 mod which is a Dayz esce revamp of the game, focused more so on surviving then Wasteland.

review: ArmA is an awesome game for anyone who is annoyed by all those mainstream shooters and would like to take on a challenge. It is also great for anyone wanting to get involved into modding! I highly recommend it! It's one of the most fun games to play I have seen yet! Now, I know ArmA has it's flaws, and the longer you look at it, the more you find where you can say "Hey! That could have been done better!" or "Why didn't they implement it? It's a simple feature". But when you look at the good parts of the game, you see that those outnumber the bad stuff, really much. Facts regarding above mentioned: -A3 Dev Team: 60 ppl (compare: DayZ Dev Team: >100 ppl ; explains bugs, missing stuff) -A3 used new content (A2's models were ~5years old, from BI's cancelled Game#2; explains "lack of content") -A3 was meant to be "ArmA Futura" (explains future, and "unrealistic" setting) -Source:

review: I have been looking for a game like ArmA 3 since I started with shooters. I always thought Call Of Duty, or Battlefield 3/4 was the most simulated you could get without really going to war. This game is war. This simulator requires players to really try, it is not a run and gun game, you do that, you die. You need to be tactical, aware of your surrondings, and be prepared for anything, from a fireteam of men, to a sniper team, to tanks sitting on the hilll line. Everything about this game is amazing. Grapihc are awesome, if you can run them on normal or higher, the AI, and ragdolling could use some work. One con of this game is the AI, sometimes there smart, sometimes there dumb. They can get hit with a grenade at point blank range, break there legs, lay down and bandage, then get up and run away. Over all, 20/10, would recommend to anyone who wants a good shooting simulator.

Girlfriends dumped us, failed out of school, in debt to the government. Now I am living the life, got ourselves some vehicles, a warehouse, started a gang and are now ruling the streets with a force. Enough so that now instead of just blasing " Da Police," we are literally ING them. 11/10

The recorded voices for commands and such are more lively and smoother. NPC Dialogue or qeued dialoge seems more in-tone with the situation. Command voices for specific objectives run smoothly, and actually sound more pleasent. Bohemia Interactive really showed what they can do this time. 5/5

review: I have heard many things about this game such as its poorly optimized or it's too laggy. Yes it is poorly optimized in some situations but when it comes to graphics, knowyour computer specs and dont argue when it lags because you bought the game without looking at your computer specs and noticing their bad. In my opinion this game is very fun. It is a very realistic game because crashing a car that your in will hurt you. Getting shot in the head will kill you. When sniping there is bullet drop. I love this game not only for its graphics, but mostly for the gameplay. I will note that I reccomend having friends to play with on the game because it's not so fun alone. Well at least there are some nice people in the game, others willbe totlal douches as a teamate. I love to play gamemodes such as King of the Hill, Wasteland, and Battle Royal but not so much. I will rate this game a 8.25/10 due to the lag even on low setting. Also if you have the settings too low for your computer, the game will lag, I can play this game at 50FPS on ultra settings.

review: I will rate this game very 5 ways VERY SPECIFICLLY: 1. 5 points for physics/ballistics (very life like) 2. 5 points for gameplay/style (if your looking for that real gritty down to earth COMBAT experiance this is your game) 3. 4 points for diversity ( from weps, vehicle, guns, its not too much and not too little. just right although perhaps a few more rifles) 4. 4 points for tactical (in order to be succesful you must work as a team in this game, i didnt give it 5 because of the lack of communication quality between squads) 5. 1 point for optimization( HORRIBLE HORRIBLE optimization. Good or bad pc we all basically get the same level of performance wth higher end pc's pbvoiusly getting a LITTLE TINY bit better performance) this is the major flaw which can kill this game for some. FORTUNATLY for ME i have a pretty powerful rig so i can opt out 31-37 fps in cities with 75+ people online. which in all honesty is RIDICULOUS but boehemia is what it is. MY HONEST OPINION: If you sick of disney-like run and gun war games liek BF4 or COD and want a more real play experience \, i'd reccomend this game HIGHLY. +=+WARNING+=+ If you think you are going to get amazing graphics AND above 40 FPS (LOL) you are either nuts or rich. You WILL need the TOP OF THE LINE n i mean at least $2500 rig to run this game MAX at 60fps. but you can still run it at Mediumhighish and hope to get 30fps. well good luck and make the best descision.

review: Key moments in arma 3: I drove my tiny SUV infront of a much large truck and watched it spin off the road and crash, causing it to explode. I was being pushed around by a large army truck telling me to "f*ck off this is my airfield". So naturally, I got my truck, punctured his front wheels and drove off as he helplessly tried to shoot the back of my car. Was playing on an altis life server, I just spawned in and saw a cop car drive up next to me and two cops walked out pointing their guns at a rule-breaker. They left their car door open, I couldn't help myself. I continued to get chased by at least 3 police vehicles and eventually a helicopter until my poor driving skills caused me to crash and burn. The police chopper didn't benefit much, it tried to land near me to arrest me but its tail hit a building and the heli crashed. Good times. 10/10 - Was bad at arma. Then I got a tank.

review: Arma 3, another great hit after the Arma 2 from Bohemia Interactive. Great open-world game. Graphics are quite good, with the gameplay and game mechanics. Another feature for this game it is a huge target for modders. Contains many fun modes, as well many co-op modes and multiplayer modes. One of the more popular is the Battle Royal mod. And also the campain is very interesting. On the other hand, the bad things are mostly the optimisation. It's open-world and good graphics come at a heavy price. Takes a good computer to have a full expirience.

review: I have now been playing ARMA3 for a few weeks or months (Time flies when you're having fun) and it is one of my favourite purchases on Steam. I had ARAM2 and AO (then modded Dayz), so i figured, Why the hell not. For the past 5-10 years i have been more so a fan of multi-player gaming over single-player, thought i thought to myself, i will try this one single first, mainly due to the fact i wanted to know how smooth it ran. Graphics up pretty much full, played it and had an average framerate more than 30FPS, so all is good. I have a little play of single player and start to pick it up. Game looks great. Few Km of open sandbox.Can't complain. I try joining a server. Stratis Wasteland. 70 players, smaller map then the main one. (19.3km or something i think). Spawn in and streight away i head some explosions and firing. Luckily enough on my first go online, i managed to take out the two guys firing and loot a vehicle. Nice rifle and a nightstalker scope. I just sat in a bush, my sights scimming around and taking out the odd players 1 by 1. Night time comes, Change scope to thermals. Beautiful. Hiding up a hill, sat in a bush, with a thermal scope and another 2 clips if ammo to use. I felt how sadistic i had become. Beautiful. This was just wasteland mode. However there are many other modes. Altis RP i would say is the most populated. A role play island where a player will need to gain licenses, buy weapons, vehicles. Basically it's what GTA online would be like. I reccomend picking up some scenarios from the workshop, such as Whole lotta altis and whole lotta stratis. as we as some of the mission generators. If you're amazing at CoD. Don't expect to be amazing at this. This is a real game and does require a lot of skill and thought. No running in expecting to kill 30 in a row.

review: I don't think I enjoyed Arma At first because I had to overhall the pc,Not the biggest fan of low fps. After I achieved +30 fps constantly, I was in love with this game. Coming from HL mod CS, dedication to a game is at my heart and this now holds the title as my current game with 2k hrs and counting. And just remember the Wiki page supported by Bi-studios if you get lost, nothing is exluded down to additional memory allocators and how to use them Just a thought, if you plan on those jumping no scope flick shots, rememer this is a military simulator, Not DukeNukem Meets Modern battle field where rewards come to those who out smart and out maneuver their opponent.

ShackTac mods, including STHUD, STGI, STNT, STACRE Volume, ST Bunnyhop, ST Interact, ST Map Autobrightness, ST Idle Anim Fix, ST Contour Enable RH M4s and HLC weapon packs Killochs Multi-National Force uniforms MBG Killhouses, MRB Voice Stop, Taosenais paper map, VTS Weapon Rest. What They do: This should be in the game, Cold War Weapons, Some Buildings, ShackTac Mods, All ArmAs Terrains/Maps, ACRE for a good VOIP, and a ALOT of National Forces (with Uniforms and Gear) MRB Voice Stop, stops/reduces the RADIO CHAT from AI; Paper map it's a HANDed Map and VTS Weapon REST for Weaponing RESTING.

review: I know it says recommended, but if you have no patience or toleration for bugs, crashes, and a large amount of trolls and hackers don't get this game. That being said, if you are ok with dealing with a un-optimized, buggy, but AWESOME game: it is best to wait for a sale because $60 is a large amount of money. But if you are seriously considering getting the game read below. | | | | \ / \ / \/ \ / Now to that you have the game start to familiarze yourself with the gameplay, but don't get too frustrated because they can be a bit wonky if you have never played a tactical shooter. Once you do this, there are two big player bases to this game: RP (roleplayers) and MIlsimers (hardcore tactical military simulation). I am a mixture between the two but I can't say I'm more towards one or the other. If you like the sound of doing roleplay and want to jump right in, find a good Altis life server my favortite is CGIs server. Oh wait you don't like roleplaying but you really want to be a hardcore milsim player then my suggestion is to find an 'online military unit'. The 15th MEU is a good one as I know a few people that are members. With many of these military simulation units there are age limits, it is usually 17 but all communities are different. I really hope this review helped some people decide if this game is right for them as there are many people that absolutly hate the game and then there are people that are completely adiccted to it and play nothing else.

review: A true life like of experience of war is to be had in this game Certainly the conflicts of the Middle East are encapsulated in the King of the Hill servers. Driving around in your 200 dollar rented pick up truck, not really knowing where you are going, you squint awkwardly into the horizon; then you zoom in with your scope because you realize you are dumb. Seeing little dots appearing you suddenly hear the distinct crack of gun fire. Being the smallest of the three factions you barrel out knowing the overwhelming s***t flinging powers of even just a small detachment of enemies. The gunner fires wildly as the tires blow out and the car smashes into a wall. He is now dead. The passenger attempts to fix the car whilst you take over the gun, firing randomly into the distance until the shooting stops The car is fixed, you are still alive. You make it into town and rendezvous with your comrades. The truck stops as an rpg slams into it, exploading and killing all inside. You are dead. You respawn and do it all again.

review: Coming from Day Z standalone, this game was a new and exciting transition. This game brings up alot of mixed feelings from my time in military service; but humanizes it all in goofy and offbeat player to player combat. the balistics are pretty on point for small arms and heavier weapons; and the tutorial & story mode can be beneficial to all who are new or experienced. I have never met so many young and old players who cooperate more and utilize military terminology, communication, direction and land navigation to enhance my total gaming experience. From gathering a stockpile of marijuana on altis life rpg to spotting a target's range for indirect fire or close air support; Arma 3 has very little in terms of flaws; but it is those small flaws and minor server glitches that add even more to the fun variable.

review: This game is definently worth the money. With gameplay ranging from straight out deatmatch, wasteland, Altis life, KOTH, and Zeus, Arma 3 brings a whole new style to first (and third) person shooters. Though there are a  of bugs, in a way, it kinda makes the game. I have had so many countless omments just bursting out laughing at what my friends and I call "Arma Physics", and I feel the bugs are usually hillarious. Finally, don't play campaign. If you wan't a good campaign, buy something like COD. Arma 3 has the most unique multiplayer experience ever, and playing campaign is a waste of your time.

review: So, where to begin? Arma 3 had an admittedly bad release. The game was unpolished, lacking content and the performance issues were an absolute pain for those without SLI'd graphics cards and top-tier i7's. These various issues put many players off upon release, myself included. Returning to Arma 3 sometime later - having only played occasionally to see what had improved - has significantly changed my opinion about the game. Arma 3 is beautiful, it truly is. The game prides itself on having astonishing some of the most astonishing landscapes in recent gaming history. The modding community, truly one of the best aspects of the game, are constantly working to refresh old maps from Arma: Armed Assault & Arma 2 using 3's engine - and my god, does it look incredible as a result. The gameplay is another aspect of Arma 3 which is much improved over the last iteration. The new posturing system, for example, allows you to dynamically shift your character's body to peek over and around obstacles without having to stand up - only to recieve a volley of bullets from the nearest enemy soldier. The multiplayer is also excellent, yet sadly still suffers from horrendous performance issues on low-tier systems (which, in all fairness, is understandable given the complexity of some of the gamemodes). Arma 3's multiplayer has a mode to please everyone, ranging from the Hunger Games-esque 'Battle Royale' and the hilarious 'Altis Life' to the 'Payday Mod' provided to us by the excellent modders in the community. There is a campaign mode which covers the entire seige of Altis & Stratis, I personally haven't played much of this but have been informed it is pretty good. My personal favourite feature - the mission editor - is back in all its glory in Arma 3. Not much has changed from the last game which is good considering that the Arma 2 editor was already an incredibly powerful tool for creating scenarios. User-created missions can be exported to the Steam Workshop, providing a near-infinite amount of entertainment for those who download them. Being able to set-up a mission where you HALO jump from 35,000 feet during a horrendous thunderstorm to then blow up radio towers and rescue hostages from the hands of the enemy is one of the most satisfying feelings in a video game, truly great stuff. So overall, Arma 3 has come a long way since its horrific release. Yes it still has bugs but most of them have been successfully ironed out and in turn Arma 3 is arguably one of the best military simulations in recent years. Pick this one up when you can. (The Helicopter DLC is massively overpriced for the content inside it, don't bother with it and grab some helicopters from Armaholic instead).

review: Even though I just started playing this game, I would already say it was worth my $60. The graphics are amazing and the detail makes everything look cool af. The only cons I would say are there are so many different controls that you will be referring to the field manual very often. Also, the keybindings are very awkward. For people that play different FPS often and are used to things like ctrl or c for crouch or space to jump or e for interact, they'll be annoyed when they constantly forget it's x to crouch. I was also sort of pissed that I couldn't change the keybindings...

This game is amaziing, or atleast what ive played of it so far. I loved arma 2 but it felt a little bit stale compared to this game. the world and charicters just feel that little bit more real which really help the immersition of a game like this. Music is good and can really build tenstion when needed and hype you up for the big fight upcoming. I would highly recomend this game to anyone intrested in both fps and stratagy fans. I would also recommend it to people who are intrested in warfair in generall. You will not be disapointed !

review: There are so many servers out there, that being a new player to ARMA 3, does not constitute childish behavior of admins, that say that I am being ignorant. For that matter, go have a nice 13year old life. The server IP I would suggest for you to avoid is Karmics PVE/LIFT/MISSIONS/TRADERSTOCKED at IP 24.123.11.106:2302. Complete lack of social skills that admin had. Just because I did not constantly check my side bar, does not make me ignorant. I am still learning this game and I really dont give two  about who runs the flipping server. I only want to have fun, while learning the game, and not be harassed when I log in about reading the mother flippin side chat/bar. For your information, I do read whatever come up in the beginning, just to see if anything important shows up. If not, I just walk or run around and play. I give two fingers up for that server and admin. (to.ot)

review: I highly recommend Arma 3 on sale. Arma 3 has a learning curve bit of a learning, but is unlike any shooter on the market. Arma 3 is a bit buggy, so expect rage inducing lag and glitches from time to time. Turst me Booboo, it's most likely not your PC set up. With all the mods and servers that this game features, you are guaranteed to get countless hours of game play out of this game. The campaign story is laughable, but the AI is challenging if you're completionist. Buy this game if you like: Great Gun play Teamwork Realistic firefights Flying Helicopters or Jets Survival mods Fighting AI with your buddies PvP with a /steep/ learning curve Pass on Arma 3 if you don't like: Large keybind layouts Low framerates Working as a team Dying a lot Not being Rambo Having PTSD Carry on Soldier.

review: Dear Diary I have recently been deployed to Altis it is my first tour of duty and already things are completely messed up I watched the Lance Corporal in my company try to fast rope and he ended up going through the roof of the helicopter surprisingly he didn't die until about 5 minutes later when he got ran over by a drunker contractor with severe road rage problems. The second day didn't fair much better the staff sargeant and our driver were shot by snipers who then proceeded to come over and tell us how we "got rekt" right before they stole our truck and our canned beans. Day 3 was even worse we had to walk 20 km back to base because of the theft of our truck which we did find crashed into those sub compacts that can go 300km/h, we lost Simmons that day.....thank god we had ketchup. Day 4 was the worst day we got attacked by the snipers again.I have yet to fire my weapon at an enemy I pass the time by going on 10km heights only to be chased by the drunken contractors again and masturbating freciously, I find myself getting angry at our policies we can't go out into the field with our issued rifles instead we have to give money to the local shopkeep to buy our rifles and ammo his name is Billy he is a nice guy. I still have yet to take somebody down I did fire my pistol at an enemy only to be winged by a sniper's bullet as it killed our company engineer. After the last day of my deployment I am happy to leave Altis we are now heading for another island called Stratis to help with the war effort we will see how everything turns out. Day 153...........all is lost I ate another PFC again 12/10 would get eat again

review: It is THE military simulator! Or something like it anyway. It ain't a COD FPS, no not even a Battlefield so much action game, even better, or worse. Many features such as weapon attachments, underwater ops, oh did i mention aviation? Pros: - Very very tactical, maybe too tactical. - Open world, limited to whatever people can figure out. - So many possible missions, you just need to find them. - So much mods, so many many mods, in fact maybe too many. - Often medium to long range realistic combat which is usually really hard to hit enemies. - Many features since first game release, such as shooting from vehicles and Virtual Reality. - Realistic graphics, limited to your hardware or your nerves for lag. - Many more? Cons: - Too tactical? Yep. Sometimes enemy AIs are a step ahead of you. - With big content and graphics, comes great hardware requirements. - Modifications that may be too big to download.

review: I start wandering around the streets and suddenly, out of nowhere, a man walks up to me and tells me to get out of my truck. I do as he says and then the police walk up to me and ask me if I have seen the man. I say I did see him and that he stole my truck. The police officer thanks me, gets back in his truck, and drives away. Now I'm without a car, and I figure the only thing to do is to go to the nearest ATM and buy a quadbike so I can drive back to my house. Before I got to the ATM, however, I was stopped by a notibly drunk naked man who stole all of my money and took me hostage for a bank robbery. The man takes me to the bank and points a gun to my head, telling me that if I move he would shoot. The police pull up five minutes later and arrest the bank robber -- and me. I ask why I was arrested, and they told me I was accomplice in a bank robbery. I tried to explain my story to the officer, but he wouldn't listen. When I later got out of prison, I went straight to my house. I went to the top-floor of my house, boot up my computer and started playing ArmA. It was pretty fun.

review: I have always been a fan of the ARMA series because its really different than the other shooters. There are so many different ways to play this game, I spend hours scripting and fooling around in the editor for my own enjoyment. I don't play multiplayer that much but it's still a great experience when I get to it. This game is very heavily GPU and CPU dependant so I wouldn't reccomend this to people who have a low-mid range gaming PC. Mid ranges might still be able to run it but you will get lots of FPS drops below 30 fps. This game is really fun and easy to get into. I am proud of the work that Bohemia Interactive is doing and continue to be a fan of their titles. I rate this game a 9.5/10.

review: This game is hard. You jump out of a building-splat-dead. You are walking aroung- bang-dead. You are in a tank-mine explodes-dead. However,once you learn all of the tricks(about 75 hours for me) it starts to get really rewarding. This game is very immersive from the fact that you can shoot enemies from over 2 klicks, you can fly helicopters, fixed wing, and drones. You can drive tons of vehicles, or you can just walk around as a rifleman. Use the mission editor to create a mission to your liking, download mods to (nearly) perfect your game. A.I. is kinda glitchy, some textures aren't perfect but overall, FANTASTIC GAME. Seriously, one of my friends NEEDS to buy this so we can play together.

review: 1st time playing this I go on altis life with a friend, heres how it went: We spawned, bought a bag and a hat each, went picking apples for a few hours Then bought a car each and went to do some delivery missions My friend crashed and I drove 18.5km to repair his car, only to find he was dead 2 paramedics came and revived him, I took the hat from my dead friends body first and offered it as payment The girl took the hat because the guy didn't like it and then accused me of being sexist because he wanted my hat He chased me around his ambulance for 10 minutes shouting 'GIVE ME THE F***ING HAT' I dropped the hat, drove off only to see the ambulance over take me and get blown up by terrorists I then burned in the wreck trying to get my hat back 11/10

review: Almost 40 hours into the game and I can honestly say it's the best game I've purchased on Steam, amazingly fun, action packed and a lot of things to do, never gotten tired of it and I'll continue to play it until I find another game as funny as this one.

review: Great visual effects, a stunningly immense map with detailed environments and immersive gameplay, ARMA 3 is one of (if not the best) Military Simulators currently available. Casual gamers beware, the name of the game in ARMA is REALISM and Bohemia Interactive has spared no attention to detail. ARMA is merciless, running and gunning into an enemy squad will get you killed in two seconds flat. Alertness, caution, cover, strategy and teamwork will win the day. Strongly recommended for the more serious FPS players and those wanting a truly rewarding gameplay experience.

review: Continuing a fine tradition ARMA III brings realism in combat to the greatest level. Maps that are miles across with dynamic weather and day/night cycles (you can even navigate by the stars!), the best ballistics in the shooter gaming world, and every type of vehicle you can think of from tanks and helicopters to jet aircraft and small submarines, PLUS a powerful mission editor and decent AI gives you an unparalleled amount of content and replayability for your hard earned dollars!

review: Unlike Arma 2 , Arma 3 can give much more. Not that Arma 2 is bad its just that Arma 3 is like gmod. If you want to play DarkRP you join a server other than downloading the addons and only picking from a small ammount of servers sometimes. Along with the ease of access to the numerous amounts of gamemodes it also has a certian play style to it.

review: A relentless pseudo-turn based dungeon crawler, with no end of challenge. The game features only two immediate and apparent difficulties: Too Easy, and Easy. Don't let these difficulty titles fool you, they're a lot more daunting than they seem. The dungeons are unforgiving, one mistake or failure to prepare can ultimately lead to your cascading loss of the dungeon. The already challenging difficulties can be further multiplied by selecting different escape pods that give new rules to your dungeon. The greatest enemy you will face in the dungeons isn't the monsters, it's the random number generator. What's in the next room? Monsters? Dust? A much needed damage-per-second, or utility hero? Maybe the room will be empty. Who know's what's in store for you in the depths of the Dungeons of the Endless. This game is not for those who are looking for a casual dungeon crawler.

review: This game is amazing. While the campaign and "vanilla" multiplayer are extremely fun, it's not even the tip of the iceberg in terms of gameplay. The real experience comes with the mods, scripted game modes, and editor included within the game, or downloadable through various websites. What Bohemia Interactive has done is give those with a vision the incredibly powerful engine (and therefore a means) to create the amazing gamemodes you can download anywhere and play.

review: Immediately upon entering a rp server, I was asked to enter a strange vehicle (Held at gunpoint of course). I hopped into the back of a black pick up truck and an invisible force prevented me from leaving. I was then driven halfway across the island. It was a long trip, the strange man in the front seat told me a few stories, some very touching others not as much. By the end of the journey, I felt much closer to the not-so-strange-anymore man. Our brief 15 minutes together had me believing I had found a new friend. A companion in this bleak world. That belief was soon torn apart as the man in the front seat let out a guttural scream and drove us both into a lake. Your experience in Arma 3 could be similar. 10/10

The game would be more worth it if it was about 25 bucks, but nooooo it has to be super expensive. Yes the game looks nice but it didnt change at all from arma 2. (again not worth it) well, if your into this kind of game, go ahead and buy it, don t let me stop you. but if you are not that into super hard core serious games than i suggest you dont get it, its a waste of money.

review: This FPS is quite unique. Instead of only pewpewpew or team fight, this game provides a *real* battlefield, not like DICE's Battlefield series.I won't call it a game but a military simulation software.And there's plenty of mods in this game, so it's very playable. One of my friend played this game for 60hrs in 2 weeks.Since this game is for the hardcore players, so it wouldn't be very friendly to newcomers. Best military simulator ever.10/10. Also BTW, DON'T THINK YOU CAN PLAY THIS GAME WITH IT TOLD YOU THE MINIMAL SYSTEM REQUIREMENT OF 8800GT. My GTX460 still sucks for almost half of time.

review: "WERE GOING DOWN, WE GOTTA JUMP" arma 3 is a realistic military shooter based on present day weaponry such as helicopters, vehicles, and weapons. there is a large single player that can keep you buys for quite a while, and all sorts of multiplayer capabilitys. modding is a great thing with this game cause there is so much you can do (ex. epoch, arma life) but its not as easy as it is with counter strike. now alot of people also believe that arma 2 was hard to run, chunky, hard to play but with arma 3 they have a auto setup that chooses what it believes the best settings are for your computer and its amazing (i still wouldnt play it on a laptop that isnt built only for gaming but runs great on my $600 desktop. if your looking for a challenge, or your the patient sniper who can wait for quite a while to pick of the guy who is wrecking everybody. or the ace pilot, who can get in and drop off 6 people in less then 15 seconds and get out. this game is for somebody who is willing to put in the time. or the single player like i said can keep u busy for a while. so finally cons: even with the setting auto-tuner the game can still be kinda laggy and glitchy if you have a low end machine. the game is very hard, if you dont like a hardcore game where 3 shots at most will kill you easy then this game can make your rage very well. pros: very well made, great weapons/vehicles, the maps and enviroment are large and expansive for large scale war on full servers is amazing to just watch a ground battle sue while aircraft dog it out in the sky and armored apc move towards the city with rienforcement until a guy in a building fires a anti-tank missle and blows it up, the smoke and fire rising to the sky on ultra setting while the survivors run for cover in the nearby bushes ontop of the hill and the sniper takes out the man in the building. so do i recommend this game? yes i do but you got to be willing to put your time into this game or you wont have the same experience as somebody who loves this game and has over 1000 hours on it.

review: Arma 3 is a very special game. The realism that is blended with the game really brings the game to life. The maps in the game are extremely huge, allowing for people to roam and have great battles. The gamemodes associated with Arma 3 show what fun can be had. Battle Royale is among my favorites, where the game is a hunger-games-like survival competition. There is a variety of vehicles, including aerial and sea. The weapons have many attachments, and some have the unique trait to have tracers. Overall, the game is a thrilling experience. 9/10

review: Pros: This game is just beautiful. Very Photorealistic! When I first looked around in the game it was like "whoa!". I can max it on my GTX 980 in 2k at around 40-50 fps, Multiplayer allows a large amount of people to play on massive maps. The controls are great, you can have total control over you player. Weapon accuracy is realistic, you cant hit anything without being tactical. It has a great training section that I advise you play before jumping into a server. Cons: The muliplayer... i just dont understand. I admit I haven't done any research on how to play, I didnt know I had to. I have not met a friendly entity in any game yet. As of now EVERY encounter with another play has resulted in them shooting me, tazering me or hancuffing me to sell to another more advanced player... there is nothing you can do about it, both the faction and the police have simmilar procedures. There are, it seems, 1k commands. It will take a while of remapping for comfort and accessability, let alone learning the bulk of them. Conclusion: It looks great and is the most immersive FPS I have ever played. So get it! Very taxing game on the graphics card. Screen shots look amazing, but the 45fps is not enough to be competative, so I will have to turn down settings =( OR buy another 980 =)

review: I have always been a fan of the ARMA series because its really different than the other shooters. There are so many different ways to play this game, I spend hours scripting and fooling around in the editor for my own enjoyment. I don't play multiplayer that much but it's still a great experience when I get to it. This game is very heavily GPU and CPU dependant so I wouldn't reccomend this to people who have a low-mid range gaming PC. Mid ranges might still be able to run it but you will get lots of FPS drops below 30 fps. This game is really fun and easy to get into. I am proud of the work that Bohemia Interactive is doing and continue to be a fan of their titles. I rate this game a 9.5/10.

review: Arma 3 Is Great!!!! Let me just start by saying are you sick of the troll kiddies running around with the cheapest weapons and using an auto aim assist and killing you right away? I know i am. This game Gives you an immense feel for war and keeps you thinking constantly. Sometimes the Action is spaced out quiet a bit but when the battle hits it is the gaming moments that stay with you forever. Plus Getting that mega kill is something to actually be proud of with your skill and not just stupid luck.

review: Arma 3... where do I start? Let's start with what Arma "is". Arma is a so-called "MILSIM", which basically means "Military Simulator". Unlike Call of Duty or Battlefield, Arma aims to achieve ultimate realism. Maps are massive, a shot in the chest could mean instant death and a shot in the leg means crawling until a medic takes a look at it. Few games match the level of realism that the Arma franchise has, and while the controls can be strange at times and some of the bugs could make the game hilarious instead of serious, the games are loved by the community behind it. STORY I must admit that I haven't delved too deep into the story, but it consists of a number of chapters, the first being "Survive", the second "Adapt", and the third "Win". I got to somewhere around the middle of "Survive", so please don't listen to me to the fullest regarding the campaign. Anyways, you start the campaign as an american soldier stationed on the island of Stratis, which is the smaller of the two maps in Arma 3 (the larget being Altis). The American forces are just preparing to leave the island when they are attacked by an unknown force. Communications are quickly cut, but you manage to get to your squad and together you complete missions around the island (the missions vary from securing crash sites to attacking hostile bases). IMHO the campaign is awesome, and I do believe that there were some ooh's and aah's exclaimed during some points of it. 8/10, great story but once again do not take my word, check the other reviews for a more detailed account on the storyline! And so we move on to the next part! MULTIPLAYER There are mutiple things you can do in the multiplayer (hah get it? no? sorry :c). Would you like to just kick back and play some relaxing roleplay? Then you can do that! Play as an ordinary citizen or a man of the law hunting some apple-stealing, drug-trafficking criminals around the islands! Or maybe you would really like to hop on and play some Wasteland, where you must gather food and water and watch out for other players. You can also gang up with some friends and build a badass base with walls and mortars and machine guns and a whole bunch of stuff, so you have somewhere to go when you're not out hunting players or completing missions around the islands! Other game modes include Domination (COOP vs AI, join up with a group of players and take on the AI as you battle for complete control over Stratis or Altis), King of the Hill (3 teams, BLUFOR, OPFOR and Independent fight each other to control a certain area on one of the islands), Battle Royale (no point in looking for teammates on this one, kill everyone else on the island and claim victory in this intense mod!) and many others. 10/10, amazing multiplayer, great community, one of my best multiplayer experiences ever. GAMEPLAY There are quite a few bugs in the game, however. The ragdolls can sometimes act up and that can be frustrating sometimes, but most of the time it's just funny and they don't exactly ruin the experience. Graphics are top notch, sound is really good (and there are mods that improve them even further!) but the enemy AI can sometimes act like they have no brain. That includes running around in circles when under fire, simply lying down and making no attempt at figuring out where he is taking fire from, but I guess that the AI just thinks that it's so good that it doesn't really need to survive anyways. 7/10, even though the AI is weird at times it certainly does not stop you from having a good time. FINAL VERDICT This review took a whole bunch of my time, and I have probably forgotten what I wrote up at the top, but Arma 3 is overall a great game and is definitely worth it at full price (however I believe that sales are quite common on this game, so keep a look out for that!). Apologies for any grammatical mistakes, English is not my main language. 90/100

review: This game is GREAT. It has tons of different gamemodes to choose from. Its a great REALISTIC game with great graphics. (WARNING: NEED PREETY DECENT COMPUTER TO RUN WELL) Some of the best gamemodes include, Altis Life(Stratis Life, Arma Life) which is a role playing gamemode, where your goal is to make that moolah. Whether it be selling apples or dealing drugs. Another gamemode is Wasteland, an open world gamemode where you make money and fight other player. To wrap this up, I would definately recommend this game. Great to play with friends.

review: This game is like no other. I have many hours spent in every build of this game, from Alpha to release, and I can proudly say that I enjoyed every single one of them. This isn't a game for everyone, there is no real guidance on what you are intended to do, the tutorials are confusing, and you will find yourself dying from all directions in combat missions. Much of the game's fun is drawn from the sheer uniqueness of it's conflicts - from small 4 man espionage missions at night to full on assaults with armored sections and infantry alike. There are few games that I could irrefutably consider a true sandbox, and Arma 3 is probably one of the best sandbox experiences around, with practically limitless mission oppurtunities from the community due to the excellent mission designer already implemented. Visually, this game is absolutely breathtaking at high settings - night time is probably the most stellar with it's pitch black atmosphere, and night vision opticals are almost a definite requirement - vehicle lights and weapon lights cast beams through the shroud of night, tracer rounds meander across the vast fields of Altis, destroyed vehicles emit a vicious explosion and emit plumes of smoke. Daytime is equally impressive with Arma's mesmerizing sky boxes and vast expanses of land which seem to travel infinitely. I don't feel like writing more right now but ultimately, Arma 3 is a visually stunning, virtually endless sandbox of military endeavours.

There is nothing to complain about because this game is ing great. I run this game on very high and i get 25 to 50 fps, i had no problem at all with bugs so far. This game hass amazing graphics, the textures look amazing, the models look very nice, the effects, lights and shading look very realistic! best graphics on a open world game so far for me Graphics 10/10 Gameplay 9/10 Map 9/10 Weapons 8/10 Worth the $ bought this for 30$ when it was on sale.

The multiplayer is really good, and you can play Altis Life RPG, Wasteland, Co-Op, king of the hill and more. 85% of community is great and much more mature compared to other FPS games. The only thing I don't like very much is infantry movement, not sure why though, feels different. Overall it's a great experience, I recommend it.

review: "WERE GOING DOWN, WE GOTTA JUMP" arma 3 is a realistic military shooter based on present day weaponry such as helicopters, vehicles, and weapons. there is a large single player that can keep you buys for quite a while, and all sorts of multiplayer capabilitys. modding is a great thing with this game cause there is so much you can do (ex. epoch, arma life) but its not as easy as it is with counter strike. now alot of people also believe that arma 2 was hard to run, chunky, hard to play but with arma 3 they have a auto setup that chooses what it believes the best settings are for your computer and its amazing (i still wouldnt play it on a laptop that isnt built only for gaming but runs great on my $600 desktop. if your looking for a challenge, or your the patient sniper who can wait for quite a while to pick of the guy who is wrecking everybody. or the ace pilot, who can get in and drop off 6 people in less then 15 seconds and get out. this game is for somebody who is willing to put in the time. or the single player like i said can keep u busy for a while. so finally cons: even with the setting auto-tuner the game can still be kinda laggy and glitchy if you have a low end machine. the game is very hard, if you dont like a hardcore game where 3 shots at most will kill you easy then this game can make your rage very well. pros: very well made, great weapons/vehicles, the maps and enviroment are large and expansive for large scale war on full servers is amazing to just watch a ground battle sue while aircraft dog it out in the sky and armored apc move towards the city with rienforcement until a guy in a building fires a anti-tank missle and blows it up, the smoke and fire rising to the sky on ultra setting while the survivors run for cover in the nearby bushes ontop of the hill and the sniper takes out the man in the building. so do i recommend this game? yes i do but you got to be willing to put your time into this game or you wont have the same experience as somebody who loves this game and has over 1000 hours on it.

review: Arma 3 is a very special game. The realism that is blended with the game really brings the game to life. The maps in the game are extremely huge, allowing for people to roam and have great battles. The gamemodes associated with Arma 3 show what fun can be had. Battle Royale is among my favorites, where the game is a hunger-games-like survival competition. There is a variety of vehicles, including aerial and sea. The weapons have many attachments, and some have the unique trait to have tracers. Overall, the game is a thrilling experience. 9/10

review: Pros: This game is just beautiful. Very Photorealistic! When I first looked around in the game it was like "whoa!". I can max it on my GTX 980 in 2k at around 40-50 fps, Multiplayer allows a large amount of people to play on massive maps. The controls are great, you can have total control over you player. Weapon accuracy is realistic, you cant hit anything without being tactical. It has a great training section that I advise you play before jumping into a server. Cons: The muliplayer... i just dont understand. I admit I haven't done any research on how to play, I didnt know I had to. I have not met a friendly entity in any game yet. As of now EVERY encounter with another play has resulted in them shooting me, tazering me or hancuffing me to sell to another more advanced player... there is nothing you can do about it, both the faction and the police have simmilar procedures. There are, it seems, 1k commands. It will take a while of remapping for comfort and accessability, let alone learning the bulk of them. Conclusion: It looks great and is the most immersive FPS I have ever played. So get it! Very taxing game on the graphics card. Screen shots look amazing, but the 45fps is not enough to be competative, so I will have to turn down settings =( OR buy another 980 =)

review: Vanilla ARMA 3 is alright, but ive found it to be better with mods from both the Workshop and Armaholic. Ive got in total about 30 monds that run everytime i play. I do however dislike the fact that they went all futuristic with the guns (the MX series is "based" on the ACR) Leaving it up to the modding community to devolope mods that add in better guns :)

review: Brilliant game. When it first came out, the game was buggy, glitchy, and pretty much unplayable. But that was to be expected. Now it's a brilliant combat simulator which I love to play in my spare time. Easy on the frames, great scenery, and awesome weapons. The update on the physics engine was on par as well. But I would say they need to "dumb down" the fatigue system. After running 50 metres with heavy gear and becoming fatigued is to be expected, but the character waves around the gun like he's aiming for a fast moving dragonfly. But that's the only thing they need to work on. Overall, this game is a must in your steam library list. 10/10

review: First of all, ARMA is not a shooter like COD or BF. The pace, style of gameplay, maps, are really different, but I have to say that it is more enjoyable, funny, and COMMUNICATING with the other players is great. For example, being the gunner of a tank: there are numbers that tell you direction and distance, so other player inside the tank tells you the indications to shoot. You wont be able to find this anywhere else. Or being in a squad, splitting in pairs to clear some buildings while the other 2 players cover you. It is important to make clear that you buy ARMA for its multiplayer and coop mode. If you are looking for campaign game, dont buy this. Also, if you are planning to buy this game, I have to tell you that you will have to join a clan to enjoy this game to its maximum; otherwise, by yourself, you wont like it as much :S Joining a clan means you will have to download MODs (content created by the community), and probably TeamSpeak (program similar to Skype) to play with them (all clans ask for a mic, take that into account). To sum it up, ARMA is a total unique in the experience out in the market regarding FPS. Nonetheless, to have a good time you need to join a clan and play with other people, and be willing to download new content.

review: A well made military simulator with a great community. The game puts you right in the action during those tense moments when the bullets flying around you could kill you in one or two hits, making every battle decision worth thinking over. Missions with a team could never be more realistic then when you are just a band of gamers who have never met before, hunched over your computers and just barely making a dent in the OPFOR forces. Even when you are on the move to the action, the game still keeps your attention. The moments when you are completely oblivious, then suddenly ragdoll to the ground with the respawn screen popping up really teach you to be aware. Overall, ArmA III is an amazing game that made a lasting impression on me, considering I'm new to the series. Originally buying it to play Altis Life, I soon found the rich treasure trove of content this game holds.

review: This is a great step up from ArmA 2. They did take an odd turn and remove most weapons from the base game to get people to buy additional DLC. Beyond that, the new graphics introduced is a nice update to the game that introduces working screens and a cleaner look. The "ArmA physics" for vehicles that used to be a riot when in a wheeled vehicle has been largely updated and has less vehicles flying 200 ft. into the air. All in all, a great game to play with friends or even random people to get your tactics on.

review: Arma 3 is a military simulator. It's not supposed to be played like Call of Duty or Battlefield where you run and gun, but you most certainly can. It helps to play this game with other people, because the AI isn;t very helpful. There is also the problem with bugs that come with any Arma game. You will break your legs from running around, you will get trapped in the world, and you will get stuck doing simple actions; you will also love every minute of it. When you learn how to deal with these issues, the game is an absolute blast.The draw of the game isn't the base game, it is the mods. Just like Arma 2, this game will have a long lifespan because of mods like Arma LIfe, Epoch, Battle Royale, Breaking Point... just to name a few. Just be sure before to watch some videos or read the instructions on various websites before you mod the game so that you don't have to reinstall your game or spend hours trying to figure out what you did wrong. 9/10 Would fly a helicopter into a tank again, bring a friend, but please fix the annoying bugs.

review: So the majority of players populate RPG servers like Atlis Life instead of servers that host military maps such as CTi Warfare. That is proof enough that the game is a massive failure for what it is intended. IMO the failure is down to lack of content first and foremost. Lack of guns, lack of everything , not even a BRDM ATGM or "futuristic" equivilent that I feel is essential for any battlefield.... just one example, nevermind the rest of the stuff that is missing. Oh, and charging relativelty big money for two helicopters and a flight model that nobody even asked for... Ridiculous. Operation Arrowhead/Resistance etc... cost just a little more and had massive content. People bleat on (especially the stepford wives on the BIS forums) about "supporting the devs" and buy the overpriced DLC. I bought the game therefore I am supporting the devs. If you want more money from me then release an OA style addon and not low content DLC BS. What in gods name have the devs been doing all this time if these simple DLC packs are all they have to release? Every game since CWC has a major addon released within a year give or take a few months..... except Arma 3 And the weapon sway... By all means make the shooting mechanics unique and difficult to master (I dont want a COD clone here) But when I play, I like to play CTI maps. That includes killing vast amounts of infantry. Before it was no problem. Now I have to play a stupid minigame everytime I want to line up my sights with a target meaning the game is impossibly long and infuriating. There is not even a server setting to customise the game for a particular game mode. WTF is that about? If you just put that in then that would make it a whole lot less tiresome for a lot of people. I had high hopes for the game when I bought it but I just cannot recommend it. Buy Arma 2 and all the addons for very cheap and just play that. Arma 2 is a vastly superior game and that makes me very sad indeed.

review: Arma 3 is a masterpiece that i think will be played for a a long time! This game has beautiful graphics of terrain and objects. Gameplay mechanics are quite easy to learn but becoming a master takes time and practice, you maybe able to kill from 100 meters but you will have to train to kill at 1000. There are a wide selection of weapons and clothing for your charicter, ranging from Ghille Suits to Civillian clothing. Where I think this game shines is the scale of combat, With two absolutly huge maps and combat scenarios Arma will never give you the same scenario twice! This isn't any arcade shooter, Arma is a TACTICAL shooter, some would even call it a role-playing game! SUMMARY: BUY this game if you have a moderatly powerfull pc!

review: Sandbox multiplayer is awesome. Don't even bother going to in-game gun stores. Grab whatever rifle and equipment you can and make use. I found a submachine pistol and a silencer, a smoke grenade and some glow sticks. Left my car running on a busy road at night with the lights on and watched it. Surrounded it with glow sticks. killed three people and came away with a decent back pack, rifle and grenade launcher and a ghillie suit. With space to pack my handy little PDW. Don't get angry when you get shot after hunting down the perfect kit and have to hike for miles and miles again. Downside @ 29/11/14 Is there are a lot of hackers at present and it's ruining the fun. This game still gets 5 out of 5 stars

review: I find ARMA 3 hard to play. It's single player is though, the AI is merciless and some game mechanics are hard to get under control. But wow, ARMA 3 really comes to live when you play this game online with other people. There are tons of good, fun servers you could lose yourself in for days. Doing missions taking hours at an end, under professional leadership from an HQ, pilots, Squad Leaders and your mates. You get to know them. You don't want to die. You leave no man behind. And after a while, you try to take leadership. And people give you that. The game is though, the community takes that, and owns that toughness by making the rules on yourself as a player though. No lone wolfing, this isnt Battlefield. This is a battlefield.

review: Arma 3 makes big steps forward with a huge world and more vehicles and weapons. This time around its trump card is Steam workshop integration though, making downloading mods effortless. A smart move by Bohemia Interactive because it are those mods that will give Arma 3 its long lifespan. Unfortunately Arma 3 is quite inaccessible and doesn't seem to grow along with modern game design on certain fronts. Space time and perseverance are your best friends here, until Bohemia's support starts paying off.

review: Arma 3 is a miltary simulator through and through, but unlike most simulators Arma 3 has a campaign with in-depth story to boot and competitive MP that's more then decent. The AI is of a standard above what most games have to offer out there and each weapon, ground or aireal vehicle strive to give as realistic experience as can do when operating said equipment. Weapons need to be zeroised and as per actual warfair Artillery or Mortars need to be given a Grid Reference (GR) before effective fire can be achieved; and you yourself can operate fire support weapons. The campaign is set into episodes and each episode has just below ten missions that offer a challenge in every aspect. Although your AI teammates need to be babysitted somewhat and the game could use some more optimisation but that's a small price to pay in a game that is overall great. I score this game a 8.5/10.

review: This game is an total Masterpiece, its the closest you can ever get with trying to remake a Millitary Simulation Game. i say buy it!, you won't get dissapointed. and you even have tons of awesome mods, like a DayZ: Arma 3 Mod (Epoch) , which looks and plays even better than DayZ standalone, itself, you have base building mechanics, tons of weapons, and best of all , you can play on player made maps, and don't make me even start talking about Arma 3 Battle Royale. yeah and btw, The game runs much better on Intel CPU'S than on AMD CPU'S especially in Mulitplayer.

review: ArmA 3, successor of ArmA 2 and ArmA 2 : OA, is in my opinion the best ArmA game yet released. ArmA was always known for it's moddabillity and the user's freedom to create their own missions, since Bohemia Interactive released "ArmA 3 Tools" modding became even more easy. There are many really good mods out there, some are as good and big as a whole DLC! The game without mods is also good of course, the campaign was well designed and there are many fun multiplayer missions, which you don't need mods for (only few actually need mods).Everyone who played ArmA 2 or any other ArmA game, and liked it for it's tactical depth, it's moddabillity, all the multiplayer missions or for whatever reason this game is defenitely worth it's money. A note to all DayZ fans : DayZ Epoch (the most popular DayZMod version since somewhere in 2013 i think) is comming out for ArmA 3 somewhen, at least they announced it, only closed alpha when i last checked. tl;dr ? A GOOD GAME !

review: I don't have a review for this game yet.....I dont have a review for this game yet.... Holy crap I cant believe I havent reviewed this game yet. this game is honestly my favorite game for more reasons than any other game could possibly deliver. Arma 3 is a near future set game that delivers combined arms operations for a massive number of players. This game is definitly a more mature game. This game reward tactics, cordination, patience and attention to detail. This isn't a shooter for the masses. honestly arma is a niche game for a niche audience. Sure it has down falls, but they can be overlooked if you give it a chance and really experience what this game can do. Providing massive options and a massive map is only part of the magic that is Arma 3. A bunch of ingredients are useless without a good kitchen. Arma 3s kitchen is the editor. The editor allows anyone to create anyone to make missions with almost any asset in game. This provides endless replayablility as well as an excellent way for peopel to create missions to play with friends. The game play isn't perfect, it can be slow and nothing is going to be over the top like battlefield or CoD but its does provide an excelllent military simulation where every death will be infuriating but acceptable and every victory glorious but hard fought. The maps is over 219km squared, but alot of it feels empty and the parts that aren't feel really empty, with the map more would be less and I could go on, but I wont for the sake of brevity. The AI leave something to be desired, friendly AI seem about as smart as a bag of rocks, except the rocks win every time. They don't follow orders well, if they do, its almost certainly cluncky and awkward. The opposing AI are just as bad. If they don't see you from a mile away and kill you with a cold bore headshot, theyre sure to hit the deck and see right throught the bush you are hiding in and return fire accordingly. There is more to this game than what appears when you first launch it. The mod community is massive. There are mods for just about everything, which makes anything possible. These games totally expand the game to insane new heights, and some change the game all together. The people who play this game are amazing. I have made some awesome friends because of this game, and continue to make more as I go. Playing with people who compliment your play style improve the game ten fold are a critical part in the Arma 3 experience. This series has been around for over 9 years and continues to grow and mature with every installation and so does the community. I love this game and the people who play it. I don't think I'll ever stop. So here's to the next 9 years of Arma games. 10/10

review: I have put over 1000 hours into this game, played the  out of it, edited and made missions all night till the sun came up. It is the best military sim you will ever play. Anything can be done in this game, and the mods make this stupid realistic. It can fit a run and gun play style, or you can do it tactically. Personally I played it with a handful of friends, and even underwent training from a guy with 9+ years in Special Forces. This game is the real deal. And you will not find one like it. That being said, I have stopped playing Arma because of their money loving developers who really bent their fans over and violeted them in their no-no places. The game still runs poorly on high end systems, there are hundreds of content missing from the game that was promised since prior Alpha, but God Forbid they are releasing pointless DLC's to squeeze every penny out of our wallets. (Go Karts? Seriously?) And not ot mention a Helicopter DLC that adds 2....2!!!!! New Helicopters, that are ALREADY in the game, you just can't fly them, for $15. If that's not the BIGGEST Scumbaggery I have ever seen, then I don't know what is. Overall, the game is fantastic, but the Devs have completely lost my support and respect. That being aside. I will give this game my 10/10 for the sake of Arma. But I'd rather give it a zero because of Bohemia Interactive.

review: Arma 3 is a miltary simulator through and through, but unlike most simulators Arma 3 has a campaign with in-depth story to boot and competitive MP that's more then decent. The AI is of a standard above what most games have to offer out there and each weapon, ground or aireal vehicle strive to give as realistic experience as can do when operating said equipment. Weapons need to be zeroised and as per actual warfair Artillery or Mortars need to be given a Grid Reference (GR) before effective fire can be achieved; and you yourself can operate fire support weapons. The campaign is set into episodes and each episode has just below ten missions that offer a challenge in every aspect. Although your AI teammates need to be babysitted somewhat and the game could use some more optimisation but that's a small price to pay in a game that is overall great. I score this game a 8.5/10.

review: I have put over 1000 hours into this game, played the  out of it, edited and made missions all night till the sun came up. It is the best military sim you will ever play. Anything can be done in this game, and the mods make this stupid realistic. It can fit a run and gun play style, or you can do it tactically. Personally I played it with a handful of friends, and even underwent training from a guy with 9+ years in Special Forces. This game is the real deal. And you will not find one like it. That being said, I have stopped playing Arma because of their money loving developers who really bent their fans over and violeted them in their no-no places. The game still runs poorly on high end systems, there are hundreds of content missing from the game that was promised since prior Alpha, but God Forbid they are releasing pointless DLC's to squeeze every penny out of our wallets. (Go Karts? Seriously?) And not ot mention a Helicopter DLC that adds 2....2!!!!! New Helicopters, that are ALREADY in the game, you just can't fly them, for $15. If that's not the BIGGEST Scumbaggery I have ever seen, then I don't know what is. Overall, the game is fantastic, but the Devs have completely lost my support and respect. That being aside. I will give this game my 10/10 for the sake of Arma. But I'd rather give it a zero because of Bohemia Interactive.

review: Arma 3 is one of the best selling FPS Sandbox games ever made. Some of those people come from arma 2 or arma 1 but most people I know, arma 3 was their first arma game. From flying helicopters to infantry rush. Arma 3 has a huge community and is still growing today! Also not to note the spectacular performance by the dev team update almost weekly. The best thing I love about aroma is there always going to be something new each time you play from Altis life to the realism units. Friend me if you want to see some screenshots of arma 3 ~Macmaster

Role-playing in the game mode Altis Life has been awesome and hilarious so far as well as playing the game modes Deathmatch and King of The Hill! Although Bohemia Interactive never optimize their game... 8/10. Outstanding gameplay but lack of optimization.

review: Arma 3, the best military sim out there. Me and my squad load into the plane, just another drop in an enemy town. The plan was to sabotage th AA so we could carpet bomb the place. Our recon ****** up. We were supposed to drop in far enough away so are plane wouldn't get hit, but apparently the AA were farther up than expected. "JUMP! JUMP! JUMP!" our sargent said. We all jumped. Into the forest Surrounded by the enemy. We all rallied at the plane crash, and decided to fortify there to hold off the enemy. "We will die today men, but for every man hit, ten of their's will fall!" They closed in... We shot six rounds.. They responded with artillary.. oohh, the artillary. I surived with broken legs. just me. All alone. As I crawled through the carnage, I saw sarge, lying their, blood seeping through his cloaths. I black out, from the loss of blood. And I never wake up. Ever, ever, again.

review: I will never ever buy another mistake (Bohemia Interactive game). I trusted this company and purchased this game in Alpha. Not only did they deliver a buggy failure. They have the nerve of releasing expensive DLCs that are meant to be included in the game. And announcing new games when they haven't even finished whats on their plate. This developer should be renamed as EA v2.1 Never again BI, never again.

review: Arma's popularity stems from the fact that it's a modern shooter with good modding support. That's it. The game itself is heavily flawed and buggy. Bohemia Interactive's strategy is to exploit the lack of moddable shooters by releasing a half- game and letting the modding community fix it. Sure, there will be some great mods for the game but their success shouldn't be attributed to Arma. Games like Battlefield 1942, Battlefield 2, and the Half-Life series were hugely popular due to all the great mods made for them. But the games themselves, without mods, were actually competent. With the shift to catering towards console gamers, modding support has fell by the wayside, and Arma, perhaps unintentionally, fills that gap. But Arma has horrible AI, horrible physics, horrible performance, a clunky UI, and so on. If Arma weren't moddable, I'm confident its metacritic rating would be more like 5/10.

review: Arma 3 broken game broken promises. Arma 3 alpha comes out, has great voice over quality, great hit registry, guns work when you shoot them. They update it. Broken voice over, broken hit registry (90% of bullets don't register a hit), car physics are for trolls, all the servers are run by admin and friends (donate money and they will ban whoever you don't like), planes don't work, AA shoot you down from 5 km away. The only thing fun is flying a helicopter. Running is broken in the game. Play epoch mod and get shot by a five year old hiding in the bushes in his underwear. Bad games made worse. Just pretty graphics, however half the servers run terribly and don't support high frames so even if you have a nice computer good luck getting good frames. Would have been great if they just left it in alpha instead of screwing it up.

review: Tried this for the free weekend to see if I could enjoy it. Played on normal and the difficulty was far too great for me to find fun. I respect this game and feel its good and everything, but even on the lowest difficulty I find it near impossible to find and shoot the enemy. Gun sway is really intense, and this is with me lagging behind the rest of the AI players walking to preserve energy (im aware of the extra stamina drained when moving crouched). Enemy seems to be able to see through foliage. If you like incredibly difficult things, this game is for you. I took my time to do the tutorial, learn the buttons, positioned myself carefully and usually just ended up getting shot. Theres time compression thank god, however a lot of people might not even realize its there. This game has its moments, but I would recommend Operation Flashpoint Red River over this any day, I find it much more satisfying moment to moment. I am an adult with a full time job, walking through the woods simulator isnt my thing, I gave this game a chance and I feel as though I wasted two hours of my life yesterday. I want to love this game as much as the original operation flashpoint...but I can't, I simply can't (in cleetus voice). Graphically things went well, I have a gtx 660 and 10 gigs of RAm on an i5, with shadow play on and recording I was getting somewhere between 25-70 FPS. FPS drops intensely around buildings. I am runnning it on ultra settings. If you have a system similar to mine you can be pretty much assured to play at an acceptable framerate. If you have friends to play with turn on OF:Red River. The friend I tried this with was too frustrated with the shooting mechanics to enjoy it. This game is good mind you, but not for me....

review: Arma 3 is definitely more improved than Arma 2, the experience is much better and the graphics has improved and the maps seem to be bigger. However to play it with at least 30fps or higher, you need a supercomputer to do so as this game is horribly optimised. Here is a comparision of my frame rates playing different games Battlefield 4 - 70fps (ultra settings) Tomb Raider - 120fps (Ultra settings) Arma 3 - 40 fps (Standard settings) The graphics of this game is comparable to Tomb Raider. Verdict: Don't buy it unless you own a supercomputer.

review: You think I'M A ?! For watching anime? HA What a joke let me tell you a story so you can futher grasp just who it is you're talking to when it comes to earning the right to call someone a . Me and my best bro used to play this game where we suck each others'  and call the person who cums first a . I usually win because my bro's never been all that great at ucking, and when he es in my mouth, I make him finish me off then give him a passionate kiss so he has to swallow both loads. Then I berate him for the next hour or so about what a total  he is. To this day I've acumulated over 1200 victories in this battle of skill and edurance, not only over my best bro, but over hundreds of other chalengers. Each just wishing to earn the right to even call me a . So next time you decide to try to berate me by claiming I'm a  for watching anime just remember I doubt you could suck off a  even half as well as I can.

review: I like military sim games and this one has a lot going for it. But in the several hours I put in to try it out, I found a huge flaw (to me). It has way to many keystrokes to accomplish what you want. Just the simple task of engaging an enemy, requires you to hit 1/2 dozen keys almost. Many keys are dual purposed (press or press & hold) and have to be held with other keys - which means you don't always get your character to do what you want or he does something you don't want. You can of course re-bind any of the keys, but then you end up using every key on the keyboard... literally... even the num pad (if you have one on your keyboard). I think this is just bad design. Sure after a hundred hours, you probably could make it 2nd nature to tap all the keys you need, to do what you want quickly. But come on. I think this game could/would be great if they would simplify the controls. Doesn't need to be COD easy but certainly needs to improve. The one other thing that got me. Trying to play multiplayer and it's very confusing. There is not much to tell you what is going on and what you are doing - and that's just getting into the game (multiply screens to get thru with no instrutions or details). Once you do make it into a game, again no instuctions or details about what's going on and what you are suppose to be doing. I wasn't the only one, other people on the team seem to just be wondering around clueless. Such potential, such fail.

review: I was a fan of the ArmA series. I really played ArmA II totally grey.. But I had high hopes for ArmA III buying the alpha , promising us more stuff will be added later... Yes that part is true.. ArmA III on itself is totally empty... You have to get Mods and Payable DLC content to make the game interesting... It is like they gave you the engine of the car only.. You have to pay for the wheels , chassis , doors , windows , lights yourself. It is suppose to be MilSim , in order to have that label , it should give us also. What made me being so disappointed about ArmA III... It is that the Helicopter DLC costs 12 euro.. Like WTF

They have a fatigue system to where if you run you get exhausted, cannot run, shoot, Ect. Now. Thats good. I like it. BUT. They need to fix it immensely. first time. Can't aim. I lay down for 3 minutes to let him breath. Didn't work. got shot at and killed cause I couldn't shoot back. This same senario happened over and over again. Finally I got sick of it and threw all of my gear on the ground. Had to be my weight right? Nope. It still got me extreamly tired immediately. Now. I wasn't injured (had medpacks on me. 2) I wasn't running up a hill I was walking. Casually. and if it considered the clearing I was in. then well. a bug this game needs to be fixed.

review: meh. i have a couple of issues with the game. 1. you need a fantastic cpu and decent gpu to handle this game. otherwise, you will be constantly playing at 20 fps 2. for how much processing they take up, the ai is downright stupid. they are still too slow and hardly use enough cover to blend in with players. -to make up for difficulty, the ai is incredibly accurate and good at detecting. 3. the vanilla campaigns are set so your teams are at poor odds with the ai. this is supposed to be realistic, where real world tactics are used. why is my team running into an enemy town through a valley? 4. the armor system is awful. it takes 5-6 shots to kill with the medium caliber assault rifles. i know they say its because of plate carriers. plates don't necessarily stop bullets, they take a lot of energy out of them so you don't die immediately. getting shot is still going to put you out of a fight. anything past .243 or 6.5 is going to start breaking bones; it would be amazing if you could even still move on your own let alone shoot back accurately. 5. the campaign is mediocre with missions that take too long and put too much responsiblity on the player trying to have fun. arma2 also had bad voice actors with bad lines, but this is a little better. its stilll not much of an improvement. 6.wonky user interface. this have improved on a lot over time, and there are mods to make it more intuitive. it still takes a while to do anything in your inventory though; maybe because in real life, it would take time to rummage through your pockets and ruck sack to find anything. it still sucks though 7. no tutorial. yes i know there is a 'boot camp' thing now. that hardly explains how to use anything. it still missed subjects like actual fighting, flying helicopters and jets, taking cover. 8. mission editor. how do you use it? i don't really know. ive been messing with it for years, i still dont think i know much about how it all works. 9. multiplayer. it doesnt happen. at least from what ive seen. just about all the servers are locked clan servers, or empty public matches. the server browser is cluttered and confusing with no explanation of what it all means. i mean call of duty was so successful partly because of its join a random lobby feature. i know i mentioned all the bad stuff. there is much good to this game, and im sure other reviewers will point it out. i played this game franchise until i got sick of it. now i play insurgency because its much more fluid and refined with the same idea of critical dammage and little hud.

review: At first this game was a lot of fun to play. But with the time it rather got worse than good. - The game does not go above 29 FPS for me (on i7 4770k, GTX 770, SSD) - It easily drops under 20 FPS when there is a bit of vehicle movement around the map - The AI is programmed really bad. Not finding paths. Not moving at all when told to. The game is just as good without AI as it is with them. Maybe some dummy targets for your enemies. Which again are overly OP compared to your AI... - Since the shutdown of GameSpy it is completely unavailable for Coop missions with friends. Hosting Steam servers was not working since the games release And last but not least the price is way too high for a game said to be "still under development" I regret every Cent of the 45 Euros which I payed for this game.

review: I cannot recommend this game, mainly beacuse it runs like hell. I have tried the game on two diffrent computers (one with gtx 580 and one with gtx 770 GPU) and still very rarely get above 40 FPS in multiplayer. And that is on standard settings. Battlefield 4 on the other hand runs with an average of above 100 FPS on very high settings (no AA though but 90 FOV). I like the concept of the game and if the performance issues gets solved I'll give the game another try, but as of now I have tried the game on multiple occasions since march 2012 and it still doen't work. Note however that while the game has superb scale and huge empahsis on teamwork - which is great - the core of the game is still far worse then any of the other major FPSes. Shooting in this game is irregular, laggy and the action menu is terrible. I really like the shooting mechanics in Red Orchestra 2 but in ARMA they are damn awful. Flying helicopters is quite fun though and very challening (unlike battlefield).

review: Bohemia Interactive made their debut with Operation Flashpoint and then changed to Arma series afterwards. Since the first installment it has been downhill up to third one. The engine is heavy, unoptimised, clunky for smooth gameplay no matter what setup you may find for your PC. The menu and UI interface is also archaeic and still as slow as it was in OFP days. I can't see justification for this game unless it would be around 4,90 and even then it's not worth your time. The map is boring and unimaginative compared to that of Chernarus, Sahrani and the multiple locations of OFP. As for gameplay the shooting is well done and the many ways of controlling your character is definitely the best of the industry has to offer. It's unfortunate that the teamplay and coordination falls down to its own clunkiness. Finally the modding is still there which offers replayability and whatever people come up with to use but still I find the engine and other problems within the core too deep to actually be worth of one's time.

review: this game is not realistic at all really. recoil is garbage, the weapon sway is way to much, the damage you do to enemies is way to low, it shouldn't take more than 1 shot to the head to kill someone but in this game it does at times, when you fire a weapon fire doesn't come out of the barrel like how it does in this game, Also 90 percent of everything in this game is fake and the rest are prototypes/in use. the only things that i can think of in this game that are real are the 556 weapons which do barley any damage so you don't every use them anyways... this game would be better if it wasn't called arma 3, because it ruined the arma name...

NO CONTENT - took almost 2 months just to release a few single player missions No Multiplayer Support - no real official missions or servers to help keep the population high. BUGS BUGS BUGS Performance issues Missing a lot of must have vehicles and aircraft that would really add to the simulation. I would NOT recommend buying this game until about a year of patches and they complete the game. It is UNFINISHED as of right now.

review: If you're a fan of ArmA 2 then you'll really enjoy this game. There have been tons of graphical improvement made to the engine which make it much more enjoyable. Personally, I didn't enjoy ArmA 2 or this release. ArmA 3 is just much of the same in the ArmA series. Most of the modules and features are half finished, the AI is god awful, and it seems that Bohemia just released an open world game and expected modders to do the rest of the work.

review: Some background: I first started playing Bohemia Interactive games in 2001, when I played the demo for Operation Flashpoint from a Computer Gaming World disk. I owned all of the Operation Flashpoint expansions, as well as ARMA II, and now ARMA III. This game sucks sh*t. All of them have, and all of them have depended on the addons to make the game playable. BI Has never made a decent game, only a platform with promise that modders/mission makers polish up. -I don't know why BI continues to make storylines, they've always been awful at them. -AI sucks. I just fired up a mission and was told to plant explosives on some mobile artillery. The Platoon Leader said "and everyone else take cover".. apparently a couple AI thought it best to run towards the mobile artillery, so I accidently killed them ---leading to a mission failure, and them shooting at me. -Before that two soldiers got killed running off on their own (funny, never saw that in the Ranger Handbook) -Most multiplayer servers with a decent ping are either RPG or DM... I should not have to explain why this is stupid. +Voice acting gets slightly less terrible each game. +Graphics are decent I don't recommend getting this unless it's like 75% off and you understand what you're getting.

review: Are you looking for a milsim game that uses cooperation, tactics and all out warfare well  off this isnt the game you are looking for. You will be killed by the smallest graze to your arm and if you just so happen to live from your wound you will have the worst weapon sway that the universe has ever seen. The planes are ed up to a point where a pawnee will shoot you down by following you and random spraying its miniguns that have the power of the sun and dont even get me started on the physics oh jeez you can get shot in the foot and die and from the shear impact your body will fly to the ing clouds and back . Oh another thing if you so happen to be driving a car and hit a little mesh fence designed to keep rabbits out you will lose you engine, tires, hull and virginity to that mother ing mesh fence and thats only going 15kmh dont even dare go over that speed limit you daredevils. Ahhh the best of them all... the stamina update... you can be running for 50 meters and your guy will be having cramps and dying from pure exhaustion from the marathon that er just ran so calm your  son and walk that off while under fire from all them ers out there with little 9mm rounds that will behead you. Good day and do not buy this... ever... at all..... I MEAN IT

I have a high spec computer and play other games on highest settings. When I try to play Arma 3 on lowest settings, it crashes. This game is what we call a complete failure.

review: Great game, But if you plan on playing multiplayer. Expect to get banned by Battleye. Played this franchise since Operation Flashpoint: Cold War Crisis back in 2001 up to the split between Codemasters and Bohemia Interactive. Onto the ARMA franchise. Never cheated and now it's completely unplayable on multiplayer. Battleye has ruined this game for me. They even ban your steam account. Can't just rebuy the game...

review: I cannot recommend this game when ArmA 2 is still alive and well. First of all, the game is lacking in content, for example, most of the weapons and vehicles are the exact same for different nations, with different paint schemes. The map is huge, which is great, till you look closer at it. Most of the buildings are empty, no furniture, nothing. A lot of the assets are missing, even basic objects/buildings for some missions that were around since the OFP days like CTI just aren't there. The gun handling feels like something straight out of battlefield, if you know how to control the recoil, which by the way is not hard, it basically goes straight up, you can be completely accurate at 300m with a fully automatic weapon. The character handling feels very awkward, and this is coming from someone with 2000+ hours on arma 2, I know about awkward controls, there are like 3 movement speeds, all of which take around 3 keystrokes to get in/out of, what happened to the good old days of just pressing W then going? This isn't a damn car, I don't have to switch gears depending on the speed I am going at. Speaking of cars, the cars handle very awkwardly aswell, the acceleration is just ridiculous, it takes forever to get up to around 30kmh, then it just switches on the afterburner and off it goes! Hey look, an afterburner! Oh wait, it's a trainer jet, a stealth a10, and some freak su25 thingy. Oh boy there is so much wrong with the planes and helicopters in this game. I love aviation, hell I'm trying to make it my job, so this part hurts me the most. Where do I begin with this... Let's start with the easiest, L39, it's a trainer, it's not supposed to carry weapons, and you're gonna tell me it's gonna go up in battle with no other air support? Ha, good joke. I'm gonna be honest, I like the looks of the su25 looking thing, but it's never going to happen, much less in 20 years. The SU25 is still doing well, and if it were to get upgraded in the next 20 years, it would probably only be the systems and avionics, either that, or they will build an entirely new aircraft from scratch, or replace it with the already existing ground pounders. Oh boy here comes the big one. That damn stealth a10 freak. There is so, so, so much wrong with this it's not even funny. Alright let's start with what stealthing an aircraft is all about. Sharp edges to bounce the radar off in a different direction than where it's coming from, the whole aircraft needs to be sharp guys, not just the engines. Notice something about the stealth aircraft that are flying around today? Internal stores. You don't want those suckers reflecting radar signals now, do you? The a10 is a subsonic CAS (Close Air Support) ground pounder, It is literally designed  the enemy up, and they'll know what hit them, but it won't matter cause they'll either be dead, or their equipment will be too ed up to shoot back. There is no use stealthing a plane that will be flying at under 5000'. Everyone and their mother will be seeing that bad boy. It's also supposed to take damage, the whole titanium bathtub  and whatnot, by sharpening the edges, you are adding more structural failure points in the event of, you know, a missile hitting it. I'm no aircraft engineer, but to me this makes sense, if someone is reading this and actually is an aircraft engineer, please tell me how wrong or right I am. Same goes for stealthing helicopters I mean come on, how are you going to stealth a ing rotor spinning at hundreds of rpm, and constantly changing pitch/angle? The mi48... This is not how things work, you can't take 2 choppers, merge them together and add some stealth  on it and expect anyone to take you seriously... ArmA 3 is set in the near future. around 20 years from now. If you look at military history, in the 20th century progress was at it's peak in WW2 up to Vietnam, and then kind of slowed down till the mid 90's, and we're now more or less at a standstill. We're still using tanks, aircraft, and weapons designed in the 70's and 80's and perfectioned. It takes a world war or some major conflict of some sort to get us off our asses and to put our thinking caps on. So do you really think that 20 years from now, the ak's, m4's, m16's, etc will be out of service and replaced by a new standard of 6.5mm caseless shells? That we won't be still using abrams, strikers, t90's and BMP 90's? We'll probably have the f22, unfortunatly probably the f35, PAK FA and others, most of this stuff will most likely be old  with fancy new systems. I half blame dayz for how this game turned out. DayZ is/was a good mod/game, but it attracted the wrong kind of people to ArmA, it didn't attract milsim people, it attracted the general public that likes shooters and zombies. The funny thing is, most of the dayz servers you find on ArmA 2 are those stupid 10000 vehicles ones with military weapons in every corner and everyone shooting everyone else in chernogorsk, that's not survival, that's just glorified deathmatch, either way, I digress. Bohemia probably decided to make the game more accessible for those people, leading to this casualized shadow of what was once great. I could let the whole 'it doesn't seem finished' part slide if they weren't releasing DLC for the parts that aren't finished... You are expecting me to pay 15 bucks for 2 helicopters? When there are barely any in the base game to begin with? And I do agree that all of the future bs thing that I've been saying can be fixed with mods, but modded servers are not popular, and the most modding the general public wants to do is grab one of those all in one mods like dayz. TL;DR: It's a casual version of ArmA 2, designed to cater to the general public. If you want a military simulator, I'd recommend ArmA 2 over this. If you feel like arma 2 was overwhelming, then this is probably the game for you.

review: Animations are more responsive, some of the new things introduced are nice, everything else is terrible. For the time being this game remains unplayable for me due to performance issues, lack of content, seemingly uncaring attitudes by the developers and a portion of the fanbase, and general disinterest in the story of this particular campaign. Unless by miracle I find a monster gaming rig behind my house one day and major changes are done to the game and to people's mindsets, I doubt I will return to this game any time soon. Seeing where this game seems to be headed, I doubt any major changes are coming. I'm quite happy with Operation Flashpoint and ArmA 2 in the meantime and for anyone looking for a good mil-sim or just a fun time with your friends, I suggest you buy one of the two aforementioned games instead of this. EDIT: To clarify, I meant Operation Flashpoint: Cold War Crisis, the first game of the Operation Flashpoint series, which I believe is now called Armed Assault: Cold War Crisis.

review: I loved Flashpoint, but this game has one of the worst singleplayer campaigns EVER! At some points completely unplayable. If you are into singleplayer - don't buy this game. The only thing you can enjoy here is the multiplayer which can be AWESOME at some points and it is the only reason why I have bought this game - at some point I was hoping the campaign will be at least a little enjoyable, but I am very dissappointed now. I don't recommend buying this game until they fix all the issues in the campaign.

review: Whilst being a unique and ambitious game with unparalleled scope and detail, the overly complicated bindings and game-mechanics and lack of any meaningful tutorials for the more complex systems often result in frustration. This game is known for its mod-ability, and whilst this is a blessing given the clunky unpolished state of much of the core mechanics, the number of community mods/ variations of gameplay modes adds to the confusion and inaccessibility of the multiplayer game. The poor optimization also leads to performance issues in multiplayer regardless of system specs. In summary- i want to love this game but its too demanding on my time and patience. This 'game' is for the Hard Core MILSIM fan only.

The sprinting animation is really unrealistic for me and when you play the game on minumin graphics, you get these weird light glitches across the sky. Also for $60, I think is too overpriced. I got the ArmA 2 complete collection for $40 and thats better value. The gunplay in ArmA 2 is somewhat realistic and the running animation is a whole lot better plus you can get DayZ free of charge. Overall im a little dissapointed with ArmA 3, I would've thought it would of been better. 5/10

review: Hi I'm a big fan of Arma's. I have been, since the first release, back when it was called, Flashpoint I believe. And I have spent, Well over 20,000 dollars on Computer upgrades, and probably more then 2000 hours of my time making levels, over the years. All the time thinking, the next patch, will fix the bugs, plaguing this otherwise beautiful game. Most of the levels I created, never worked out because, of the bugs. I would leave, the level work over night, to see how the AI faired, and to check for Stability. It was always the same, You would find the AI, stuck on some tree, fence, or even just a rock. Now, anyone that drives, know how to avoid, and get out of this situation. But the programmers at BIS, must be pedestrians because, after all these years, these devastating bugs, are still, just as obvious in ARMA3. In fact, almost all the things, that make the game useless, are still in the game. The best you can do, is make little missions, keep it simple, and for god's sake, don't let the AI near a vehicle. Most casualties in an Arma missions, are AI vehicles driving over there own guys, and crashing into each other. Then taking shortcuts though the wood and cliffs. It's bad enough, that the men are 3 feet tall.(Really I'm 6'1"), I always think I'm on my knees. The vehicles are drivable, in Third Person only, the windows are to low, can't see out the side windows. That's why, I thing the Guys at BIS, are kids, without driving experience. Then, there's those annoying things,(not bugs) like, every time you go to the map, You come back crouched. The gun is always up in my face, the gun, should only be up, if I put it there. You can't hold a gun, in firing position, they are heavy. this is a terrible thing to do in a game. Any hunter will tell you, it's crazy and unrealistic, and very annoying. The gun, should always be shouldered, On your chest pointing up safely, or Hanging is hands, pointing down safely. Never in my face or anyone else's, unless you intend to shoot them. But AI has always been the main problem, especially driving and taking corners. The map look great, until you try and use them, the buildings are in the street. What happened to the 3 to 6 meters on both side of the road, even front a lawns. So it's not suppressing to see the game all jammed up, on a unrealistic street corner. And AI, don't understand Bridges, So you constantly find them, all stuck at one. I could mention, another 30 bugs, that have persisted in the game, making useless since the beginning. So instead of fixing Arma2, they just added a bunch of new modern stuff, and knocked out all the great stuff, we played for. So we lose all the work we did, NO backwards compatibility? Well I could live with that. If they fixed the plentiful persistent BUGS. If the sandbox, has just a few toy, and they are broken? Why do BIS, continue adding DLC, to add to the insult? (We played for this game, ahead of time, it's still in beta, and generates so many errors, the log have to be turned off, to use it). Why don't they just fix the main bugs, that have always been,(Like AI) , that would be the only thing, anyone could ask for PLEASE. I'm getting tired of wasting my time, making script, and mods, that can't be used, because of bugs in the game. Don't get me Wrong, I love this game, (for what it could be, if they fixed it). I think, it's the best game on the market. (if they fixed it). They just insist on ignoring the faults, and try to mask them, with other stuff. Ohh and FYI Lately everything is reversed, if your man say's enemy on our right, it's actualy left, and even, get in and disembark tag,s are reversed, Effects from some tanks are on the wrong side of the vehicles ? The speed of AI Vehicles, have the Hicups very annoying, and so does the camera, using Switchcamera, it just bounces back anf forth, making the camera views useless. In fact at present date, the game is not usable. This game needs some major repairs, but they just go on, with future features, and let the bugs ADDUP. and up. If your car has a flat tire, painting it, will not fix the problem. That's the way I see it anyway.

review: for the money... well no.. this game is worth 10 times less than what i paid for it. actually i have played phone games more exciting than this. my review for arma 3 is simple, i got it on steam sale, i played it 3 times. and its been pretty bad. - the servers cause FPS lag (because I get 40fps normally on some servers and others it crawls to 9) - the missions are basically to try and troll people - the maps are big and awesome but theres not many people and whoever you see just kills you - its just boring half the time. so if you like just exploring the virtual map and doing jack all half the time then this games for you. but you could be doing that in the real world and have an extra $30 bucks in your wallet (sale price). decisions decisions..

review: Once again Bohemia has delivered a garbage war simulator with mediocre graphics (in comparison to other war shooters in the industry) and optimization worthy of being related to the original release of Crysis 1. I'm using a gtx780, i53750k (3.4ghz), 16gb DDR (1600Mhz) and it ran pitifully. Not to mention the voice acting is once again terrible and robotic sounding and the gameplay is awkward and cumbersome with the worst control scheme in the history of shooter games. I get you're going for realism, but at least try and make it accessible. You don't need crap controls to make the world more immersive; you need smoother controls so that you forget you're even playing a game. You're better off reinstalling Battlefield 2 and downloading "Project Reality" if you really want an immersive War simulator.

The Maps are way too huge for your graphics to run smoothly, I had to turn everything down and even still I was lagging like crazy. I would highly recommend playing the Battlefield series instead of this game because A. You will get more enjoyment and entertainment from Battlefield B. Your computer will be able to run it C. Better vehicle system and lots of weapons to choose from

review: Make Arma Not War
game-hours: 51.7
review: This really is a poor game and should not cost 36, here's why: 1) Recommended system specs are a lie. I could not run the singleplayer campaign above 30fps at 1024x768, lowest everything including draw distance with a FX6300 and HD 7770. False advertising, and also extremely unreasonable hardware requirements. Fanboys will tell you Arma 3 is super advanced etc. so demands a lot of the CPU, but I believe it's just poorly optimised. You can have a lot of units moving about and framerates will stay smooth but as soon as people start shooting performance plummets, so I believe it's something to do with badly optimised effects, not demanding AI (which is pretty poor in any case). Multiplayer performance is even worse and when 20fps is considered 'normal' it's effectively unplayable. People should not accept 20fps due to game restrictions and the dev's ought to really address this. 2) Gameplay is terrible - so bad that it feels like it's buggy rather than poor design decisions. Jogging for about 10 seconds will cause you to start panting and creates extreme weapon sway - maybe they are trying to simulate a Wall-E future of fat soldiers? Again, really kills the gameplay considering the size of Arma 3's missions which require a lot of moving about. Recoil on weapons is ridiculous and feels like your guy is shooting with only one hand with the gun held sideways. Damage is ridiculous, enemy targets will take 2 headshots and some more chest shots to be brought down. It all adds together to completely kill immersion and makes the game feel like a chore. 3) Immersion - Again, keeping in mind how bad the shooting mechanisms are, the AI are utterly gamebreaking as well. You can empty a clip of bullets in a relatively small 1 meter area around an enemy target. He will not budge, he will not flinch, he will just keep on shooting you until you die, and you probably will die because of the awful recoil system in place which makes aiming for the player impossible. The AI are basically terminators who will simply run about from time to time, stand still and then shoot you to death. There is a mod which reduces recoil, and with this mod a player can mow down these AI like fish in a barrel simply because they don't move once they've decided to stop and shoot you. 4) Content - Really really lacking. Okay, they have a single player campaign (which is pretty dull). But what's really bad is that they seem to have left a lot of the content up to the community to develop. There is no ambient combat module in the editor, unlike Arma 2, there is no SpecOps module in the editor, unlike Arma 2, there is no quick mission creator, unlike Arma 2. This makes a huge difference in the game because it means if you want to actually experience the sandbox of the game with AI, you have to either 1) create relatively complex scripts yourself; or 2) download other missions or mods. It's not a pick-up and play game which is disappointing considering Arma 2 was. Arma 3 just goes wrong in so many ways, from the gunplay, to the AI, to the stamina and damage system (basically every aspect of a fps) and the lack easy to use content such as an ambient combat module or quick mission creator, to the incredible system requirements. It really is not worth 36 and, while the futuristic setting is very appealing and graphics look nice, there's no real reason to get this over Arma 2 which is much better overall. Save your money!

review: I have been playing Arma 3 for the past couple days (with the free trial), and I was really concidering buying this game. However, even with all the realistic featues that I love, I cannot stand the fatigue and weapon sway system. After running for 3-4 minutes, a short sprint, or getting nicked by a bullet, it becomes nearly impossible to aim. Even while focusing and holing my breath, the weapon is still moving to dramatically to accuratly hit a target at even a hundred meters with a scope. The army is trained to be able to shoot under stress, fatigue, and even injury. I myself have done 100 meter sprints, and half mile runs, then grabbed my AR immediatly after and can still quickly and accurately hit a man sized target at 100 meters. Also, I only shoot with iron sights. Until this unrealistic fatigue and weapon sway system is fixed, I will not be buying the game. Honestly, what is the point of buying it if I can't even engage the AI, (who, guess what, can still accurately shoot you while injured or fatigued!)

review: No decent manual available. The training in the beginning does not show you how to use the sight on the gun. So, the next step where you have to shoot targets in a field you have to hit one 400 yards away but there's no clear way how to use the sight on the gun. The cross hair on the screen is not accurate enough. Wished it had a better manual because playability is paramount to graphics.

review: Terribly optimised, the only half decent thing to play on it is Altis Life, and no matter what you're doing the FPS seems to stick around 20-25.

review: From my point of view, it's still in early development, years from completion, horrible CPU and GPU-utilization (stutters constantly) not to mention bad PhysX performance (proprietary nightmare) lack of basic weaponry, vehicles, low-res vegetation and textures. The main campaign is full of bugs and glitches (shooting through everything without you ever having a chance spotting them) scenarios are a joke, incomplete, horrible voiceacting and bad audio quality, almost silent all the time, lack of weaponry and content (to much focus on overly expensive dlcs) and the overall experience is cheap, incomplete and you will get the feeling that the developers don't know what the  they were doing back in 2013.

review: I like this game. I played my first FPS years ago starting with Doom and at that time I was blown away, and could never of dreamed of anything better. Boy was I wrong. The next game to capture my imagination was Meadal of Honour and the single player world captured my imagination and heart. With Meadal of Honour came the first real multiplayer action that I enjoyed and I couldn't stop playing. Next game to follow was Call of Duty, a great series of games that offered plenty of run and gun action... Great stuff. The Progression to Battlefield for a more indepth experience blew what came before away. Now Battlefield looked to offer with its later installments a more realistic battle experience, but it fails. infantry are fine but the vehicles,which look great,in my opinion start to ruin the game series. That brings me to ARMA 3,, wow ,, once again I am blown away and once again what came before falls into history. Animations, lighting, movment and the environment are a dream come true. This is a truely epic game.

review: Just awful, a mockery of the advancements in the engine. I have 600+ hours on Arma 3 alone and having just come from A2 and A2:OA I was HUGELY disapointed, the engine, physics and graphics are beutiful, the main map Altis is insanely giant and detailed as all get out. HOWEVER the choices made in development make is a flunk, the AI is the worst thing on this planet, if robocop and Neo from the Matrix had an entire race of super-soldiers it would be these s. Instant headshots from 300m+ first shot. Like being stealthy? Well too bad, the hive mind is immune to stealth. Also A3 has 90's action movie syndrome, everything explodes, even if it shouldn't -Like cars shot with pistols in the tire detonating spontainiously sometime later, or a gental landing with a heli, that results in a comedic nuclear fireball. Speaking of vehicles, the tanks are silly, as they take damage from everything, you can kill one with an APC cannon to the frontal glacis, you know where it's supposed to be able to deflect tank rounds? Do you like guns? Well too bad again! There's exactly ONE rifle, ONE sniper, ONE DMR, ONE pistol and ONE offencive grenade type per faction, so to hell with choice! So in summary, not really diggin' it, lock-on shouldn't be on EVERYTHING and the AI has no reason to be so OP, let alone as bullet-resistant as they are, and the lack of any sort of realilstic armored combat makes this a pass, and saddly so becuase this game was full of potential.

review: Felt like it could have been a very good simulator, but it turned out to be poor. Played through the first part of the campaign and it was laggy in parts (which I have researched is down to poor optimization of the game) and I managed to get the vehicle stuck in a barrier and had to reload from an autosave. Clearly, not well made. I also found the way markers really hard to see. Either don't bother with them, or make them more vivid. I also found it hard to see the enemy, but that's just something I would need to get used to. To top it all off, the landscape is so boring. Nothing but open areas and very little variation or cover. Overall, great potential and if you like spending hours learning to play a more difficult game than CoD/Battlefield, then I've read that Arma 2 is a much better choice. With that being the case, I cannot recommend this game to anyone.

review: The only time it works is if its on the lowest setting (it looks like garbage) and even then its lucky if you get more then 12 FPS unless you have a $4000.00 dollar PC. Its unplayable, feels like garbage, plays like garbage, tons of bugs, nobody actually communicates. Waste of 60$, its barely worth 15. I've givin it tons of chances after each update and its just a huge dissapointment. They robbed everyone blind, its quite funny actually. With that said, during about a 10-30 second period when theres minimal lag you realize what could of been a fantasic game if they actually would fix it instead of making huge half million dollar contests for - you guessed it - more money. Basically, if you have a thousands- of- dollars PC, you MIGHT be able to run it on the lowest settings at maybe 25 FPS if you're lucky. If you're like me and just have a pretty decent PC (Run battlefield 4 on high, Day Z on ultra, War Thunder on Movie settings etc) then steer away from this game. Also, there's only Co-op modes, no competitive unless you join a clan and throw away your social life for your fellow clan-mates. so, no PVP its all players against AI and it gets very boring once you kill everything and theres nothing to do. I've only seen about 20 enemys in all my time playing. If you enjoy sitting around waiting for orders, terrible frame rate, glitching thru objects, doing nothing, then you might like this game

review: The Game was absolutely beautiful to look at, Graphics were on target 100% but if your a first time Arma player the user friendly version is not there. Leaves you completely disoreinted almost immediately. Camera views while inside the vehicle leave you going for the number pad's 0 key a lot. Once outside the vehicle your camera's axis is only in the up down view there is no 360 view here boys/ girls. It does however have the genuine military simulation feel. For the amount of times it use the F-Bomb you'd think you were on a military boat. Hence the term make a sailor blush. All in all I'd give it a 6 out 10.

review: What? Why are you reading the reviews? Why haven't you already purchased this yet? ARMA 3 is the epitome of virtual tactical military-based operations and simulation. In my eyes, this game is not just a simulation of military firefighting and combat; I find this game is a great practice for team-based cooperation and initiative. You need to work together to complete your goal, follow your Team Leader to succeed. There are many game modes that simplify the standard operations so new players will be able to experience the game in a friendly and forgiving environment that allows you to improve your abilities. ARMA 3 is a grand game and I definitely recommend it.

review: The worst. The campaign is lame and lacking, to say the least. I had to restart it because of 'friendly fire' 10 seconds in while I was driving the truck at least 4 times, for no reason...? As soon as you come across enemy forces, which were your allies 10 seconds earlier, you have to shoot them 4 times with your  weapon while they shoot you twice and you're dead and you have to restart from 5 minutes prior, sitting through the same horrible coms talk between leaders. Tried some multiplayer, wouldn't even let me chat to ask them how I can move considering I started as a citizen with my hands cuffed behind my head on a random island no where near anyone or anything... what the  is that? I'm hoping steam will refund my money, this is my most regrettable purchase yet. Don't buy this game.

It's not worth 10! In the near future it may improve; it needs to improve drastically to appeal to me, at least. As a simulator, outstanding. As a game, made to play for enjoyment and having fun, useless. I find more fun in the Call of Duty and Angry Birds franchise. Not Fun! Not Enjoyable! Not Worth It! Bohemia need to up their game or, they will definately, DEFINATELY decrease in sales. Do Not Buy This Piece of Horse Crap.

review: worst arma game in history. it feels more like COD or Battlefield due to when you run you can see your wepon on the screen. the graphics are amazing but the graphics dont make the game. the realism is there due to the new stamina system and in vehicles you need more than one person to make it effective but they really didn't do what they promised like putting the take on helicopters flight model in so the helis feel like VTOL planes when you fly really fast. i also dont like how it is set in the future because it cant be a simulation if it is in a era we have no clue about. and the weapons sound like your firing marsh mellows at people the 50. cal machine gun on the pickup trucks sound so quite when i fire a mounted gun i want to have the feeling that im shooting a 27mm gun with my hands not that im just firing another LMG. finally the NATO forces dont have any jets in the vanilla game but the OPFOR and indpendents do it should be the other way around and also the lack of planes, helis and IFVs is terrible there should be more IFVs than tanks and thats not the case, if i want to take a patrol out im not going to take 2 MBTs and a IFV im more likely to take a MBT and 2 IFVs im patroling not trying to take an airbase. those are the reasons you should not waste 60 dollers on arma 3.

review: Arma 3 is like a sandbox but instead of sand it's full of heavy rocks and sharp objects. The game runs poorly on most computers and is needlessly complex. Unless you want to read an encyclopedia's worth of information and install mods the online is dreadfully boring. However, if you're willing to put anywhere between 2-10 hours learning how the game works and experimenting you can have a  of a fun. With the money you're spending there's no reason you should not give it that opportunity. Stop being lazy.

review: All around excellent game. The campaign was very well put together, the graphics are amazing, the combat very realistic, and the squad movements are very realistic. It does take some time to get used to all the various controls, there are a lot of them, but once you figure it out you can move your squad through any level with ease and destroy everyone along the way. The mod content is getting better everyday! If you like quick PVP then wasteland and the battle royale mods are great for that. Currently they have a "DAYZ" version of Arma3 called Breaking Point that is an independent spin-off that is also quite fun. I personally cannot wait for the Arma3 Epoch (DAYZ) to come out because I have played the Arma2 mods for a while now. There is also Altis Life and Lakeside if you're into the RP scene but that is all preference. Overall, it's a well put together simulator that ex-military, which I am, or civilian with no experience can learn to enjoy and appreciate. --MB

review: This is a very immersive game, with high attention to detail and a seemingly limitless amout of possibilities. Every peice of your gear is changeable... i mean sh*t you can run around the battlefield in nothing but your underwear and a t-shirt if you so please. You can change your camo and helmet and LBV and backpack and every other thing you carry. Everything that is in your inventory can be dropped or moved from bag to LBV or pants/ shirt pockets(and vice-versa). It provides a very similar experience to hardcore milsim airsoft (if thats what you're into... I am into airsoft) without the "Hey call your hits" or "Hey are you dead" BS. You are even able to create your own missions somewhat easily with the in-game mission editor. Anyway I figured I'd share one of my most memorable experiences in any operation in Arma- or any game out there. I was playing on a mission that I created on Stratis(One of the in game maps). I was leading a 10 man assault on Air Station Mike 26. We were all riding in an APC. My gunner was doing great taking out ground troops, and even took out an Ifrit or two. Out of nowhere an enemy hit the APC we were in, popping all left side tires, stoping it dead in its tracks. I immidiately got out and threw a smoke grenade to either side and told my men to disembark. Unfortunately only 2 men made it out before the APC exploded. In that same explosion the 2 men that had made it out were killed. worried, I threw one more smoke grenade and waited for the smoke plume to build and ran straight back behind a small hill, dodging what seemed like the bullets from 1000 angry hostiles. Once behind the hill I healed my self, and radioed in for a helicopter extraction. I waited and waited until the heli showed up. All I could hear above me were the screams of the miniguns that the 2 door gunners were operating, and the swooping of the rotor. The heli flew right over my head and began to circle around the base, taking out enemy after enemy. I knew the helicopter would not last long, as it was simply a helicopter meant for extraction, and not any sort of combat, so I called in an attack heli for some added assistance. After the attack heli started to engage targets I sprinted inside the base behind a large H-barrier. I could see lots of enemies. I quickly engaged one enemy and started to advance to another H-barrier when I was hit. I quickly went prone and healed up, and threw my last smoke grenade inside the base. After about 10 seconds of letting the smoke build I ran up to a building and began to take out target after target, in some sort of spec ops manner(Yeah I was that good). I ran around the base with the supressive fire of the helicopters and cleared the entire base of any threat. After I called in the evac heli and flew myself back to base because the pilot was killed on landing because my area clearing is garbage. It was quite the experience to get the juices flowing. This game never fails to impress, and I still find myself learning new things about it every day.

review: 7/10 Single player is fine. Mods can make SP a fun experience. But once you try MP, that's a solid no unless you play wasteland or on a private server. The FPS on any server running a custom game mode is terrible. It is higly unlikely you will get above 30 FPS on a public server. I can't speak for private servers but if you want to play MP, play wasteland or find a group that has their own not-bad private server. Only recommended because of SP

review: It feels like soldiers who have never played a videogame made ARMA III. This game is the most unintuitive, glitchty mess I've seen in a long time. Simply not enjoyable to play. Annoyingly, it seems so promising as a large-scale shooter, but it just doesn't have the quality to really satisfy that niche. The optimization is abysmal; completely unplayable problems arising from strange performance issues are frustratingly common. There are common glitches that break the game, such as ladders and walls magically killing you. It's not worth the money for this kind of attention to detail. Do not buy ARMA games unless the devs suck your  in return.

review: This game doesn't use all of the cpu cores, same with its predeccesor Arma 2. Bohemia doesn't have the technological skills to fix this problem at all, don't even think their will be a fix I have been waiting for 6 years. No matter what computer you have you will get low fps on the famous multiplayer games like Altis life, so don't be suprised. I am running MSI Z97 Gaming 5 motherboard with an i5 4690k, and a GTX 970 graphics card, 2*4 gigs of ram. My internet connection is perfect I made a technician check it out. The game doesn't work and if you look closely you find all these techniques being used to optimize the game such as going to your libary right clicking on arma from thier to hit the play arma 3 luancher, in the luancher go to advanced and change all your setting's such as malloc which is an important .dll and i tried using them all, i even found another malloc file that has been optimized for arma 3 to no avail. You can even delete the dll folder in arma 3 if you are running win 7 and it will defualt the memory allocation to its specified. Nothing work's the cpu doesn't use 100% usage and this can be seen by running task manager and looking at the cpu usage with the fps on the corner of your game. You might get 60 fps at start up and in some server's, but as soon as you hit a high population count kiss your fps goodbye. Thier is nothing you can do to solve this horrific horrific problem that is the #1 complaint on thier feedback portal, thousand players claim the same sotry. problem People have claimed they get 60fps but I doubt it, and I tell them to turn on thier fps to see it instead of guesing and I am always correct. The game doesn't work and never will work at 10-40fps this is unacceptable performance and in combat situations have 10 fps to play with on a modern computer is a joke, you can't shoot or react what is the point on playing the game.

review: This game is great! Even though it currently has some interface issues, the gameplay is awesome, the mods and different gamemods keep you playing for hours on end, and the graphics look almost real as you see each individual piece of grass sway in the wind... If you like "War Simulation Games" then im sure you will probably get your moneys worth out of this game.

review: Arma 3 isn't a game about Shootin. It's About The Life Of Your Character It's about How Long you Can strive And Live It's About Flyig It's about Driveing It's About Liveing! Forget About Shooting let Your Vehicles Do It For You....This Is what THIS GAME IS ABOUT LADIES AND GENTLEMEN!

review: Such a great military simulator you can't turn your head around in a car to look around where are you supposed to go... A Z-category shooter but you still have to use controls like if it would be StarCraft. I don't play an FPS to use my whole keyboard to issue broken commands. Don't buy this game. For a strategy game there's only horribly-done strategy elements, and for an FPS there's horribly done FPS elements in it. For squads and commanders, buy Battlefield or any other non-garbage tactical shooter, this game is just bad.

review: I hope most if not all of the bugs and issues there are fixed through beta and release. For an alpha it was very impressive but I feel there is still some work to do to make the game the best it can possibly be and with a price of 19.99 ($32.99   24.99) is almost idiotic to pass up. I imagine on full release that price will go to the normal price for a new game on Steam, either 29.99 or 39.99, so get it while its hot.

review: ArmA 3 has industry leading gameplay mechanics, which show a number of improvements. Optimization, graphics, and sound effects have improved considerably, but it still isn't excellent in terms of optimization or sound effects. Steamworks integration is a very nice bonus. It's a better game than ArmA 2, especially when you consider that it's best played in private co-op sessions on custom missions, but it's very disappointing to see that ArmA 3 has no noteworthy game-changing new features. It's a great mil-sim, the core game is very good and better than any other mil-sim, but it's also a poor sequel. The first release has minimal content, which is now expected due to the sudden change of an episodic release. See my full review here:

review: Everything about this game improves on Arma II except for one key point. The game simply does not run. Not on high end machines, not on anything, it is so poorly optimised and coded that no system can run it smoothly (60 fps). Online games lag all the way down to 10-15 fps in cities just because the server code is poorly written and results in server side lag that effects frame rate as well as hit detection. If this game was actually able to run at a decent frame rate that stayed decent online it would be a wonderful game. Until that time i cannot recommend this game.

review: The base game I would give 80/100.....with all the great mods people put together for it I would give it a 90/100. This is due to the fact some of the mods are still.....meh....to say the least. Great game overall and highly suggested to realistic shooter enthusiasts.

review: Like it's predecessor, Arma 3 really raises the bar in the gaming industry. Graphics, Beautiful... Physics, Fluid... Gameplay... Enagaging... You won't find a shooter like it! The number of mods is growing rapidly, and that's what really makes the Arma series what they are today. As with Arma 2, you are purchasing a game, with many separate games embedded for mulitplayer, or singleplayer. Due to the fact that this game is full release, there are no major issues, and it's only recently been available! However I would recommend waiting for a sale or buying this game elsewhere, as I do think 40 is a little steep, atleast for me.

review: The next generation ArmA awed reviewers with promising graphics and an intense single player campaign. What seemed like a would be GOTY quickly has faded away. As people slowly, possibly dreadfully make the switch to ArmA 3 they will see it is a myriad of misfortune. With very little solid content to speak of compared to its predecessor it has left people in want. The game has been an overall disappointment for me, with a lowered sense of viable large scale combat, and very little aircraft to be talked of I was sorely disappointed at Bohemia Interactives next generation game in the ArmA series. The only thing that has made it playable is the limitless community made mods to add things that the developers seemingly forgot from ArmA 2. This causes me to not recommend this game.

review: Feels like I wasted my money. Game looks beautiful, but it got too frustrating when it felt like everyone else was going on with the mission and combat, and I was left looking around for the enemy. Outisde of waiting for some tracers to show up and give the enemy away, my efforts to eliminate my target were futile 99% of the time. I'd use up all my ammunition, and they'd land in a perfect shot, every single time. It got to the point that I would end up sitting back while the AI on my team took care of it- after all, they knew exactly what to do while I'm just sitting there shrugging my shoulders. This is not your typical combat FPS. The controle are wonky, and I spent a hard-earned $60 on frustration. I have a Titan video card. It runs all of my games on maximum settings flawlessly. With Arma 3, it seems like all I do to ajust the graphics settings makes no difference, as I'm hit with major framerate issues. After a few days, I reinstalled the game to give it another chance, but I just couldn't get anything accomplished. I personally don't recommend the game.

The game looks really good for the huge map, and if you have friends to play with the games fun factor completely changes. You can plan operation and do them with your friends and you will feel like you are actually in the army. (But then you realize you sitting on your chair yelling at your friends through the mic.) Everyone should get this game, not just because it is great fun, because it shows true teamwork and co-ordination. Hope this helped with your decision :)

review: A definite upgrade from Arma II, the controls act more like PC controls of the 21st century (not feeling like your wading through pudding when trying to look, strafe, etc.) and the graphics of course are much improved. There have been some issues with PhysX crashes, but only from those with AMD cards in my experience. Sa-Matra wasteland alone is reason enough to pick this up! The only gripe I really have is that they still have not made the client/server multi-threaded. One of the most idiotic things to overlook when the AI calculations and such really make this game/engine heavily CPU-intensive. If you love realistic shooters without all the kill-streak B.S. and handicapping, pick this game up.

review: This game used to be good but since Bohemia which doesnt listen to people have made this game into a drunk simulator 2014 just as they did with walking simulator aka DayZ standalone. They have taken weapon machanics to next level of unrealistic where your soldier has no muscles to control and hold a gun in his hand since it has unrealistic exaggerated sway in a shape of number 8 and will be adding unrealistic inertia into the fact where when you move your weapon even a bit it starts to rock from side to side. They need to stop changing things that werent broken and fix a million other problems in their game. I do like how they spent a lot of time to imrove some stupid door sounds and yet when you wanna open a door you have one of the worst action menus in the world where you have to scroll your mouse to do anything. On their forums they dont like any negative feedback and only wanna hear all praise on how awesome their unrealistic sway and inertia are. I will be uninstalling this game cause its just unplayable especially since this game cant even give you 30fps online and usually goes down to 20fps or worse and then you realise how horrible the sway becomes. Save your money on a finished game and support developers who actually listen to the customer.

The developers for this game are autistic  who have clearly never cared for gameplay in anything, sure you can argue "It's a simulator, not a game" but it's still a "Military Simulator". There is no effort for gunplay whatsoever in this torm of a simulator. All the guns feel the same, bullets never connect where they're supposed to, you run around feeling clunky as  shooting nerf guns at nothing. TL;DR Pros: It's a game Cons: It's a really  game Low/nonexistant FPS  gunplay Models are ugly Server list sucks Just about every game out there is better than this , and that's terrible seeing as there's a full dev team that made this. Just take your $60 and spend it elsewhere, that's all there is to it.

review: Like it's predecessor, Arma 3 really raises the bar in the gaming industry. Graphics, Beautiful... Physics, Fluid... Gameplay... Enagaging... You won't find a shooter like it! The number of mods is growing rapidly, and that's what really makes the Arma series what they are today. As with Arma 2, you are purchasing a game, with many separate games embedded for mulitplayer, or singleplayer. Due to the fact that this game is full release, there are no major issues, and it's only recently been available! However I would recommend waiting for a sale or buying this game elsewhere, as I do think 40 is a little steep, atleast for me.

review: Such a great military simulator you can't turn your head around in a car to look around where are you supposed to go... A Z-category shooter but you still have to use controls like if it would be StarCraft. I don't play an FPS to use my whole keyboard to issue broken commands. Don't buy this game. For a strategy game there's only horribly-done strategy elements, and for an FPS there's horribly done FPS elements in it. For squads and commanders, buy Battlefield or any other non-garbage tactical shooter, this game is just bad.

review: I hope most if not all of the bugs and issues there are fixed through beta and release. For an alpha it was very impressive but I feel there is still some work to do to make the game the best it can possibly be and with a price of 19.99 ($32.99   24.99) is almost idiotic to pass up. I imagine on full release that price will go to the normal price for a new game on Steam, either 29.99 or 39.99, so get it while its hot.

review: Great military simulator, which will make you play for many hours with all the stuff do. The game looks really good for the huge map, and if you have friends to play with the games fun factor completely changes. You can plan operation and do them with your friends and you will feel like you are actually in the army. (But then you realize you sitting on your chair yelling at your friends through the mic.) Everyone should get this game, not just because it is great fun, because it shows true teamwork and co-ordination. Hope this helped with your decision :)

review: Summary: Tensions rise as NATO peacekeeping forces begin to leave The Republic of Altis: a strategic fault-line between crumbling European influence and a powerful, resurgent East. But when a key radar facility drops off the grid, a Mediterranean flashpoint risks escalating into global conflict. Also Gameplay: The engine is a big step up over ArmA 2. Things like the adjustable stances, dynamic fog, physics and underwater terrain add tons of possibilities in the game. Setting: This is one of my major problems with the game. Sci-fi and simulation don't mix well. While I know that everything in the game is possible, the fact remains that most vehicles and weapons are pure speculation. The equipment not being used in present day armed forces partly kills the immersion for me. Hopefully ACE mod will fix this. SP content: The campaign (so far) is awesome. BI managed to improve the storytelling and the gameplay as well as the realism. MP: performance in MP can be horrible, depending on the gametype and server. I don't often find populated servers with interesting gametypes, as there only seem to be 2 popular gametypes on public servers. Collapse

review: The Game does have some pretty minor glitches but other than that Arma 3 is a great game for community development. Dev's out there create some pretty fantastic mods and addons for the games because of the huge open world maps and functions Bohemia Interactive provides in Arma 3. Many people buy this game just for the AMAZING addons to the game which allow very unpredictable scenarios to happen. Arma is Intriguing to me because the game is UNPREDICTABLE. Games that are unpredictable are more of a way for players to choose how they play and gives a slight immersion. There can be scenarios where you see a heli crash onto a building which is 100 meters away and that building had one of your best soldiers now knocked out waiting to ambush the enemy who is surrounded with OPFOR. What do you do? Arma is fantastic because its your choice of how you want to play the game where other games have straight up orders to do stuff, why would you want to do that? I would give this game a 9/10

review: Arma 3 is a Side-Scrolling 2D Platformer developed by EA. In the games' main mode (competitve), you play as one of two factions; the Terrorists, crazed madmen who seek to destroy the world by unleashing ravenous chickens infected with the Ebola virus, and the Counter Terrorists, who desire to stop the fowl plague. Armed with $800 and their wits, players seek out the various chicken sites and fight over control of the worlds destiny.

review: For what this game tries to be (Which is a war simulator) it fails misserably at that. The movement is clunky, the A.I Is dumb and overpowered as hell. So if you get into this game being all like "Yeah, this is what war is like, this is realistic and really precise" Then sorry. You need to get out in the real world pall. Because I don't consider a game that when you shoot the enemy in the head they are able to do a 180 turn and shoot you 3 times in the head before dying very realistic. Same goes for boosting of stairs when walking down from them to quickly and breaking your legs. This game is however one of the funniest games I have ever played with friends. The amount of vehicles, the guns, the destructible enviorment. The overall map is not to shabby either. If you get this game for fun gags with friends and just cause overall chaos then this game is perfect for that. If you get it to play it as a serious war game then i'd say the clunky motions and faulty A.I ruins that emediatly

review: If you enjoyed Codemasters Operation Flashpoint in 2001, then you will absolutely love ARMA III. ARMA III takes place on two different islands: Altis & Stratis. Stratis is 19 square kilometers (7.3 sq. km), with few roads and rugged forested terrian. Altis, on the other hand, is huge at 270 square kilometers (104.2 sq. mi.), with lots of roads and terrian of mostly rolling hills. However, only ~5% of the roads on Altis are paved. There is a lot of detail put in this game, including some indigenous fauna, such as snakes, rabbits, goats, dogs, insects, and a wide variety of fish and other sea critters. They do not do anything but move around, but it adds to the realism. Did I mention snakes? There are a huge number of snakes on Altis. Movement is not restricted. Meaning, you can move anywhere you like. Including using a re-breather to dive off the coast of either island to investigate ship wrecks, just for kicks. There are lots of vehicles to choose from, both civilian and military. Weapons, ammunition, and equipment can be taken from the dead. However, only take what you can carry during the missions. If you put anything in vehicles they will disappear once you return from your required mission or scouting mission. You will only be allowed to keep the items you are actually carrying. The game includes a single-player campaign broken into three episodes: Survive = 8 required missions, plus 6 optional scouting missions Adapt = 9 required missions, plus 8 optional scouting missions. Win = 6 required missions, no optional scouting missions. When you complete the first required mission for each episode, return to base, and told to report in  don't. If you report in, then you will be assigned the next required mission. Instead, go to where a group of your fellow soldiers are standing/sitting, and listen to what they have to say. This is how you get optional missions. Then go off on a scouting patrol to complete the mission, if you so desire. When you have completed your scouting mission(s), then return to base and report in for your next required mission. All the missions, except for the last one, are linear and static. Meaning, nothing you do will change the course of events. Except for the last mission. In the last mission you have to make a decision, and that decision will determine the outcome of the mission. There is a steep learning curve, and that can get a little frustrating at the beginning. If you are new to ARMA III, then I recommend enabling the Save Games in the Game Options settings and save often to help alleviate that frustration. The Survive missions are all solo, so you have time to adapt and learn the controls. The Adapt and Win missions team you up with a fireteam at your command. By the time you complete the campaign (~30 hours) you should be familiar with giving your fireteam commands, both individually and as a group. ARMA III is more than just a First-Person-Shooter, it is a first-person combat simulator. The weight of your equipment is taken into consideration and will effect your movement and endurance. The three different stances (prone, crouching, and standing) will effect how much your weapon recoils, which will effect how quickly you can target an enemy. Standing while trying to hit a moving target at 1,000 meters is not recommended. ARMA III allows user-developed mods, and also includes DLCs. Once you have completed the campaign, and want more single-player or multiplayer campaigns, then I recommend subscribing to the Dynamic Universal War System in the Steam Workshop. The DUWS mod will randomly create new campaigns, with as many missions as you desire. The goal of the campaign is always the same  control of the island. There are still some minor bugs that need to be worked out, but it is very playable as is. I definitely recommend ARMA III.

review: My ARMA Story, I was a war jornalist for BBC news and I was assigned to report the war efforts of NATO forces on Stratis. When was I was on base, I was invited to tag along "Bravo 1-1" and they insured me of my safety. So, we hoped on the Ghosthawk and headed north of the Island. The men of Bravo 1-1 were very speechless along the ride as if they were getting ready for the worst and this concerned me because what could be worst than getting shot at? As we have landed, Bravo 1-1 had begun advancing towards a town near the coastal line. I try to keep up with them, but the smooth task force squad effectively glided every inch of the way as they scan for enemies. Once we've reached the coast, we were already taking shots by enemy fire from over the horizon. Bravo 1-1's squad leader, callsign "Toast", yelled my name while firing his weapon saying,"GET TO COVER!!!!". I ran towards his safety only because I was in shock and did not know what to do. He completely disapproved of my reaction and lead me to the nears wall. After a couple of minutes of the violent firefight which felt like hours, a loud count down appeared, "5...4...3...2...1..." and a bright white flash blinded us. BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOMMMM A NUCLEAR MISSILE EXPLOSION!!!!! A large mushroom cloud had risen into the sky causing and blocking the sun. Everything was so shocking and sudden! All communications were just filled with confusion. Luckliy we were far away enough from the blast zone. Finally, the mushroom cloud had disappeared and we were ordered back to homebase for a debriefing. Thanks Bravo1-1 and Toast for the great online cinematic ride. From, Paddington

The game includes a single-player campaign broken into three episodes: Survive = 8 required missions, plus 6 optional scouting missions Adapt = 9 required missions, plus 8 optional scouting missions. Win = 6 required missions, no optional scouting missions. When you complete the first required mission for each episode, return to base, and told to report in  don't. If you report in, then you will be assigned the next required mission. Instead, go to where a group of your fellow soldiers are standing/sitting, and listen to what they have to say. This is how you get optional missions. Then go off on a scouting patrol to complete the mission, if you so desire. When you have completed your scouting mission(s), then return to base and report in for your next required mission. All the missions, except for the last one, are linear and static. Meaning, nothing you do will change the course of events. Except for the last mission. In the last mission you have to make a decision, and that decision will determine the outcome of the mission. There is a steep learning curve, and that can get a little frustrating at the beginning. If you are new to ARMA III, then I recommend enabling the Save Games in the Game Options settings and save often to help alleviate that frustration. The Survive missions are all solo, so you have time to adapt and learn the controls. The Adapt and Win missions team you up with a fireteam at your command. By the time you complete the campaign (~30 hours) you should be familiar with giving your fireteam commands, both individually and as a group. ARMA III is more than just a First-Person-Shooter, it is a first-person combat simulator. The weight of your equipment is taken into consideration and will effect your movement and endurance. The three different stances (prone, crouching, and standing) will effect how much your weapon recoils, which will effect how quickly you can target an enemy. Standing while trying to hit a moving target at 1,000 meters is not recommended. ARMA III allows user-developed mods, and also includes DLCs. Once you have completed the campaign, and want more single-player or multiplayer campaigns, then I recommend subscribing to the Dynamic Universal War System in the Steam Workshop. The DUWS mod will randomly create new campaigns, with as many missions as you desire. The goal of the campaign is always the same  control of the island. There are still some minor bugs that need to be worked out, but it is very playable as is. I definitely recommend ARMA III.

review: Arma 3 is an interesting game with all the god awful driving physics for the trucks... But hey! let's get past that one con. Arma 3 in general is a frun game, But when you have friends that play it, when i first bought Arma 3 i played scenarios and got bored as hell in ten seconds flat, but when you really get into it and start playing Altis Life and make a gang with your friends and do all that kind of stuf like my friends and i do all the drug dealing, it really hits how the fun this game is, and how pretty it is depsite the driving physics.... 8/10 realy fun game Pros: Gameplay Altis Life Online Multiplayer Cons: Physics Single PLayer

review: Played this over a free access weekend, I have a high-end gaming rig so no problems there - liked what I saw. I really wanted this game, but decided to do some research before I pulled the trigger. I really wanted a game that would let me play with modern vehicles. I couldn't wait to jump in an Abrams or Apache or a Leopard 2 or a T-90... or jump in a Tunguska to try and shoot down a A-10. I had visions of massive armored battles with supporting infantry, artillery and drones oh my! All with badass graphics, and realism only a simulator can give - beyond the laughable dumbed down versions found in the likes of Battlefield and CoD. THEN I came across screenshots of what initally looked like a Russian Mi-28 Havoc (Sweet!) With... the dual contra-rotating main rotor blades of a Ka-50 Hokum?! Apparently, Arma III, much vaunted "hardcore military simulator" doesn't even have real-world vehicles in it. Fantasy island nations with ficitious governments to battle in I can handle. Completely made-up armored vehicles, tanks and helicopters in a supposed high-end military 'simulator'? No Thanks.

review: I say no simply because the Arma 3 main game multiplayer (Including Wasteland) feels like it is still in Beta with the amount of bugs, glitches, lag etc. It is worth it for the Mods Takistan Life and Altis Life but i still wouldn't pay 35 for it. If its going cheap and your tempted? Get it, otherwise avoid it. I still enjoy Arma 2 more its smoother.

review: The game looks good, the audio is fantastic and the style of play when considering other FPS is very authentic. The mission designs and training are great and well thought out. I can clearly see why many people are taking to this game franchise as it provides a much more realistic diversion then one would get from CoD etc. So why am I giving this a negative review? Because this game does something with its control format that I just do not like. In an effort to make the game more realistic the developers provide too many customization options for the keyboard. It took me roughly 1.5 hours to tweak the controls to the point where it was halfway playable and even then because you have a button for what feels like everything, it isnt smooth. I know some will disagree with me but despite the unrealistic approach to the CoD etc franchises one thing I feel they always get right is how intuitive they make the controls feel. That is really the best way I can describe it. I can say from experience that with enough training and practice weapons manipulation, tactics, movement etc becomes second nature and smooth despite the chaos that a battlefield provides. It has to be said this game gets most things right, but whatever fun or joy there is to be found in it (in my opinion anyway) is taken away by an overly complicated controls layout.

review: Software is buggy, I'll get stuck between water and land and have to restart the level. Also, I can do 2 direct head shots and nothing happens but, the character can take a single hit anywhere and die; this is on novice. If I take a differnt path, the level gets hung, and nothing will progress unless the level....again has to be restarted. My team members will have super human powers and they take off leaving me in the dust, while my character never recovers from exhaustion. I understand they try to make this a realistic as possible to being a foot soldier but, I spend most of the time "walking" from one end of the map and back. I wish they did more R&D before releasing this and spent more on combat; I wish I could have my $ back.

review: Arma 3, yes. A huge game with lot of fine stuff in it. Its really fun to play actually..... BUT; you gonna reconize very soon what ruins this game again: - if you think you put 1500 into a gaming machine and though arma would run proper.... forget it.... in singleplayer you wont get troubles, but in multiplayer. Some server run with 50 players or more, and thats simply too much for this game. Gotta be honest it depends on the mod you play, but compared to singleplayer its a huge framedrop-difference. - as you noticed, its 2014..... this games has bugs that takes you back in the 90s..... it seems to me as its still in alpha, maybe beta now; 45 aint justifiable!!!! ..... and for sure not the dlc that includes 2 chopper for 13..... cmon, the community can make better add-ons and doesnt want any money for it! - if the fun isnt ruined by the stuff i already mentioned, it will after you noticed youre hard work was wasted by a hacker. You need to seperate a good gamer and the fact that 3rd person can be very tricky if used smart or the fact that its not like hitting stuff in COD or it can take up to 5 bullets or even thermal-attachments was used, with a hacker-child that uses god-mode and hits anything with his aimbot..... or even more annoying stuff like finish a whole game by probably 1 click...... 80 peoples will lose all their stuff by 1 hacker..... how can bohemia make it that easy to hack its game?.... im not talking about a hacker once a month....... if you have some game experience after a while (im personally talking about 600h+) you will notice them in almost ANY SERVER!!! and dont think they get caught...... steam wont support your work with finding and banning the hacker... of course not .... its like "hmm the more hacker there are, the more player dont wanna play this game anymore.... and what will they do? ..... buy a new steam-game!!!!! perfect lads"..... this game is death, good bye!

review: Overview: Arma III, such a beatiful game and it's also really fun! Enjoy Arma as it is, or try out one of it's many fantastic mods. Arma is known for modding in the community, along with countless other addons to the game for free. The DLC for this game is fantastic and should really be considered when buying the game. Overall I think Arma is a game that needs more contrIbuters and with that we could see many new exciting mods and gameplay that you can't find anywhere else. It's worth every dollar and even more worth it for the communiy gameplay that can come from it. REVIEW: Arma is a beatiful game, the graphics are fantastic and all. Although for $60 price tag, you will need alot more than that if you are looking at running the game at a reasonable framerate and trying to insure that the game can look at its finest. Another fault of this game is the campaign, boring and preety much a waste of time and resources by the developers. I believe the resources put into the campaign would have helped the multiplayer much more. Multiplayer, what we are all here for right? The multiplayer aspect of this game is just briliant! Is roleplay your thing, running away from the cops or getting into high speed pursuits - growing cannabis or mining salt, the roleplay game mods have it all. Or do you think you would enjoy king of the hill, on a massive server and trying to control a centre objective with 3 small army's fighting to the last man to take control. I do think if you don't already own this game, just get it! 8/10

review: When it comes to writing a review for this game, I really don't even know what to say. This series has always been a go to for me, basically since the beginning of my PC gaming days, I was playing OFP in 2001. Over the years this series has entertained me longer than any other i've ever played. There is absolutely no competition to ArmA, no game/simulator comes even close to what arma has to offer, or even comes close to the gameplay experience ArmA has. As any ArmA veteran knows, there is some humps you need to tackle to get use to the game. It's not a game a where you can just join a server and play like battlefield or red orchestra. That's not how the game is structured. It's not a game where you can play it natively, it is not designed in a structured gameplay style what-so-ever. This isn't a game where you can play by yourself( Well, you could...). It's hard to explain to the average-gamer what this game is about. It's a platform and if you're playing it without utilizing the very nature of the game is not going to result in the ideal experience you have heard about. You need to have a community of players, small or large, and 3rd party content to form the game into the GAME you want this PLATFORM to be. The average content pack is at least 10gb, but you should expect 20+gb of content. The game is designed to be modified. Arma 3 has no asset content and ArmA 2 is merely a skeleton of a game body. Explaining to the average player that they need to download a special program and install 10s of gigabytes of content is difficult, it sounds like hard work. Your average player doesn't want to 'work' to get the game into a playable state. That's understandable, but that's not what this game is about. It's so versatile for a reason, so groups of people can make the game exactly how they want it. It's really almost too much to explain, all I can say is that if you give this game a chance, and you put in the work for the first time around to set it up, it's amazing. It is absolutely unmatched. Almost every issue you are going to hear about this game comes down to user error. If people are complaining about the AI, and the futuristic content( or the lack of content), that is entirely because they are not using the game to it's potential. If you don't alter the game meant to be altered, you're going to have a bad experience. The same concept can be applied to performance. I'm sure if you've looked up ArmA, you're probably wondering if you can run it. It is true that arma is a heavy game to run, but that usually is not the source of the problem. 90% of the people complaining about lag are running the game on weak computers that just cannot run arma. The game is not considerably unoptimized, it does have some networking issues, but they are hardly the cause of any major performance problem. This is an intensive game, 5 years ago you could not even dream to see what arma is providing. In a couple years, it will be much more easy to run given the bound-to-happen advancements in hardware. It also comes down to the mission maker and the server hoster, if you don't run your servers right, you are going to give your players bad performance. This game does not babysit you, and you should not expect it to. If you know what you are doing, and you have a decent computer, you will run this game with no problem at all. I hope you take the time to try it, and don't blame everything you are uncapable to do on Bohemia. There is very few things I can say that have made an impact on my life that aren't real, maybe 1 other game out of the hundreds that i've played. ArmA is one of those, there is some great, hilarious experiences in ArmA that I think I will remember the rest of my real life. Not many games can do that.

review: To have fun in this game you MUST work with your teammates. Communication makes this game fun (or funny, you'll meet great guys on this game). Going somewhere alone if the most boring expierence you'll have. Get to that city with all your teammates and find a town to take over, plan your assault then execute. You might be able to get some good mods on this game too (Battle Royale, Breaking point) that will only expand your game expierence. When you first start off your frames will be absolute crap, google stuff to find fixes, you just have to change some stuff in your game files. Stick to certain servers too. They may be the only ones with good frames/those cool guys you were playing with earlier. All in all you gotta trust my review because i only write long reviews for games im passionate about. Single Player: Creates that epic feel that multiplayer has, with a story. 8/10, a little clunky Multi-Player: Epic stuff. Great community. You can let that tactical guy out of you that says "Tango" or "Hostile" instead of enemy. 10/10 Mod support, in-depth video settings. Overall: 9/10 game. Does not deserve to sit in your library and rot.

The Game itself is a very tactical war simulation but not only that, you can play with thousands of mods for that game and missions, etc. Graphic: - Very nice graphics - One year old graphics but are still as good as new games Gameplay: - Simple Steerings - Easy driving and flying - Sometimes unreal physics (flipping cars, sadly no/not much weigth physics in cars,trucks,choppers and planes) - You can do almost everything e.g. Wasteland, Braking Point, Altis Life, King of The Hill, Battle Royale (and many more) But all in all i can highly recommend this game, me and my friends had and have a lot of fun with this game.

The game is full of bugs and the controls are all backwards. Half the time I find myself looking at settings when I'm actually trying to open a door.

review: I have been a fan of tactical shooters for as long as I can remember, my first one being the original Rainbow six and all of its additions. Hidden and Dangerous, Ghost Recon, And the game that spawned this one Operation Flashpoint. As buggy and screwed up as that game was I was still able to eveintually play it. Not the case with this game. There is no excuse for the graphical bugs and gameplay issues present in this game. There has been ample time for this game to be optimized and yet it is still a mess. I am able to play every graphic intensive game out there on my system yet this one is barely playable. It seems some people have been able to get it to work but no luck here. This is unfortunate as it looks like I would love this type of gameplay based on my history however looks like I'll never find out since I can't even get it to run properly.

Positive Punkte: - Grafik In meinen Augen ist Arma III komplett in die Hose gegangen.

If you are the kind of person that wants to have the capacity to create an infinite variety of scenarios for yourself as I am, this is a great game to play. The game is difficult and brutal, you can freely make your characters look like a civilian or a hardcore military operative. You have a staggering amount of freedom in this game and lots of strategic options involving vehicles including ATVs, helicopters, tanks, and even UAVs. The maps are extremely large and the game does not fail to deliver on any point.

review: Besides the fact your enemies turn into slender man everytime you shoot them, this game is by far best arma besides combat operations and arma 2 but graphics do matter cause in low settings on arma 3 is like medium on arma 2. Also this game is very futuristic in a way the CSAT are the closest thing to the modern day terrorists and the AAF are your greek resistance the only modern thing in this game is NATO they use commanche helis, MRAPs, Ghost hawks, and who ever is wondering whats a ghost hawk? it was the prototype heli used to transport the navy seals to kill osama. Finally the game modes are crazy fun like escape from stratis and they have steam workshop so you can download missions instead of making one your self they also have pvp but due to desync it wont be as fun as playing coop with friends. The campaign in this isnt like the one from previous armas its more dynamic it tells the story of how NATO is being attacked by AAF and the CSAT i wont spoil anything because this is a review not the campaign

A good server I play on is end days. 217.23.7.117:2302 This is a great server with lots of good role play, enjoy it!

review: This game used to be so fun, now I spend an hour or more getting started on my character only to be killed and have to start over. If you have alot of time to blow doing absolutely nothing then this is the game for you.

review: This game is such a piece of . Come on Bohemia, learn some  from your previous mistakes. The snipers are near impossible to use due to the dramatic weapon sway even when laying on the ground after 10 minutes. My player is tired after 10 seconds of sprinting and my game seems to run the same on ultra settings as it does on all low. The Arma engine is absolutely terrible and needs to be completely re-done. The ing go karts drive like  like the rest of the ing vehicles. I run over a wooden fence and my car blows up. The dumbest  will really piss you the  off in this  waste of money.

review: This game is just wonderful, it is beautifully done, very good and magnificent. It is a bit hard to play, but not as hard as Arma 2. So I recommend this game for everybody and seriously, you should rather buy Arma 3 than Arma 2. :D
