review: Game of the year simulator. If you're thinking about buying a game and you don't have GTA5 you basically need this game. BEWARE you need a pretty fast computer to keep up, the game is cheap in comparison to what you might need to spend to get it running but I can play it on a Radeon HD 5870 1GB without much fuss so the fact that it can run on 2009 hardware is pretty impressive. No complaints in the optimization department. I must say, the PC options are fantastic. There is a LOT of tweaking to do, especially in regards to the controller and keyboard settings in addition to the expansive performance tweaks. My favorite part is having a keyboard and mouse and gamepad in front of me and when the game gets to an intense shooting part I can put down my controller and use the keyboard/mouse and start shooting without having to go to a settings menu and change anything. It just works. It's perfect. The gameplay itself needs no introduction. You can do pretty much anything. Even online play is pretty good, first time I played two guys were in an airplane and nosedived right into me while on foot and everyone died. 10/10

I just love this game, the heists, the missions.. everything! 10/10 and it's running smooth. :) Pros: Beautiful graphics and city 3 character switch Smooth gameplay Hours of fun GTA online. Cons: Rockstar social club integration itself. Taking a long time to load sometimes.

review: Well, I played GTA V before on PS3 and I loved every moment of it, I played it allot on PS3, about 75 hours on story mode and 80 hours on multiplayer. It's not much but as I said, I liked it a lot. So... the moment we have been waiting for! Grand Theft Auto V on PC! I bought it again for PC because I want get the best experience that this game can give and play with my best friends that have only PC. I have GTX 780 Ti and it runs well on it, decent fps. Story mode is great and characters are even better (like in every R* games). In this game, we will have 3 main character: [A bit of spoilers] Michael De Santa; a retired bank robber, who, after making a deal with the FIB, moves alongside his family to Los Santos, where they live in a nice mansion. Franklin Clinton; a young man who dreams of becoming big-time in Los Santos, in a world where the glory days of street gangs has long passed. He works as a repo man for a car dealership, but his ambition makes him tired of the job. Trevor Phillips; is a mentally unstable guy and bank robber. A former military pilot, he based himself in Sandy Shores, where he founded "Trevor Philips Enterprises", which mainly deals with weapons and drugs. (He's my favourite character). Grand Theft Auto: Online Multiplayer with a lot of stuff to do (if it works). Game Modes: Free Mode - my favourite thing to do in this game! Deathmatch Race (including standard, GTA and Rally modes) Capture Survival Hold Contend Raid Parachuting You can have fun killing civilians or just chill and ride your car around beautiful places (what I like to do). Heists are additional GTA: Online missions that you can complete with your friends or with random people. It's really cool and a lot of fun, you will probably enjoy it! So the conclusion is that you must have this if you're a PC gamer, as this game has almost everything (killing to racing). The verdict is a "Must have" game that you will enjoy playing alone or with friends. As I said thousands of times, it is fun and epic! Enjoy and have fun!

review: Rockstar shows one more time how to build a masterpiece. GTA V is not perfect but has everything you'll ever dream in a sandbox game. San Andreas is gorgeous and full of life, Trevor, Michael and Franklin are a trio full of charisma and the game simply raises the bar in so many aspects. It's worth your money, it's worth your time.

review: April 14, day when I quit my job, April 14, day when GTA 5 was released for real xD April 14, day when I stop having xXx <3 with my wife, couse game have so much thrill ! Ok now about review : Grand Theft Auto V is a spectacular third person free roaming game which does well in portraying everyone's guilty pleasures, whether that is slaughtering innocents, exploding cop cars with RPGs, murdering hookers or taking a trip to the local strip club. Grand Theft Auto has always been amongst the greatest free-roam shooters of all time, and it continues that legacy here with GTA V. The online experience and racing have been greatly improved and the story features three playable protagonists rather than the traditional one. In the story of Grand Theft Auto V, you play as three very different characters, with three different, distinctive personalities. First is Michael, a retiree from the illegitimate business of bank robbing and a family man with tons of family problems. Next is the young blood, Franklin. Straight outta the hood and looking to make a living without having to look over his shoulder every step of the way. Lastly is Trevor, the truly psychotic man with no regards for human life. Everyone that plays GTA V instinctively chooses a favorite character, whether it is Michael, because you want to see him get his family back on track, Franklin, because you want to see him create a future for himself, or Trevor, because you too enjoy killing drunken rednecks. Regardless you must play as all three, and the greatest feature that separates the campaign of Grand Theft Auto V from all others is the bank heists. Plan and execute heists, whether you choose stealthy or an all out blood bath, choose your crew which ultimately decides the payout you receive from each heist and enjoy every detail and heist you can. The story is well worth the price of buying the game, but it comes with an added bonus. GTA Online. Although GTA Online had a rocky start with several issues, it is for the most part fixed today, and a very fun experience to play with friends. In the beginning their were terrible servers, problems involving created characters being deleted and now the mission payouts being much lower than early release, and replaying them pays out even less. Along with most others, I am still awaiting for heists in multiplayer, which very well may never come, but regardless GTA Online is still fun. You still have the ability to run around and kill others, as well as civilians, but instead of that simplicity, you can now customize your character, his vehicles, and even where he lives. You earn money through online missions and other methods that helps you pay for newer vehicles, apartments, weapons and clothes. You create your own character and literally choose his skills, which you can later improve. Grand Theft Auto always has great replay value, gamers still play San Andreas and GTA IV, and of course, several thousand still play GTA V. After the story is over, you can always free roam, and when you get tired of wandering aimlessly, the multiplayer is great to play for long periods of time. Gain satisfaction improving your vehicles and purchasing a high end apartment. I only have one little note about this game, NOT FOR KIDS. Seriously, if you are even the least bit immature, or offended by violence, language or sexual content, please do not buy this game, and don't buy it for kids either. A great game but it's worth waiting for, especially if it will traumatize you, or turn you from innocent, into a kid that spews foul language. Overall a masterpiece.

review: Played it for a few hours on PC. I have to say I definitely prefer it on the PC over the console version, it seems to run much smoother, looks nicer, the controls are easy, driving is definitely a HUGE improvement compared to GTA IV where that was just awful all together. Rockstar definitely proved me wrong, after the amount of rage I went through on GTA IV and how much of a crappy PC port it was along with all the buggy video editor errors, all of that seems to be fixed in GTA V PC with a tidier video editor and less buggy overall. Oh and no more GFWL! YES! Well done, Rockstar. Definitely worth buying.

review: This is one of those games that nail that sweetspot of RP [Roleplaying] and the perfected multiplayer that is in GTA V. Personally in these games I go for that and its typically hard for me to find games that are like this that my friends and I enjoy playing. GTA before [so GTA IV] hit the perfect spot of relying on the community of mods to keep it interesting and multiplayer which was fantastic. I think in these kind of reviews it's important to mention its predecessors and judge them to see exactly how far they have come. GTA IV was fantastic but abit buggy alot of glitches to be exploited and kinda fell short in that RP aspect as I saw it. Pros: -Alot more to do in the terms of Role Playing and in terms of multiplayer alot more for the player to strive for which is a key aspect in keeping a player immersed and infactuated with a game alot of the reason why Skyrim and such are still so played - The multiplayer is done really well no ports or anything to have a server just for you and your friends to screw around in - Roleplaying has that optional feature that it isnt necessary to have rely on like in Skyrim. There is that feeling that you can have it with friends aswell the game is what you make of it and I LOVE IT - The asthetics are supremely adjustable more than alot, even most games have out there and helps catch the eye that just give you that itchy finger for screenshots - Friends, if you have any this is a game that can just be played for screwing around in a sandbox feel and keep the game anticipating which most games don't do - The game literally is just for  and laughs there are some many things in this game that just make fun of other things in media which keep the game hilarious and fun to play - The story mode is well done but not alot of replay value and is fun just for a story mode with good characters and voice acting that aren't heard in every single game you play like troy baker as the main voice actor helps make it diverse - Online and Singleplayer are easy to switch to and from with easy access to players etc. - The ingame recording is a nice and good feature to have that makes the game feel a complete package which helps complete that 60$ feeling to a game such as this - PC Master Race> Console Beta Testing Cons: - Public servers suck like public restrooms when you enter one you non-stop get killed and robbed, etc. and it seems that no matter what when you leave an activity you automatically enter one unless you set it to make your own private server - When you are in a public server when someone talks in it it goes across all the server there should be some limiting proximity to this because it is just plain mic spam when someone is talking. - The damage system for cars is kind of short cars give way super fast unless you buy armor for it [in about like 100 levels] which sucks and gives the feeling of buying cars just plain dumb - Killing in the game is a bit realistic and a bit stupid a combonation of both which could be easily fixed when you shoot at someone they take about awhole round in anywhere but the head - Cop are extremely accurate and actually do stuff which is good in the sense never do something bad or the cops will come eat you, but its done in away that if you do something like run over a headlight they chase you. This drags away from the initial feel of GTA in my opinion - The  LOADING there are so many loading screens that take awhile to through even with the game optimzation - The game is the most demanding game I've played ever which makes it hard to have fun and not worry about your fps the whole time and that sucks major cohoanez (i run a 970 and still get 42 fps and some points) - Game invites there are so many of them and that little DING that you get when you are playing sucks  cause its so damn frequent and sucks, i know there is the setting to pretty much turn it off but you can't from my experience when playing with friends With all of these pros they do outweigh the cons in the game in away that yes if you look closely at the game every second you will notice but otherwise if you play the game normally you won't most of the time. This all being said i find the game to still be fun with and without friends hours and hours of gameplay in and will proly delve hundreds upons thousands of hours in the game with friends, mods, and gameplay enjoyment. With so much to do and work toward it keeps the game perfect. This is a perfect game that was worth the wait and everything is lovely and asthetic as a hot girl in the sun.

review: I couldn't enjoy this game on a console, but maybe it's even better because I was familiarized for the first time with GTA V on PC. The game is well optimized and polished, didn't notice many bugs yet, the graphics are stunning, even at medium settings. The gameplay is way more developed in comparison to GTA IV and the story is promising to be very interesting. I don't regret any cent I spent for this game. Totally worth it.

review: At least it runs well on my PC. Game itself is good. Looks a lot better than it does on my nephews PS4. Unlike the GTA4, at least this one is not horribly optimized. This review would have been a positive had not a certain petty even occured. The moderators of this game are trolls. They ruined my perfect steam account with several bans. I was locked out of steam for a few days pending ban. I wrote a petty post stating "Too bad P!r*t3s are enjoying the game while we are just stuck with a preload." That comment resulted in ban. Then I got in more trouble for contesting it resulting in a temporary lock out of my steam account. Forget about steam support. They don't answer calls, and the ticket is a week old. Maybe I should not have wrote it, but I don't think it was worthy of a ban of any sort. Bottom line don't even say the word P!r*t3 or any other related word in any way. Not even in the old definition before we had internet. You could say a racial slur, and nothing will happen to you, you say p*r*cy and bann. Seriously though is steam becoming as evil as EA? PS. They keep deleting this review. So my truth must be getting to them. I keep rewording more carefully.

review: We all know (or should know) that this game is excellent and probably the best GTA of the series. So lets skip that! The forum is litterally filled with questions about if the game runs well without having a high end rig, so lets talk about that. I personally was worried as well about if I could run this game as I have a graphics card that doesn't even meet the minimum requirements, but I took the (expensive) gamble anyway. I was pleasantly surprised to see that the game ran fine right from the start! I could even go beyond the recommended settings and still have a very smooth and stable fps. So If you have a desktop similar or better then mine you should definitely be able to play the game! i5-3350p (@ 3.10GHz) 6 GB ram Geforce GT-620 (2GB) 720p

review: I've been playing this game since day 1 when it came out, for 4 days straight, everyday for aprox 18 hours. In less than 3 days I finished the main missions and most of the optional side missions (game completion at 75%), without stealing more than 3 cars/vehicles in total (in the stats I have Trevor with one police car stolen and Michael with one FireTruck and a Taxi stolen, Franklin didn't steal no nothing). I also played on the side Online in that game time and reached a Rank over 20, it's great fun with or without friends. It feels like this game is a drug that stole my life...but I don't regret a thing. Things I really enjoyed and you should probably do too: The game, despite it's large size, it's amazingly optimized with many graphic options to tweak. I have exactly the minimum requirements and I can run it, sure I had to turn every fancy pc enchanting option off and it looks like the graphics on the old-gen consoles, but I am happy, it works with +30fps. The missions are really captivating, the money spending system feels more challenging (because you have a lot to spend it on, to invest it, to simly lose it). You get to meet many interesting sidecharacters and the overall voiceacting is really good. Besides the actual story and the many twists in the missions, they have quite a replay value due to their minichallenges for each of them (like 'finish in the required time', 'complete it in a certain order' etc.) if you are a completionist. The car handleing, amazing, the gave up the GTA IV 'simulator' like driving and brought back the arcade like car handling from the older ones, where you can rotate in the air or do some nice stunts. The world is really immersing, each NPC with it's small story, with their interactions etc. It's a living world filled with living people, animals and moments...and with Internet, Radio and Cable TV! I can't quite say there is a lot of choice based tasks, but there is a really decent number of those, most of them involving planning or the interaction choice, but as long as you have imagination there will always be a choice. It's great that we have animals, you can kill them, you can play/interact with them, you can even become them at a certain point (hidden easter egg). Most of the people are avereage aged, from 20-60 or so, I kinda wished we also had the extrems like children or quite old people...sure it would probablly create some controversy, but it would make give the game an even more real feeling. And I could enumerate so many more...but now I have to get back to the game.

review: This game ruined my life. After traveling far across the city of Los Santos in search of a car that would help me appear more appealing to the ladies, I found a Truffade Adder sitting on the side of the road and took it as my own. I then proceeded to flaunt my newly found ride in and around the pier. Soon enough a young blonde woman (who I can only presume loved me for my car) called me over to her and offered to make my night. I believed that we were going to go out bonding at a coffee shop and talk about our feelings, but before I knew it she was  my . Little did I know I had been led under the influence of the earthly equivalent of a siren, known by many as a street hooker. I now have an irrational fear of fish nets, red heels, and anything pertaining to leopard print. I miss the fishing trips with my family. I miss being able to take my son to the exotic plains of Africa on a leopard hunting expedition. My life is over. I can not go on living in this way. I do not want to go on living in this way. Every day I wake up wishing I hadn't. Someone please put me out of this hell. I will do anything. Please... 11/10

review: GTA V on PC is finally here (which was delayed for 1 year, 6 months, 28 days), but it can easily be forgiven. Because the content is already awesome and it's technically stunning. It feels like a new Los Santos. There is no open world game that can match that. And the Rockstar Editor offers such an easy access and so many possibilities in terms of clips/movies creation that we can only be sure that the pleasure will last for a long, long time. The game is well optimized for pc as well. Excellent work Rockstar!

review: For the first time in the series, characters now have a set of eight skills that they can grow over time. Stamina, strength, stealth, and lung capacity are joined by a meter for their special abilities. These impact how long you can run and swim, of course, but also impact how well you handle recoil, climbing speed, take-off and landing in planes and helicopters, and so much more. If you want to bump up your flying skills, logic follows that you head to flight school. Similarly if youd like to have a bit more stamina, then riding bikes, triathlons, tennis, golf and other physical activities will help with that. Other than specialty skills, simply doing more of something makes you better at it  practice makes perfect. This is not an arbitrary add, but one with real. Also Graphically, Grand Theft Auto V makes the respectable presentation of its predecessor look pretty bland in comparison. What a difference five and a half years makes! Gone is the drab and depressing color scheme, giving players all the bright faux-California sun they can stand. Having lived in Los Angeles, many places in the world of Los Santos, San Andreas are familiar. The city itself is teeming with life, and I dont just mean random pedestrians and cars roaming around. People go about their daily lives: traffic backs up, downtown is busy, Vinewood is full of shopping and mansions, Vespucci Beach has people skating and lifting weights, Blaine County is far more rural with rednecks and pink flamingos, and wind turbines spin in the distance like the real-world San Gorgonio Pass Wind Farm. The whole place feels organic, looks the part, and is more like a living world than ever before.

review: While the PC version of this outstanding game is new, it's been out long enough on consoles that I don't need to go into every single thing about the game so I'll just sum up what I personally like, (ALOT) and don't like (Not too much). Likes: -The Environment An insane amount of detail has been paid to recreating parts of L.A. (L.S.) to near perfection. Having been to the actual city several times, I could easily recognize landmarks and accurate streets while in game. The Viper Roorm, Ripley's Believe It or Not museum, The Scientology Center are all here plus lots more albeit renamed but the structures remain the same. When the sun sets and rises, all of the lighting is accurate and at times, absolutley beautiful especially when the light rays are breaking around Mt. Chiliad and when storms roll through the desert or in the cities, it's some of the best weather FX I've seen in a game because it feels real. Roads gradually get wetter the more it rains and lightning illuminates everything when it crashes. It truly feels like a living world. -The Satire What I feel is one of the strongest points of the game is how it shows no mercy towards the vapid lifestyle that's so prevalent in L.A. across all social classes. The rich are just as shallow as the poor in their life goals and in a very cathartic and some would say sadistic way, it's never been more fun to mow down socialite trash in the hills or go on a rampage down in the ghetto. The signage and radio commercials are also perfect, knocking everything from politics to the video game industry itself. This can keep a person driving around just looking at billboards and movie posters and listening to the varied radio stations. -The Characters There are many who dislike the characters, especially Trevor and I can see why but I liked them because of how they played off of one another. Michael, the would be retiree who's juggling family problems. Franklin, a young man growing up in the hood, doing what needs to be done but also having some kind of conscience and a want to get out of his current lifestyle. Trevor, the manic fiend throws all caution to the wind and is the vulgar but free spirit, taking pride in his insanity but also has some insightful moments along the journey. None of the characters generate any real kind of sympathy but they're all believable and kept me wanting to play to see how things end up for each of them. The voice actors do an A+ job in bringing them and the secondary characters to life. -The First Person Mode Not only is this one of the best 3rd person games ever made, it's also one of the best FPS's in years. Being able to take in the entirety of the world and action through the eyes of each character really brings the world to life and the shooting is super smooth in both 3rd and 1st person modes. -The Radio Stations There's nothing like blasting through neighboorhoods or driving off cliffs while rocking "We Built This City" by Starship or "Heartbeat" by Don Johnson. If you like pop, rock, country, rap, trance or even talk radio, there's something here for anyone to like. Dislikes: -The Police They seem overly aggresive and I don't know if that's a play on the LAPD or not but there have been time that I've simply pointed a gun at someone and got swarmed by 4 cop cars in less than 5 seconds. Also while in a car, I've been clear of their field of view with no chopper in the air and parked in the most secluded hiding spot I could find only to have them pinpoint my location and jump the walls to get me. -The Storefronts I just wish there were more of them that could be entered and explored but I also know how much of a challenge this would be in an already huge world. I'd be happy if they would have an arcade somewhere with a few playable classic games. -The Sub and the Helicopter For me, the sub missions are the biggest weakness in story mode. The model looks cool but is just dull and not much fun to drive and thankfully main missions with it are few. The helicopter, while fun, could have the controls refined a bit more to make it more fluid especially when trying to pinpoint certain targets. Thankfully Rockstar is fairly lenient when it comes to this. -Real Time Destruction Again, like the storefronts, I know how much it would take to have this throughout the world and we'd probably be lucky to get 10-30 frames per second with Phys-X cranked up but it would be a sight to behold bringing down one of the contruction sites or collapsing an overpass at will. Something about shooting a rocket at a building and only leaving scuff marks really removes me from the game in those moments. -Extra Activities Given the sun and sand vibe of L.S.(L.A.), I wish that you could surf and skateboard. Seeing a skateshop as well as a skatepark and half pipes and only being able to ride them with a bmx bike left me slightly gnashing my teeth. That's not to say they couldn't add these things in a dlc pack, (fingers crossed) but I just find theior absence strange and overlooked. Those nitpicks aside, this is still one of the best games I've played in a very long time and, with so much to do, I'll be playing it for the rest of the year and beyond and smiling the whole time. Overall Score: 9 out of 10

review: Well, what can I say? Grand Theft Auto IIIII is another installation for the Infamous GTA franchise developed by Rockstar. First impression was immensively outstanding. The ability to immerse yourself in the online multiplayer is extremely corporeal. This has everything that I could ever possibly want from a video game, and delivers ten fold. There is simply not enough time in the day to spend playing Grand Theft Auto Five Online. It is pretty enjoyable. Kind of wish I pre-ordered, but that is pointless considering it is easy to accumulate cash, if you're not wasting it on tattoo's, cheap suits, or car mods after you complete each and every job, which, in my case, I have a bad habit of indulging in all of the above. To make a long story short, it's fun. There could be a few improvements, but you know how the old saying goes... You wish in one hand, and poop in the other; which one fills up first?

review: So I haven't played any GTA since GTA 2 (1997), and that has been one of my favorite games from my teenage years. I skipped GTA 3 and 4 mainly because I didn't care for the change from 2D top down to 3D third person. However seeing the Total Biscuit review for the game convinced me to give this game a try. Honestly, I'm blown away in regards to how good this game actually is. The attention to detail and the grand scale of the world is really amazing. I have only a few hours in so far, but I am completely sold by how good the game actually is, and look forward to playing it for many hours more.

review: Imma let you finish but GTA V is one the best ports of all time... ONE OF THE BEST PORTS OF ALL TIME!! It was totally worth the wait for a better version after playing it on PS3. There's a huge jump in terms of visuals. Besides, custom soundtracks, mods, first person mode, better graphics, smoother frame rates, higher resolution, more music and of course, the best thing ever; the amazing director mode. I love you Rockstar!!!! 10000 OUT OF 10!

review: 4 hours on Single Player and 4 on Multiplayer so far. Fantastic entry into the GTA series. Stable performance (Normal settings) with an Nvidia 560, though planning to upgrade to shorten loading times. Gameplay and controls are top notch, GTA IV's floaty character controls and sloppy, boat-like slippery driving are gone. Controls have been well made for both keyboard and controller alike (Logitech F710), though flying is a bit rough on the keyboard. Only issues I notice are: Loading times (again, old video card), CPU dependent, with a rather nasty CPU intensive spike whenever one is viewing a cutscene or in an interior (i5 2500K SB 3.30GHz) An odd issue where the game minimized whenever I attempted to use full screen mode (This was after 8 solid hours of gameplay)

review: It's an amazing game yet it needs some patching. Once in every two or three hours I (and my friends) are heaving a memory leak and game freezes (like 0.1 fps) until restart. I am using a laptop with two videocards so each time I start launcher it crashes unless I turn one of videocards off while it loads. It is rather annoying. Optimization itself is pretty fine, I wasn't sure that my laptop will handle this game but it does. And speaking about actual game aside of these memory leaks and various issues with starting up the game - its grate. I had little faith in GTA series after IV being a boring trash, but GTAV learned on the mistakes of the previous chapter. Characters are more original and charismatic. Unlike in GTAIV where you had to do 5 missions between every "story" mission, each task in GTAV makes sense and does not feel boring at all. Downsides in GTA Online: Dozens of glitches and bugs that are both annoying and even game breaking. But what is most important (and frustrating) is loading times and amount of these said loading times. After almost every action you have to stare at the loading screen (from 15 to 60 seconds). Example 1 (Remember, like I said - each loading is bout 30 seconds): Join online -> loading -> failed to connect -> loading -> Join online -> loading -> Joined, but friends are in another "world" -> First option: Join friends -> loading -> A lot of players in here, do you want to wait in Queue? -> No -> Loading Second option: Join friends -> Do you want to wait in queue? -> Ok, fine! -> Loading -> You spawn in some game world that is different from your first one, for a duration of queue -> Loading -> Joined friends Example 2 Join heist -> loading -> joined heist, lobby leader is starting the heist in 10 seconds -> one of party members left the lobby -> disconnecting -> loading Example 3: Join random heist/job -> loading -> You don't want to do that particualr thing -> leave -> loading

review: Rockstar fix your ing game, The stuttering in this game is ridiculous, the way the textures are streamed is ed up, after 20-30 mins the game just starts eating more and more ram to the point that it starts using the page file memory instead.... There obviously a memory leaking issue, and alot of people are having the same problem no matter the brand or how powerful the rig is. based on multiple users configurations, I can safely without a doubt that your game is not optimized properly. 3 delays for more optimization my , release a patch that can fix this memory leak, after that then I might recommend this game, but for now. hurry up with a proper fixing patch.

I really do hope they release some fun DLCs, but I am also excited about seeing Mods in the game! Do you like cars, planes, helicopters, pure.. mayhem? GTA 5 is for you! It is the ultimate amalgamation of FUN! Anything can happen in this game.. Anything.. Don't miss out!!

review: Great game with an amazing singleplayer storyline which is long and fun to play. There are many side missions and things you can do if you ever get bored of the main missions. You can fly planes, drive boats or just go around doing whatever you want. The multiplayer is so fun and there are so many challenges and different missions/heists that you can do with your friends or anyone you want. There is so much to unlock and so many different vehicles to customize. You can buy houses, vehicles, planes, boats and so much more. The heists which were only introduced recently are fun, challenging and great to do with friends. I would recommend this game to anyone especially if you have played the previous GTAs this game brings together aspects from every game which you will notice. The map features things like Grove Street and Mt Chiliad from SA and other GTA games. Overall this game is very fun and great to play with friends or alone and I would recommend it to anyone.

review: Well since 17/04/2015 I was have pain in the  loading the game for 1 ing hour even it was horrible I just crashed and crashed over and over again and on graphics only thing that I can see is squares its like ing: Minecraft 2 as party buuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuut its kinda fun to play if you play with your close friends you have so much fun without doing exactly nothing just sitting even when we come to phone or tv's they are actually animations and shows just like real life (but serously watch out watching these when I was exactly doing nothing but watching suddenly a woman voice sayed windmills kills birds and we shouldnt save energy and bla bla bla when I hear this I was like wtf then how solar panels KILLS the birds. if a 6 years girl/boy hear this he probaly turn into those who dont care about forests and the world so please I know its kinda funny you some of you think but serously dont even think about this) well another thing we can say is its kinda too much unrealastic beacuse of the FPS for sure and I dont even care about 60 gb I cant even say something but some of you say even 10 gb is too much how we gonna download 60 gb oww?! well  you then we are not in a world that tech is too further if its easy to fit a game like gta 5 in 1 gb go and make your own  game second of all game is the best game ever we can count: graphics (if you have great computer that can carry on gta 5), game modes and many many more. but you know people just can die from 1 single pistol shot no matter what (Im not counting those who has great strengh and does sports all the time they can die with 3-4 shots even if they are not wearing and armor but in this game you just fist fight each other and they just die from sprint and hit (like you ran and punch them in the face they just die not even 5% blood comes out and they just die from pain or what) and when we come to guns if you are away from them like 10m just shot over 5 times! they wont die (civils) they have and invisble armor or what when we come to cops they die from 3 bullets on headshot and over 13 times with body shot now wow even a real life cop can die from a 5 shots (if they are wearing great armor). now for the biggest thing of all for me: graphics : 7/10 shoting : 10/10 characters (single): 1/10 Lester (why I even counting him): 10/10 multiplayer IN A SERVER WITH TROLL PLAYERS : 1/1000000000000000000000000000000 ( NO) friends server : 9/10 freaking characters on multi : 8/10 easter eggs : 6/10 (I didnt like those easter eggs much missions : 1/10 heists (much more better atleast has a adrenaline) : 10/10 62/90 (not counting multi  that) game is play-able for me

review: Game is just stunning, a masterpiece, just gonna keep playing the shetz out of it. Well, I fixed my game at first, it was stuck on Social Club loading after logged successfuly. Maybe that's cuz my system name has a symbol -> . ... Here's how I did it: If your username contains non-english or normal characters, then first create an empty folder wherever you want (for example: C:\NewFolder). Then, right click on your "C:\Users\USERNAME\Documents" folder, select "properties", and change its location to the new folder that you just created. The computer will then ask if you want to move all the files, say yes. After that, try running the game and it should work. Update: Now that a patch was released and a new Social Club, I can play just fine with everything back to normal.

review: Amazing so far. Great sequel to the series and finally on PC. Running on a GTX 760 at 1440p. 4k looks nice, but FPS drops to below 30. Buttery smooth @ 1440p. Radio is very entertaining. The map has definitely changed alot since San Andreas, but there are still some areas that are very close and reminicent of the older game. Cars handle alot better than GTA IV. Switching between characters isn't as bad as I thought it would be. I'm also a big fan of how the map is not locked down from the beginning such as all the other GTA games. First thing I did after the prologue was boost a car, drive to the airport and grabbed the first plane I found and cruised around the map (dat turbulence). Love this game so far. Only played online for a few minutes and hit rank 3. Lots of potential and really looking forward to continuing this game. 10/10.

Jokes aside, plays at a beastly 60 fps on 4k resolution with 2 overclocked GTX 980s so I'm glad that it is optimised well for how nice the game looks. (Just turn off AA, at that resolution you don't need it at all :3). As for online capabilities, much better than the torm that was launch on the PeasantStation 3 and Xbox #360noscope since you can actually play GTA Online without disconnecting 24/7 (All hail PC Master Race). *Good on Rockstar for not pulling another GTA IV on PC

review: If you have your graphics driver updated to the latest version (no serioulsy nvidia has actually released a driver update specifically for GTA just before it was released) and the settings at a level your computer can handle then you're in for a fun ride of stealing stuff, injecting marijuanas and really messed up stuff. NOT for prude or squeamish people at all. PC version is optomised really well which is really rare for a huge game of this caliber and it even includes settings for future graphics cards and I get a smooth 60fps at all times. That's until you start playing GTA online, then you start getting conectivity issues and joining your friends or trying to make a private session is a nightmare. But you're still likely to have an great/10 time with the online mode just dont be a complete  to the other players and they wont start beating your  down for being said . That's untill you get to the online heists, then you'll start praying for patches to save you from the crashes and the bugs that can never let you win a mission sometimes and the automatic mission failures for the game disconnecting another team member and the freezing of the screen thats sometimes fixed by pressing alt+enter twice but not really and the prison heist thats an absolute long boring drawl that builts itself up as a squeaking mission but is just rambo guns blazing at the end without telling you and leaving one of your teammates with a  pistol in the middle of a high security prison and the even worse connectivity issues and the issues where enemies can spontaniously go invisible and Jesus Christ I just wanted to have fun. Fun is dead ;~;

review: I have played the game on both PS3 and PS4 and so far Steam experience is the most adorable. Game runs extremely smooth on my rig and the visuals are totally worth the delays game had during the development journey. If you are a fan of the serie or haven't heard of Grand Theft Auto ever, this is game you should buy if you are capable of running it. One of the best Steam releases during 2015.

review: I don't think anyone needs any introduction to this game so i will just comment on the port. The game runs perfectly at 60+ fps with all high settings with my Gtx 970 Sli. the new feature of having your own custom radio station that plays your music is a really great feature, just put your music files or shortcuts (both work) in the User Music folder found usually at C:\Users\Your username\Documents\Rockstar Games\GTA V\User Music. after putting the files just perform a quick scan in the in-game audio options and you are ready. my only gripe with this game is that it will be tied to your Social Club account and in case you lose the account then you won't be able to play the game anymore.

It has taken me 1.5 hours to get to this point and I still haven't been able to find a simple "PLAY" button! I paid 60 bucks for a game - where is the play button? I want to play the game! Not join a damn club. I dont care about selfies and stupid clubs. I want to play the game. F U Rockstar!

review: First impressions of GTAV are very positive for me personally. I played the game for about 300 hours on PS3 so I went in knowing what to expect for the most part but I was nervous of Rockstars past reputation of PC ports. Needless to say this one feels very well done, there are still places where you notice controller priority most noteably the menus,UI, and aerial controls but most of this can either be learned realitively quickly or altered in key customization. Overall the game runs extremely smoothly, I have a higher end PC so it's hard for me to grasp optimization issues but I will say I can run on max settings with a 3 gig GTX 780 and a i5 4670k. There has been the odd burp or glitch while playing with friends which did become an issue through some missions, one time a friend wouldn't load in another time a friend crashed but it's hard to say what targetted this and if it is a common issue. I can say for myself I have not once crashed or had any sort of game breaking bug. Overall my experience has been extremely positive, online works great, single player is fun, quite simply it feels like a Rockstar game and one that is finally a decent port to PC. I highly recommend this game if you enjoy the GTA series, this is definitely the best game Rockstar has ever produced.

Just make sure your PC can handle it, would check on "can you run it" and make sure your drivers are up to date.

review: This game is absolutely gorgeous on PC. No major problems running the game besides a few minor frame drops here and there. Played on 360, and Ps4, but neither of them compare to this. It felt longer waiting for this game to come out, but now that it's finally here we can all relax and enjoy this beautiful masterpiece. There's no more to be said, time to go back to killing pedestrians and drooling over the new San Andreas. If you love the GTA series, then you need this game ASAP. 10/10

review: I wasn't sure if it will be a good VERSION(not port), because of the delays, and R*'s past in PC games, but hell, I got one of the PC game(By PC Game, I mean optimization) in the last 2 years! GTA V is full of Graphical options with free key rebind, but without GTA games' best element, Mods :(. The story is interesting and long(After 22hours I am still not done with it!), while some missions are boring, but the graphics, the optimization, and the voice acting are all awesome. The controls are great, but the Helicopters' are not realy, but I don't care about it. The game got lot of mini games(Tennis, Golf, Cycle reaces, running races etc), with a huge variety of cars, and car customization items, and a good amount of customizable weapons. The Online is also good, but sometimes realy unfair due to the character transfer from Consoles, and I had to fight in a TDM as a lv. 5 character against some lv. 50-60 guys, and that was unfair. Online got a bad sport system, what is not the best at this point, because I don't wanted to become one, but I realy wanted to leve the match, because it was full of, well idiots. Heists and other game modes are awesome, just like the character customization. Sadly in Single player, the amount of clothes and hair styles are low, so I hope soon we will get more from modders, if they find a way to mod the game. Pros.: -Story -Gameplay -Optimization -Characters -Lenght -Content -Voice acting -Online Cons.: -Low amount of clothes and hair styles -No mod support Final: 9.5 Love it, and you should buy it!

review: After almost 2 years finally comes to PC. Huge open world filled with brutality and prostitution with amazing story and awesome soundtrack this is Grand Theft Auto V. Single Player is OK but best thing is ONLINE! ONLINE will give you a lot of fun especially if you play with your friends. Race, Deathmatch, Survival, Capture you can do a lot in ONLINE but for my best thing is Heists. The Heists to need communication and cooperation with your friends. Your team can die only one time so you must concentrate and have some skill. I like this style of playing. This game is also well optimized. I would recommend this game for all. 10/10* ____________________________________________________ DELAY SIMULATOR!

Pros: Faster Loading screen Better graphics Good standard controls Millions of hours in playtime until you get tired Heists which you can replay Races Apartments Good flying controls Almost bug free And i could do this forever.. Cons: Bad community (Shooting everyone) A little harder in heists Not really much bad stuff. Its worth the 60 euro.. Just.. buy it damnit!

review: NOTEBOOK USERS TAKE NOTE! GTA V does not support Enduro(AMD) or Optimus(Nvidia). This means that you won't be able to play the game with your dedicated gpus, only your integrated Intel gpu will work. If you try to launch the game with your amd or nvidia gpu i'll crash right away. Looks like R* never heard of gaming notebooks before, maybe they should've delayed it a third time... !!!Update for Nvidia users!!! Seems like the issue has been fixed for Nvidia users. AMD users are currently still unable to run it on their dedicated AMD gpu though.

review: I've already played this game on console so the hours played are not correct... With that said. The game is way different from console. I mean... it is the same game. but it feels and plays much better. I max out the game and rarely get below 60 fps. if I ever do i get like 55 fps... not a big deal. So Rockstar did a great job porting the game. It seems people are having issues logging in to the social club. I never had that problem. My friend did though. His steam name had a dot at the end (name.). Once he removed that dot he was able to log in. It has something to do with the social club not working with certain symbols. The game: The story is crazy and filled with even crazier people. The longer you get through the game the more fun it becomes. I love the characters though I think rockstar did a much better job in Red Dead Redemption when it comes to personalities. The world is filled with stuff to do so you will never be bored. If you somehow get bored there's always the multiplayer. I've not tried it yet on pc... but I can say the console version had a ton of variety in community made maps and game modes. I am sure the creativity of the pc gamers will outdo what has already been done.

review: back in my mid 40's I had what any normal person has... a midlife crisis. I had an urge for adrenaline that I just couldn't get. I tried joining a triathlon, that didn't end well with my heart condition. I tried smoking weed for the first time but nothing really happened and my whole house smelled like pizza, I tried being extremely racist to black people in order for them to assault me but the only thing that happened was that they dismissed me as crazy and continued on with their day. One time, I remember, I even tried cocaine but to no avail. I simply wanted a rush, an experience, something that would send my heart racing (yet not overboard). I wanted adrenaline. On a fine summer evening, I walked to the grocery store to buy a pack of cigs when out of the corner of my eye I see a man in a mask with a gun. He tells us all to get down on the ground or he will shoot us and skin our family alive. So, naturally, we all got on the grown and complied with our captor. My heart was racing, I couldn't believe this was actually happening! I went for my phone to call the police but he saw me and kept me in his crosshair for a good 15 minutes while his friend cleared the register. After collecting all the money, they were making their way out when suddenly a cop turns the corner of the door and aims his pistol at one of the robbers. He yells "Freeze er!" and the robbers stopped in their tracks. The cop told the robbers to drop their weapons and they did so. The cop then yelled "Holy  he is resisting!" the criminal then started to say "but, I alread..." when the cop layed down the criminals life. The other criminal stood their shocked and frightened at his fallen comrad when the cop says "Now its your turn, bite the counter!" which, in my opinion, was an odd request. The criminal listened to the officer of the law and put his teeth around the edge of the counter. The hero & hunk of a police officer then said "Say goodnight, er!" and proceded to stomp the black mans head in. I was so amazed by what I had just witnessed all I could do was start a slow clap, everyone in the store was screaming and yelling in amazement at the officers fine work. It was the rush I needed, it was amazing and I highly reccomend the experience.

review: This game isn't really in a genre because it hits so many. So the way I am going to review this is 0-10 in multiple sections. After I will go into more detail for specific things. Graphics: 10/10. Driving Physics: 9/10 Shooting: 9.7/10 Player dialoge and realism: 10/10 Story: 10/10 Enviorment realism: 10/10 Car Customization: 8.6/10 Player Customization: 9.5/10 Car choice/amount of vehicles: 10/10 There are hundreds of other things I could rate this game on but it would take too long and their are a few more things I would like to talk about. First off, the thing that actually impressed me most about this game is the little things. For instance, I was playing as franklin and was going along the highway on a bike and noticed this fluttering around his sholders. At first I thought its was bad refresh rate, but then I realised its his shirt fluttering in the wind. Holy **** that's awesome that they included stuff like that. The list goes on about little things, but their are a few cons. The only cons I could really find is crashing issues. Now this is different person to person. It's not my system either because I have a very powerful computer. It's just launch bugs which every game has. It almost makes me giddy thinking about all the bugs their gonna be fixing in the next couple months. Other than that this game is a must for any game enthusiest. Thats my 2 cents. Hope this helped.

review: is it optimized? yes does it run at 60fps? yes does mouse and keyboard work well with it? yes does it look good? yes Does it look better then console version? yes i played it on xbox one earlier today and i notice the difference in some areas moreso then others does it look 10x better then console does it look better overall indeed it does. did rockstar have enough servers to make gta 5 playable online at launch? no (kinda didnt surprise me anyways) was it worth the wait for the pc version if you already owned a xbox one or ps4 version? thats up for debate im undecided i dont write reviews often games cause i suck at writing them anyways, if you havent owned gta 5 its a must have to own especially on pc. if you dont have a very good gaming pc but already own a xbox one and or ps4 but are thinking about trying the pc version you can if you want but it wont be worth it in my opinion. benchmarks will follow specs: i5 4670k 3.4ghx oc to 4.4 ghz 16gb of corsair ddr3 1600mhz gtx 970 g1 gamining edition anyways theres the most important specs i maxxed out the game at 1080p using very high and ultra settings when possible with 8x msaa then theres the option of 4xmsaa with txaa i tried both the second option used a little less gpu ram and looked same as first option in my opinion and ran the benchmark mimumum fps was 26 max was 60 (vsync was on) and it uses 3764mb of the 4096 mb of availible video ram mind you thats everything up even in advanced settings so heres the wrap up 60fps nice its very well optimized mouse and keyboard are great and work good even for driving its a definite graphical improvement sometimes more noticeable then others but dont expect it to be mind blowing difference if you played ps4 or xbox one overall 9/10 (hype made it lose one point same with gta online not working)(which was partially expected) disclaimer i am candian and trevor doesnt represent canadians LOL! ps this is my opinion your milage with the game may vary edited:: alot of people are having widespread issues with game not working from what i heard people that have it threw steam are having no issues for the most part people who got it threw rockstar warehouse are having issues for the most part so i hope there issues get fixed and whoever buys it doesnt have those issues just a warning

review: This game isn't really in a genre because it hits so many. So the way I am going to review this is 0-10 in multiple sections. After I will go into more detail for specific things. Graphics: 10/10. Driving Physics: 9/10 Shooting: 9.7/10 Player dialoge and realism: 10/10 Story: 10/10 Enviorment realism: 10/10 Car Customization: 8.6/10 Player Customization: 9.5/10 Car choice/amount of vehicles: 10/10 There are hundreds of other things I could rate this game on but it would take too long and their are a few more things I would like to talk about. First off, the thing that actually impressed me most about this game is the little things. For instance, I was playing as franklin and was going along the highway on a bike and noticed this fluttering around his sholders. At first I thought its was bad refresh rate, but then I realised its his shirt fluttering in the wind. Holy **** that's awesome that they included stuff like that. The list goes on about little things, but their are a few cons. The only cons I could really find is crashing issues. Now this is different person to person. It's not my system either because I have a very powerful computer. It's just launch bugs which every game has. It almost makes me giddy thinking about all the bugs their gonna be fixing in the next couple months. Other than that this game is a must for any game enthusiest. Thats my 2 cents. Hope this helped.

review: WOW, JUST WOW. In just a day I have gotten around 12 hours in game, Ive started online and I am up to the planning for the first heist. What Ive noticed: Positive: - Very good optimisation ( a dev that isnt so mean to AMD users for once <3 ) - The anti-aliasing is just beautiful - I have noticed that things at a distance get blurred/fogged; this makes it look so rich, so instead of seeing rough textures, it gets softened off ( In a differant way to anti-aliasing, i think. ) Bad: - After pre-loading I had to do a 220mb download, however it took 45 minutes to actually install and decrypt the file - During my livestream, I had a glitch where in climbed over a ledge during an early mission, only to find myself catapulted 400m into the air, then fail the mission from dying - The steering sensitivity on a keyboard doesnt seem to have the ability to be adjusted - During the day when I wanted to play online, the servers didnt seem to be up and the game kept displaying the message - Cannot connect to the social club servers - Was flying a heli that took me around an hour to find, then during my livestream my brother comes up and presses 'F' on my keyboard :( Thank you for reading, So far I am very impressed. I am very confident I will get my moneys worth out of this game. I may do an update on this review tomorrow after I have played another 12 hours ;) BTW, I have been playing on a pretty stable 50fps on max settings 1080p :D Specs: AMD FX 8350 4GHz 8 Core CPU ( Water Cooled) ) Gigabyte 970a-d3p Radeon R9 270x Direct CU ll Top ( 2GB GDDR5 ) 1TB SATA3 hardrive (6 GB's per second) 8GB Kingston ddr3 1600MHz (2x4gb) 7.1 Audio ( Built into mobo ) Windows 7 Home Premium 64bit

review: Apart from waiting an hour for steam to find the encrypted files and move them. And the game crashing 4 times in an hour. And my Entity XF and my Sultan RS (2.5 Million) disapear to never be seen again. And half of my friends unable to go online. And waiting 5 minutes to get into an online session and see everyone in the server get kicked. And trying to fly anything is a death wish because the controls are sh*t. And the 1st person FOV is so small it gives you motion sickness. Apart from that the game is great! Seriously though, the game is x1000 times better than the XBOX 360 copy, and being able to transfer my character from XBOX 360 is amazing. GTA V is probably the biggest PC release for a while and the fact that the servers didn't go down is an achievement far greater the any console could achieve (im not biased to PC, I play on XBOX and PS as well). The graphics and outstanding and my cheap PC can run the game and a stable 59.999 fps shows how hard they worked on this game, I run ArmA III on 30 fps on medium-high and have regular frame drops. The heists so far have been great and i've only experienced a few very comical glitches, the pay is great and really helps to fund your online murdering needs. The story mode is not different from console but the glitches are gone and my only problem is you can't be in 1st person while with a hooker, oh and 4K t*ts.

review: AMAZING PC Port !! Runs butter smooth @ 1920x1080 on my GTX 970 with almost all the bells and whistles turned on (and it does offer a huge variety of video options). The graphical fidelity is outstanding -esp. for an open world game. I am very happy they didnt dumb it down unlike so many other contemporary PC ports. Beware of the ~ 60 GB download / hard disc space requirement though. The game also seems to be using up almost all of my 4096 MB Video memory. So if you have a mid range pc, I suggest disabling Anti Aliasing and turning the texture quality sliders down a notch to ensure smooth gameplay. I'm not even gonna waste time reviewing the actual gameplay/storyline as this game has been out on consoles for almost 2 years now. But for us PC players it was certainly worth the wait. brb overclocking my GPU so i can crank up the MSAA even more ... #JustMasterRaceThings

review: I've already completed the story and reached level 67 (Online) on Xbox360. What I can tell you now is that the PC is a definate improvement. I'll be updating this review as I see fit but for now here are some reasons you should/shouldn't buy the game: Pros: - Excellent Optimisation. Don't listen to the other guys with "Low FPS" and crashing. - Looks amazing. Like, best graphics i've seen. For real. - Cool story - Fun gameplay - Endless playability - GTA Online is the center of some of my best gaming memories. - Custom radio stations omg - You can plug Xbox wired controllers (Or wireless if you have an adapter) in on the fly. No restarts, no settings, it just happens. Perfect for getting in a car, pushing the USB in and not getting a scratch because you can actually drive the bloody thing. - First Person is pretty cool Cons: - This game is huge. 59.1GB to download. If you can't handle it, don't do it. - Some of the online players are s to say the least - DLC is pretty hefty - Terrible driving without a controller (But what did you expect) - First person, while it is cool, gets old. Don't spend money on the PC version just for the first person feature. Especially if you own it on PS3 or Xbox360 already. You will be dissapointed. - I'll admit, the launch wasn't fantastic.

review: Grand theft Auto's next installment of the series, or atleast the port for it, is superb. I was one of the people who could not for the life of me wait for this game, yet would be unsure if it would be a good port. After playing 6 hours straight i have to say, even after beating the game twice, it feels like a whole new game. This is the Ultimate version, I highly reccomend it, it runs great and looks amazing. 10/10 would wait again (pls no dont let me wait) PS: Totally worth the having all the DLC's at launch, we aint gotta wait for hiest #PC masterace

review: GTA in first person is the most immersive experience i have ever had. I even, stopped a couple of times noticing how real this really seemed. The single player is the samme but hey it was amazing the first time around, and im ready to go at it again. Online felt a bit weird at first, public server to me are really boring, get missions with people driving everywhere like , jumping out of the car, shooting at nothing, not giving a f*** about objectives. So that really cut my immersion and made me think about this online thing but then again found somme good buddies and i play with them for real fun coop heists and stuff. I dont have to tell you how beautiful this game is, i run it at a steady 60 fps with max settings, it runs smooth as ever. NO bugs no crash no nothing simply perfection. Best pre-released purchase i've ever got.

review: Maybe pre-ordering a triple A game isnt so bad after all I haven't tested the story out too much (Just unlocked Michael), but me and my 2 friends spent about 16 hours on release day on GTA Online. let me rephrase that. 16/24=0.66. We spent 2/3 of the day playing this game with small breaks. So ing fun. I play on minimum settings because my Card is old (radeon 7850) but the game looks gorgeous and runs 60fps consistently still.

review: GTAV is a fantastic game on PC, really well optimized, but, does have its issues(which I've listen below) which I hope Rockstar will fix in the future. Issues: Texture/Model Pop-in (There is a workaround by setting the GTAV.exe process in task manager to High Priority) Shadow draw distance issues (only renders high quality shadows at a very low distance.) Some stuttering issues (Workaround as well, at least for Nvidia[dont know about AMD] by setting the max pre-rendered frames to 1 in the Nvidia Control Panel or Nvidia Inspector) Timing out from GTA Online session when Alt-Tabbed or have the Steam Overlay up. Other than the stated issues above, GTAV its amazingly well done, highly recommend! Specs: i5 2500k @ 3.7ghz EVGA GTX 680 2GB 32GB DDR3 RAM

review: Grand Theft Auto V on PC! A game that was actually worth waiting for because look at the awesome graphics and the smoothness, just amazing! There's so much I have to say about this game. This game has just the perfect story line, setting, location, gameplay, multiplayer, graphics, audio and combat! Grand Theft Auto V has a lot of effort inputted to this and Rockstar has done an amazing job! They've progressed their outstanding techniques, ideas and graphical features from the consoles over here to the PC. Along with that, it's amazing how even with such amazing graphics, you can still run it with a medium end PC! Multiplayer has also played a major role on this game for PC, and it seems as if it improved from the consoles. Less and less bugs have occured for the PC version of GTA V multiplayer and I'm very happy that Rockstar has also looked into the bugs, props up Rockstar! I really have no complaints for the game, because this game is far too amazing for myself and I continue to enjoy playing this game almost everyday. I must give this game a rating of 10/10! Here's my rating rubric listed below: Graphics: 10/10 Gameplay: 10/10 Environment: 10/10 Combat (if any): 10/10 Story: 10/10 Mutliplayer (if any): 10/10 Audio: 10/10 Trailer: 10/10 If you are going to play this game (or going to buy it), I hope you have a very fun time just as I did :)

I would recommend ALL my friends to buy and play this game, it is worth it. This'll be the next Skyrim if mods ever come out, I can't wait for those mods. Best game I've ever played in a really long time. The Storyline of GTA V is awesome and hilarious at the same time. GTA Online is even better when you play with your friends, the downside of this is some players that are in the session, may just come and murder you for no reason. I was able to defend myself back so many times. But due to me just killing random Civilians and hunting down bounties, my Mental State, in statistics, considers me as a psychopath. But I think GTA Online is a better experience, unless it comes down making an archenemy. GTA Online is great when you rank up through missions and heists and people won't be able to mess with you if you're ranked high enough. The game is inexplainable in general. In GTA Online, I just blow stuff up, 360 no-scope Players that tries to kill me, and make Los Santos my World. 11/10.

review: GTA Five is a game in which you can do things that mimic real life. For instance you can play Tennis, or ride a bike, or drive a car. The game heavily encourages players to partake in a number of criminal activities, such as gang turf wars and robbing convenience stores. However I have found it personally rewarding making my money legally, like winning car and parachute races! No matter what kind of lifestyle you choose, GTA Five has got you covered. 10/10 Avoid this game at all costs if you don't like wonderful things.

It runs fantastically, the graphics options are lush and plentiful, and I especially like the way that you can seamlessly switch between keyboard/mouse and gamepad (you can even use both simultaneously). Gameplay wise-- it's the best GTA yet. Be it doing crazy  online with friends, to the amazing singleplayer campaign, you'll certainly put in hours upon hours of gameplay in. Definitely recommend to any/all friends.

This game was my personal best game of 2013, I put hundreds of hours into the 360 version and now that its on PC I'll probably put another couple hundred and considering that at this time of writing this review the game has been out for only a week and I already have 60 hours scares me for whats to come. Do I need to tell you whats in the game and whats the game is about? pff Why would I? Its flippin GTA!! The game that made a billion dollars in a day! Who doesn't know what this game is? Honestly I would like to know 1 single person that isn't old or been living under a rock that hasn't heard of this game. Anyway getting carried away, point is: this game is a really great game and I would recommend it to anyone that enjoys fun. My only complaint is that I wish there where more interiors (hospitals, Police department, Cluckin bell, night clubs and maybe more than 1 strip club) but thats about it.

review: Everything about my passion for the series GTA V I'm on the road somewhere in the desert, asphalt - pink at sunset on my glasses aviators, in his hand - a pistol with a silencer. Life - a complicated thing. In the distance seemed machine, and I know that this movie was going to happen, because the decision has already been taken. Then there will remain only a crime scene may lead a quiet country of radio fired at the car. For fifteen minutes of real time in GTA V has time to occur so interesting that for the whole game cutscene cheaply enough. Got into a fight with the homeless, drenched them with gasoline and set on fire, tried hijack jeep, the dead driver knocked down, the leg stuck in the radiator, the cops, kill, got into the jeep drove off, the gas tank is breached, burn, jump on the asphalt, car explode at a distance. That's all - in two minutes. Now die in traffic accidents - simple (much easier than in GTA IV Summary of the game), and the city all the time you travel with this thought. Crashed on the fly on an opposite - a way to continue in the air, without a car. But this car is almost always possible to turn left Stick - is unrealistic, yes, but not break the rhythm of the game. She eventually became harmonious, not without flaws, but for such a colossus like GTA, - a major achievement. Feeling of continuous action - one of the main objectives in the case of Rockstar GTA V. Narrative job followed without interruption, clinging to one another, which is why the player with the first seconds of narration captured and may go through the game a couple of times looking menu with incredible beauty ambient Tangerine Dream. Game included, and it is itself forward as a film about gangsters, but without the participation of our film is not spinning. *** You can speak at length about how GTA V hits record, earns a billion dollars in the first three days and finally pushes the game in general cultural background. Houser brothers (and after some time we turn on the card) if this transition is felt even before the game, and maybe here and legs grow their sermons. Interestingly another: this is an adult a game based on the boyish emotions, and therein lies its charm. This is partly why GTA can not escape the violence. And this is a very cruel game (not the first, and obviously not the last in Rockstar), childishly cruel game, psychopathic violent. And naturalness of all it looks like a psychopathic character with complaints of severe childhood - nailed to the floor with wooden toys and other fatal trouble. He did not have those memories of the "machine", well, you know, when it is such a great-looking, and it sits a plastic driver: maybe Batman can, Spider-Man, or maybe just the driver. When it was possible to take her hand and go out for an adventure: the carpet turned into an imaginary sun city, like the one from the mysterious film bellied TV. In this fantasy we play, and that fantasy alien - it is for the better. At the end of history show us allegorically statistics in a form of a psychiatrist. The conclusion from the reference, in general, the same - childhood was difficult.

review: **Coming from an owner of the PS3 version of Grand Theft Auto V. - All the negative reviews are from the people who are just plainly hating. Some people can't run the game but thats the small amount of people. Rockstar has even posted how to fix certain issues for the people who cant run the game. Besides, I'm sure it shall be fixed. - This is NOT a port. It was made seperately! I, myself, dont meet the recommended req. but I can play it smooth like silk. I never go under 30fps the graphics are amazing. The game it self is amazing but the PC version is just the best. Online is much more active and more populated aswell. Buy it.

review: We all know how great GTAV is. The little details Rockstar added really make this game for me. Also my PC was slightly better then the min specs(My graphics card being the min spec, gtx660) and with a little messing around im basically running it on max, i droped shadow quality to normal and it works fine for me. There are a few frame drops evry now and then, but over all it works fine. Great game and it looks beautiful. 10/10 would bang.

review: Have been waiting for over a year to get this game on PC, ffs Rockstar you let your pc fans down with that move! D: But the game i got after that painful year of waiting is worth every cent of 60 euro pre-purchase!!! I CAN'T STOP PLAYING DIS GAME! <3

review: This game is honestly amazing, the graphics and the dynamics of it are brilliant! I've seen a fair few reveiws up to now about how the game is just the same as console the versions wich it basically is but it's the fact they've managed to put these graphics onto PC, people don't understand that. So the people who are moaning about it are just beyownd stupid, you have to see the reality of it and how they've put it on PC. Great game with friends, Graphics, Brilliant. Dynamics, Brilliant. Runs as smooth as a baby's . 10/10 Game 100% woth the 40 or whatever currencey you use. 10/10 IGN

review: To describe GTA 5 (Online) in short would be; the combination of games including Payday, Need for speed, The Crew with the original GTA elements that was in the previous installments. There is a wide variety of things to do from racing to missions to death matches. Golf, Tennis ... Darts. Content updates being free makes it more desirable, although faced with some issues right now, (Server overload, disconnects). GTA 5 Online is worth a shot if you got friends, If your a loner then play single player. Get a crew going, run some heists, buy a car, mod it, race and impress dem hunnies or get the booty at the strip club and/or random chicks walking on the streets.

review: Been gaming for 30 years and let me say. If you ever get this masterpeice of a game on your computer make sure you get your coffee, soda, or tea before you do. This game would even make Goarge Lucas creme in his pants. This is by far one of the very best games I've ever played in the last 3 years. I'm surprised how good this game is. Rockstar really put a lot of time and work into this game and it shows with the amount of things you can do in the game. The customizations, the outfits, cloths, Aesthetic things you can do with your character and cars. The races, heists, tennis, biking, piloting, DeathMatch, teamdeath match, gang wars, player housing, player garages,  the list goes for on for n ever! Lol. This is way better and more indepth then all the Grand Theft Auto games I've ever played The online aspect is really really well done as well. It's very very rare that I ever find any good games these days because they seem like dumbed down, simplfied, kiddy game crap, but this game is a masterpeice just like Skyrim is. Is it worth what I paid? 70$ Canadian? No, no game is worth that, but it certainly is worth the normal full price of most pc AAA games that are 50 - 60$ If you ever get this game on sale you will be laughing yourself all the way to the bank because this is probably one of the best games ever released this year so far. No joke. If you don't see the beauty in this game then you must need a psychiatrist because this game will be rated highly by angryjoe and all those other reveiwers as well.

review: Tell me a good thing that this game teaches you, i dont even feel the hero that saved the day or anything, all i can do is killing civilians and steel and crash everything, and at the end of the day i really feel stressful, i am not trying to be boring but this my experience, and there is a different between a violence game and a game that install violence in your actions and corrupted ideas. For now i am sorry , but i feel the game is so filthy and it even teach me the most wrong english of all time. HOWEVER the online playing is better i really like racing with other friends and everything work fine and smooth, the game didn't even crash once and it has everything you like, i still remember once we where trying to code another game to include all these features before GTA V came, The game is very customizable and i can't find anything that it doesn't include. YES buy it, you will like it but dont get too crazy about it, just remember that life has more valuable and your career is more beautiful than the image of this stupid crap game, it is very hard that i gave it yes but dude, i am telling you the developers didn't miss anything.

review: Loaded up the game onto multiplayer, loaded, loaded, loaded, loaded, found a lobby with friends, drove around with them doing all the shenanigans most players get up to on GTA, then everyone "left" the lobby. I was then disconnected and sent to single player where I got to then listen to Michael's persaonl life problems. Pause. go to GTA online, loading, loading, loading. Rince repeat. I think the game will be fun once Rockstar fixes these server issues a select number of us have to endure. but till then i wouldnt recommend the game for multiplayer.
