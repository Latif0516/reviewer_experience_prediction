We're on our way to the objective, a small dump east of a town occupied by enemy forces. I'm leading a team of 4 men. We come to a crossroad and I sprint across, telling my men to hold back. I cross a few more times, trying to get a response from any snipers. Nothing. I run, my LMG gunner runs, my medic runs. But I kept my Marksman on the other side to make sure we'd make it across. Anybody seen Full Metal Jacket all the way through? Remember the sniper scene? The marksman takes a round in the leg as we're running and goes down. He then takes two more in the chest. The kid who was playing had some mad acting skills, he played it up to 11 here. He screams as he's being shot. Crawling, drenched in his own blood. \"SARGE? YOU AIN'T LEAVING ME OUT HERE LIKE THIS, RIGHT? I-I WANNA GO WITH YOU GUYS! C'MON SARGE, H-HELP ME! C'MON! PLEASE DON'T LEAVE ME!\" he died after that.

Having done both military service and picked up MILSIM airsoft as a hobby this game is the closest you will get to what goes on in reality. There are experiences you will have in ARMA 3 that can not be had in COD or BF, experiences that will have you shaking from the adrenaline release. One that comes to mind was a mission to destroy an enemy comms tower, I was squad leader of 8 or so AI:s. As we approached the Comms tower and I told my men to go stealth, no firing unless fired upon. We moved slowly taking advantage of terrain, keeping an watchful eye for enemy patrols. Once the tower was in visual range pace slowed even more and I spent the better part of 30 minutes just looking for enemy patrols and advancing to about 200 meters from the tower. There I positioned my men to cover a wide firing arc as I had spotted quite a few patrols moving in and about the tower. I considered opening fire and probably being able to drop a good portion of the enemy before they could zero in on our position. But a firefight is always a risk, and these AI had been around for a few missions and I had started to anthropomorphize them a bit and secondly I might get hit and killed. As I considered how I would start the engagement a sudden hole opened up in the patrol pattern, I realised the tower is unguarded and I had an opportunity to do something I had not considered. I got up and ran as fast as I could towards the tower, all the time expecting the bullets to start cracking above my head. I kept scanning as I ran whizzling through bushes trying to pick a path that the least visibility to any patrols. After what seemed like far too long I reached the tower and threw out a satchel charge and another for good measure, if one would not bring the tower down it would sure attract attention. I turned around and made my way back, as I closed on my men I started ordering them to fall back, hope growing that I might get out of this alive. Falling back to about 400 meters I finally detonated the satchel charges and the tower fell, from there it was just a short run to the truck and back to Command. I had done it. I had pulled off the perfect mission, not a shot fired and all under my command back alive.

Where to even begin with this one. It would be an extreme disservice to simply call Arma 3 a shooter, as it is so, so much more than that. Arma 3 is a military simulator. This is a distinction that its developers hold sacred and are proud of, and one to which I can attest is completely accurate and deserved. But its even more than that. Arma 3 is a gaming platform, upon which so much has already been and will continue to be built for years to come. At its core though, Arma 3 in a supremely excellent military sim. The graphics are stunning, the gameplay is excellent, the mechanics are solid, and Bohemia Interactive has done an absolutely amazing job packaging this all together. New comers to the Arma series (as I was) may initially be overwhelmed by the games complex mechanics and decidedly different pace from your typical FPS/shooter. Enemy engagements happen at much greater distance than is typical in the genre and are often brief, brutal, and more times than not will conclude with your demise. There is no handholding here. No mini-maps, no enemy UI icons/indicators, no hit markers, no health bars. If you get shot a couple of times, you will find yourself unceremoniously dispatched. While this creates a high barrier for entry and a steep learning curve for new players, it provides a unique and distinctive play style. Situational awareness, cover, teamwork, suppressive fire, and generally moving purposefully and as if your  depended on knowing what was behind the next ridge or hiding in the bushes are paramount to your success. Add to these infantry mechanics the amazingly rendered vehicles, armor, helicopters, and planes, each with their own realistic mechanics to learn and master, and you end up with a truly amazing military simulation experience. Out of the box, Arma comes with a great single player campaign comprised of 3 separate acts, each containing ~12-15 missions. The campaign focuses on a well crafted story of a military conflict that has erupted over Arma 3s two HUGE islands of Stratis and Altis. You play the part of a NATO soldier who finds himself stuck in the middle of a complex engagement. The campaign is rewarding, and challenging. (I have yet to complete it as Im stuck on one mission that I simply cant seem to complete.) However the single-player campaign is FAR from the end of this title. The mission editing tools have allowed this amazing community to develop some absolutely awesome single player missions, all of which can be downloaded free of charge from the Steam workshop and numerous other sites around the interwebs. I would also recommend you check out the supremely excellent full game conversion single player mods Whole Lotta Altis and Dynamic Universal War System which will provide countless additional single player hours and could be completely stand alone titles in themselves. Oh and the multiplayer, oh god the multiplayer. Wasteland, King of the Hill, Invade and Annex, Battle Royale, Breaking Point, so many Co-Op opportunities, the amazing looking upcoming Epoch (currently in closed Alpha). Im sure there are so many others that I havent even discovered yet. Each of these represent COMPLETELY USER GENERATED and totally disparate ways to play Multiplayer within the Arma 3 platform. By purchasing Arma 3, you immediately have access to each of these completely gratis and each could essentially be considered totally separate game. In wrapping up this lengthy review, Arma 3 is an amazing experience and a true accomplishment in game development. It is the only game in recent memory that I can say with confidence that I never get bored with playing. Bohemia Interactive has made it clear that they plan to support this game for years to come, and they have built something amazing on which the possibilities are truly endless. Purchase this game. Purchase it now. Thank me later. (IF YOU DO NOT FIND MY REVIEW HELPFUL, please leave a comment as to why. I welcome the constructive feedback.)", "num_found_helpful": 0, "date_updated": "Sep 30, 2014, 12:43PM", "steam_id_number": "TheDanius", "num_screenshots": 370, "num_badges": 36, "rating": "Recommended"}

Unwilling to die before then, I rushed to the nearest cover, a small house by a narrow road. I entered to find a ten year-old player who had also been left behind. He explained that he was a sniper and invited me to join his \"clan\". I politely declined, explaining that my own squad was inbound. As I finished, a Ghost Hawk flew over the horizon. My squad had arrived. This noble child soldier and I were sprinting to the helicopter when the bullets started hitting. The sniper screamed as a 6.5 mm cartridge entered his leg.

Great game for the more serious war gamer, not for those who prefer the fast paced combat that you get from Call of Duty series which I consider more for the younger gamers anyway. Arma 3 moves a lot slower and is more squad based than other war games, similar to Battlefield series only slower than that when playing online and you may find yourself on 10 minute helicopter rides just to get into the battlefield and you will be highly satisfied with each kill you make as you know a single round landed by your enemy could be fatal regardless of the weapon they are using. You will have to make good use of any cover you can find and hit the dirt as soon as you hear a bullet crack over your head and then very carefully survey the surrouding area and work out where you are taking fire from as it will usually not be obvious where the fire is coming from and you will find yourself having to hold up for 10-20 minutes in a single location (sometimes longer, I personally have gotten pinned in one location for over an hour) because you are either pinned by enemy fire or it is too dangerous to move forward. You will need to buffer up on your mic communication skills as most players use proper phonetics etc when relaying information to each other on the battlefield such as coordinates and other reconaissance. You can not respawn as quickly as you can in CoD if you are taken down by enemy fire so staying alive is more crucial than any other war game you have played and you wanna hope you are moving up with a squad that has a medic. The graphics are great, the game is a little glitchy at times and the controls take a little getting used to. I recommend buying this game to any serious war game enthusiasts who want to get as close to war as possible (unless doing paintballing or airgunning), and if you do buy the game - I recommend completing the whole VR Tutorial before actually joining a server or playing the Campaign as you will need to really learn all those different keys that may make the difference in a hairy situation in game.", "num_found_helpful": 515, "date_updated": "Jan 2, 2015, 12:11AM", "steam_id_number": "76561198057309553", "num_screenshots": 0, "num_badges": null, "rating": "Recommended"}

I can shoot a rabbit at 2 Kilometers between the eyes I can land a helicopter on a dime at Mach 2 in a raging blizzard I can field strip a 50 tonne tank in under thirty seconds while under small arms fire and RPG attacks I can order Pizza in five different languages using a U.S. Army FM 3-0 Command and control radio I can single-handedly defeat an entire army using nothing more than a MRE ration and a Bowie knife if anyone is going to give a review on ARMA 3 it's going to be me ...this game is good. But the proof is in the pudding so for examples of gameplay: https://www.youtube.com/user/Jester814 Jester gives an in your face gameplay view \"That is a TANK!\" https://www.youtube.com/user/Dslyecxi Dslyecxi gives the best hands down introduction to techniques, weapons and movement. If you want to know \"how\" it works - then go watch Dslyecxi. https://www.youtube.com/user/RHINOCRUNCH Go watch Rhinocrunch for shooting peeps in the back and running away screaming in fear they will come back from the dead and then pretending you fear nothing. Just Plain Stupid Funny. There are of course numerous flaws, bugs, and irritants that every multiplayer game has, but the one the gets most peeps irate seems to be the lack of contempory guns. After all the game is set in the near future, so the guns should be differerent (a bit), but I've seen Pashtun tribesmen up in the Hindu Kush who still carry Martini-Henry rifles left over from the 1880 Anglo-Afghan War taking potshots at their neighbours. Weapons never retire, they simply explode. The Vanilla guns are quite good, but I really wish there was a lot of the old guns from Arma 1 and 2, actually what I really want is a combat shotgun, like the Saiga and the AA12. Nothing says \"I'm peased to meet you!! MudderF###ker\" more than a Atchisson Assault Shotgun 12 gauge to the face. Which brings me to mods. Arma 3 isn't a complete game, its the basic framework upon which the modding community can builld mods, weapons, equipment, vechicles etc, for you to use. So the first thing you do after buying this game is go to: http://www.armaholic.com/ I think this is an excellent source http://play.withsix.com/ Download this, and wait three days as it figures out what cyberspace is or Steam'sWorkshop which I find problematic as it doesn't categorize items, and you find weapons, uniforms, vechicles and pretty well everything mixed up together, but at least it installs correctly, while the other two routes are really annoying to figure out. There are mods for glasses, hats, uniforms, beards, compasses. There are no end of special forces assault rifles, bazookas, sniper rifles, pistols the size of a shetland pony. There are exotic and weird mods for Star Wars, Halo, Zombies and Dinosaurs - yes I said Dinosaurs! Personally I think Bohemia should change its business model and simply pay the modding community for their best work, as in \"here young fellah, we like what you've done, sign this paper, have some money and we will stick your work into the offical game, now go make a career of this.\" All said and done, is this game worth getting? Well do the math - almost 3000 hours gameplay for about $50 or Euros. Then it's not really a question - is it? but I still want my COMBAT SHOTGUN!", "num_found_helpful": 0, "date_updated": "Jul 9, 2015, 6:54PM", "steam_id_number": "76561198065399597", "num_screenshots": 0, "num_badges": null, "rating": "Recommended"}
