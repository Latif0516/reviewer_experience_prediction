review: This will be more of a ''my experience with this game'' type of review, because saying things like ''great gameplay'' will not suit something I've experienced with Counter-Strike. Here you go: I remember back in 2002 I was at a friend's house and he was playing a game. I didn't know the name of the game nor I had internet to find it. A few weeks passed by and another friend came over and he didn't have a computer, so he brought a disc with a game in it. He told me that it was one of the best games and from that very moment I knew that it is going to be the game I saw at the other friend's house. When I saw the Counter-Strike logo I was filled with gamegasm (?) and I was so happy. I don't remember a day when I was so happy like back then. So, the journey started. I was playing it hardcore. Made friends, clans, was involved in communities and even made two myself. Counter-Strike is my first game which I played competitively and it was a whole experience. Playing public servers and maybe some servers with mods was very fun, but playing it competitively made it very intense and stressful. In a pleasant way, ofcourse. Shooters these days try to be different, advanced in a way. Sometimes the most simple games like Counter-Strike are the ones that live to this day. Also, there are plenty of mods to keep your attention to this game. The gameplay is very simple - defend as a Counter-Terrorist, attack as a Terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a CT. I am sure most of you already know this and I doubt there are gamers that haven't heard or know the gameplay of Counter-Strike, so I am sharing here more of my experience. I wish I could find my CS Anthology account which I've lost since 2008. So, I decided I am going to buy this game again and here you go - more than a thousand hours played. I still play it from time to time to this day and it brings back many great memories and I sometimes even stumble upon people I've played with years ago. I think Counter-Strike changed gaming in a major way and we wouldn't have many games like we have today, if this game wouldn't exist. I am sure many of people already have played games like CS:GO, but never the roots. I doubt any of you will play it for more than an hour, because it's much more simple and it differs a lot in my opinion from CS:GO and modern games. I am glad that I lived through the golden era of shooters and if I'd have to rate it, it'd 10/10 ofcourse,

review: CS is one of the greatest and undermined games in history. It is, in my opinion, the best game to ever have a crosshair. It is not a contact sport, so for the girly girls, it is an activity to indulge in. It starts off with a team trying to kill another team. I started playing cs when I noticed jacking off isn't the only activity to do on a computer. I started inviting a lot of friends out and getting drinks, as well as a boom box, to spend a nice summer day in the living room playing this wonderful game. I wanted to play every chance that i could. On my road of cs adventures, I encountered a couple of problems; those being that nobody was as fervent as I was about playing, and that when we did play, nobody was good enough, so it wasn't a lot of fun. Then I discovered that I could sign up for a class with dboorn. I was overly excited, and signed up, but with skepticism at how the class was going to be. Sure enough, I was proven wrong. We started off by practicing a little bit. Then we split off into teams and started playing almost everyday of class. I made some friends, and played with people who had built up their skill gradually over the period of the course. When I play counterstrike, the whole world disappears. Only I, the mouse, and my teammates remain. We are united in a common goal. We strive collectively towards an end we all desire. Each player has a spot to hold. They stand ready and waiting, eager for their chance to aid the team in what they hope will be a forthcoming victory. Thus, CS celebrates the unity of man, the indomitable spirit in all of us that pushes us and drives us towards excellence. When I play CS, I play until my veins pump battery acid, and then I play some more. CS is unique among the games because it teaches all of us that no matter where we are in life, there is a role for us to play, and we can help our fellow man by fulfilling that role, and thereby our destiny. What destiny might you ask? I spoke before of unity. And it is that unity that brings us all together like one big loving family. That is the nature of counter-strike; the many working as one. One machine made of well oiled cogs and wheels, moving in unison, happy to play their part in the production of something greater than themselves. Not that these small metal objects are actually animate, I'm of course speaking only metaphorically. Over the course of the years, I have increased in skill, but I have learned a greater lesson than how to be a better cs player. I have learned how to cooperate with a team to accomplish a goal that we all share. Even if that team is less than ideal. I have realized that cs is about more than just one's athletic ability. Instead, there is a deeper meaning behind the colt, the AK, the AWP, the deagle, the sands under my feet (in d2 or inferno). And more importantly, the teammates at my side. I love them. It is the human element of cs that gives cs its greatness. In conclusion, I love cs. I love to win. I love pushing myself to my physical limits. It's that feeling that first drove me to the computer. For every second that I am not playing cs, there is only an unquenchable thirst to play. A thirst that grows as every minute passes by when I am outside, sitting at the television, or playing sports. I had an extraordinary time playing this game, and I will return to look at the future students of this game to see that bright eager look on their faces to remind me of how I used to feel. This review may be over, this game may be dead, but I will never stop playing couner-strike (1.6).

review: Counter-Strike: Ok, after 9 years of unlimited fun with friends, I have finally quit counter strike. Counter strike, in all of its versions, its just a great FPS game that anyone can enjoy it. Its a great game and all, you just cant stop playing it, you can just sit and play with your friends for days with out stoping. The huge weaoponary option you can choose and the smooth and sound of the game, its just f*cking addicting. With this games I've met so many different people and unique friends. This game is literally G(OLD). To all the young players who are looking for a good cheep and fun game to play with their friends, I highlly recommend on this. I've got (with steam record) 2,484hrs record in counter strike IN TOTTAL,,, and who knows how many more hrs in a non official steam version of this game.... Great Game. GG WP. And too all the people who will keep playing this game, all I can say, as always, GL & HF <3

review: This game is unlike the other counter strike games. This game requires a different type of skill. You have to become used to the recoil each weapon has. You also have to become familiar with the different advantage points of each map. I personally think this is the best counter-strike game.

review: This game appears to remain No. 1 FPS Action games since 2000 for around 8 to 11 years. It is a intense game as your health and your exposure is important as well sticking together with your team mates at all costs. You should maybe try this game and learn the routes in common CS maps like dust or assault. Go on try it! However they are a several downsides to this game like the weapon nerfs like the recoils and smoke grenade failing to detonate airborne and the lame Tactical Shield. And cos this game is so popular that thousands of servers host this game online, that some PC criminals tend to take advantage on players like using hacking or server addon hacking materials. So you maybe best to stay clear of weird or dodgy servers with extreme adult material and Steam cannot unban victims who got hijacked and VAC banned, so please be careful! But if you are old and wise enough to handle this intense action game...BUY IT, SOLDIER!

review: I don't like because Steam blocked redirections from server to server. I know that people using it to slowhack, but now... servers with redirection are unusefull.. Also, VAC not working good for Counter-Strike 1.6. Maybe it could be good for some update, or something... I can give you anything you need for it. Contact me. Kinds and Regards, drag1c.

review: First of all its my first online game ever. I was very young and i was playing with my friends LAN matches sometimes for fun sometimes with bets the loser treats refreshments. xD This game its the reason that i maked my mum to buy me a PC to playing this game at my home. With the time i learn how to modding on CS 1.6 servers,plugins and more stuffs about PC. After this i learn how to aim on the enemy head, how to fire inside the walls, how to hear someone with his steps and HOW TO FIGHT!!! I have played many FPS(First Person Shooter) Games that they called me hacker of my fast killing. I had so fyckin good and bad moments on that game that i will not forget never. For others its only a game for me it was MY LIFE! This wasnt a review but a little story. SO COUNTER-STRIKE FTW ES!!

review: A still alive first-person shooter, since 2000. The game that changed everything, along with Half-Life. Still, the best first-person for thousands. And you know why? Because this game's focus isn't on graphics. It's for having fun with your friends, or, even aim for world turnaments. All proffesional teams, such as fnatic, navi, sk, still play Counter-Strike, doesn't matter if it is 1.6, Source or Global Offensive. Highly recommend this game.

review: Counter-Strike was an amazing achievement. A free mod for the original Half-Life that outshone it's parent game completely and become becoming incredibly popular, so popular in fact, that it was sold it stores as a individual entity back when it was still free to download for anyone that already owned Half-Life. Nowadays a mod turning into a full game is almost common place and happens sometimes even without the popularity but back then, it was a monumental accomplishment. Counter-Strike managed to become the most played PC shooter of all time and even to this day boasts both a strong competitive scene and tons of active public servers. How many other online shooters can say that their online community is still alive and kicking 12 years down the line? The game itself I never really cared much for, I played it back in the 5.2 beta days and although there is something to admire about the simplistic purity of it's gameplay this has never been the kind of game I could really get stuck into. The developers tried to introduce a number of new game-modes back in the beta days but quickly found that trying to complicate the game would only leave the players confused and unsure of how to proceed. Counter-Strike is a simplistic teamshooter but it is a milestone in gaming history and one that we should be happy and proud of because Counter-Strike's simple existence is the reason why modding turned mainstream.

review: Yeah... the old Counter-Strike.... Everybody know, what CS is.. Counter-Strike - My rating - 9/10 Why or Why not to play this old classic ? Positive: Its a legendary game, and if u playing games like CS:GO etc. u will like it, cause it will be legendary in your library. Almost everybody played CS 1.6 "from start his cs:go career" Counter-Strike 1.6 is latest and best version on the game, and if u purchase CS, u can play it, if u will download it, theres is some chance, that u cant play it (Win 8 etc). Most of legens/pros in CS:GO played CS 1.6, its like beginning, and it could be your beginning! Negative: No more good tournaments on CS 1.6 (On CS:GO are tournaments like EMS, Dreamhack etc.) Graphic+Gameplay - Graphic sucks... but its still better then WarZ:P Gameplay.... yeah, crouching sucks, aiming sucks... u know... bad gameplay, if u see CS:GO, when is all so smooth, u will hate CS 1.6... but if u play CS 1.6 before then CS:GO, its good for you, and u will like it (probably:D) So... my opinion is: Its legendary game, everyone, who likes FPS must have this in his/her:P steam library. :)

review: Counter-Strike is probably one of the if not the best fps series ever, and it all started from this humble beginning, Counter -Strike 1.6 is a down right one of the greatest classics. It still holds up today, thousands of people play it EVERYDAY, this community has not weakend from 1999 it has gotten stronger, and it is 2014! The competitiveness and skillfulness of CS is so much fun, and no other game can even capture a mere smidge of it. This game also still has competitive servers still today, unlike the newer CS:source which just have casual servers that are only on office and Dust 2. On 1.6 you can find nearly every map (including moded maps), and nearly every game mode (even moded game modes). CS 1.6 still holds up today and it is still so much fun, I give 1.6 a 10 out of 10.

review: Counter-Strike 1.6 is a great ing game. What makes this game great is that I can write a review for it in one paragraph, completely summarize everything that is included in this game and still fully recommend it to everyone. This game is the most generic shooter at first glance, but after your first few weeks of CS 1.6 you quickly realize that this game's aesthetic simplicity only encourages more community map development. And when you really begin to play more of CS 1.6, you realize that the shooting mechanics and first person mechanics of this game is anything but simplistic. No other first person shooter feels just as a smooth as a valve first person shooter. And the amazing mechanics that are in this game are backed by an amazing community of players who will never leave CS 1.6 behind. The maps such as, dust2, inferno, and nuke are built to such perfection that they will suck you into the game as if you were in a modern militaristic tron. The gameplay is pretty similair to that of its opponent (COD). Search and Destroy is completely influenced by CS 1.6. Only downside I could think of is that really the only weapons that are worth using are the AK, M4, and the AWP. All the other weapons are left behind. In my opinion Counter-Strike 1.6 is a strong 8 out 10. It's a total classic.

Failure in Counter-Strike is, as it always has been for this series, the greatest way to learn where you should have gone, what you shouldn't have done, and how you could have done better. Counter-Strike players spend a lot of time learning -- consequently, they are always getting better.

That's ok because that's what make Counter Srike trully special, the learning curve is so steep that you'll never get bored, if you're up for the challenge of course... This game is the true tactical FPS multiplayer, many new games with fancy graphics try to accomplish what CS 1.6 did and fail terribly. 1.6 needs more love from valve, it was one of the games that made steam a 'thing', hell, back in the day it was the ONLY game to bring loyal users to the platform, the games available at the time were very reduced and steam was just an annoyance, to be completely honest we all hated steam, it was a broken nightmare. Valve could show some love for their baby... adding trading cards, bg's and emo's or even skins would be a great start... one call only dream.. :) tl;dr: Steam was very broken and the 1.6 playerbase kept it going, valve should recognize that.

review: Blame this game for the rise of the online multiplayer modern military shooter. Good game, great custom maps, terrible community. Not much has really changed since 2000, has it? I don't think anyone still plays this particular version of CS though. Edit: Wait, there are over 8,000 people in-game right now. Wow... guess I have to give this a "yes" then because it isn't dead.

review: Standard run and gun game that says it tries to stop cheaters and hackers out of the game, instead all it does is ban people who are having internet trouble trying to blame them for lag switching. It does not hitting those who you can obviously watch and see they are using aim bots by spectating after death and always aiming at people through walls at their heads ready to shoot the moment they turn corners.

review: If you can't get Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, this is great replacement for it. It's not as popular, but it still has a big amount of players. Some servers may be in languages you can't understand, but the game is still very fun and requires a great amount of skill. One of the best first person shooters, that still holds to this day from 1999. Although the game's graphics...aren't really the best. Even then, you can get skins, map textures, etc. to spice the graphics up a little bit. Though to me, graphics don't really matter. Highly recommend this game. 9.5/10

review: So I just played the original Counter Strike, CS1.6 for about an hour and after over 100 hours of both CSS and CSGO, this game is AMAZING! But so different! I love this game and its game series! It taught me tactical gameplay and how much communication is key but this game lacks a bit of that but not much. I absolutely love this and highly recommend it!

review: Played this game for the first time in 2008. Since then I have clocked more than 5000 hours, that's how addictive its multiplayer is. Father of all FPS in MP.

review: I'm not one to criticise a game but, this has to be a great title mostly for it's "Your role affects your team's success. Your team's success affects your role," system even if it had many problems. The gameplay is great with plenty of user created content to play. Vanilla gameplay is not advised as it gets repetitive fast. Overall gameplay is a 8.5 out of ten. The sound isn't very good with it's annoying tracks, the only way to fix this is to download custom gun sounds but thats a pain. The sound wasn't even good in 2000 when the game came out and thats telling you something. Overall 4.0 out of a possible ten. I know this is odd for me to review a game off of this but online community. The community if few and far between, there are BARELY any good servers up and sometimes the community is awful. (still not as bad as team fortress 2 IMO XD) Overall 6.0 out of ten. Graphics usually take the backseat in my reviews but, I do have to say the graphics are OK I mean in 2000 they still weren't as good as UNREAL 1 or IDTECH 3 but they get the job done. Overall 6.5 out of ten. My verdict is that this game is good and still is I have to say this is a damn fine game earning my score as an 80% out of 100% (BTW This is all criticism because, I AM A CRITIC.) (I go into detail about every problem a game has.) Therefore I recommend. Monstercat signing out.

review: So if you are a Counter Strike player from India there are chance i hate you . The game is amazing , the first game i ever played online , i had fun since i came to more depth ,in Indian Counter Strike community . Lets start from cons : 1. Too many servers .People floods with spams. 2. Hackers , people normaly play with illegal copies of CS and use hacks. 3. Admins there are people who are  and people who are admin in CS indian server's . The  scored a 2/10 score in test and the admin scored -10/10 due to the  and useless ban they does. My CS got destroyed so many times cause some dense admin thinks i was hacking (You play nice you must get punished destroy CS -Admins). Not all are dense thou. 4. The Community calls each other pro it may not be a bad thing but it is really annoying when you see people calling each other pro everwhere even your social life gets destroy if you are connected in a Counter Strike group tons of spam useless Ban and demo for hacking and all. 5. Wallspam in map like de_dust2 (which is played mostly) There are so many wallspam people spams a entire magazine in wall in hope for kills . Not once or twice but always you cant move from that place ever . 6. The Community is bad way too bad . and more. Now the pros 1.Gameplay CS requires gameplay i knew some player who were worth calling good or even a professional level player.they had the skills 2.Mods were allowed in servers . Jail Break was my most fav mod in CS . and there more like zombie mod. 3.The game is competitive in everyway . 4.There are few tourney for amature player to earn some money. its hard to see games this old still is successfull . 5.Maps are well made not talking about custom maps which are worse (in my opinion) some custom maps are good but majority are worse. 6.The recoil is kinda hard to control this makes the game hard for noobs who spams bullet hope for kills . 7.There are many more pros to this game . No doubt one of the best game i ever played . Still if you are an Indian CS player i hate you .

review: The greatest game out of the older games. This is why it is still going after so many years. This game contains LOTS of modifications including different maps to download for your server, different skins for your weapons and even fun mods like DODGEBALL or ZOMBIES! This game is certainly worth its full price and it does deliver the entertainment that you are looking for. Of course as it is an older game the graphics will not be compared to Call of Duty or Battlefield 4, but the graphics should be the last thing that a person worries about and you have to look at the level of the entertainment of the game. Counter-Strike definitely delivers that entertainment and that is why you can spend so many hours on this game.

review: This game, is not a multiplayer game, is THE Multiplayer Game. This game is classic, is a monster! Counter-Strike... I love those words. This is my 2 favorite game of all time. To be good in this game you must be a strategist, to have a good team relationship, and takes dedication. This game has tons of weapons to choose. THe game modes are PERFECT, the other community gamemodes are even better! You like COD with zombies, well, this game haved zombies before COD, and better zombies. In what game are you gonna do a deathrun, where you must be alert to everything and to have skills to survive and kill a terrorist? In what game are you gonna kill zombies, while they run at full speed and all your teammates throw granades and shoot as if there was no tommorow? In what game are you gonna surf on wall? In what game are you gonna find this quantity of maps, and good maps!? In what game!? Battlefield and COD can have better graphics, destruction, campaing and more guns, but, they will never have the community that Counter-Strike have. We made Counter-Strike, Counter-Strike made us.

review: Here's my story, I went over to my friend's house one day, he was playing CS. I tried it for myself, I was instantly hooked and have been for over 10 years with the counter strike franchise. Best online action franchise ever for the pc in my opinion. Counter strike is like a drug that you will never be cured from, trust me.

review: 1999 is when this came out, but when I was born. Gladly though I grew up to find out and discover about this magnificent piece. There was no other game that I played once I purchased this with some B-Day cash on Steam. First time playing, I got mutilated like the noob I was, but when I started playing more often, I became better and everyone else can too. This isn't like the CODs or Battlefields that I have played here and there today. No it's much more different. Counter-Strike is a Tactical FPS which relies on teamwork and tactics more than fast paced arcade action. You don't unlock weapons, you buy them with cash earned from kiling enemies, completeing objectives, or winning rounds although you still get a little for loosing. Think of the game as Cops & Robbers. Robbers blow things up and the Cops don't them too. On the extra note, this game has probably one of the best modding communities out there. There too much to do or put in here but I can slam a bit down. -Zombies Survival/Escape -Soccer (Or Football for the Europeans) -Surf -Bhop/KZ (Climbing Zone) -Pokemod -Gungame (Those new may have heard such from Call of Duty's spinoff) -And more, etc. So now that I've explained the game I guess I can lay down some pro's yet con's to playing Counter-Strike 1.6 PROS -Fun/Unlimited Gameplay possibilities -Booming community that has been alive for 15 years -Plethora of servers to choose from -Competetive and Casual at the same time -Fun to play with a group of friends -More skill based than many other games out there -Cheap price CONS -Graphics from 1998 may seem slightly offputting -Not an easy game to jump right into, as it takes lots of time to become better -May seem repetitive after a while I came into CS late. But, I'm glad this was the first one I owned.

review: This Game Is a classic master piece. And has AMAZING replay value. As a young gamer my self growing up in a world where most casual gamers are xbox humping, cod playing, graphic s. It is shameful that this game is not played. This game made and broke friendships and made a childhood for many people. Even if you dont play the game often. Please just get it for it to be in your library. 8/10 for some bugs and a now strange community. But nonetheless a great game.

review: This will be more of a ''my experience with this game'' type of review, because saying things like ''great gameplay'' will not suit something I've experienced with Counter-Strike. Here you go: I remember back in 2002 I was at a friend's house and he was playing a game. I didn't know the name of the game nor I had internet to find it. A few weeks passed by and another friend came over and he didn't have a computer, so he brought a disc with a game in it. He told me that it was one of the best games and from that very moment I knew that it is going to be the game I saw at the other friend's house. When I saw the Counter-Strike logo I was filled with gamegasm (?) and I was so happy. I don't remember a day when I was so happy like back then. So, the journey started. I was playing it hardcore. Made friends, clans, was involved in communities and even made two myself. Counter-Strike is my first game which I played competitively and it was a whole experience. Playing public servers and maybe some servers with mods was very fun, but playing it competitively made it very intense and stressful. In a pleasant way, ofcourse. Shooters these days try to be different, advanced in a way. Sometimes the most simple games like Counter-Strike are the ones that live to this day. Also, there are plenty of mods to keep your attention to this game. The gameplay is very simple - defend as a Counter-Terrorist, attack as a Terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a CT. I am sure most of you already know this and I doubt there are gamers that haven't heard or know the gameplay of Counter-Strike, so I am sharing here more of my experience. I wish I could find my CS Anthology account which I've lost since 2008. So, I decided I am going to buy this game again and here you go - more than a thousand hours played. I still play it from time to time to this day and it brings back many great memories and I sometimes even stumble upon people I've played with years ago. I think Counter-Strike changed gaming in a major way and we wouldn't have many games like we have today, if this game wouldn't exist. I am sure many of people already have played games like CS:GO, but never the roots. I doubt any of you will play it for more than an hour, because it's much more simple and it differs a lot in my opinion from CS:GO and modern games. I am glad that I lived through the golden era of shooters and if I'd have to rate it, it'd 10/10 ofcourse.

review: The greatest multiplayer shooter experience I've had since Quake 1. The e-sport scene also helped it alot, it's the only computer game I've really followed when it comes to e-sports (back when I followed the CPL etc). The design of the game was simple but very effective and delivered a multiplayer experience that few other games can match. The Call of Duty and Battlefield titles, although good in their own right, never drew me in like Counter-Strike.

review: Bought this game a bit too late... wish I would've been around to play it back in it's prime. This game is simply a classic. My first Counter-Strike was Source. I loved Source a lot, and that lead to me getting CS:GO. CS:GO is now my most played game. ANYWAYS, I bought this game pretty recently and I love playing it. Too bad the servers are bugged I think, otherwise, still has an alright community. great gameplay and requires a lot of skill. I love the wallbanging and the style you have to shoot. Not so much run n gun like the other games in the series. I definitely recommend this game. Even though I doubt many people are still buying this game!

review: You have this game to thank for modes like Call of Duty's "Search and Destroy." CS is arguably the most widely-played online shooter of all time, and it's still got a thriving community going on 12 years later. It's got simple, easy-to-pick-up gameplay that's spawned a massive competitive community. Unfortunately, it's extremely stale thanks to the fact that there are 3 game modes. Luckily, there are tons of customization options available online. Still, worth checking out for the sake of history.

Playing this for the first time as a kid, I felt it was so realistic lol. It was like being in a new world, basically. We came back to gaming cafe every once a while whenever we can afford it. One time, my dad came home early and we were not home, lol. Somehow, he figured out where we were at! Good times good times! This is one of few games that made my childhood memories.

review: The original CS. This is where it all started, 1.6. While many forget about 1.4, 1.5 and those versions, 1.6 is a great standalone title. Graphics wise, you have to be able to run this. If you can't run CS at all, not sure why you have Steam. Simple, and basic is what a lot of people would describe the look and feel of CS to be. If you haven't played HL original it make look a little stupid, but the game is still great inside. Original can't get more original here -- when talking about the base game idea(s). Great for people with low end comps and internet like Link Freeman and his dial up. This game was made a while back so keep that in mind! 7/10

review: This game STILL continue to live on, but why was that? Well it was quite due to that fact that CS:Source isn't that much like by the pros since 2004 as CS:S as quoted: "Too easy" and such, so the match for cs 1.6 grew more and more and that it was so hyped and praised and good, it still have matches even after 10 years of its 1.6 release (2003 - 2013) in which just kind of died out for CS:GO, but still, because of it's core gameplay and the fact that the commuity has been long just playing this multiplayer long and long and long, it is a game that will take long to die out, since it has a strong community base for it. Since this game has been, well for long, then you should commonly see the use of wallhacking, cheats, aimbot, fake servers been used today, and the fact that there are quite a lot of empty servers now, but there are populated servers that are good and good community, but there are part of the community been off ever since. It is seem a bit late to just buy and play this game, but it is still great to check it out if you are new to the cs series, or otherwise if you don't have GNU/Linux (In which I have), then you can buy Counter Strike : Globle Offensive anyway, since it is newer and (I think) has more players and pros playing it now. But if you want to have this raw action, then cs 1.6/cz would be great, you can get the bundle too if you want source as well, but source is fun to play as well. Verdict: 9.5/10 - It still holds it place.

review: Counter-Strike is a first-person shooter in which players join either the terrorist team, the counter-terrorist team, or become spectators. Each team attempts to complete their mission objective and/or eliminate the opposing team. Each round starts with the two teams spawning simultaneously. The objectives vary depending on the type of map, and these are the most usual ones: Bomb Maps: The terrorists must carry a bomb, plant it on one of the designated spots and protect it from being disarmed by the counter-terrorists before it explodes to win. The counter-terrorists win if the time runs out with no conclusion. Hostage Maps: The counter-terrorists must rescue a group of hostages held by the terrorists to win. The terrorists win if the time runs out with no conclusion. VIP Maps: One of the counter-terrorists is chosen to act as a VIP and the team must escort this player to a designated spot on the map to win the game. The terrorists win if the VIP is killed or if the time runs out with no conclusion.

review: When it boils down to competitive long lasting First Person Shooters, Counterstrike 1.6 is king. The unique money system on a two team map design is what puts Counterstrike apart from other Run and Gun FPS's. Many custom maps and mods are available, while still boasting a steady player base even 15 years after release.

review: Counter-Strike... This game is the reason to why I got a Steam account in the first place. I got this game six years ago from a near friend of mine. Everytime I was at his place we used to play this together in turns; he played for a while, maybe 2-3 deaths then I played. We had such a great time. But... the problem was that outside his house we couldn't play the game together. At the time my dad didn't allow me to buy the game, so my friend ended up giving it to me as a christmas present. Since that day we played it all the time. One of our favorite servers was Eropid (HS Only). He (my friend) ended up beeing in 4-5 place for a while on the server. Overall, I've had a great time playing this game, and still enjoy playing it today. The game was the start to my FPS gaming interest and since then I've bought every CS released. I recommed this game to anyone who wants to start play FPS games; as it is a great starting game. I also recommend that you play it with your friends; that way you will get the most fun out of it! Thanks for reading, and enjoy! - nit

review: The original Counter-Strike, is a game one cannot forget. Albeit having 3 successors, the gameplay of "the original" is incomparable. The title "Number 1 online action game" was truly deserved during its glory days. That said, the game is tactical, and the guns handle close to real-life counterparts. Either you plant a bomb, defuse a bomb, defend hostages or try rescuing them, there's also a few deathmatch maps, but the tactical/competitive gameplay is a lot better. If you find yourself struggling to get kills while revisiting one truly legendary game, try Condition Zero, as it's quite useful to understand the mechanics in the Counter-Strike franchise.

review: Best game known to man-kind. No enhanced engine captures the reality of this original. 1.5 was even better. Per. Head-shot boxes have NEVER been the same and since VAC I miss seeing the cheaters getting caught Red-Handed and added to the International blacklist. I still keep a black book of every IP at the scene of any crimes. If you want to experience the original AWP trying playing OP4. Shoot opponent in the hand or foot and they are toast! If you are still mad that 'they' Cliff and whoever took the silencer off the Colt I got the SOB back. Visit ANTPLA.NET to get skin pack II. Original was from ~01 and is still downloadable as General Sphinx Brothers of Steel BOS skin pack. I was there playing UK's Ganstawars Last Man Standing Gameplay type messing with the bots skins trying to get CS skins on Gangstawar bots and enjoyed how one of them was invisible. Sort of like a prank. If you can tommygun invisible opponent you are like a Luke Skywalker bad a$$. Skin pack II has the 'Starwars' lightsaber replacement for knife and the AK to plasma rifle from 1980's movie 'Alien'. The skins out compete CSGO any day of the week with 400fps instead of stuck on 30 same kernel. I got a duo-core up to 1200fps. Well I should not have shared the knowlege with other gamers on the map because next thing you know everybody was doing it on their own character. [AU] DeathWish settled it when it got to CS with rainbow coloured animated reskins instead of them being invisible. My first game was CS Canyon_Siege and I was wondering why we all were moving around as ghost spectators. I am not the Prodigy Inc SPHINX. I have only made auto-admin called 3 forms of punishment. It was for Admin Mod then re-written for AMX. Lost. No need for it anymore anyway. People still found a way to hack with it and fly around the maps prior to hook and vote for matrix, etc. Give them enough rope and instead of being slapped, killed, kicked, ban was in effect for short period. Essentially you mixed 2 words with lag and server and other various buZz words like gay server all these got punishments set fourth. Talking crap about admin was a slaying. Lag was a slap. It was based off Trinity and the server was the spirit. If trash talk is about the 'spirit', that is not forgivable or rather as tolerated and the ban was automatically set. That resolved major breach of security. Suddenly there is no need to have tons of admins. Most of whom were there just to exploit code often unintentionally, due to buggy 3rd party plug-ins such as STATSME.

review: Life is one .. CS is 1.6 only . I will not say it is the most fav game of mine . But it doesn't strive to be the most fav game of anyone . My fav game has to be GTA ! The thing why we all love this game and we all feel the urge to say this is the most fav game is that once this game starts , the human element takes over and we actually game with our friends ( and strangers) and that's what gives us the enjoyment; the feel of competitiveness and who is the best ; to be in awe of some good player and the list goes on . The game itself is not great but the way in which it just lets the human element takes over and be the silent spectator as we enjoy and have a good time , just speaks volumes of the greatness of this game ! The game is like a silent Guardian which governs us as we enjoy our life in the 1.6 way ! GG

review: The original Counter-Strike, is a game one cannot forget. Albeit having 3 successors, the gameplay of "the original" is incomparable. The title "Number 1 online action game" was truly deserved during its glory days. That said, the game is tactical, and the guns handle close to real-life counterparts. Either you plant a bomb, defuse a bomb, defend hostages or try rescuing them, there's also a few deathmatch maps, but the tactical/competitive gameplay is a lot better. If you find yourself struggling to get kills while revisiting one truly legendary game, try Condition Zero, as it's quite useful to understand the mechanics in the Counter-Strike franchise.

review: -This is my opinion your experience may vary- counter strike a name that almost anyone will recognize. Before I played counter strike I knew that it was a game loved by thousands even millions and that people play it every day. =The Graphics= this game's graphics are good (IMO) and it may not look to good by todays standards, they hold up just fine. =The Gameplay= The gameplay in Counter Strike involves starting out with some money to buy equipment, you earn more mony by killing members on the opposing team rescuing hostages, deactivating bombs, or plant and explode the bomb, also 1 life per round so work together. =My Verdict= I love this game the people who play it are pretty cool most of the time and the game can really suck you in and $10 may be kinda steep in for a game this old but it comes with -Counter Strike -Counter Strike: Condition Zero -Counter Strike: Condition Zero Deleted Scenes wich all come in the $10 asking price and I would give this game a 9/10

review: A fantastic game that improves your fluency in the foreign languages. Every server you visit has the charming alure of Mexicans and Brazillians; an honorable bunch of players who praise your skills with phrases such as "filho da !!!!!!", "xiter!!!" and "jajajajaja". They are also very skilled players ingame; I often see a single player moving at the speed of sound, headshotting everyone in a blink of an eye, and getting all the praise from his fellow brethren, usually in the form of "xiter fdp!!!". Overall, I recommend this game to all individuals seeking to have a fun, non-hacker, non-english gameplay experience.

review: Best game known to man-kind. No enhanced engine captures the reality of this original. 1.5 was even better. Per. Head-shot boxes have NEVER been the same and since VAC I miss seeing the cheaters getting caught Red-Handed and added to the International blacklist. I still keep a black book of every IP at the scene of any crimes. If you want to experience the original AWP trying playing OP4. Shoot opponent in the hand or foot and they are toast! If you are still mad that 'they' Cliff and whoever took the silencer off the Colt I got the SOB back. Visit ANTPLA.NET to get skin pack II. Original was from ~01 and is still downloadable as General Sphinx Brothers of Steel BOS skin pack. I was there playing UK's Ganstawars Last Man Standing Gameplay type messing with the bots skins trying to get CS skins on Gangstawar bots and enjoyed how one of them was invisible. Sort of like a prank. If you can tommygun invisible opponent you are like a Luke Skywalker bad a$$. Skin pack II has the 'Starwars' lightsaber replacement for knife and the AK to plasma rifle from 1980's movie 'Alien'. The skins out compete CSGO any day of the week with 400fps instead of stuck on 30 same kernel. I got a duo-core up to 1200fps. Well I should not have shared the knowlege with other gamers on the map because next thing you know everybody was doing it on their own character. [AU] DeathWish settled it when it got to CS with rainbow coloured animated reskins instead of them being invisible. My first game was CS Canyon_Siege and I was wondering why we all were moving around as ghost spectators. I am not the Prodigy Inc SPHINX. I have only made auto-admin called 3 forms of punishment. It was for Admin Mod then re-written for AMX. Lost. No need for it anymore anyway. People still found a way to hack with it and fly around the maps prior to hook and vote for matrix, etc. Give them enough rope and instead of being slapped, killed, kicked, ban was in effect for short period. Essentially you mixed 2 words with lag and server and other various buZz words like gay server all these got punishments set fourth. Talking crap about admin was a slaying. Lag was a slap. It was based off Trinity and the server was the spirit. If trash talk is about the 'spirit', that is not forgivable or rather as tolerated and the ban was automatically set. That resolved major breach of security. Suddenly there is no need to have tons of admins. Most of whom were there just to exploit code often unintentionally, due to buggy 3rd party plug-ins such as STATSME.

review: This is the game that started a genre, every shooter since CS has copied its competitive team-based style of play. Its the original to a legacy, and many people still play it to this day. It has older graphics for people who might not have an expensive computer, plenty of dedicated servers, and the core gameplay that is known worldwide is right here where it belongs. But obviously you know this already unless you've been spending your life playing on Xbox and playstation. Right?

review: From begining , I have to say that I played a lot of FPS & First Person Shooter games and cs 1.6 is the only one that I still play because it's so good. I started to play Counter-Strike 7 years ago.(2013 now) And I still play it yeah , I took a break from playing it cuz my parents didn't like the blood etc. After 1 year without cs 1.6 I decided to start again. Everything was changed a new update , more hackers , a lot of noobs.And just 4000+ servers , and 7 years ago was with 9999+ even more ! So I started to hate Valve for this .. they removed everything to make that cs go much better for cs 1.6 players to go on csgo. I was so nervous . I stopped again , but after serveral mounths I started again and something has changed.. I heard about a new update but I thought that will be another . But it wasn't actually the new update I really liked it.. All the old settings are back and I use this 2013 cs 1.6 updated . So today in this moment when I'm writing this I just finished a mix in Counter-Strike . That's my story about Counter-Strike , I recommend this game , it's just awesome , you should play it ! If you do add me as your friend , maybe we will play in a mix together ! :) GL&HF !.

review: This game changed gaming as a whole. One of the best FPS of all time, if not the best. But its all about the gameplay. Its how CS plays that will get you. Huge online community, thousands of mods, nostalgic graphics, excellent gameplay, nice sound effects even if they r outdated. CS 1.6 is my favorite FPS and is much better than Source and Global Offensive in almost all aspects. I played this game so much before i got Steam, this game is just spetacular. Even in non-steam gaming, lan houses,competitive play, CS 1.6 is still incredibly popular. 10/10, congratulations to the developers.

review: -This is my opinion your experience may vary- counter strike a name that almost anyone will recognize. Before I played counter strike I knew that it was a game loved by thousands even millions and that people play it every day. =The Graphics= this game's graphics are good (IMO) and it may not look to good by todays standards, they hold up just fine. =The Gameplay= The gameplay in Counter Strike involves starting out with some money to buy equipment, you earn more mony by killing members on the opposing team rescuing hostages, deactivating bombs, or plant and explode the bomb, also 1 life per round so work together. =My Verdict= I love this game the people who play it are pretty cool most of the time and the game can really suck you in and $10 may be kinda steep in for a game this old but it comes with -Counter Strike -Counter Strike: Condition Zero -Counter Strike: Condition Zero Deleted Scenes wich all come in the $10 asking price and I would give this game a 9/10

review: Counter-Strike... This game is the reason to why I got a Steam account in the first place. I got this game six years ago from a near friend of mine. Everytime I was at his place we used to play this together in turns; he played for a while, maybe 2-3 deaths then I played. We had such a great time. But... the problem was that outside his house we couldn't play the game together. At the time my dad didn't allow me to buy the game, so my friend ended up giving it to me as a christmas present. Since that day we played it all the time. One of our favorite servers was Eropid (HS Only). He (my friend) ended up beeing in 4-5 place for a while on the server. Overall, I've had a great time playing this game, and still enjoy playing it today. The game was the start to my FPS gaming interest and since then I've bought every CS released. I recommed this game to anyone who wants to start play FPS games; as it is a great starting game. I also recommend that you play it with your friends; that way you will get the most fun out of it! Thanks for reading, and enjoy! - nit

review: Counter Strike 1.6 is a good game. It used to be SOOOOO much better, but now there are hardly any servers running, and even less vanilla counter strike servers(servers without mods). Unless your a hardcore counter strike player, I'd reccomend you just get CS:GO. The gameplay is better in the first place, there is workshop, and billions of hours of content. Back in the day 9.8/10 Now...6/10 Don't be hatin'

review: This game is a prime example of how a great game tends to pass the test of time. Although the graphics are very outdated (graphics aren't everything), the gameplay is good enough that the game is consistently on player number charts even after 15 years the original mod was released. BE CAREFUL: There are a lot of FAKE servers out there. Be sure not to click on those.

Game provides many different gamemodes from regular deathmatch-bomb plant mission to platformer style of gamemodes. Overall an awesome game and I recommend it to anyone who has any cs experience or has any interest in FPS-shooters :)

One of the first breakout e-sports (alongside Starcraft) and a significant influence on the FPS genre. A piece of gaming history. Play it if only for that, and see for yourself.

review: Few years ago, we first heard that CS 1.6 is dead, some organizations have dismissed their CS - team, people screaming that the game is dead and we need to move to CS: GO. It seems that now it is not so! If you pay attention to the broadcast with IEM 6 WC, we see that CS 1.6 By Views prevzashla SC 2, not only is this game broke all past their records. So why CS 1.6 is dead? I beg to differ. According to spectators IEM 6 CS was the best in the tournament. I think CS 1.6 hardly died, she would die only if we want to do! As for CS: GO it grows, developers even began to read the "Feedback", the game has changed a lot of things. Open Beta -version of the game was to be released after the new year, but I think the developers have not yet sufficiently satisfied with the result. As for the keys to the CS: GO, something I'm working on that would get a couple of the key for you guys! I will write how I succeed!

review: This game... Is great. No, seriously, this is an awesome game. However, It isn't quie worth 10 bucks, maybe 7.50, so either wait for a sale, or buy a retail copy and use the CD Key. PROS: -Extremely fun -Balanced weapons (Except for the AWP) -Lots of servers & players -It's classic -It's not that big, it's only about 400 MB. CONS: -Learning curve is a cliff. That's on fire. -Not the best graphics (Can be fixed with a texture pack) -No bots Overall, I give this game an 8/10. Now buy it, NOW!

review: Counter Strike is a game that will be in the gaming history books for centuries to come. It IS VALVe's turn in the competitive scene and this is their weapon. Counter-Strike. Stupendous game which has proven to many gamers that gameplay, strategy and quick thinking comes first and graphics second. Unique because of the ability to completely control the recoil of your weapon. Astounding as pretty much all the maps are beautifully designed, even now I appreciate the creativity, the player and modding bases allowing for some of the best content by the people, you to create. The gun mechanics are by far the best seen in any game I have ever played. The way the guns fire and flow syngerize and play so well, it's almost mad why they never copied this to CSS and CSGO. Planning rather than rushing is another reason. You never know what terrors come across. Counter Strike is no longer updated but however is still alive and played by most of Europe, where small teams and clans are still existing to this day. Veterans also still play this game (I don't play comp on this but I have met and played with players totalling 3000 hours on it, which is insane, inspiring and completely awesome!) the game itself, is in no way glitchy or bugged and is in fact, for a better word for it, near-perfection. VALVe will be remembered in the glory that is Counter Strike.

review: This will be more of a ''my experience with this game'' type of review, because saying things like ''great gameplay'' will not suit something I've experienced with Counter-Strike. Here you go: I remember back in 2002 I was at a friend's house and he was playing a game. I didn't know the name of the game nor I had internet to find it. A few weeks passed by and another friend came over and he didn't have a computer, so he brought a disc with a game in it. He told me that it was one of the best games and from that very moment I knew that it is going to be the game I saw at the other friend's house. When I saw the Counter-Strike logo I was filled with gamegasm (?) and I was so happy. I don't remember a day when I was so happy like back then. So, the journey started. I was playing it hardcore. Made friends, clans, was involved in communities and even made two myself. Counter-Strike is my first game which I played competitively and it was a whole experience. Playing public servers and maybe some servers with mods was very fun, but playing it competitively made it very intense and stressful. In a pleasant way, ofcourse. Shooters these days try to be different, advanced in a way. Sometimes the most simple games like Counter-Strike are the ones that live to this day. Also, there are plenty of mods to keep your attention to this game. The gameplay is very simple - defend as a Counter-Terrorist, attack as a Terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a CT. I am sure most of you already know this and I doubt there are gamers that haven't heard or know the gameplay of Counter-Strike, so I am sharing here more of my experience. I wish I could find my CS Anthology account which I've lost since 2008. So, I decided I am going to buy this game again and here you go - more than a thousand hours played. I still play it from time to time to this day and it brings back many great memories and I sometimes even stumble upon people I've played with years ago. I think Counter-Strike changed gaming in a major way and we wouldn't have many games like we have today, if this game wouldn't exist. I am sure many of people already have played games like CS:GO, but never the roots. I doubt any of you will play it for more than an hour, because it's much more simple and it differs a lot in my opinion from CS:GO and modern games. I am glad that I lived through the golden era of shooters and if I'd have to rate it, it'd 10/10 ofcourse,

In overall, I recommend it to everyone, please do not judge this game for graphics and/or lack of military actions, GoldSrc engine is not Real Virtuality 3 ( Arma 2 engine ), and this game is old school, typical classic so graphics are what they are.

review: Few years ago, we first heard that CS 1.6 is dead, some organizations have dismissed their CS - team, people screaming that the game is dead and we need to move to CS: GO. It seems that now it is not so! If you pay attention to the broadcast with IEM 6 WC, we see that CS 1.6 By Views prevzashla SC 2, not only is this game broke all past their records. So why CS 1.6 is dead? I beg to differ. According to spectators IEM 6 CS was the best in the tournament. I think CS 1.6 hardly died, she would die only if we want to do! As for CS: GO it grows, developers even began to read the "Feedback", the game has changed a lot of things. Open Beta -version of the game was to be released after the new year, but I think the developers have not yet sufficiently satisfied with the result. As for the keys to the CS: GO, something I'm working on that would get a couple of the key for you guys! I will write how I succeed!

review: I was sitting in CT Spawn in de_dust2 after I found my entire team afk sitting right next to me. I decided to sneak up on cat when I heard "Bomb has been planted" by the terrorist opposition. I proceeded to act like a Slick Ninja by avoiding all terrorists. Only to find out most of them went to look for our team and killed them in ct spawn. I went around on Cat Walk, Threw a smoke, and went to cut the wire of the bomb the Terrorists had planted. I almost cut the Blue wire, and it could have cost us the round. 5 Seconds goes by, and it says, "Counter Terrorist wins". At that very moment, I just realized I had won the game. That is my story. Counter-Strike = Thumbs up!

review: Counter-Strike is a pretty old game of "shooter", which was developed in 1999, and since 2000, supported by Valve. This game immediately caught on millions of players around the world. The game is a confrontation of terrorists and counter-terrorists, representing the forces of good and evil. Objectives of the opposing sides differ depending on the map, in which the battle. And here is my thoughs... This is the most entertaining video game i've ever played since 2007. I think i've played this game like 2000hrs i guess, played only the cracked version in that day... I finally i bought this game and it's worth 10 bucks indeed. I still play CS 1.6 because i had an amazing childhood with it! By that i didn't mean online or with bots but i had lots of LAN-party's in my country and my friends still play it though but theres still Lan-party's sometimes in my country ^^ The game is still fun and it never gets boring! I mean todally this game has lots of gamemodes which is ZM/ZE/CSDM/GUNGAME/FURIEN/SURF/DEATHRUN/BASEBUILDER and more and more and more... It's just fantastic! :D 10/10 Would recommand it!

I have at least 400+ hours in this game on another account as i loved it very much, As far as i know, I have CSGO now and i play that instead. I missed this game very much. I hope to get it again. This is just like the other CS games, You play as a Terrorist and Counter Terrorist. The objective of the Terrorist is to use the C4 and blow up 2 area's, Either one could do. A or B. While the Counter-Terrorist's objective is to Stop the bomb from being planted, If it is planted, They have to eliminate all Terrorist and Defuse the bomb. It takes around 5 second's or 10 to defuse, It depends if you have a defuse kit. It's a good game and i recommend it.

review: Get this game if you love repeatedly hearing sounds of "Fire in the hole!", not respawning after you die and having to deal with players hundreds of times better than you when you first begin playing. If you enjoy a game of frustration with a terrible community who will look down on you for not having reflexes like a cyborg, this is the right game for you. Also, if you don't already have this game, you are a . Please either buy it or leave Steam immediately.

review: A wise man once told me "Maybe you should load up some Counter-Strike 1.6 and  around on some pub servers for a bit.". And that was what I did. And it was good. Then I entered a server with a bunch of  plebs. Sometimes there would be a player or two that could challenge me and we'd have fun little fights. We'd make jokes back and forth with the radio but when I started asking for nude  pics (no homo), the dude didn't respond ;_; . Two hours later, I noticed a player wouldn't stop trying to jump on a single ledge. Failing, he would back up and then try again and again and again without end and never shot back. I just sat there are watched him. That was when I realized the entire server was just bots and my conversations were with the rare amount of human players. Didn't know what to think.

review: This game is THE best action shooter ever made, it's gameplay is very well balanced and you have many options and tactics to do. Actually, if you play CS:GO, then this game is exactly the same except that the graphics are from 2000. But this does not matter. Gameplay is far more enjoyable then graphics! And if steam was built aound this game, well, then it must be some good stuff.

review: This comes with expansion pack Condation Zero free! I didn't get the game years ago but it is still suprisinely one of the most played games on Steam despite coming out in 2000 and not getting updated anymore. It's about taking sides between the Counter Terriests and the Terriests and rescueing/keeping hostages, stoping/planting bombs or fighting in a deathmatch. It's about the community, a lot more play the newer version of this on a different engine and the more recent and updated a lot Global Offence new CS game. Most people on here have been playing for a lot longer. Since they are bought in pack together, here's review for Condation Zero: A free expanion you get along with Counter Strike when you buy CS on Steam. Adds single player missons and it updates Counter Strikes Multiplayer Content.

review: Cs... discovered that game back in 2000s, friends introduced me into 1.3 more than a decade ago, in a cyber near school. Wasn't playing FPS these years but I decided to keep it, Felt like I was in the game instead of my character (shooting on everything that moves o/) Wasn't good until I discovered how to recoil in cs works... I kept playing at it only on LAN with my friends, and then I decided to play online, another stuff haha. I found that cs got a huge eSport wold wide scene, and I decided to follow that competitive game. By years, The gamestyle I've built in any FPS now was born in Counter-Strike, the incarnation of the perfect FPS game ever.

review: This game is THE best action shooter ever made, it's gameplay is very well balanced and you have many options and tactics to do. Actually, if you play CS:GO, then this game is exactly the same except that the graphics are from 2000. But this does not matter. Gameplay is far more enjoyable then graphics! And if steam was built aound this game, well, then it must be some good stuff.

review: Counter Strike is even fight between highly trained American anti-terrorist team using latest in military technology to battle a group of really pissed madmen possessing crude bomb and surplus from USSR 1980's army supplies. Despite all training and technology terrorists still have good chance of blowing up market therefore much like real life. Game is currently full of hackers who fly on top of map so unless you hack or like getting aerial teabag please play better Counter Strike Sauce or Counter Strike Go game. This game has had its day and only exists for historical purposes. I remember times when internet cafe and mosque full of this game. No more.

review: Counter-Strike is a tactical first-person shooter video game which originated from a Half-Life modification and features real-world weapons. Counter-Strike pits a team of counter-terrorists against a team of terrorists in a series of rounds. Each round is won by either completing the mission objective or eliminating the opposing force. The game has both individual and multiplayer options. Bots can be added into the game. The online-multiplayer option is activated via Steam. Other than similarities in basic gameplay, Counter-Strike is not in any way related to Half-Life. The original version was marketed as a commercial mod, but since then it has grown into a separate game in itself.

review: best game ever made and the beginning of esport and after 15 years it still a very good game but dont much people play it that is very sad because its very good and the best game ever made. The graphics don't really matter or it looks like minecraft fps it's about the game how you play it, it still is the best game ever made and is the start of Counter-Strike series but not a single Counter-Strike that has been made after 1.6 is not comparable with 1.6. The game engine is so good are nice and the graphics arent good but that how i think cs should be, like the bad look and back in the days when you couldn't do very good 3D models of the map and the weapons etc now when csgo came the game looks very good and beautifal it look like cod and you dont get the counter-strike feeling.

review: Hello people, i would like to spread the world about this game. Graphics kinda bad, but its about the action, eh? So, it is mainly based as a game, terrorists vs counter-terrorists. Terrorists have to plant the bomb,(at de_maps) or secure the hostages (at cs_maps). Counter ones needs to do the opposite, defuse or deny the bomb (at de_maps) and get the hostages back (at cs_maps). There are a lot of mods, if you dont like the classic mode. But i really think that everyone knows about this game :). P.s. Im doing this for a steam badge :D

review: Classic FPS fun. Nothing beats the original. (Except maybe source) But you'll be happy to find that both 1.6 and Source still have thriving communities. The best thing about 1.6 is that it's requirements are a potato (lamp recommended) and chances are, it will run flawlessly on your system. I don't need to praise the gameplay because what else can be said that hasn't already? Deathmatch, gun game, bomb defuse and many more. And with what seems to be an endless amount of fun and creative maps at it's disposal, it's no wonder people still play it today. If you have steam CS 1.6 is ESSENTIAL. (I also recommend source)

review: At first a third-party mod for Half-Life Deathmatch, Counter Strike became one of the most recognized and accoladed FPS's amongst the PC gaming community, and 1.6 is still going strong with hundreds of servers available free-to-play worldwide, even after the release of Source (the newer version of CS using the HL2 engine). Nothing comes close to the intuitive physics and control provided by the old-school Half-Life 1 engine. Clever map design, in combination with a wide (but not overly-acclectic) collection of firearms and equipment at your disposal make for exciting deathmatch-style firefights as well as situtions requiring strategy and coordination with teamates. The beauty of this game is it's simplicity, and diversity of action: There are no classes, no upgrades or bonuses, and nothing giving any player any sort of in-game advantage over another, save for skill and knowledge of the game. A large arsenal of uniquely-tuned weapons, CS's worldwide appeal and player base, and a plethora of every map type you could possibly imagine make for some very memorable gameplay experiences.

review: The sum of years of work put into designing something the devs were happy with along with the community (back when the community wasn't composed of reddit and casuals).This game has a good design in general. Its very simple, very clean, and thats what makes a great game. There are some small things I could whine about but for the time it came out and even now, these things arn't huge issues that could frustrate me like the issues in the newer iterations of CS. This is CS. Its a damn good game that you have to play. Its a shame though they abadoned pretty much everything about this game in GO aside from the fact you play on T or CT and buy guns. Only problem is no US and english speaking players. Which pretty much ruins the game when you don't want to hear third worlders and their monkey screeching.

review: A great game of cat-and-mouse where you either play as a terrorist (plant bombs or hold hostages) or counter-terrorist (defend bombsites or rescue hostages). Either complete those objectives or kill all players of the opposing team to win the round. Counter-Strike is a fast-paced, realistic shooter that encourages teamwork so play with a friend (it's also more fun). The graphics hasn't aged well but the guns still looks authentic. One thing I hate about Counter-Strike is when you die, you have to sit and wait until the round ends. Even if the rounds are usually short, it's frustrating and it puts a ton of anxiety to your efforts of staying alive. Fortunately, Counter-Strike has tons of mods available so you're able to play the game in many different ways. This helps the game from becoming repetitive and keep the game fresh. There's also not a lot of detail in the sound, other than the guns, but that's a minor complaint. The mods, dedicated servers and competitive nature of the game is what holds this game together to this day and that's why millions of people still play this old-school game. Although there are many better shooters on the market now, Counter-Strike's unique gameplay is what keeps me coming back from time to time. 8/10 - GREAT GAME!

The game just gets boring, BUT, it has a lot of different mods and server plug-ins which can make of this a decent game for a few hours. I have bought this, and I don't regret buying it, but if you have something else in mind, leave this one as the second choice. 6/10.

review: I love Counter Strike, I should end it here. But I'll be honest and say I grew up with Source, wasn't old enough to experince 1.6 sadly. But giving it a try, it's very different, having to buy ammo, see what the original maps looked like before being changed in Source. And dealing with pros that somehow can deal with the game choppyness and inaccuracy. I'll stick with Source, but great game! 9/10

review: Counter-Strike, this one also known as Counter-Strike 1.6, is a team-based multiplayer realistical/military shooter. And a very well known one at that. It was first available as a free mod for Half-Life 1, being patched regulary up to version 1.6, until recently it got it's way onto Steam, as a serapately sold title. So, how is the player base? Counter-strike 1.6, being popular self, has an active player base. You will see many servers, up to 32 players. At very least there are many Russian servers, as it had a cult following over there, can't really see past them. On bad side, most seems to prefer "Terrorist plant C4" mode and then De_Dust2 is the most played map. A lot of servers run small mods, that may alter balance or other small things. And most of it, playerbase had a lot of time to play and master this game, so new players will be more frustated than having fun learning. Counter-Strike is a very well known realistical FPS. It gained it's popularity while being free mod for popular Half-Life, because it provided something else what wasn't overused yet - realistical shootouts (using models of real weapons, you know) in team multiplayer. Unforgiving and furious. Or unbalanced and twitchy one-shot kills with headshots. Whichever one you prefer. Counter-Strike has two types of map. First, "de", is a mode where counter-terrorists have do defends few market spots on map from terrorist. One of the terrorists spawns with C4 in inventrory and has to bring it to one of the marked spots to plant it adn start to countdown of T's victory. Roles change as Terrorists will have now to defend this place from CTs, who's aim now are to defuse the bomb, in which case CTs will win the round, no matter how many more Ts are left. Pretty interesting mode and most played, otherwise this game would have been camping fest. And if one site is too well defended, Ts can go to another one. And then there is a second type, "cs", in which CTs have to to rescue hostages by bringing them back to base. The problem there, is that hostage NPCs aren't perfect (though good enough) and since CTs have to rescue them all, Terrorist can camp in one of the spots around them, since CTs will have no choice but to come to win. Much less played and even if it does, it goes like your everyday Team Deathmatch, just killing all of opposite team. Much simpler anyway. Now, the core gameplay... There are few rounds. Each round starts with each team spawning on their side of map. There is no respawning during round, once person is dead he is out, so you will have to worry much more about getting insta-killed. There are no items placed on map itself either (on correct, official maps), no kind of medikits. In spawn place, you have 15 seconds to press "b" button (or whichever you set) to bring up "buy menu", where you purchase weapons and equipment for the round witht he money that you earned so far. Yep, when round ends everybody gets some sum of money to spend, with winning team getting more, an ingenius design decision that helps losing team to get steamrolled even harder. What you can buy there is a pistol, primary weapon and any of the equipment. (Yep, if it doesn't smell like prototype of modern military shooters) Once past purchase screen, you are free to run and shoot. And here comes the art of recoil and aiming. For you see, one of the more important thing that is used in this game is accuaricy of your weapon. If you move it drops. if you jump, it drops. It drops while you are shooting too. Thus it becomes more importanly to get good position, making assaults more compilated, and you often have to relearn to shoot, making few clicks instead of just holding down mouse button. You will have to be often walking instead of running, to keep accuaricy while moving (it also makes you silent, so do it often), or just stand and crouch sometimes. Burst shooting is better there and for long range targets you want to be just click few times. Another important thing is that you can shoot through some walls with more powerful primary weapons. So don't be surprised for people shooting through door, walls and even just over the corner, it indeed does small damage to whoever is behind. The game also emphasises aiming because it supports headshots and they do a MASSIVE damage. And you also got three kinds of grenades. Explosive (HE), which explodes, good for throwing into chokepoints. Flashbang, which blinds whoever looked at it when it blows for few seconds, quite annoying but good for stroming into room. And Smoke Grenade, when you don't want enemies to see you coming and don't want to be under direct fire, good for open spaces with snipers (who instakill you when you peek around corner). Protip: You run slightly faster with knife out. And well, while on theory it sounds interesting, as well as empashises teamwork. here comes the downfall of the game. The weapons, while make people with gun fetish happy, are badly balanced around each other. There are just best and bad weapons. From pistols Desert Eagle is the best, they behave as backup when you got no time to reload primary weapon. Shotguns are theorically good for close range but in this game they are useless and Assault Rifles can kill even better at close range. Sub-Machine Guns category had advantage of no accuaricy drops while moving, but are still inferior to Rifles. Rifles category has two best guns: all-range assault rifle like AK-47 and all-range sniper rifle like AWP (which doesn't even require headshot to one-hit kill), exactly what majority of people use. The only Machine Gun is "pew pew pew can't hit". And all-range is all-range, random is random. You may run and shoot in general direction of enemy and pull off a headshot from your AK-47 by luck. Or you may walk around corner, thinking of your next grandious tactical plan, just to get headshotted in insta-second by guy with sniper rifle from close range. It's just so full of cheap and frustating, the rage is probably the main thing that keeps players coming back for more, not honest fun, as well as luck of possibly pulling few magical headshots. Slow-down when being hit doesn't seem to be good idea either, making it harder to get away from the choke points. And random spread is not actually random, it just randomly follows one of the pre-set pattern. And yes, if you will learn them, you will be able to control your shooting better and get on top. Exactly what puts apart newbiews and elites, and exactly what elites seem to boast about when they want to say that Counter-Strike 1.6 is the best because it takes more skills and time to learn, with artifical challenges like this one that makes little sense. And well, once you spend your time to learn them, you will still find out on top that it didn't make the game any more amazing. But you know, it's not too bad. It does teamwork well. Sometimes the game just works. When you work along the team, round the corners and storming the next room, where you follow teammates, supporting each other. Provide covering fire to the corner. When upon entering next place, each one covers his own direction, as some of the rooms just have too many places from which enemies can shoot you (smoke grenade and flashbangs help in these cases). And it's pretty damn nice at those moments, until they get ruined by something stupid, something you don't feel like could be prevented. Yea, getting shot by sniper. And yes, this game has good enough sounds. No music, sadly. The graphics are quite HL1 high-definition era, but otherwise are fine enough. The levels are a bit of bland though. Can't really recommend it. Because everybody who will like such games are already playing it. And player base of this game had too much time by now, that they will be just way too skilled for new players, who will just get destroyed and it will take a long time to get onto same level. It's not like there aren't enough military/realistical shooters anyway.

review: Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is the current iteration of Valves top-in-class competitive shooter, and the first to be maintained in the very modern way it has been. Learning from its experience with Team Fortress 2, Valve has a miniature economy in CS: GO that revolves entirely around gun decals. Players get a few drops a week after matches, which can be a gun decal or a weapon crate  the latter of which cost 1.49 to unlock with a one-use key from the store. Obviously this economy is tailor-made, and so there are extraordinarily rare and mysteriously fantastic-looking gun and knife skins (with prices in the hundreds of pounds), then a large range of other skins tapering down to the common-as-muck variety that trades for pennies. I dont pay much attention to the CS: GO economy as a whole, though its interesting enough, but its important for a non-player to understand that a big chunk of the games audience takes it very seriously indeed. In the days after a new Operation launches countless forum threads are launched about the value of the new goods, whether someone should sell this new rare drop they got or hold it for a while, Twitch streams with giveaways and 50 crates being unlocked and so on. You get the picture. I give such context on CS: GOs economy because  even though it is a subsidiary part of the game to many including myself  it is the molten core of Operation Vanguard. CS: GO is a regularly-patched game but the major updates come in the form of Operations that introduce new maps and new skins, at the price of around 3 for an access pass  with the nice touch that maps are available to all players regardless, or made so shortly afterwards. To give an exhaustive history of Operations would be no more useful than a general overview. If you play Counter-Strike then the chances are you play a lot of Counter-Strike. What the Operations do is freshen things up a bit  naturally they dont disrupt the regular Dust-Mirage-Inferno cycle of competitive play, but you get some unfamiliar environments to tool about in, the chance to score some fancy new weapons, and in the context of a game you play almost daily, 3 a few times a year is chicken feed. Operation Vanguard is different, and the changes are not for the better. The first problem I have with it is major: the way its sold seems to skirt the borderline of deception. To participate in Operation Breakout you bought an All-Access Pass for 2.39. To participate in Operation Vanguard I bought an Access Pass for 2.39. The difference is obvious side-by-side, but of course when OV popped up in Counter-Strikes home menu I bought it more or less instantly, thinking this was the same thing. OVs selling point is two campaigns, a series of missions with three branching paths. The missions are things like Win 16 rounds on map X and Kill 20 chickens in Deathmatch mode, and completing one bags a pre-determined award  either a weapon crate or a random weapon from a specified collection. So far, so OK. But in fact OV has two more campaigns, both of which cost 1.79 to access  which follow more or less the same pattern. To be crystal-clear about this, the money is not the problem. Im happy to pay for Operations, and OVs combined total of around 6 in the context of the time I put into Counter-Strike is really not an issue. But that switch from All-Access Pass to Access Pass (with the right to buy more access), just pissed me right off. First of all I felt conned. I bought the OV pass in the same way Id bought all the previous Operation passes, expected it to be the same deal, and realised Id been fooled by the removal of All. Secondly, what the two extra purchases offer is basically a re-skinned version of OVs mission book. But thirdly, and this is the real killer, youre encouraged to buy them to self-medicate the most egregious, enormous, climactically wrong and frankly offensive design decision in Vanguard. There are multi-day cooldowns on missions. Thats right Rambo, you may have thought you were buying another set of missions and drops to liven up day-to-day business in CS: GO, but in fact Vanguard is a campaign designed to play out over a set period of time, with the only limiting factor a bald external one: cooldown timers. Let me set the scene for you. I love Counter-Strike. I saw Vanguard was out on a Thursday, and cleared Friday night. Got in a few beers. Booted it up and bought the pass. I played the first mission, cleared it in about 15 minutes. Chose a second, the killing chickens one, and that was another 15 mins. So around half an hour into my evening of joy I was given a four-day cooldown for the next mission. You can slice this any way you want, but its . The sad thing is I get the thought process behind it. Consider: youre Valve, in charge of a game where players (a) want new content but (b) put in so many hours that theyll rush through anything almost instantly. For example, mission chains. Operation Breakout introduced missions in the form of random drops, which parcelled them out over time but had no larger arc. It was fine but the missions never felt important. So Operation Vanguards missions are in structured patterns, with defined rewards, and are given the desired longevity through simple brute force of timing. You will not complete this content before we say so, because you cant. Oh, except that if you buy the extra mission packs, your cooldowns decrease across the board, because now youre allowed to do more missions in a set period. Thats right. Youre basically paying to reduce cooldowns. In a Valve game. The thing is that Operation Vanguard is only a campaign in the same way that a pile of biscuits is lunch. The missions are basic objectives like Win 16 competitive rounds on Season or Get 100 FAMAS kills in Deathmatch mode. And what do you get for completing them? Either a drop from an existing collection of guns, with a minor chance of a rare gun, or a weapon crate. The first is fair enough, but the second I mean, at this point I already felt pretty rinsed by Operation Vanguard, and now its rewarding me with crates that I need to pay more money to open. There is a school of thought that says Valve has done this in order that a flood of new crates and mission rewards doesnt flood the in-game economy, instead trickling them in over the coming months. To that argument the only appropriate response is  who cares? I play Counter-Strike: GO because its a great game, I dont play it because of the economy, and while I accept the latter is how Valve makes money, the moment it starts intruding into the game  if indeed this explanation holds water  then the economy is not acting in the way that it should. That is, it should be improving the experience rather than throttling it. The sad thing is that Operation Vanguard comes with my favourite selection of community maps yet, including two in Season and Back Alley that feel like potential classics. Yeah theyre all over the place in terms of favouring one side or the other, but this is par for the course with CS: GO and will be tweaked over the coming months. Every CS: GO operation freshens the game up with some new environments if nothing else, and the point of Operation Vanguards structure is to elongate this beyond a few days  to really showcase these excellent maps by forcing people to play on them semi-regularly for missions. It at least manages this. I want to emphasise that Im an enormous fan and c

review: I first played Counter-Strike back in 1999, when it was still just a mod. I went to it on a daily basis, for several hours, as my main source of entertainment and gathering of friends until about 2002, when other activities came along. I only went back to it now, in 2012. This unveiled the greatest disappointment and proof of destruction of a game I have ever experienced. As it is today, this is not Counter-Strike. It is a broken, unrecognizable, nearly useless form of the original game. Valve has let this game rot to death and still make an easy profit for nothing. The server browser is a joke. It is simply broken. The results it returns are completely inaccurate and all servers you will find are run by non-Steam users, with the game settings altered to who knows what, and 90% of them playing the Dust map. The other servers are running non-official maps and pointless game modes. In addition, you can not set your client to disallow the automatic download of custom server sounds or other trash that is force-fed through your connection to alter the game. Counter-Strike has been so blatantly abandoned, that it is shocking Valve still charges something for it. You will also see advertisements while you are connecting to the servers, and while you wait for the next round once you have been killed. Counter-Strike is the epitome of falling from grace and becoming an outright failure. It has become an embarrassment and a gaming tragedy. Counter-Strike is bad.

review: This was one of the best first person shooter and fps games. After steam updated the fpsengine and made other changes to the game after more than 10 years of good gameplay, I would rather say that this is a now a rip-off. The game doesn't work properly and the developers isn't listening to the players when they're updating the game. If steam would roll back the game to before they update I would recommend this game because of the good gameplay. At the moment because of the update I just want my money back!

So I'm gonna say pass on this game in favor of the two newer versions that have all of the same content but with more.

review: Addictive, dull, and repetitive, Counter-Strike will eat up hours that you'll want to have back. There are two newer iterations of this game now, both of which are similarly wasteful of time. While one might argue that any game is not a productive use of one's days, Counter-Strike ranks one step above almost anything out there: unless you're freakishly good or an inveterate camper, you'll spend the lion's share of your gameplay idly waiting to respawn. More, you'll inevitably (especially in 1.6) run into players so good that you'll be unsure whether they're superlative gamers or superlative cheaters. And in Counter-Strike, there's really no way of telling. Prepare yourself for frustration, either way. Avoid.

There's no reason to buy something that isn't an M4 or an AK-47, and if you are a CT that just got a kill, you drop your M4 and take his AK, unless you memorize the recoil pattern on the gun you're firing you will lose every time, not that it helps because anyone still playing this game has been playing for 13 years and will know where you are at all times and be able to AWP you a new ventilation shaft in your forehead from 400 yards the same second your arm moves into visibility from behind a door. Just hold your horses, and let's hope they save Counter-Strike's from itself with CS:GO

Most are very skilled and have been playing the game sense day one. Still one of the best CS I have ever played. Before anyone asks I run this game on windows 8 and it works like a charm. I HIGHLY recommend this game to anyone looking for a classic FPS experience.

If you are a person who thinks he/she is good at fps's and want a challenge, buy this game. Your self esteem will drop further than an emo in prison after dropping the soap. I highly recommend this game!

review: Counter-Strike is one of those games that I can play for only 2 minutes. Seriously, the graphics suck big chicken nuggets. The thumbnail for this game makes it seem like it's graphically in tents, but it is not. I'd say wait for sale then buy because this game sucks.

review: Counter-Strike can join in with Golden Eye in taking credit for defining the comman FPS game as we know it today. It's servers are still active over a decade of entertainment. You customize your gear then choose to either use tactics to disarm the bomb, or you can JUST RUSH IN LIKE AN INSANE PERSON, GRIP THE HOSTAGES BY THE ARM AS YOU SAY "FOLLOW ME NOW!!!", and get them to safety. It is pure greatness. And the system requirements are not demanding, so virtualy any computer nowadays can run it.

review: Counter-Strike (tambm abreviado por CS)  um popular jogo de computador, mais especificamente um "mod" de Half-Life para jogos online.  um jogo de tiro em primeira pessoa baseado em rodadas no qual equipes de contra-terroristas e terroristas combatem-se at a vitria.  acessvel atravs do Steam. O jogo inicialmente era para ser um mod para o Unreal Tournament, mas a Valve Software viu uma oportunidade no jogo e comprou-o. O Counter-Strike foi um dos responsveis pela massificao dos jogos por rede no incio do sculo, sendo considerado o grande responsvel pela popularizao das LAN houses no mundo. O jogo  considerado um "desporto eletrnico". Muitas pessoas levam-no a srio e recebem ordenados fixos, existem mesmo cls profissionais, e que so patrocinados por grandes empresas como a Intel e a NVIDIA. Pelo mundo existem ligas profissionais onde o Counter-Strike est presente, como o caso da CPL (que encerrou suas atividades em 2008), ESWC, ESL, WCG e WEG. No caso da ESWC funciona da seguinte forma: cada pas tem as suas qualificaes no qual qualquer cl pode ir a uma qualificao em uma lan house em qualquer parte do mesmo pas, passando depois s melhores equipes, as melhores equipes de cada pas encontram-se depois no complexo da ESWC, localizado em Paris, para disputar o lugar da melhor equipe do mundo de Counter-Strike. Com a chegada da sequncia de Half-Life, Half-Life 2, o Counter-Strike ganhou uma verso com grficos mais atualizados chamada de Counter-Strike: Source, tambm acessvel pelo Steam. Apesar de contar com grficos mais bem elaborados e correo de erros, essa verso no  oficialmente utilizada nas maiores ligas competitivas principalmente devido a menor divulgao dessa verso e de inmeras inovaes consideradas negativas com relao ao ritmo de jogo, que nessa nova verso  sensivelmente mais lento do que nas antecedentes. Em janeiro de 2013, um dia aps o lanamento de Half-Life para Mac e Linux, a verso 1.6 de Counter-Srtike foi tambm lanada para essas plataformas, novamente sem nenhum anncio oficial da Valve.

It's full of scrubs, lamers, scammers, spammers and hackers. Its very hard to find a good and clean from all those dudes server, but when you do find it, you will forget all about them and will enjoy all your hours of play.

review: In my opinion 1.6 has less hacker than Counter-Strike:Global Offensive. Then again 1.6 is made up of a few servers with small coumminty base and more than likely has an admin in game. Best physics in any Counter-Strike game. Probably not top notch graphics.. Just get your friends and have a piss

This game is old, has not many multiplayer servers and has graphics that aren't the best, but I assure you that you will have some fun with it. If yoiu are getting this game because yiu are looking for a good FPS, buy Counter Strike: Global Offensive or even better Counter Strike: Complete.

review: Wait, what is this? Counter-Strike?! Yes.. It's Counter-Strike.. the old FPS Game.. I've loved this game very much.. It's my Childhood Game.. This game doesn't have it's amazing duper 2014 graphics, but instead.. It's the gameplay we're talking about... So the Gameplay.. It's very fun but bit serious if you can ask me.. this game made me very serious at some period of time but the gameplay is still pretty fun.. and to derp around with it.. such as editing it's textures and etc.. I've seen people having troubles playing this game online because full of try-hards or any pros out there.. well there's no bots included in Counter-Strike but you can go practice at Counter-Strike Condition Zero, it has bots.. This game isn't free and you have to buy it. I'll only suggest people who really likes Old FPS or Competitive Gaming around here!~ Game on mates! I highly suggest you buy this game for the people who really likes FPS here..

review: The classic. The original. The first and last of its kind. The beginning of a legacy. Or just hours upon hours of time wasted while your brain controversially shouts to you "Just one more round!" The excitement of a firefight is a standard of most First-Person Shooters but Counter-Strike is different. The game tries to focus on communication and teamwork coincided with skilled aim and complex maneuvers rather than just free-for-all deathmatch game. Failure to comply with the games train of thought winds you up in the lovely thing we gamers call "Spectator Mode." Gotta love that! Although becoming proficient at the game will take a lot longer than most games it is worth the time put into it! Gamers that are looking for a game that requires teamwork, skill, time, practice, and communication will not be disappointed!

review: In the '80s my tape-mate Richard D. Reynalds disappeared down my extra 8-track speakers clutching opiate presciptions and blues mixtapes. I remembered his parting words: "FUc k John Coltrane's Newphew -- I'd tear my Pseudo Goldfish in that Flyinglotus-eater. Take my Taxi-card, I'm off." But three avenues deep, I regarded his winter jackettas nothing more than a Sony stance. My first-draft redeemer is a real VB! Wow!! And don't pose me a steam, you neglector Flying Aphex! True Macho What did we teach?ageispolis is famous for its slow-burning ziggurat. Check it, mountain-chair gig at 2!!!

review: Check out those 2 hardcore s on the cover. That should tell you all you need to know about the game. And what kind of name is Counter Strike? Did they name it COunter Attack and realise that sounded too genreic and decided to name it something off? Or maybe this game is about the strike of counter-tops? We may never lnow. Like i said, look at those two hardcore GSG9 and GIGN operators and that should tell you all you need to know Money and time sink, like the Philadelphia Experiment only with less GOvernment coverups. I should be studying SS what is this 0/10 struck too hard would not counter

I highly recomend this game.

review: Best game ever made... Domination of movemenet, shooting mechanics - recoil... Exaclty what a FPS game need... When developers of this game genre learn that this 2 things are the most inportant for good FPS, they will make a game as good as CS 1.6 is... CS:GO does not have these major aspects, and doesn't deserve name of Counter-Strike (IMO). As a third very important thing for FPS game, I would say the animations... The animations of player models such as runnig, walking, crouching, gun holding/fireing/reloading etc... Graphics isn't so important, doesn't need to be sooo good, but decent due to visibility...

game-hours: 28.0
review: This game was initially launched in the year 1999, this being the first shooter of it's kind;competitive and challenging in a new manner. Although the game is outdated--updated a bit by Valve on their Steam release in late 2000--it is still extremely fun to play. The initial game experience is (The casual feel of CS:GO when you defuse and plants bombs with others) still very fun to play but the game has evolved with the community of CS. Some of the most fun things I do is the KZ maps, and other new and different game modes that are best on the original Counter-Strike. If you enjoyed any modern shooter you should play Counter-Strike for it's nostalgic feel and rewarding game modes.

It's probably the only game that people are playing today on that isn't running off from a source engine. If you never played Counter-Strike 1.6 before, try it out. It's one of the best FPS game of all time. If you don't like it, well, you didn't paid alot of money for it.......or did you?
