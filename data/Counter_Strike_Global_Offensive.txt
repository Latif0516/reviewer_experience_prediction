review: It doesn't matter how good you are any more, you will be judged solely on the market value of your inventory. You should have one of your several Karambit knives equipped at all times and inspect it in game whenever possible to ensure that anybody who is spectating you is aware that you are aware you're being watched and you are absolutely showing off that extremely pricey knife you own. Your stats are irrelevant now, most people aren't even aware that the 'Tab' key actually has a function in game. It doesn't matter if you don't know what 'eco' means. Fuck team work. You have a 'BOOM' AWP in your inventory, as long as you have $4750 cash in game you're buying an AWP. You will mock anyone who decided to give their Nova the 'Walnut' skin. Same goes for people who give their FAMAS the 'Doomkitty' skin. You will only equip 'StatTrak' weapons and the first thing you do when you acquire one is go on an idle server and get several hundred kills on AFK players in order to pad the stats so you don't look like a total n00b. Whenever a new case is released you will buy as many cases and keys as it takes in order to acquire 'an Exceedingly Rare Special Item!' Disregard the fact that you will end up spending three times as much as you otherwise would've by buying this directly from the market, it's only your parents' money after all. Besides, your birthday is next month and Christmas/Easter/[insert public holiday here] is just around the corner so you won't have to wait too long before you can blow more of their money on digital goods. You will also plaster ever single skin you own with multiple unseemly stickers with the intention of creating a unique skin for your weapon. Your 'Easy Peasy' and 'Ninjas in Pyjamas' stickers totally don't look ridiculous whatsoever. You will also name tag all of your weapons in order to add that final personal touch to the weapon you invested so much time and money in. You don't own an AK or an M4 any more, you only own weapons with names like 'xXx OG Snoop Dogg' and 'dubstep warrior'. You now have all the knowledge required to start playing CS:GO. Go forth and procure many skins of great value.

review: Revan was only 23 years old. He loved CS:GO so much. He had most of the achievements and items. He prayed to Gaben every night before bed, thanking him for the inventory he's been given. "CS:GO is love," he says, "CS:GO is life." His elder Dragon hears him and calls him a silver scrublord. He knows his elder is just jealous of his son's devotion to Gabe. He calls him a console peasant. He slaps him and sends him to sleep. He's crying now and his face hurts. He lays in bed, and it's really cold. He feels a warmth moving towards him. He looks up. It's Gabe! He's so happy, Gabe whispers into Revan's ear, "Try your chances... Open a case." Gaben grabs Revan with his powerful dev-team hands and puts him on his hands and knees. He's ready. Revan opens his pockets for Gabe. Gabe puts his hands deep into Revan's pockets. It costs so much, but Revan does it for CS:GO. Revan can feel his wallet emptying as his eyes start to water. He accepts the terms and conditions. Revan wants to please Gabe. Gaben lets out a mighty roar as he fills Revan's computer with keys. Revan opens all the cases and gets nothing worth anything at all.

review: In this game you are a Terrorist or elite Counter-Terrorist who has never fired a gun in their life before a round starts. You must help your character learn how to control their guns while killing enemies. Strangely, each character has the mysterious power to fire one or two shots without ridiculous recoil by very briefly jerking in the opposite direction they are moving in. When your character wears a Kevlar vest, every part of your character, except the head, are made out of steel. Therefore, the only way to quickly kill people is to shoot them in the head. This can be annoying at first, but you will soon get used to shooting a small smudge of pixels on top of a character's body. The Goddess of Guns can materialize guns in your character's hands a few seconds before a round starts. However, your character must pay for the guns, which have vastly overinflated prices. When you have the right amount of money, the Goddess will flash a menu in your character's eyes, allowing them to select the guns they want. More advanced users can make guns materialize out of thin air with their mind as long as they have the right amount of money. Maps are often about evil terrorists trying to bomb deserted places. Vandalism is a very serious crime in the Counter-Strike series, so elite Counter-Terrorists are deployed to stop them. Unfortunately for the Terrorists, they are dumb and only packed one bomb. However, the Counter-Terrorists do not know how to pick up a dropped bomb, so the Terrorists can still pick it up after it is dropped by a fallen friend. In some maps, the terrorists have kidnapped a janitor and low-level desk jockey in a building. The Counter-Terrorists have been deployed to save one, not both, of the hostages. In reality, this is just a thinly-veiled excuse for the CTs to murder the Terrorists while pumping rounds into the invincible hostages. One weird thing about hostage maps is that you can purchase a "Hostage Rescue Kit", which somehow makes gives you the ability to put a grown man on your shoulders in a second. Perhaps it is a spell scroll that allows hostages to hover to your character's shoulders. Overall, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a surprisingly solid game about people with the worst gun handling abilities ever seen on Earth. Even though your characters have the aiming abilities of someone with Parkinsons Disease, you have many tactical options that make the game very fun and dynamic. It's worth picking up.

review: I slowly look at the luminescent green dial of my wristwatch, which tells me it is 5:46, am. Damn. Another night of Insomnia. I sit up in my bed, and listen to the soft hum of my Radeon HD 7870 GHz Edition, as her fans slowly cool the surface of her brilliant silicon plates. The only light in this room comes from the electric blue glow of my keyboard, and the azure LEDs in my Razer Abyssus. I press a button, and the display of a 23 inch, 1080p IPS monitor lights up, colors shifting and changing in psychedelic pattens, chromatic waves of light bluring and stabilizing to send an image within my mind. My desktop stares back at me; the only icon the Recycle bin. I move my eyes to the Taskbar, where the icons for Windows Explorer, Star Citizen, Mozilla Firefox, and lastly Steam return my gaze. I click on Steam, and watch as a loading bar appears. The light from the moniter shines brilliantly on my face, and if I look closely into it, I can see myself reflected in the crystal surface, eyes staring deep into a mad realm of pixels and insomnia. Steam finally loads. Oh, what's this? There's a sale on? Ah, too bad; I only have one cent in my wallet. I click the library tab in a futile attempt to find meaning. My list of games appears, showing me hints of open doors into new worlds, strange and wonderful. What path sould I choose? Should I join battle with Dragons, in the strage land of the Nords? Or, perhaps, I should launch the StarCitizen hangar module, and lust after a dream of flight, a game not yet finished. Ah, but here it is; Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. How many hours have I thus spent within you, oh CS:GO? You have been the reason for many nights without sleep, many days of ragequits, many days of fun and sadness. I pull out a calculator from somewhere on my desk: dividing one thousand, eight hundred and eighty-five hours by twenty-four tells me that I've been within this game for seventy-eight point five days so far. Damn. The game begins loading, and I hear the soft hum of GPU fans, and the silent sound of the sunrise, far beyond the single window of my room. _ Ah, where was I? I guess I feel alseep for a second there. Skip the intros, enter main menu, searc- Wait, what? 20 friends online? But, it's like 6 am... Oh, right, timezones. Eh, I might as well invite all these people. Well, I guess I didn't want to play with them anyway. Green light fills my room, I press accept, and wait for the ninth player. Who, it seems, never can figure out what the big glowing green button actually means. Oh well, it just found another match anyway. Well, third time's the chram, right? I guess not. Fourth time does it, and we're away. Cue loading screen, begin meaningless text I've seen only a few thousand times before. I get up, walk towards the kitchen, and only trip twice on miscellaneous paraphernalia in the dark hallways. The bleak windows of the room greet me: pale dawn, gray clouds and black trees visible through their panes. The neon numerals of the microwave tell the time as 6:07. I search the pantry and refr!gerator, but find nothing of value. I lower my standards and try again, this time coming up with a few tastless cookies of some kind. I begin a pilgrimage to whence I came. The last stars of night grow cold and die; as color once again spreads over the sky. Monitor glow, winter snow, cybernetic flow. My quest now complete, with prize in hand, I return to my chair. 0's and 1's stream across a fiberoptic gulf of space, connecting people hundreds of miles apart in a beautiful lattice of data, all for my enjoyment. I begin the first round, and purchase a FN Five-Seven and a Flashbang grenade. I move over to long A, and hold my sights on the old wooden doors. An insurgent sprints through the open door, firing his Glock-18 as fast as he can, his bullets hitting the wal beside my head. I pull the trigger, a volcanic plume of hot gas propelling a one gram lead alloy projectile at twice the speed of sound into the side of his head; The FN 5.728mm armor piercing round delivering a fatal 540 Joules of energy. The neon Stattrak display mounted on the left side of my Case Hardened Five-Seven increases by one, and a bright flare from the muzzle reflects its light in the cold metal of a name tag, the words "NOT ON MY WATCH" silently mocking those fools who fall by my pistol, in an absurd pun about clocks. Another Terrorist moves into view, I fire three supersonic rounds into his chest, and one in his skull. Again the neon numbers shift and rearrange in a mad dance, as bullets enter my manly chest hair and are absorbed. A third Terrorist fires, and I die in the gameworld, madly shooting as my bullets hit empty space. Pixels shift and change in an algorithmic song, and my teammates finish what I began, with the severing of a red wire a small number one is added in blue to the top of my screen. Second round, man. Time to roll. I got long- wait, why are two of you going there? Nevermind, I'll hold Catwalk. _ Turns out they decided to rush Mid with pistols. Poor choice. I leap out of catwalk into mid as they rush the doors, electric blue pathways of fire traversing the void between my tazer and and the insurgent's back. He screams in death as I drop the now-useless tazer and unholster a Bizon SMG; 9mm rounds begining to sputter at 320 meters per second into the backs of my foes as a Terrorist pulls a 180 and flicks a round into my skull with his CZ-75 Automatic, punching through my helmet into the flesh beneath. I mutter to myself "I ing hate that gun" while typing out "#TAZED " in all chat. Childish insults fly like eagles, soaring over skies of wire and valleys of silicon to majestically land in the lower right of my vision, proclaiming their wondrous messages for all to see. "get rekt" "u suck" "TIME to die, amirite" Using the mighty power of a pistol save round, the enemy gains a round. From far beyond my drywall cube, a sun the color of a Helium discharge tube bleeds the first light of Autumn into a sky the color of Krypton: but here I am safe from its incandescent fingers, here, the persistance of color exists in the 60hz of my monitor. Perhaps tomorrow will be different? Oh, but I don't think it will. The scoreboard moves with its own hateful volition, seemingly granting rounds with a heart of cinder and magma. Chaos lies within its eyes. Final round of the first half begins and I press f1 to auto buy, supplanting my XM1014 from the previous round with an M4A4 Bullet Rain, tastefully decorated with a "REKT" holographic sticker and renamed "Clockwork Assing". I once again reflect on what a stupid name that is, and regret selling my Desert Eagle Blaze to buy it. Surprisingly, my team manages to hold a push at long. In the simultaneous push to cat a rain of lead from a thundering sky finds my face with magnetic precision, and in the downtime I skim through my Ebook library on my phone. I've been considering writing something in the style of Neuromancer or Ready Player One for awhile now, perhaps if I can find the right subject... Oh well, that's a project for another day. Translation: never. Halftime, and the tally stands at ten for them and five for us. I've seen worse. I've seen better too, but what the hell, this isn't hopeless yet. Pistol round begins and I buy Dualies, partly just to  with people and partly because for reasons that I can neither explain nor defend I'm ridiculously good with them. Don't dis my Dualie skills, man. Just accept it. Like a wizard and his wand: you do not choose the Dualies, the Dualies choose you. I pop smoke Mid and rush Catwalk, suddenly realizing I hit the character limit while subsequently breaking the 4th wall. I slowly look at the luminescent green dial of my wristwatch, which tells me it is 6:34, am. Damn. Another night of Insomnia.

review: I bought this game for the chickens, and was not disappointed. After exploring the countless lands the chickens have traveled far and wide, I realized their population was growing too large. The chickens had started to inhabit such horrid locations across the world, such as nuclear plants, and offices without cafeterias. I knew what had to be done. I bought a flip knife off of the steam market, and called PETA. I listened to In the Arms of an Angel in my Microsoft Professional Deluxe Gaming Chair 360 for about twelve hours with no response, so, I decided to take matters into my own hands. I loaded up de_nuke and started to put the chickens out of their misery. I cried harder that night than I have ever before. The next morning, with tears in my eyes, I loaded up Counter-Strike: Global Chicken, and I saw a new item waiting in my inventory. My Flip Knife had turned into a Flip Knife Slaughter. At that moment, I realized what a horrible thing I had done. With my hand shaking, I navigated my mouse, and uninstalled Counter-Strike: Global Chicken. I regret everything I have done. I am writing this review to warn you about the chickens, and to let you know I have made a full recovery, and that I have started my new journey in Goat Simulator. Thank you, and farewell.

review: CSGO is a near-perfect multiplayer shooter. Unlike the previous versions, which were often difficult to get in to, this one offers a variety of modes that will appeal to all skill levels. It has a large community and a well supported workshop, ensuring that this discount-priced game will be around for years to come. In short, you either play as the good or bad guys and must either kill the other team or complete objectives to win the round, which will earn you more money to do the same thing again but faster. It's been around for years and has spawned many imitators. The game isn't much of a looker as it is based on the same engine as the original Half Life 2 was. However, Valve have polished it as much as they can and the community consists of lots of awesome mappers who have been churning out brilliantly imaginative and beautiful maps almost on a daily basis. Is it worth getting if you already own Counter Strike: Source? Yes. CSS was always Counter Strike shoe-horned into the Source engine. CSGO feels far more like a standalone game. Valve have very carefully listened to what people have wanted and have made a very appealing game. The best feature must be the competitive play. You cannot leave these matches or you'll suffer a temporary ban from the feature. After 10 wins in this mode you'll be ranked and will be paired up with people of the same skill, meaning that the game is challenging but fair regardless of your skill level. These matches are exciting, occasionally scary or frustrating, but are the most rewarding part of the game and improving your rank is one of the most satisfying experiences in any video game, ever. There are all kinds of teams and communities that you can join. Really, if I was stuck on a desert island with one game this would most likely be my top choice. It's bigger than you can hope to conquer and has a huge community around it which will likely be around for years to come, something that can't be said for the Call of Duty franchise which is probably its closest rival. Remember that those games are full price and have another one churned out each year, fragmenting the community. Plus you can customise your weapon skins in CSGO. Surely that's the most important feature?! All they need to add now are hats and you might as well live in CSGO.

review: I came to this game for my fetish of chickens. When playing the game, I realised that not every map has chickens on it, so I slowly got angrier with the game... The lack of chickens boiled my blood. CSGO made me angry, Until, I found my dream love, Deathmatch. A Chicken on any map, right then.. I'd kick the bots, and chase the chickens around for hours. Ah, It was so pleasurable, How I would do it for hours on end. The chickens are perfect. I play this game for hours on end, and the chickens never disapointment me now, Oh Chickens, how you are my one true love. I can't focus at school anymore.. I only think about chickens, on the way home from school there is a KFC, I walk past it every day, I think of chickens, One time, I literally stopped, and took a fap to one of the chickens. Ah, It was so good. Chickens I love them Oh Chickens THANK YOU GABEN 5/5 I love chickens.

Every matchmaking team I get is a team of Russians who like saying "" and have a grudge against Obama and have a microphone that sounds like a cat trying to gargle shards of glass. I will keep on unboxing cases, playing like a handicapped person, stay on Silver and keep buying expensive skins that apparently are supposed to make me better but don't.

review: At its core Global Offensive/Counter Strike is a brutal shooter which in its prime was probably the number one cause of broken Microsoft mouses. The emphasis on death is probably the only aspect of this series that has kept me around. It creates an atmosphere that games like Battlefield and Call of Duty hasn't been able to reproduce. On the outside Counter Strike looks like a simplistic shooter but the learning curve is steep and will challenge even the most seasoned FPS gamer. The game is simply tactful; its brilliant when youre alive and even when youre dead the game is still fun to watch other players. Global offensive is a competitive game and a casual one, although for casual gamers it's probably better to find community servers over Valve servers. There's a huge market place now for the items in CS:GO and not only that, there's third party websites and support for numerous other avenues these in-game items have created You will also find on Twitch CS:GO is consistently one of the most streamed games and boast numerous competitions, if you need any convincing watch a stream, watch a competitive match and see for yourself. This game is simply a must try and a game every gamer should have in their library. Overtime you can even make back the money spent on the game from the game itself.

review: I only got this game because everyone literally forced me to get it, so I got it, I played it. It was good in the beginning, until I started playing competitive, and why is that? Well as I walked into my first competitive match, I got into a match with 4 Russians on my team, and enemy team consisted of 3 Russians and 2 Americans that only spoke Russian. When the game started I walked 4 steps towards mid and got instantly sniped through doors, and that was a teammate! My team lost half their players before we met the enemy...So after that game I came to the conclusion that all the Russians wanted was to  my blyat. Pros: +Great maps, especially when they're filled with Russians! +I got A+ in Russian after owning this game for a week. +I can now insult my friends in Russian because they don't understand ! +I finally fit in(This review is more about my life than the actual game) Cons: -Russians, duh -Russians with guns! -democracy!!! -Screaming Russians -Not enough Russians I wonder how many dislikes I can get by saying this?

review: Maybe the only FPS where it truly boils down to a game of pure skill. No *t perks or kill streaks, no auto-turrets, no air strikes. If you want to win in Counter-Strike, you have to learn the maps, play smart, and have fast reflexes. Since you work for each and every kill, it's much more satisfying than other current gen shooters.

review: It doesn't matter how good you are any more, you will be judged solely on the market value of your inventory. You should have one of your several Karambit knives equipped at all times and inspect it in game whenever possible to ensure that anybody who is spectating you is aware that you are aware you're being watched and you are absolutely showing off that extremely pricey knife you own. Your stats are irrelevant now, most people aren't even aware that the 'Tab' key actually has a function in game. It doesn't matter if you don't know what 'eco' means. Fuck team work. You have a 'BOOM' AWP in your inventory, as long as you have $4750 cash in game you're buying an AWP. You will mock anyone who decided to give their Nova the 'Walnut' skin. Same goes for people who give their FAMAS the 'Doomkitty' skin. You will only equip 'StatTrak' weapons and the first thing you do when you acquire one is go on an idle server and get several hundred kills on AFK players in order to pad the stats so you don't look like a total n00b. Whenever a new case is released you will buy as many cases and keys as it takes in order to acquire 'an Exceedingly Rare Special Item!' Disregard the fact that you will end up spending three times as much as you otherwise would've by buying this directly from the market, it's only your parents' money after all. Besides, your birthday is next month and Christmas/Easter/[insert public holiday here] is just around the corner so you won't have to wait too long before you can blow more of their money on digital goods. You will also plaster ever single skin you own with multiple unseemly stickers with the intention of creating a unique skin for your weapon. Your 'Easy Peasy' and 'Ninjas in Pyjamas' stickers totally don't look ridiculous whatsoever. You will also name tag all of your weapons in order to add that final personal touch to the weapon you invested so much time and money in. You don't own an AK or an M4 any more, you only own weapons with names like 'xXx OG Snoop Dogg' and 'dubstep warrior'. You now have all the knowledge required to start playing CS:GO. Go forth and procure many skins of great value.

review: Revan was only 23 years old. He loved CS:GO so much. He had most of the achievements and items. He prayed to Gaben every night before bed, thanking him for the inventory he's been given. "CS:GO is love," he says, "CS:GO is life." His elder Dragon hears him and calls him a silver scrublord. He knows his elder is just jealous of his son's devotion to Gabe. He calls him a console peasant. He slaps him and sends him to sleep. He's crying now and his face hurts. He lays in bed, and it's really cold. He feels a warmth moving towards him. He looks up. It's Gabe! He's so happy, Gabe whispers into Revan's ear, "Try your chances... Open a case." Gaben grabs Revan with his powerful dev-team hands and puts him on his hands and knees. He's ready. Revan opens his pockets for Gabe. Gabe puts his hands deep into Revan's pockets. It costs so much, but Revan does it for CS:GO. Revan can feel his wallet emptying as his eyes start to water. He accepts the terms and conditions. Revan wants to please Gabe. Gaben lets out a mighty roar as he fills Revan's computer with keys. Revan opens all the cases and gets nothing worth anything at all.

review: Great game that can teach you many things such as: 1. The Russian language. 2. How to be a tough guy that is afraid of nothing behind a screen. 3. How to be racist and sexist. 4. How to be spoiled as . 5. How awesome it feels to shout through your microphone and giving invalid instructions while someone is trying to pull off a clutch. 6. How to be disappointed in human beings. 7. How to socialise in a civilised and calm manner (/s). And last but not least. How to be a complete  for no reason at all. Aside from that, if you're willing to ignore the aforementioned it can be a truly great game. It has many goals for you to achieve if you wish other than the obvious goal of getting the highest ranking possible. You could always aim to get that gorgeous weapon skin you always wanted potentially without spending any money at all. It is highly recommended you find a few people to play with as solo queue is extremely toxic, harsh and often rude, as in every other game that has competitive matchmaking. Having 4 people to play with can be extremely fun since you can easily bond together and have fun either you win or lose. It's a good game and I do recommend it as long as you're willing to ignore the (Admittedly plenty of) things that are wrong with this game. Even if you don't, it can easily be worth it if your skin is thick enough or you can utilise (If you got the balls really) self-deprecation humour.

review: Really good game. Very simple, yet complex at the same time. For first time players: DO NOT let the game's recoil mechanics scare you away. It will take some time to get used to but once you do, it is a great game. PROS: [+] -Great community (COMPARED TO SOME OTHER GAMES) -Frequent updates -Tradable stuff -Source Engine means that players from GMod, CS 1.6/Source, etc. won't (or at least shouldn't) have a hard time adapting to new controls and physics. -VERY Competitive at higher levels -Tons of workshop files and tons of room to make your own skins and maps -Weapon skins -Multiple modes for casual or competitive and more -High FPS on almost any PC (great optimization) CONS: [-] -Skins can be expensive or worthless -Skins and cases can suck the money out of you if you let it -Recoil is not very easy to get used to -No aiming down sights (FOR NEW PEOPLE, CALM DOWN VETS) -Cooldowns can be handed out unfairly -Low graphic quality/detail compared to other games (IT IS SOURCE, CALM DOWN) -MP only (if you are reading this, you most likely have internet at home, THERE IS A BOTS ONLY OPTION) -Hackers do like to hack in competitive matches at higher levels -Callouts are not that easy to learn for beginners OVERALL: Get it. If it is on sale, CS:GO is an even better deal. The recoil was my biggest challenge at the start but just take some time to practice with bots. Perfect for traders, casual FPS players, competitive FPS players, and workshop content creators. RATING: 9.5/10

review: When I reviewed Counter-Strike Source a few years ago, I called it things like "immortal" and "the definitive multiplayer FPS." The Awp is easily one of the most satisfying weapons in gaming. Quickscoping and noscoping can be a gamble - I really like the balance and precise feel of the Awp. The rest of the weapons feel really good - there is much more variety here: we are talking custom weapon skins and even a custom loadout for each team. This is one of the areas where CS:GO shines, and leaves its predecessors in the dark ages. Competitive matchmaking is one of the really nice features of Global Offensive. The game allows you to play in competitive matches based on your skill level rating. This is done similar to the matchmaking in Dota 2. While not perfect, I find the matchmaking to be pretty accurate - it is rarely a cakewalk. Always be wary of the player community for this game - this community has some sick and twisted people, tons of trolls, smack talkers, hack accusers, mic spammers, and cry babies, lol. Fortunately you can mute players, and if you are so inclined, can vote them off the game - nice! Trading and items drops are a fairly big part of the game as well. One of the neat things about the game is you can easily sell back your in game drops via Steam market and basically play this game for free or even profit from it. its insane, but some items sell for over $400 USD. CS:GO is on the rise reaching peaks near 300,000 players. There are huge tournaments played, and with each passing month the game sees positive growth. I think its safe to say this is the new "definitive multiplayer FPS"! 9/10

review: Dear Counter-Strike Players, After a long period playing this game (~1000h) I think I have the advantage to write a better review than my last! First I want to say thank you Valve for making a nice game like Counter-Strike: Global Offensive! BUT: There are some things Valve has to change really fast! 1. Cheating: There are more and more cheaters every fu***** day! The VAC-System isn't as save as it should be! I hope Valve is working on it! 2. DDOS-ing: I think the Valve-Servers should be very save, but then there is the DDOS-ing! How is it able to get the IPs from your opponents this fast and DDOS them! Please fix the Serversecure! 3. Smurfing: Through all those Steamsales you get more and more smurfs! Highranks buying a new account to play against lowranks and get really horny about it! I think they should make an IP-Based system where the rank is linked to the IP or something like this! 4. Patches: Patch after patch, the game is getting worse! They nerf every weapon till the weapon isn't playable anymore! With the maps you have the same problem! 5. Serverproblems (also Steamserver): Steam and Valve aren't able to fix their serverproblems, so the game isn't playable because of laggs and disconnects! Also the cooldown you can get is very unfair! This is fu***** s***! 6. Community: The community isn't as good as I hoped. Most of the people are pretty unfriendly. Over all: Counter-Strike isn't playable anymore! And the higher the rank the more hackers you get! Please fix the things I listed above and make the game playable again! And I know that Valve can't fix the community, but I hope the community will get better! PS: I'm from Germany, so there are maybe some spelling mistakes!

review: I've wasted over 200 hours of my pathetic life on this  game. Its not even fun its the exact same thing over and over again. Just like my life. Anyway, you can get new skins. Also, instead of fixing hitboxes, weapons, and servers, Valve released new summer skins, so while you get ed in the head you can inspect your weapon. Also, every single game I join I get called  for how I sound, and god forbid that you actually want to have fun. This game, will want to make you rethink your puny existince on this galaxy, and about how you are spending it shooting the same  over and over. New Stat Traks thoo####### Cant even spell Track right the ing . 10/10 Would try to kill myself again Thx Valve UPDATE I have now.... 542 hours in this game. I have wasted another 300 hours of my life, with this thing going on in my head. Now now, I know what you may be thinking. 300 hours? There surely must be some improvements with this game between then and now. HahahahahHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAA I just got banned, for no being able to reconnect to a match. Not my fault, I was online, everything was going swell. DANDY. Until it kicked me out, and banned me. I final  shot in the eye. This game....has ruined my entire life. I could of done so much with my life, been something, but csgo took my lifes goals. I couldnt balance it out. This game grasps you by your balls, brings you to your knees, shoots its load in your mouth, then makes you feel like a piece of  swallowing One thing when you are playing this game to remember is that, it is never VALVES fault. It is always your fault. Everything in this game is well designed, elaborate, and rich, with team based elements. That is until you actually play the game. Then you realize everyone is as big of a ing  as you are. I hate this game, it ruined my life, it ruined my dreams, it ruined me. I never want to play this game again, I never want to see it again. I want to bury it under six feet of dirt. LOL @ ZOMBYE CHICKENS LOLOLOLOLOL HAHAH MASKS thats GR8 I can feel Like A VILLIAN DANKS VALVE. I have no reason to live anymore. 10/10 would reccomend if masochist, depressed, suicidal, or a GIANT.....ING.....LOSER Or if ur like me, and all of the aboVE.

If you want some tense, nervewracking clutch situations, Competitive is for you, but be warned; Silvers will do the most messed up tactics, call you a hacker if you see them or kill them, or if you even win a game, i never knew how many 12 year olds had ed so many people's mums there is not enough lifevests left. However, there are some good community servers too, full with Surf, HS Deathmatch, Jailbreak, BHop etc. which is good until you meet the admins, 90% of admins are 12 year old donators who abuse the  out of their power

review: This game has a feature were you can turn $2.50 into 10! Then you bet that 10 skin you just got on CSGO lounge to try and make your money back, but then lose the bet. Outraged you decide to buy another key, hoping that this will make up your money by pulling a knife, only to find that you got another 10 skin. Hundreds of dollars later, finally you think you have learnt your lesson, to not buy keys and decide to buy a skin straight off the market for full price. Being still resonably new to the game, you click the unknown link, unaware of what is going on, you later realise that you have been scammed. Thats right that skin you bought, more expensive then the game, and all 10 skins you have purchased for $2.50 are gone. Outraged once again, you start this process all over, this time knowing the chances of you pulling a knife and making your money back are extremely, slim, but you feel that this will be the one, lol nope get rekt son, 69 skin.

review: Since i started to play counter strike global offensive a new world opened for me! With all the tactics i learned from this game life has become easier for me. Whenever i'll go running im sure to take a knife with me so i can run even faster then i usually do! I made a fake bomb and painted an A on the floor in the living room. Whenever i come out of the shower i wrap my towel around my head and pretend to be a terrorist. I pick up the bomb i made and run around in my house. When i reach the living room i plant it on the "A" side and make some beeping sounds. Sometimes my dog gets close to me when i plant and he starts to lick my rectal opening. I think this is just one of the side effects of playing this game. My family thinks i'm crazy and my girlfriend left me because of it. This game has become life for me and i don't know what i should do without it. Thank you Gaben, i accept you as my lord and saviour. Gaben is love, Gaben is life.

review: First Off... Im not sure when Trolls, Smurfs, and Hacks began to become the norm, but the game is broken. They put it on sale for 5.00. Kids buy it just to hack it. Valve knows, they dont care. And all we do is BUY BUY BUY skins. I mean 400.00 for a knife skin? WTF?!??!!? Didnt we used to be able to get those for free? The guys hacking have a customer service number to call if they cant set it up correctly. Hacking is Big Business. They took 12 name tags from me, all because of 1 off-color gun name. Meanwhile, vulgarity far worse than my gun name, is allowed to cheat, troll, and make the game unplayable. Because its funny to watch people get pissed. And valve does nothing but put the game on sale. And kids, Rememer. When you tell ghame developers that your ok with paying 65.00 + 35 or 50 for the "season pass". You set what the market will bear. Thus making games MORE expensive for us, and limiting how much fun you can really have with it. Cuz if you cant afford the season pass.. you dont get all that content. CSGO is setting an example of how to take all of your customers money, and make them happy they did it. Maybe they put it on sale so that you can afford to have 3 copies of they game. 1 for rank, 1 for smurfing, and 1 for hacking...

review: Years of playing overrated AAA shooting games with lens flares, blood on the corners of your vision, and blue everything have since taken me away from the good old primative day of filling in the shoes of generic swat teams fighting generic terrorists; of which both groups lack the ability to look down the sights of all but a few weapons. Then I found Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. Being set eight years after the events of the previous game, there are noticeable changes brought upon by the passage of time. For example, the cognitive ability of hostages have further decreased to the point where they can't walk on their own. Moreover, both the terrorists and counter-terrorists adpoted new-found language ability. Finally, as we've evolved from the black and white days to being able to see the world in color, the world of Source has evolved drasticly in it's graphics in the eight-year gap between games. Among the new things introduced are atom-wide ledges, birds of superavian strength, and a modernized Russian train station which pays tribute to the skillful, fun to play with, and polite players of the Motherland. Finally, Counter Strike: Global Offensive has gone above and beyond the expectations of being an emergant AAA title by introducing an economy system that teaches rich naive kids the harshness of the post-2008 economy. Bravo. I've only played a bit of it but I will reward this game with a 9/10 for it's advanced chicken AI and the hyper-realistic sounds they make when you caress them with knifes in a fashion akin to spreading butter.

Entered competitive. got a team with 1 russian. 1 guy from donetsk. 2 ukrainians. they started to fight about who doesnt water and electricity. they called each other nazis. they called me a jew. they started to fight on who doesnt have democracy. we lost 1:16.       !!!! I played a competitive with a friend. we got 2 syrians. they told my friend to uninstall CS:GO and called him a zionist.  !  !     ! I entered a server in Saudi Arabia. Got kicked because im from israel.  !  !     ! A guy was annoyed because we had a noob team. he kept shooting me and killed me 2 times. i told him that he should continue and that it doesnt hurt. He got a 7 day ban.       !!!! A guy got a perma ban from all CS:GO servers in front of my eyes.       !!!! When you are a silver, you are more likely to play with global elite smurfs. When you are global elite, you are more likely to play with cheaters.       !!!!

review: I love this game! If you decide to buy this game here's 10 Tips: 1) Your ears are your eyes. 2) Echo = Eco 3) AVP = AWP 4) Top left you have radar. Learn to use it. 5) The guns have rubber barrels so when you hold the trigger for more than 3 shots, the bullets will go all over the screen. 6) P90 was crafted by Gods so it's users are not hackers. 7) If you have the bomb, sit behind your team like a good dog. 8) The game's secret name is Counter-Strike: Dust 2. 9) Competitive is the main game mode but there are other modes for your little kids too! 10) If you easily get brain cancer just from losing one match STAY AWAY FROM COMPETITIVE! you psycho! P.S. I'm not a doctor.

review: It's got a toxic community that will make you literally want to punch a hole in a foreigner's face. It's got its own economy full of scammers. It's got a betting industry addictive enough to bleed you dry of all your skins. It's got ban mechanics that make you regret not waiting a week for your last ban to cool off. It's got shooting mechanics that require immense skill and will test your patience just as much as Hotline Miami. It's CS:GO and it gives everyone that plays it anger problems. And yet we all still play it. Why? Because it's too bloody good at making us want to jump back into a competitive match and improve.

review: Great game, nice skins overall and the game is pretty fun but there is one thing that I have to complain about and that's server tick. Competitive servers use 64 tick servers and esports use 128 tick servers. This causes more lag and a slightly difference in aiming. 64 Tick servers seem to be off (for me) my cursor is on them and the shots do not connect (Ping is fine and under 50). I would still recommend this game to friend. P.S - Stop putting this game on sale it's the cause of mass hackers and smurds (Not a typo) Smurfing nerds. <3 Pros: - Nice Gun Skins - In Game Voice Chat - In Game Item Drops - Competitive Scene Cons: - On Sale Often (Allows more cheater and smurf accounts) - Server Tick 64 (Could be 128 and valve has the money)

review: Looks and feels very similar to the older games in the series. You can still have fun even if you're not the best player with the competitive matchmaking system; You'll get grouped with people around the same skill level as you and the system seems to work pretty well. The game goes on sale for less than $7.50 frequently so there really is no excuse not to try it out!

review: Best competetive "guess where hitbox is", "99 in 16 hits" and crate opening simulator for true MLG players. You have beautiful classic 10x10 metres square maps to test your tactical genius, truely realistic feeling of shooting with airsoft weapons with stunning purple camo and banana stickers on them. Will i eco or will i buy after lost pistol round? It doesn't matter because at "master guardian elite" level and below your teammates will buy and die anyway and there's nothing you can do about it, since they're speaking on horrific Lovecraftian languages. Good thing skill levels make a difference and ELO works in team games, right? You just have to reach Global Elite or train your real life friends in special camps for 5 years to have competent teams and enjoyable rounds. You can play on Dust 2, Mirage or Cache, because search for other maps takes forever, which is good because these legitimate tournament maps don't reward people for " krisa" gameplay. Weapon spray act just like it should: it works in preprogrammed pattern so you must remember spray of every weapon if you want to kill , because if you just sit with ak and shot static target right in the head, you might actually miss! It aint 1.6 anymore, scrub! It works kinda like japaneze Touhou games: you play for 100 hours to remember every pattern and then you're good to go to play on  competetive servers where hitboxes travel in outer space and none of it actually matters. Anti-cheat system works like a charm! People can just buy csgo gift for 1 dollar at some web service, other guys can exchange it for a crate that drops every now and then, play 10 games with wh and aim and get up to "distinguished master guardian" just in 4 hours or less. Then you will be delighted to play against them as they rush middle at dust 2 making 5 headshots as fast as rmb can be pressed. But no worries! Since VAC doesn't work properly, developers added Community Overwatch where you can spent up to 10 minutes looking at some guy running at light speeds with negev spinning like a yoyo killing everything! Without even slightest reward or weapon skins you like so much you can do developers' job at cleaning off the cheaters! As for the graphics, since Source they added motion blur.

review: It's surely the best CS so far, if you can overlook the fact that competitive matchmaking ranks mean nearly nothing, as well as if you can deal with being kicked and consequentially put in matchmaking cooldown by a team of four people. You can also invest few thousands of dollars to buy fancy weapons. A good game in the end, but only if you play it with friends.

review: This is a honest review of the game Counter Strike Global Offensive or CSGO. Lets just start off by saying that previous counter strike games really have been amazing. Now CSGO is the newest installment in the series. What seems and is a fun game is plauged with problems. Lets start off by the community. The CSGO community is one of the most toxic communities out there just as bad as the Dota2 Community. They will put down new players, troll and just overall have BM while playing the game. Really valve does nothing to punish "Griefers" and others so the trolling will never really end. Another Problem is hackers. Hackers plauge the world of csgo at all ranks and skill levels. Some may be blatant and some may be more conservative. Point is that valve has really not done anything to fight hackers. VAC sucks and takes weeks to ban a hacker, while overwatch has been implemented its a time consuming process that cant always be accurate. Because of the low price of the game hackers can make endless accounts and continue to feed valve the 15 dollars for csgo so that they can continue to ruin other peoples time. Valve really has ignored the community in many ways aswell. Not implementing 128 tick servers, adding stupid stuff like Music intros to players and not doing productive things like fixing exploits or overpowered things like grenade tagging. A massive problem is also skins. They may look pretty but they ruin the game. Now I understand that valve will never take skins out of the game because it is a massive amount of revenue for them. But skins really only lead to professional players throwing matches... Nothing can really be done about this as much as the big Orgas (organizations) try to stop it from happening. Players will find a way to do it and will throw for skins when competing in small tournaments. Smurfs are considered a problem by some but I see no feaseable way to stop them so I will not be talking about that. Surrendering is also an issue. Teams playing competitive matchmaking can surrender a game but only IF one of the players decides to sacrifice himself and abandon the match getting a cooldown. When playing against a hacker in addition to getting aimbotted time after time 1 player must be punished for abandoning the match in order for the team to forfeit. This game CAN be good but valve is not doing what they need to do to fix the issues and instead adds their cash grabs to the game. The issues will persist and more and more players will leave the game. This game had great potential and is fun at first until you play enough. Then you ake notice and you wait for every patch that is supposed to fix things just to see that it is a new set of skins for some new stupid collection. Today I will be leaving CSGO maybe not forever but until they fix their issues I will not be coming back. TLDR: Great game with TONS of issues that valve gives zero s about. Rating 3/10

review: Do not open cases, for the love of god. You see that you have $5+ on your steam account. You feel the urge that you will get "an exceedingly rare special item" You spend $2.50 and open a case. Tick tick tick..... It stops on a blue gun. You feel this depression, but also this rush going to your head. You decide to spend another $2.50 believing that this special key is the one to get you "an exceedingly rare special item". Tick tick tick... time slows down as the line scrolls past multiple useless gun skins. You see it.... Time stops and you look at that beautiful Yellow Circle. Somehow, you manage to calculate the rate at which the line is travelling to determine if it will land on the yellow circle. You can also apparently have a very large IQ during this short time frame. You heart starts to beat much quicker, you know that it's going to land. You know you can finally brag to your friends that you got a knife from a case. You are so excited you almost knock the glass off the table... But your whole life flips upside down... You realise you failed Physics in High School and that your calculations were completely off. You see it... The line stopped 1 tick away from your beautiful Factory New Stat trak Karambit | Fade. You see that cursed Mil-Spec Skin worth 7c on the Steam Market. You press the Power button on your computer and walk over to your bed. You lie down and close your eyes, tears running down your face. You then overdose on Wizz Fizz and commit Sodoku 11/10 A must buy

review: Imagine, after playing a game for almost 13 years, watching it evolve, get better, finding skills to be better than the average pub player, then the ultimate version of the game comes out, it allows for competitive ranked play at the touch of the button, you practically explode with joy, and you play, and you tweak , you find the right mouse sensitivity , you learn the guns, you learn from your mistakes , you play with friends good and bad, and then you notice during a competitive ranked game that 3 members on the other team or hacking, speed hacks, hacks that dont register direct hits, even killshots can be ignored,players using programs and hardware to intentionally lag themselves back behind corners...you feel like all that hardwork you put into the game has become worthless, you feel let down by the people who brought you the only franchise you've ever put over 2000 hours of your life into, you justifably feel cheated. And thats why i can't reccomend this game, its great, it really is, but the best part of it isn't secure from the same hacks that have been used for so long, it's heartbreaking .valve you dropped the ball, please secure your servers.

review: This game is the successor to the original counter-strike aka CS 1.6. Ignore counter-strike: condition zero, and counter-strike: source, both those games never blew up as competitively as CS 1.6, and CS:GO. This game takes tons of practice, and patience. Nobody can just start off doing well, you might be decent if you can aim, but there are so many factors that come into play determining your skill level compared to your opponents. All of the above is true except for when I said nobody can start off doing well, I am one of the rare exceptions where I just dominate everything. I never lose, and have yet to lose. Maybe someone can tell me how it feels to lose. This game isn't fun as much for me anymore, because I never lose.

review: Counter Strike Global Offensive in itself is a good game. We are getting frequent updates from the devs and the player count keeps increase. Rather than writing a lengthy summary of my opinions of the game I have decided to break it down into two groups of bullet points. **The Good** * High skill ceiling but easy to start FPS * Lots of fun to play with friends / make new friends * Many of the guns are viable unlike previous versions * Devs connect with the community and gradually make tweaks and ingame changes after deliberation. **Needs Improvment** * Visibility (HDR / Bloom are locked down unlike prior versions). * Upgraded anti cheat (too many hackers in higher elo MM). * Movement and accuracy modifications. * Some guns need further tweaking (Deagle / P90) * Valve servers need lower VAR / higher tickrate * **Overall Rating ** 8.5 / 10

review: When Counter Strike: GO came out it wasn't very good, and the online servers was quite dead. But after a year of updates the game have become really good! I knew Valve and the team behind cs wouldn't let the cs fans down. Counter strike GO offers different gamemodes, improved graphics and overall options, a ranking system for those interested and a good variety of maps and weapons! The competitive scene have grown, and I think thats great. Unlike some other FPS, cs requires skill and training. When the game came out you couldn't customize the weapons very much, but now thats possible, with thousands of badass looking skins and stuff. CS:GO is really cheap compared to most competitors, so Im recommending it without doubt.

review: PLEASE READ BEFORE VOTING THIS DOWN I cannot recommend it because this game destroys people. It's a good game but at a terrible cost. No, Im not some anti-gaming freak, I love games. But truth said, this is a great game, but it will kill you inside. Matchmaking is well made so you usually get paired with equal to average of your team. When it's easy and you wreck havoc, it's too easy, boring, unsatisfying. If it's challenging and hard, or you're loosing, you keep worrying about your stats, skill and rank. You are either bored and dissatisfied or stressed and angry. Either at yourself or the rest of your team(that other happens more often). If you live in europe, this game will only make you racist. You will hate on every person that cannot speak english or your very own language for not being able to communicate with you, or refusing to communicate with you. Maybe at first you wont experience all that by playing casual where people usually don't care, but once you try competetive, you look at casual with disgust. The better you get, the more hateful towards other players you will be. You will not remember how bad you used to be, you will hate all the noobs, skrubs and casuals. You will judge people by their skins, weapons of choice and headshot ratio. Everyone you dislike will be labeled as cheater. Where is the fun in all this, I ask? You can be proud of yourself when you win, or survive in an action where you were meant to die, but each and every accomplishment you'll get will make you crave for more, and at one point you won't feel much from winning, but you will feel a lot from loosing.

review: Comparing with CS:Source,we can no more spray erotic pictures in game. Instead,we have splendid weapon skins. If you become the last survivor of your team,don't be nervous,even facing 5.Just gently press your fade F,then you can guarantee everyone on your side is watching you showing off your sparkling invaluable knife. There's no noob in the world,just elegantly push your likeable F,then everything is alright. In order to keep youself brilliant,you would buy as many cases and keys as you can afford. If you don't have so much money,work for it.If you don't have so much time to work,go rob a bank. If you finally got arrested,at least you had tried your best to chase your dream and guard your faith. Go f()()() the game,and just admire your collection. Enjoy yourself in Counter-Strike:Skinner Box. 10/10 /Would touch F again and again

review: I grew up on the series. Love and hate, but it always had some magic and made me come back. When I got the opportunity to play the CS:GO closed beta it was amazing. Top notch stuff, guns had a great feel back then, no stupid stickers or skins, no failed updates. Even the final product released a year ago was good. Since the introducing of the skins, performance went to the drain (bear in mind the Source engine is 10 years old now), stability is a word of a past and the COD effect among newcomers is at an all-time high. This is not even remotely satisfying. If you find 1.6 or CSS dear, DON'T SWAP! Otherwise, you will live to regret it. You'll become a twisted shadow of your former self, incapable of gaming on that proper level ever again when you go back out of frustration. The number of cheaters and the way the support/dev team does not care about this product - makes me want to vomit. WELCOME TO COMMUNITY TESTED PAYED BETA! 7.10.14 Update: If your behinds hurt, I feel sorry for you. Focus on getting them random headshots we all get but never admit. And no, I do not mean the ones that kill us, but the ones that we frag mid air, mid run which should not even happen. But yes, you call that skill, cause it hurts the ego.

review: This game has become a great FPS in my library. I played a CS mod many, many years ago (Tactical Ops: Assualt on Terror) and loved it always wanted to play it online but never could at that time. I finally bought Global Offensive and I've been impressed everything I was expecting and much more. It's a simple FPS with different modes search and destroy, hostange rescue, TDM, and more. I will give you the warning, it's very difacult to be good at this game. The level of compitition is great. I honestly can go into a game and suck and have fun or light up the scores and still have fun. I typically play just competitive matches where it's a 30 round game first team to 16 round wins wins the match. It varies by map as to which game mode you play and in each round you only get one life. Sounds hard right? Exactly! Competitive is a blast. I highly recomend this game if you like FPS and like playing online. Use stradegy, play with friends, play with strangers and remember DO NOT PLAY THIS WITHOUT HEADPHONES IF IN PUBLIC PLACE! "The bomb has been planted is not something you want heard outloud. Just saying. My rating 9.5/10 very awesome game!

review: Basic Gameplay You play as either a Counter-Terrorist or a Terrorist, both of which are deployed into a battlefield and each round are giving a small allowance to purchase weapons of their choice. You can make extra money by winning rounds or you could also hold a knife up to the enemy demanding their money, Although that would be risky since the enemy would likely just to shoot you. On the Terrorist team your goal is to plant and explosive near some uhhm.. important boxes?. Anyway, once plant wait You patiently for it to explode. As a Counter-terrorist you must eliminate all the Terrorist forces OR defuse the bomb, thus Protecting those ever important boxes from certain destruction. Being a honourable opponent, Terrorists are sure to set the bomb timer just long enough to give the Ct's the chance to Slaughter the remaining T's, and defuse the bomb. I'll list some positive/negative attributes of this game here. Positive attributes : - Matchmaking - Teaches children the harsh reality of gambling (although some never seem to learn even after $500 later) - Ranks - Cool looking skins - Fast growing population of players - Fat stacks of loot dropped somewhat often - Chickens - High replay value - Deathmatch game type (I could go into more detail on negative parts of it, but that would make this review too long and boring) Negative attributes : Although I Do love the single player campaign, it could use some work. I REALLY wish it were longer.. And that final Boss fight is pretty lame. It only lasts around 27 seconds, and during that time the only way to lose is by taking offense from the old man that constantly insults you, and how his "7 year old could beat you, blindfolded." - The game mode "Infernal" played on the map "de_inferno" Some people like this game mode however I personally dislike it, For those of you that have not yet had the chance to experience it I'll explain for you. It seems like any normal de_ map However, The real goal is to scurry around finding any shred or scrap of rego, Normally it's hidden in obscurer unused sections of the map, and has the ability to shift/move around to different locations, Or even leave the game entirely for up to 10 minutes at a time. - Demolition, Also known as "jokemode" Added purely as a joke that volvo was supposed to only unlock on every April fool's day, However some hacker probably that "4_chan" guy, permanently unlocked it. (Volvo have been working on a fix ever since) Demolition is the game mode which automatically gives everyone amour and then requires you to get kills with weapons that do extremely poor damage against armoured opponents. Also no block is Enabled And Whoa?, So is team killing! The volka Strategy You could just play this game like a noob and spend hundreds of dollars on skins, OR you could play the game correctly like me. Here is my strategy : - Don't buy skins to start with, Seriously it's a waste of money. - Play for a good 50 hrs or so and sell any drop you get. - Wait for a steam sale and Invest in as many copies of csgo you can. - Work your way up to about 5 copies or so But make sure you don't get too many otherwise you won't have enough time to harvest all your csgo account drops (having more than 7 accounts may have diminishing returns) [Note- it takes about 20 hrs gameplay to activate the drops]. - Keep playing on all copies frequently to maximise drops. - Once you have your economy built up with this method you can now buy skins with all that free income you have. Remember to Never gamble with opening cases. I've made about $100 with this method. I think it's about time to quit my day job. In a whole, I do love this game And would recommend to anyone, Good half, Good half.

review: CS:GO is a game which was once designed around team-based attacks and defenses, something which has since been replaced by weapon reskins and recoil patterns. Pros: Very easy to hop into a casual game and enjoy a quick game. Very easy to join a competitive game and work with a team of nearly equal skill-levels in a longer game with higher tensions. New game modes to choose from. Wide variety of powerful weapons at your disposal. Betting scene. Numerous competitive leagues and teams for highly skilled players. Cons: Difficult to master weapons and recoil patterns. Luck plays a considerable role in fights. Learn a plethora of new insults from teammates. Conclusion: For 15$, it's worth every penny.

review: Counter Strike: Global Offensive is a great game about robbing banks. It shows how a great musical game like itself can be transformed into something of a story driven racing game. It shows a few hints of real time strategy and can be played while eating foods such as pizza, spaghetti and vegemite sandwitches.

review: Really fantastic and balanced game! And think about the competetive aspects you could compete: - Queing up vs fullpremade teams as solo! -Getting kicked out of a ladder game just for fun for having a disconnect, even if you have 10:0 stats. -If you arent familiar with russian greetings you should inform yourself before joining a game, else you would be confused about  BLIAT VODKA VODKA, YOUR MOTHER IS A *BIEEEEP*! - Matchmaking is starting 4vs5 games, enjoy your bot! - People get random Matchmaking bans, because they can`t reconnect due to bugs! -You have to decide what player you are, you have 2 options. You can be the noob or the hacker. As Noob you basically have worse than 1,0 kd. As Hacker you are above 1,0kd, pretty simple, isnt it. -Oh and if you meet people who are Master Guardian after 20 hours playtime, dont be afraid. Its okay. The boy/girl is just playing on one of his 37 smurf accounts. I can really recommend this game if you live in russia and your IQ is below 70! Or you love the sound of ongoing 13 yo german gangster-rapper screaming in your ears, this game could be for you. If you arent sure yet if you should buy this, just check out some hacks in youtube which are available for cs:go. Its awesome. You see flying people who shoot with homing bullets through 10 walls while screaming in voicechat, YOU ARE ALL NOOBS, BUHAHAHAHAHAH. And honestly, who would want to miss something like that :) ? If the current bugs are taken serious by valve the game might leave beta stage in like 3-4 years. Buy it right now!

review: Engine still broken after idk how long. Stopped playing when the buggy as hell CSS was released try to get back into it but the registry and .netcode in this version of the game is still so awful that it's nearly unplayable. The community consists of "die-hard try-hards" and people who haven't the slightest clue as to what they are doing. Ranks are useless and baseless as it falls under a W/L ratio, rather than a K/D ratio like its forefather CAL. With this release Valve continues to make money off of other people's ideas with stupid things like gun skins and lacks the originality it once had with it's release of HL1 and 2. All in all this game is a huge waste of money and does not give anything to the modding community that once made this game thrive. Forgetting the average age of a gamer and turning it's back on the people that made CS a once world renouned title.

review: Simply the cake of first-person shooters. In my head CS is the purest aim-based shooter. The Counter-Strike series are an absolute classic dating back 12 years and the recipe hasn't changed very much. Why change what is not broken, and Valve realized that and made CS: Global Offensive a modernized and community-driven version of older holy grails like CS 1.6 and CS:Source. I just had to buy this game for the sake of the good old LAN-party days and the lasting effect CS 1.6 left on me. ------------------------------------------------------------------- I am very pleased with what Valve managed to do with this game. I never knew it was possible but they managed to make the game compatible with all skill levels, as opposed to something like let's say CS 1.6 in which "Get rekt" is the only game mode new players can play. What surprised me even more is the fact that they kept the classic feeling of older titles in this series. All you have to do is go into the game options and change your crosshair to "Classic" and you're set. As I expected from Valve's legendarily well-made engines, the game is running as smooth as butter on ice. The input scheme is astonishingly sharp and for good reason, since every single pixel can make the difference here. Speaking about pixels, the graphics are based on the Half-Life 2 engine and I must say, they're extremely fitting and the very, very well-made maps are the cherry on top. Nothing distracting here and definitely nothing ugly or out of place. It's a minimalist approach in my opinion and I absolutely love it! No extra filler added in, only what's needed. As a result the game is optimized as hell for high frames per second. Flawless gem polish all-around, can't really spot any imperfections. CS:GO is really balanced around the player's skill level, the player's aim and his team synergy. Match making is solid, too. There is really to complain about in this game. If you are losing it's because you suck and if you win it's because you are a mean, well-oiled clicking machine. I haven't really delved too deep into the team aspect of this game but I am really looking forward to the new "Competitive" matches. I will get there eventually, I just need to get even better than I am now, and maybe make some time to play more awesome games like this. Competition is not absent from this game, it's over-abundant for those who want to seek a challenge. You'll get it, for sure. The game modes are plenty as the maps. They include the classic Terrorists -- Counter-Terrorists paradigm and they revolve around the classic: Plant the bomb, Rescue the Hostages and many more new ones that are just a truck full of fun. More casual and more well-known game modes like Deathmatch and such are in the game if you want to shoot something fast. I am really surprised by the numerous and awesome community this game constructed, and it's constantly growing too. The players are really friendly and fun to play against from what I've seen. Good sportsmanship too. All in all, what it really comes down to is the fun aspect of this game, and boy, I must say after just a couple of matches I realized I was gonna skip the night just to play some good old CS. The game is fun and addictive once you get into it. Rounds may be short, but the replayability is ridiculously good, and it scales well with the multiplayer aspect. Man those headshots are satisfying to land. ------------------------------------------------------------------- Some tips I gave to a friend, and I'm sure these will be useful for newer players out there: "In CS, basically you have to click on the enemies head before they do, while your crosshair is minimized. Don't shoot unless you have a guaranteed headshot. For starters, I recommend switchingto one of the dynamic crosshairs in the option menu.I use classic dynamic. Now you have an idea where bullets are going. Try shooting bullets at a wall and see where they hit. Try full auto, try burst. Try practice mode here, without bots. In 98% of the situations it's good to burst or semi shoot. Never go full auto, controlling recoil is essential. You must wait a bit until your crosshair is small before shooting. Don''t forget to use Crouch/Walk (Ctrl/Shift) to minimize your crosshair. For beginners, try crouching when you see a guy and try clicking on his head. Also, never shoot while moving, your rekoil is huge and you don't have chances to hit. Don't forget to put your crosshair at head level always. Keep it up and close to corners. When enemy comes by you only have to move an inch for a headshot. Play deathmatch at first to train. What matters, in order: 1) Aim All weapons are hitscan. Aim well and use low sensitivity + a huge mouse pad. I go 28 cms per 360 degrees. 2) Reflexes You have to aim accurately and you also have to be fast in doing so. No point being able to click on the enemies head if he clicks on yours first. 3) Map awareness and predictive thinking This is basically your game skill that you've gathered through experience. Knowing how to be effective on the map. Knowing where enemies are. Listening for enemies. Knowing to take cover. Knowing when to engage. Knowing to stay with teammates. Knowing where to throw grenades." ------------------------------------------------------------------- Overall, this game is absolutely great. Can't really point anything wrong with it and I'm really looking forward to spend hundreds of hours on this one in the long run. Maybe I'll uncover some things wrong with it after I play it more, and I'll surely update this guide. Buy it. Especially if: -it's on sale -you like FPS's, especially if you've played and loved the classic ones like CS 1.6, Quake and such -you have good aim -you like a challenge and you have a competitive nature ------------------------------------------------------------------- ~~~ 9/10 ~~~ A sacred beast of a game. ------------------------------------------------------------------- "Counter-Strike is a pretty simple game. All you have to do is click on their heads" ~ Anonymous

review: Dear Santa, For Christmas, I would like for CS:GO to receive an AI overhaul. You see, when I play a game, and a teammate gets grumpy, they wind up leaving. That leaves me and my friends with a bot. This bot is not very bright and will often run out into anything, whether it be a smoke, an incendiary grenade, an AWP, or a five man rush of P90's and Tec-9's. At the very least, I would love for the AI to be able to sit down in a corner as though it were a chick hatching an egg everytime it was asked to "stay here team". Sincerely Kim Jung-Un P.S. I've been very good at using my CS:GO betting money to feed the people of North Korea. It makes up 30% of our GDP.

review: Do you want a fast-paced multiplayer FPS that is riddled with inconsistent crap netcode that readily bends over a barrel and presents a jasmine scented  which pooches open in anticipation for every two-bit "hacker" on the Internet? Well then THIS IS FOR YOU! Do you enjoy an endless torrent of  hackers? Teamkillers? Smurfs? Gobshites with broken microphones who will readily spout an everlasting supply of foreign swear words while you're trying to listen for the enemy? That's right, nothing adds to the challenge more than having to watch out for  and traitors on your own team! Laggy no-skill morons from far-flung lands who are impossible to hit? That's right, hit your router with a hammer and fill the ports with kitkat wrappers because YOUR HALF SECOND PING WILL SAVE YOU SON! That's called LAG COMPENSATION which gives ALMOST TOTAL INVINCIBILITY to anyone with an Internet connection that has no business whatsoever playing games like this. This was once a good game. These days KDR stands for "Kids, s and Russians". Toxicity from top to bottom. "But surely, at the higher levels, you get away from all that!" Yeah, check out the regular reports of "pro" players throwing matches for money, using hacks at top-tier tournament level, and acting like 12-year olds. Banwaves are good for about a day, if that, just to give you a glimpse of what the game could be. Don't even waste your time reporting griefers and hackers, if you want to do something more useful, open notepad, type some Russian swear words (you will know them all by now) then save the document and throw it into your Recycle Bin. Avoid at all cost. Play a man's game. Let the children have this one and buy ArmA 3 instead. Find a good, well adminned server. Ping greater than 300? *BOOM* See ya, Vlad. Mouthy teenager? *BOOM* See ya, Timmy. COMING SOON: Yet another half-baked cack-handed attempt at balancing the pistols ...

Why is that good you might ask? Cause you will keep playing this game for many hours just to get the basics down. Cons -There is trollers/mean crude people in the game, who are far better than you. -hackers (this is a big one later in the game of competeive play) You will come across them very often in high skilled level games. -Complainers who just gives you complete negetivity in the game. Like wow how the  did you not get the kill you ing scrub? -csgo skins (yes I have csgo skins blahaha) I am going to go with a postive review on this as a like. This is the type of a game I really like. (other than the cons) Note this will get updated if I think more stuff.

review: Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is the newest version of the well known game Counter-Strike. Global Offensive has a lot of different game modes besides of the classic bomb defusal/hostage rescue scenarios. Deathmatch, basically is about getting a lot of kills and dying as few times as possible. You will spawn at random space with your chosen weapons or random ones. In Arms Race you have to get kills with every weapon. The fastest player wins. Demolition can be a Bomb mission or hostage rescue on smaller maps compared to the regular bomb or hostage missions. Competitive is the hardest and most interesting type and is only recommended for advanced players. You have to win a minimum 16 rounds to win the game. This gamemode may take up to 90 minutes. Communication is the key here to win. Counter-Strike: Global Offensive also support ingame items, but it is a purely cosmetic thing. You will also have a chance to support the game by buying special tickets for the so-called "Operations". With an operation pass you will get access to newly released competitive maps, new weapon skins and an upgradeable medal. The graphics are much better than Counter Strike Source. The environments are more detailed and the game just looks a whole lot better. Global Offensive is one of the top 10 most played games on Steam right now, so there are plenty of players and servers. The mechanics are different from former Counter-Strike games, like the recoil for each weapon and new weapons like decoy, Molotov, etc. This could be difficulty for veteran players at the beginning. But after a while you can deal with it. Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a definite buy for anyone that is into Counter-Strike. It is definitely worth the regular price of 13,99. A must have for every Steam user! Sounds 9/10 Graphics 9/10 Gameplay 10/10 Atmosphere 10/10

review: Over 600 hours on CS:GO. Over 13 years playing CS in general. In older versions of CS if you are high skilled you can easily take down 5 low skilled players. In this version you are lucky to get onto the 3rd guy. Game is all about luck, not skill based like all previous versions of the game. Ranked up to DMG with over 200 wins in competetive and i can say this game should be released as a 5 person COOP. You should only play comp when you have 4 other friends who you know won't troll you, regardless of their skill level its better to have that than random teammates. The hit reg in this game is absolutely nothing compared to previous versions, due to the low bandwidth allocated to the gaming servers setup by valve. The skin system is nothing but a huge money grabbing scheme which no doubt has earnt a huge amount more than the game sales alone. As with all games you can trade in, this one is full of scammers. Constantly, daily trying to scam your high value items from you. Procede with extreme caution when making trades with anyone you don't know. This game promotes gambling to under 18s with the skin drop system, costing each skin a certain price with a possible return on investment. Gambling sites are regulated and usually offer around 85% return on your gambling in the long run. I believe there is no regulation of this system and there's plenty of 12yr old kids out there throwing away hundreds into this system. Alot of reviews have complained about cheaters. This isn't such a bad problem nowa days as the overwatch system has taken over VAC in the competetive section of the game, blatent cheaters are caught and banned for 1 year quite quickly and the players that support and judge in this system are to thank. Overall the game it's self has a great system but just isn't being used to its full potential. Allocate more time and money please valve.

review: I must recommend this game, it is my duty as one who has spent 1600 hours on CSS (from xFire) and 500+ hours on CSGO. I played non-stop competitive CS:Source in regional championships, LANs, and online leagues; and won 4 regional championships with some LAN placings. Here's what I have to say about GO... CSGO is awesome, Valve delivered here in the end. When it was released, yeah, it wasn't anything special, just a pretty CS:Source. But now we have amazing gun skins, stickers, awesome knives, intense major tournaments, souvenir packages, bracket prediction challenges, seasonal operations with extra maps and challenges for even more drops, etc. It's awesome, it's a great game to be a part of. Matchmaking and rated matchmaking based personal ELO rankings is a sweet way to keep competitive games close. It can never be perfect, but back in Source you had to wait in an IRC channel with a looped message playing until someone finally answered your loop and then it took them 20 minutes to get 5 in the server, etc. Basically with CS:Source whether you were trying to ring or you had your team it took between 20-60 minutes to get a scrim. Now it takes about 5. So, the fact that people still complain about it is beyond me. Game play wise, each CS as I know them (1.6, Source, GO) has been different beasts in terms of mechanics and recoil control. Lots of little things that made or broke you as a player in these games, but recoil control is one of the biggest. You often hear people scream deathmatch deathmatch deathmatch, that's the only way to get better. Well, quick point, how can you DM to practice when you don't know what your practicing? Best thing to do to understand the recoil patterns is load an offline game, kick the bots, and shoot at walls. Seriously. Shoot and spray at walls with various guns at various ranges with various movement patterns, that's the best way to understand how to control and use various guns. You need to understand each guns grouping patterns first before you can practice controlling them! About the community, yes, the flamers and trolls are alive and well. But here's the thing, I've been around CS a long time, I've won 4 regional championships with CS:Source, and really it never bothered me that sometimes the flamers are all you hear. Here's why. Once you play enough games (competitive or otherwise) you'll hear the same kind of person, it'll sound like this.. you guys suck, why are you even playing this game? or something similar if they are beating you. It sounds like this, you're such a hacker, it's so obvious when you beat them. The fact that people are so binary in their mentality amuses me personally, so I carry that over to CS flamers as well. Some people like to pretend they are perfect at the game, and everyone else around them is inferior, yet if you beat them you must be a hacker. It just sounds so stupid to even talk about it but seriously this is how a lot of people are about the game. Just don't let it get to you, there's no point. Don't even engage. And you wont have many problems. It's not the easiest game to pick up right off the bat. Spray at feet, get headshot is a notorious saying from outsiders about CS games, because CS can be amazingly random sometimes. And the round-by-round economy, buying guns and items every round, and recoil patterns make it a steep learning curve. But if you understand the groupings (I said how to above), read guides about strategy (like economy management, game flow), and just get in there and start playing you will see why people just can't stop playing this game! Counter-Strike was the world's original eSport. After the Championship Gaming Series went down the CS1.6 and CS:Source attention did as well, games like StarCraft and DOTA took to the forefront of competitive eSports soon after. But with the cases, skins, and major tournaments Valve and the CS community have turned CS:GO back into one of the world's premiere eSports and there's many, many reasons why it's succeeding. As I say, it's a very exciting game to be a part of right now.

review: I could never really get into Counter-Strike and Counter-Strike: Source. But Global Offensive is really easy to pick up, is pretty polished, has nice customization option, lots of neat little things all around. It's a good MP title. I'd recommend trying to play with a friend who already knows about the game's mechanics and the metagame, too. It's a very gradual learning experience.

review: CS:GO is arguably the best Counter-Strike in the series. Counter-Strike's unique style in the first person shooter genre has made this series a trail blazer among many other shooters. CS:GO carries this mantra and revitalizes the concept with content that is mainly user driven. Compared to the previous iteration, some weapons have been replaced with similar counterparts while the maps have been upgraded and balanced more appropriately. Admittedly, the game was riddled with issues during the early stages but it has matured drastically since its inception, owing to Valve's diligence and community feedback. CS:GO's 250,000 concurrent players and the ever expanding competitive scene stands testimony to this game's successful approach. At the heart of this game is the community's boundless imagination full of custom maps, skins, stickers, and soundtracks that add style to the gameplay. Additionally, to show appreciation to the community, Valve packages community content into DLC and uses it to support the content creators and fund the competitive scene. This game is a must have for the FPS fans.

review: In the beggining as amateur or something is good game. But after 400+ hours GO is so bad. The way you get the rank is so stupid because without pre-made team in ranked matches you are nothing. Full of random kids that flame,doing rage quits etc. So the rank doesnt show your real level. Also what about bans?If there is blackout in my home how can I avoid the ban?You have only 5 or 7 minutes to join again. And if the electricity doesnt show up then you have to be banned. 6/10

review: When I first got this game I thought it was going to be an amazing anime RPG. I turned on the game and I was so excited. For whatever weird reason, it wouldn't let me customize my character. "Whatever..." I thought and joined a server thinking maybe it would show up. When I joined the server no character customization was to be found. Nor a tutorial. Nor was Naruto, Pikachu, or Ash. I then decided I would ask the "helpful community". Unfortunately for me, I was globally offended when I asked people where Naruto was. People immediately told me to kill myself over the mic. This drove me into a deep depression, I couldn't watch Dragon Ball Z or Seinfeld again. D: -69/10 Would not cut myself from the suicide messages again

review: It doesn't matter how good you are any more, you will be judged solely on the market value of your inventory. You should have one of your several Karambit knives equipped at all times and inspect it in game whenever possible to ensure that anybody who is spectating you is aware that you are aware you're being watched and you are absolutely showing off that extremely pricey knife you own. Your stats are irrelevant now, most people aren't even aware that the 'Tab' key actually has a function in game. It doesn't matter if you don't know what 'eco' means. Fuck team work. You have a 'BOOM' AWP in your inventory, as long as you have $4750 cash in game you're buying an AWP. You will mock anyone who decided to give their Nova the 'Walnut' skin. Same goes for people who give their FAMAS the 'Doomkitty' skin. You will only equip 'StatTrak' weapons and the first thing you do when you acquire one is go on an idle server and get several hundred kills on AFK players in order to pad the stats so you don't look like a total n00b. Whenever a new case is released you will buy as many cases and keys as it takes in order to acquire 'an Exceedingly Rare Special Item!' Disregard the fact that you will end up spending three times as much as you otherwise would've by buying this directly from the market, it's only your parents' money after all. Besides, your birthday is next month and Christmas/Easter/[insert public holiday here] is just around the corner so you won't have to wait too long before you can blow more of their money on digital goods. You will also plaster ever single skin you own with multiple unseemly stickers with the intention of creating a unique skin for your weapon. Your 'Easy Peasy' and 'Ninjas in Pyjamas' stickers totally don't look ridiculous whatsoever. You will also name tag all of your weapons in order to add that final personal touch to the weapon you invested so much time and money in. You don't own an AK or an M4 any more, you only own weapons with names like 'xXx OG Snoop Dogg' and 'dubstep warrior'. You now have all the knowledge required to start playing CS:GO. Go forth and procure many skins of great value.

review: Revan was only 23 years old. He loved CS:GO so much. He had most of the achievements and items. He prayed to Gaben every night before bed, thanking him for the inventory he's been given. "CS:GO is love," he says, "CS:GO is life." His elder Dragon hears him and calls him a silver scrublord. He knows his elder is just jealous of his son's devotion to Gabe. He calls him a console peasant. He slaps him and sends him to sleep. He's crying now and his face hurts. He lays in bed, and it's really cold. He feels a warmth moving towards him. He looks up. It's Gabe! He's so happy, Gabe whispers into Revan's ear, "Try your chances... Open a case." Gaben grabs Revan with his powerful dev-team hands and puts him on his hands and knees. He's ready. Revan opens his pockets for Gabe. Gabe puts his hands deep into Revan's pockets. It costs so much, but Revan does it for CS:GO. Revan can feel his wallet emptying as his eyes start to water. He accepts the terms and conditions. Revan wants to please Gabe. Gaben lets out a mighty roar as he fills Revan's computer with keys. Revan opens all the cases and gets nothing worth anything at all.

review: Counter Source: Global Office is a great video game to play on the internet. Personally, I like to play multiplayer more than single player. However, multiplayer is more difficult because the enemies shoot back. I think they should nerf the sniper because people can kill me in one shot even when i buy the helmet! This game is very tough but fun. I heard that the pros warm up before their matches by playing minecraft so that's what I do too.

review: The only thing this competitive game has that compares to call of duty is it's FPS aspect and a few of the guns. Otherwise, it's an upgrade to the original Counter Strike, 1.6, and source with a few additional game modes and better graphics. What I like about this game above it's predecessors is it's offline bots. The dedicated fans that have been playing CS for multiple years makes the online multiplayer very difficult (which is a good thing). So, what I like about this game is the offline bot mode, which allows people who buy this game to enjoy a little pwnage (or challenge when they crank up the difficulty to veteran) when they can't get it online. Also, everyone has an equal chance, not thrown off by prestiging or leveling up, which adds balance.Overall, it's a fun, challenging, and addicting game -- I'd recommend it to all gamers! Especially those who enjoy a good FPS.

review: Counter Strike: Global Offensive is one of those games that is kind of hard not to recommend. It's a solid shooter and it is cheap and looks really good for a game that runs on the Source engine. To new players CSGO may feel a little "back to the basics" as this game does not have aiming down the sight, unlocks, attachments, perks and killstreaks so it's heavily based on player skill and not on selecting the perfect loadout with the perfect perks. This game does have a ranking system but it's different from all the other shooters which I'll explain later on. But the game does show a lot of depth as you play more and you will find out that not everything is as straight forward as it might have looked. It's also a tactical teamplay based shooter, so don't even think about buying it if you don't like teamplay. Only a good team can lead you to victory, not a highly skilled lone wolf. CSGO offers a small variety of game modes, those are: Deathmatch, Arms race, Demolition, Classic casual and Classic competitive. For those of you who are familiar with COD Arms race is called Gun game in COD. You start off with a weapon and every time you kill someone you'll advance to the next weapon until you get a golden knife, kill someone with the golden knife and you win the game. What's rather interesting about Arms race is that you still play in teams 5v5 but the one who killed enemies with all weapons wins. Demolition is a combination between Classic (Ill explain classic later in the review) and arms race. The goal is to plant the bomb as a terrorist or defend the bombsites as a counter terrorist or defuse the bomb if its planted, there are no respawns and instead of buying a weapon you start with one and advance to the next weapon if you made any kills during the last round and if you made more than one kill you'll get extra rewards like frag grenades and flash bangs. In my opinion those game modes are fun but unnecessary because I never really feel the need to play them. There's also deathmatch which is a little different from the usual (team)deathmatch. It's played 5V5 and all weapons are available except for grenades. you play in a team but it's every man for himself as the person with the most points at the end of a round wins. What's also interesting about Deathmatch is that different weapons give a different amount of points and at some point during deathmatch certain weapons give bonus points. In my opinion deathmatch shouldn't be taken to serious, It's a good gamemode to improve your aim, and I know most new players will jump right into deathmatch but that's in my opinion not the way Counter Strike is supposed to be played. So that leaves Classic casual and Classic competitive which are almost the same gamemodes, therefore Ill use this section to talk about the things these gamemodes have in common and in the next section the differences between these gamemodes. Classic consists of the two original Counter Strike game modes: defuse mission and hostage mission. In hostage mission the counter terrorists have to kill all the terrorists or rescue one of the hostages (in the other counter strike games all the hostages have to be rescued) and the terrorists have to prevent the counter terrorists from rescuing the hostages by killing all of the counter terrorists. In defuse mission the terrorists have to plan a bomb at one of the two bombsites and make it explode or kill all the counter terrorists and the counter terrorists have to win by killing all the terrorists or by defusing the bomb if it's planted in which case killing all the terrorists does not result in victory. Both defusal mission and hostage mission have a money system. You'll receive money for all sorts of things, playing a round, of course the winning team receives more in most cases, completing a part of the objective like taking a hostage or planting the bomb and kills. The kill reward depends on the weapon, a rifle or pistol will give you 1 kill reward while an SMG (except for P90) gives you 2 kill reward, a shotgun gives 3 kill reward and a knife gives 5 kill reward while the AWP gives only 0,5 kill reward. At the start of a new round you can buy weapons and grenades with the money you earned and the money you don't spend will carry over to the next round. So now the differences between casual and competitive. In casual you play either terrorist or counter terrorist and the best team out of 15 rounds wins, in competitive the teams are swapt after the 15th round and the best team out of 30 rounds wins. In casual you'll receive more money if you lose a round, less if you win a round and the kill reward for a rifle is 150 bucks while a kill with a rifle in competitive rewards 300, the developer did it this way to balance the difference in money between the good and bad team and the good and bad players in casual. Competitive is played 5V5 and casual can be played 10V10. In competitive you have to buy your armor and your defuse kit while you get those for free in casual. In casual you can just drop in a round and leave whenever you desire while in competitive you join at the start of a game and you're not supposed to leave until the game is finished, because if you do you'll get a penalty in the form of a temporary competitive ban ranging between half an hour and 7 days and I've seen screenshots of people getting over 200 days competitive cooldown. This is both fair and unfair as it will punish the players who ragequit, the more they ragequit the longer the cooldown, but sometimes you can lose connection to the server because of server problems or internet problems in which case you'll also receive a cooldown which is highly unfair. If you play casual you'll play with random people while competitive has a ranking system based on your skill and win/lose ratio and you'll play with people of the same skill level as you. There's also a community server browser with servers that have different game rules, use community maps or even have completely different game modes. I don't spend a lot of time on community servers so I can't tell you more than this. In my opinion competitive is the way to play CSGO, I spend by far most of my time playing competitive. Casual is great for practice but keep in mind that people play different on competitive. If you're new though I advice to play a few rounds on casual before playing competitive so you can learn how the gamemode works, how the economy system works and gain some map knowledge, why should you do this in casual? Well competitive is way more serious. There's also an option to play against bots if you're new to shooters but even expert bots are pretty easy to defeat and play really different than human players. The only negative points I can come up with is that the servers have to be improved as hit detection doesn't always works as it is supposed to work, and the ranking system has to be improved. At the time of writing I am silver elite master (fifth rank) but some silver elites (fourth rank) are way better than me and some golden nova 2 players (seventh rank) are much worse. And they could crank up the difficulty of the bots as medium bots in CS:S are way harder than expert bots in CSGO making bot practice less useful. Over the last year this has definitely become my favorite shooter, I even watch CSGO E-sport. It's a crown jewel and it only costs 14 bucks. I give CSGO a 10/10. This doesn't mean the game is perfect, of course it can be improved but it's based on the fun factor, and even though I sometimes HATE this game out of pure frustration, I'll always come back to it and there are barely any games out there that can do that. Everyone who remotely likes shooters should buy it.

review: This is a really good, casual yet uncasual multi-player FPS that pits two teams against one another. The Terrorists and the counter-terrorists (counter strikers). The terrorists need to make it to specific bomb drop points and hold the position until the bomb goes off. The counter-strikers need to kill the terrorists need to disarm the bomb if it is set or if they kill a terrorist holding the bomb before it is set, they need to make sure no one picks up the bomb to set it. If all members of one faction die, they lose the round. There is no respawn until the next round. All rounds take place on the current map. You don't go to a different map until the match ends. Since you play a few rounds per game (let's say 15 rounds), you get cash for each round win or lose and you can spend that cash at the start of each round on weapons and stuff. So the game increases as you go from just pistols and knives in the first round to much bigger guns in the later rounds. You can also pick up a weapon off the ground and use it as well (unless you've set the rules to restrict such things). You'll keep the weapon from round to round until you die. Its a nice system. It is a great game dynamic with good maps that have the right amount of side paths and choke points to cover. The maps are small enough where there will always be some sort of action happening, but large enough where the action can happen at places you aren't. There is no single player campaign, but you can play maps on your own with bots that have difficulty levels. You can even jump into a bot if you die since there is no respawn until the next round. You'll notice the easy bots take their time to shoot you as well as you can tell watching them they intentionally don't aim directly at you. This is PERFECT FOR BEGINNERS to pick up and play, but of course the bots get more difficult. The game makes headshots instant kills and goes more along the realism path where if you jump and shoot, you're less accurate. When you kneel and shoot you're more accurate. It's a fun game that fills a different niche than Team Fortress 2. Give it a try over a free weekend and its also dirt cheap.

review: It is kind of hard to say I do not like the game after > 1100 hours of gameplay. It is very addictive! What I love about the game is the fact that skill matters and that every player, from total noob to pro-level, has the same arsenal of guns to use. You can not get better guns or upgrades by investing money, meaning it is skill, experience and teamwork (and connection) that makes the difference. But you can give your guns a personal touch, by getting different skins, adding a personal name to a weapon and add stickers. I really like the bomb defusal mode (or bomb placement when you are a terrorist), but there are also other game types: Hostage rescue, Armsrace , Deathmatch and Demolition. Also there is a big library with player made map, all with their own rules and styles. (aim training, headshots only, all vs all, achievement maps, platformstyle and surfmaps) This is my first ever FPS, so needed the first 1k hours (i am a very slow student) to learn how to hold a gun, how to recognize enemies and friends, learn game mechanics and map based tactics and to work well in a team, etc. The overall crappy community is not making it easy to learn the game, because specially as a starting player you get kicked out of matches all the time. Hey I am silver 1 (lowest competative ranking) , of course I am not a star player! Many other players on that same level are hacking, have second accounts, or are experienced in other shooters. And their patience level with newcomers is about 0. So a mistake (even if i had no clue i made one) resulted often in an insta kick. Most absurt thing was getting kicked out of a casual match for being noob...omg really?:) If you can't practice in a competative match, and get kicked out of casual matches too...then how on earth can you learn how to play? Despite an overall crappy community, I met some awesome people. Lot of fun to play together, preferably in a full team, or just some casual matches, armsrace, deathmatch or training. And training does pay off! Anyway, you would think that by now I am a pro, but hell no! I guess I have to conclude I am not talented enough to get to a high rank. On the bright side....I do not get kicked out of a team anymore, at least not that often....must be doing something good! Still playing daily, and still loving it! So... recommended? Hell yeh! NB I just have to mention that that laguage used ingame is really bad... Maybe thats just my feminine view., but I think it extremely childish and limited to the same scolding words over and over. Quite pathetic to be honest. I learned to ignore it. Loving the mute button! I just hope that it is not a reflection of those people irl. That would be really sad.

review: CS:GO mixes up Source and CS 1.6 gameplay. The recoil and the flashbangs are more 1.6 like and the rest is pretty much Source. In CS you have no aim-down-sights-feature what means that you have to control your fire by shooting short salves or single shots. You can also learn the gun's spraypatterns by holding down fire-key and noticing the bullet-impacts (on distance they aren't really noticable but on short to middle ranges it works pretty well). In long range firefights people mostly strafe left and right, shoot single shots and try to hit their opponents head (unrealistic.. but interessting and challenging). You can duck pretty fast but it has almost no effect on your precision. You will be slow and more vulnerable. Flanking is hard in this game, because there is no sprint and maps are designed to have clear, mostly open ways. You can hide in only very very few situations because mostly you have great visibility (It's a bit bad and sometimes irritating that you can not disable blood decals). Mostly the only cover you can get is behind corners or of course headglitch-positions. In this game you can not go phrone or lean around corners. I think leaning would be a nice addition but no.. this game is still remains classic. Armor is more helpful than it was in Source. To me it feels like it's more important to land headshots. Because of that it's rather unlikely to get wallbang-kills. It's hard to spray, there is not much hit-slowdown and armor is very powerful.. and sometimes wallbanging feels a bit random. The sound in this game is good. You mostly hear exactly when people run, shoot or jump. You can mostly locate loud players really precisely (unlike in most modern games, where you mostly have crazy boominess or randomized sound.. because of perks for example). Counter-Strike is mostly comprehensible. Some maps got a really nice overhaul (dust2, dust1, aztec, office, militia, mirage).. Train and Cobble are very different compared to Source or 1.6. Personally I don't like them that much.. Inferno is very similar to the Source-version (they only changed some wall textures and made some minor changes). It's good that Valve changed the hostage rescue mode. Now it's more tactical and more objective based, but I think this mode doesn't work that good with the old map layouts. It's sad that there are only very few new competetive maps. Instead of new official maps there are buyable community-mappacks which are available in competetive and causal matchmaking for a period of time. The ability to find or buy weapon-skins is new in CS:GO. On the one hand it is cool to have camos on your guns, on the other hand it's bad that you mostly find bad looking and/or bad quality skins (or cases). Most camos look very colourful and not realistic. If you want good looking skins you most likely end up buying the skins for real money (on the steam marketplace). Conclusion: CS:GO is a new CS with mediocore graphics (the textures are mostly 512x512 pixels and could be better, sometimes the bloom- and post-process-effects are a bit annoying and also some animations could be better), reworked maps, new recoil and still not perfectly balanced guns (but it's fine). It has most things that the old CS-games already had but also some new things. There is ranked matchmaking, a great HUD and an easy to use replay-function. It's also very nice that you still have dedicated servers. You have the possibility to make your own maps and use server-mods. These are all great features that every modern FPS game should have. If you want to customize the look of your guns, you will have to pay for it. It's very very unlikely to find good skins and the amount of skin-drops is limited to 2-8 drops per week. All in all I think CS:GO is a game that continiues the series in a moderate way. It could be better but it could also be a lot worse. Since this game is not too expensive I can recommend you getting this game.

review: Counter-Strike: Global Offensive truly is a game like no other. In Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, you are tasked with globally offending as many people as you possibly can in 30 rounds, with an array of tools such as mic spam, teamkilling, or racist bullet messages. It differs from the original Counter-Strike (Known as '1.6' because there are 1.6 people still playing) in the fact that it's not 37 years old. Counter-Strike Hardline refines the tried and true formula of Police (Voiced by Nolan North) vs Counter-Police (Voiced by Troy Baker), bringing in many new faces to each team, such as Jewish Toad from Super Mario Bros, a black guy, a ghost with a beret, and a hot topic customer. Counter-Strike: Black Ops adds exactly 3 new zones for you to wreak havoc in, bringing the total amount of maps to 1, but makes up for it with a large arsenal of over 70 weapons, which I will now list for you. -Ak-47 -M4 -AWP All in all, Counter-Strike: Global Defensive is a robust top down open world third person beat 'em up that tweaks the gunplay to its best, with amazing graphics and sound design, it's bound to keep you hooked until Counter-Strike 5. 0/5

review: On Counter-Strike: Global Offensive since the announcement lay a huge responsibility. After all, the continuation of the legendary series of online shooters , a fan is a vast community will not tolerate the slag or just serednyachkovoy game. Benefit , Valve and not the studio that dares to disappoint their fans. Two years later, the clockwise and 691 held in opposition to the special forces and terrorists , I can proudly say that CS: GO is really failed. Even more than . Before continuing my review , it is worth noting that the only worthwhile game mode and remains to this day a bomb clearance , ie confrontation 5x5 , 30 rounds of 1 min. 45 sec. , In which the attacker must detonate a bomb at certain points , and protection appropriate to allow this to happen. One of the major advantages is the fact that CS: GO this type of game ( with minor changes ) placed in a separate section of the menu called ' competitive mode ' . Introduced a system of titles that helps you find a match according to your skill. In CS 1.6 and CS: Source competitive mode by default absent and was available only on certain servers , specially tuned for this type of game. The gameplay is not changed . Actually , nothing changed and is not required , a familiar mechanic works on hurray . Fixed characteristics of some weapons , something removed, something added to the overall picture it does not have nearly no effect. Shooting became more random, yes. But perhaps the most realistic FPS in the moment. If multiplayer shooter from you wait not fancy graphics and ballistics believable and interesting gameplay, then welcome to the CS: GO. Valve managed to make an almost perfect balance of gaming devices. With proper skill you can neutralize the enemy with a much more powerful weapon . Pistol rounds in CS: GO is not known to sink without a chance and an opportunity to take the round even with poor economies . But the most important advantage is the ratio of Valve to his fans . Almost every week there is a free upgrade , changing the gameplay for the better, in order to achieve a perfect balance . Approximately every six months out extensive additions cost 5-7 dollars with soccer fans cards that are available in the competitive mode. That's not counting skins for weapons that can get special opening drawers. In addition to all Valve maintains its competitive community , sponsoring tournaments large sums . And I am delighted that the number of people playing CS: GO, is increasing every day . But on the other hand it is the community CS was for me the only problem in this game. Because it often turns into a competitive mode into a farce and mutual humiliation. The only solution - only play with friends. Total we have a great continuation of one of the greatest franchises in history. To purchase required if gaming is important to you the gameplay itself . Best multiplayer shooter at this point, in my opinion. - beardATTACK @ fren

review: I don't really know why Global Offensive costs less than Source, but nevertheless, this is a great game, the successor of a real legend. It's a little hard to adapt if you come from games like Battlefield or CoD because of the recoil and no sights, but if you are dedicated, you can master it in no time. If you are a fan of shooters, you MUST play this game... but warning: it'll be addicting as hell.

review: Well, this game is amazing, and is very different from the past Counter Strikes. Graphics have improved alot, which I believe why many people love games because of their graphics. (Graphics aren't everything). As of the past Counter strikes, you would have to find a server with the particular gamemode that you want. (Arms race, Deathmatch etc etc) In CS-GO You wont have to worry about that, they have different gamemodes where you could actually choose to play in besides finding a server that has it. I have also notice that this is fairly alittle bit easier than any of the other counter strikes, probably since they reduce the recoil a bit? But either way, tap firing is always the key. Also many Unique Features they have added in this game. First off, there are the skins. Many people disliked this idea since they probably thought CS-GO would be "like" Call Of Duty. Well, adding skins doesn't really mean anything, it just makes you be able to battle in style. Not to also mention offline mode. Offline mode is basically playing with bots. Now, some Counter-Strikes did have bots such as Counter Strike Source, but I just thought it was nice that they would add "bots mode" back. Counter Strike Global Offensive is way different from any other FPS (First Person Shooter). It's much harder and takes a bunch of skills seeing the fact that many players are already pros. So, that's why I play Offline mode. If I were to rate this game out of 10, I'll probably give it a 7.5/10

review: Counter-Strike makes you work to enjoy the content, and you'll have to put many hours of play into it before enjoying the feeling of conquering it. Weapons are a huge part of the series too, with CS:GO not an exception. Each round provides a cash sum based on your previous performance, and with this you can purchase armour, projectiles and weapons. Firearms range from standard assault rifles to shotguns and sniper rifles, and you'll want to experiment with each one to see which works best. What makes Counter-Strike such a popular series - and what will no doubt make CS:GO the next big PC shooter - is the thrill of the ego chase. As you die, often continuously, the frustration is outweighed by an aspiration to do better. In a game where success is pinned on attention to detail, death often triggers an internal failure analysis that the player will mull over while waiting for a new session to load. It becomes a spiral of egging yourself on to do better - and if you become a good player, the game becomes a stage for you to parade your skills. Global Offensive builds on the CS series by going through a significant checklist presented by its community and marking off as many points as possible. Gun game as its own separate mode? Check. Competitive capabilities built in? Check. Map balancing here and there? Check, check, check. As a result, there are numerous upgrades that will adjust gameplay while also making accessibility far better. The wide range of grenades, for example, will likely make play more tactical - laying down incendiary grenades will thwart rushes, while decoys, which fake gunfire and fool radar points, are brilliant tools for messing with the minds of established players. The actual core shooting will be a huge talking point for many months to come. It has been tinkered slightly and gives weapons a noticeably floaty feel, which doesn't sit well to begin with. We eventually found ourselves enamoured by it, and the impact of hits add a real tactile distinction to play. It's what doesn't work, however, that is most notable. Regular mode has no new maps added to it, while all the new guns seem somewhat cosmetic. Global Offensive has also removed some of its middling weapons such as the MP5, essentially pushing even more players to stick with the AK and the M4. Sometimes it gives the impression that there is in fact less valuable content than in previous CS releases. If one assumed this was Counter-Strike Source with a visual mod installed, there would often be little to shake that impression. There's also now a split between casual and competitive servers - however, many players aren't yet aware of the differences, mainly because the distinction isn't made obvious enough. It becomes even more confusing if you join a community server with all hosts of mods installed on it, which have perhaps taken casual mode, turned friendly fire on and essentially made it as close to Source as possible. At times, arranging games in Competitive Mode feels like a chore. Joining a five-on-five war is simple enough, but attempt to lobby up with a group of friends and join a game, and you'll often hit a snag. Myself and a few others tried to find a competitive game with no luck, simply being told that no servers were currently available. When you finally do join, it works fine, but the wait and work required to find a game seems like a drawback. We eventually gave up and resorted to using IRC to find matches, as we would with Source. Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is not the key evolution point that we were hoping for, and the response from the community often reflects this view. On many occasions, other players used phrases such as "same old" to us. This is elementally Counter-Strike Source with some fine-tuning under the bonnet, and Valve appears to have acknowledged this with the reasonable RRP attached to it. And yet the core DNA of the game has not lost its appeal. This is still a glorious experience that sets a benchmark for all multiplayer shooters. Valve's objective with Global Offensive was to draw together the active communities of both the Source and trusty 1.6 edition. It clearly has a good chance.

review: Once again, Valve never fails to deliver an epic title such as Counter Strike. For years, the Counter Strike community was divided into two titles: Counter Strike: 1.6 and Counter Strike: Source. But now thanks to Valve's latest Counter Strike adition, we can finally bring back the family all together. The addition of skins are all bonuses that make Counter Strike: Global Offensive even more enjoyable, following Team Fortress 2's hat and drop system. The money being used for E-sports for the best to take place in. The competitive rank system that finally matches players equally based in terms of skill and tactic, as well as giving you the prestige for winning. The game is not perfect, but then again no game is. But what seperates most games from this one is the fact that the beloved developers of Hidden Path Entertainment are always listening to the fans while working together with the top players to try to achieve the perfect gameplay (although there are many features that could be similar to DOTA 2 to make it even better, but Valve will learn soon). Thanks to this game more and more people are joining the community of this game and we should all work so that this game, or should I say franchise becomes the best First Person Shooter series EVER!

review: Death is a great teacher. Failure in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is, as it always has been for this series, the greatest way to learn where you should have gone, what you shouldn't have done, and how you could have done better. Counter-Strike players spend a lot of time learning -- consequently, they are always getting better. Growth is an important factor in Global Offensive, especially if you're coming into Counter-Strike fresh or after a sabbatical. This is an extremely hardcore, skill-based first-person shooter, and it forces you to think differently than other modern shooters. If youre a Call of Duty player, youre going to need to change your play style to succeed here. Counter-Strike also tries developing into something new here as well, despite doing little to push itself beyond what its always done best. Global Offensive modifies old maps to keep veterans on their toes, and introduces official new modes that encourage different play styles for the first time in almost 15 years. For the uninitiated, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a small-scale, team-based first-person shooter with permanent death. When a counter-terrorist kills a terrorist planting explosives in a classic Defusal match, or a CT escort swallows a sniper round in Hostage Rescue, the victim is dead for good and doesn't respawn until the next round. As such, players on both sides must exercise skill and care. The bomb objective, meanwhile, gives everyone a purpose. Of course matches end when everyone on a team is dead, but a clever and coordinated terrorist team will give the CTs the slip, plant their bomb, and protect the bomb site. Between rounds, everyone spends earned cash on better gear and guns, and the cycle continues. Pieces of the Counter-Strike formula are dated at this point, but the superb heart and soul of Global Offensive is timeless. Teams are small, guns are lethal, and rounds are short. There's an addictive just-one-more-round quality to it, because there's a constant desire to do better than last time, to earn a satisfying kill, or to win in a new way. Call of Duty and Battlefield vets will wonder why they can't sprint to escape enemy fire or look down the iron sights to improve aim; Counter-Strike players will feel like they walked into their redecorated home. Certain map redesigns will catch hardcore fans off guard, but the changes are for the best -- the underpass choke point in de_dust, for instance, has a new escape route. Even in the face of genre evolution, Global Offensive doesnt care to adapt. CSGO is so dedicated to Counter-Strike's aging ideals despite market and trend changes that it brute-forces its way to success. Part of what makes it such an engaging competitive game is that killing in Global Offensive requires a wholly different skill set than other shooters. Everyone is limited to what they have and can see, with little room for character modification or on-the-fly advantages. Running and gunning is a useless play style, even if you've bought a helmet and kevlar that round, to the point that someone standing still is more likely to score the kill. Walking, crouching, or standing are your best bets to reduce the inaccurate spray of machine-gun fire Consequently, killing in Global Offensive feels good. There's a sickening sensation to dropping someone dead because you know they're not coming back. It's also satisfying knowing you used limited resources to play smarter than your victim. If players aren't watching corners, providing covering fire, or using smoke grenades and flashbangs, they're more likely to take a headshot from a more delicate and patient triggerman. The desire to experience that distinct feeling is a strong motivator to keep playing, even when you're getting steamrolled by an obviously better team. If you've played Counter-Strike before, Global Offensive probably sounds a whole lot like Counter-Strike. Like Counter-Strike: Source before it, Global Offensive exists simply to modernize the look of the classic competitive shooter, while doing little to disrupt the core form and function. At the same time, it does enough to color outside the lines of tradition to justify your time and effort. Fire is one of the most interesting new combat variables. Molotov cocktails and incendiary grenades either roast groups of guys or force them in another direction. Flames are a useful distraction or scare tactic, too. They're particularly useful during Demolition matches, which focus the fight at a single bomb site rather than giving terrorists two to pick between. The new and modified maps in this mode aren't as big as classic Counter-Strike arenas  entire sections have been cut off to direct teams toward a central location  but their thoughtful design is as intricate as ever. The Lake map is a standout -- there's a wide open yet densely populated yard around the bomb site, which is inside a sizable lakeside home with plenty of vantage points and hiding spots. To separate Demolition from Defusal, players can't buy between rounds. Instead, it takes a cue from the other new mode, Arms Race, in which each kill unlocks another weapon instantly. The better you do, the more you have to switch up the way you play, and because Demolition is so fast you'll need to be quick on your feet.

review: I'll just be straight-forward with this; this game is for ones who enjoy FPS, Counter-Strike games, and PvP. If you are one that doesnt enjoy those things then this game isn't for you. You will be faced with a lot of frustration and will regret purchasing this game. Now for those that do enjoy those things stated before, this game has better graphics than the previous CS games, intense competitive FPS matches, remakes of nostaligic classic CS maps, and new fun casual game modes like arms race. So yes, I will recommend this game, for those that love FPS.

review: Death is a great teacher. Failure in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is, as it always has been for this series, the greatest way to learn where you should have gone, what you shouldn't have done, and how you could have done better. Counter-Strike players spend a lot of time learning -- consequently, they are always getting better. Growth is an important factor in Global Offensive, especially if you're coming into Counter-Strike fresh or after a sabbatical. This is an extremely hardcore, skill-based first-person shooter, and it forces you to think differently than other modern shooters. If youre a Call of Duty player, youre going to need to change your play style to succeed here. Counter-Strike also tries developing into something new here as well, despite doing little to push itself beyond what its always done best. Global Offensive modifies old maps to keep veterans on their toes, and introduces official new modes that encourage different play styles for the first time in almost 15 years. For the uninitiated, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a small-scale, team-based first-person shooter with permanent death. When a counter-terrorist kills a terrorist planting explosives in a classic Defusal match, or a CT escort swallows a sniper round in Hostage Rescue, the victim is dead for good and doesn't respawn until the next round. As such, players on both sides must exercise skill and care. The bomb objective, meanwhile, gives everyone a purpose. Of course matches end when everyone on a team is dead, but a clever and coordinated terrorist team will give the CTs the slip, plant their bomb, and protect the bomb site. Between rounds, everyone spends earned cash on better gear and guns, and the cycle continues. Pieces of the Counter-Strike formula are dated at this point, but the superb heart and soul of Global Offensive is timeless. Teams are small, guns are lethal, and rounds are short. There's an addictive just-one-more-round quality to it, because there's a constant desire to do better than last time, to earn a satisfying kill, or to win in a new way. Call of Duty and Battlefield vets will wonder why they can't sprint to escape enemy fire or look down the iron sights to improve aim; Counter-Strike players will feel like they walked into their redecorated home. Certain map redesigns will catch hardcore fans off guard, but the changes are for the best -- the underpass choke point in de_dust, for instance, has a new escape route. Even in the face of genre evolution, Global Offensive doesnt care to adapt. CSGO is so dedicated to Counter-Strike's aging ideals despite market and trend changes that it brute-forces its way to success. Part of what makes it such an engaging competitive game is that killing in Global Offensive requires a wholly different skill set than other shooters.

The better you do, the more you have to switch up the way you play, and because Demolition is so fast you'll need to be quick on your feet. Unlike other game types, Arms Race allows for respawns. It's the most chaotic and care-free mode in Global Offensive, with players throwing caution to the wind for the sake of climbing the kill ladder as quickly as possible. It's a shame there are only two maps in Arms Race -- a problem that will more likely persist on consoles than PC. If you have the option, playing the PC version is unquestionably the best way to experience Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. Mods, mouse and keyboard, and the usual PC-only options are better than the ports. Plus, Valve is much better about long-term PC support -- it abandoned Team Fortress 2 on consoles, and Portal 2's level editor was PC exclusive. If you prefer to play on consoles, Global Offensive is the same great game, with the following special bits:

review: I used to be an Xbox addict. But after playing this game, I have now stopped playing xbox for months. After all the years of playing COD i have finally figured out why I never had a girl friend. I was alone, played alone, lived alone, I thought it would never end... Then my friends told me about steam and after a while I found this game, Counter Strike: Global Offensive. I was excited to play it, i played it everyday NONSTOP until i felt like going to sleep. One day, I woke up and of course started playing cs go, I noticed what i have became...a csgo addict. I didn't know what to do when i was thinking of that. I quickly shut off my computer and went outside for once. I thought about what i was thinking...I decided to go back inside, still trying to get it out of my head..."a csgo addict". I started crying...I didn't know what to do. I couldn't stop playing now...I have only just begun. I looked at all the money i had left and wasted it on cs go skins. The addiction is growing. I couldn't stop it even if a tried, thats when i realized...that i have fully became a cs go addict. To this day, I'm still a cs go addict. I love cs go and will never stop playing it... 10/10 Ruined my life that i never had...

review: It's different than previous installments in the series. The recoil of the weapons is dramatic and infuriatingly unreal looking. It's very possible to almost completely miss a target standing in front of you at no more than 1 meter (gamewise meter) and deliver only one hit with the AK. The AWP for example isn't the surgical instrument of death no more. The shoot area isn't a dot (the dot in the center of your reticle) but a quite large "box". Also the physics of it seem a bit off, I cannot understand how you can be stopped from running from being hit with a smoke grenade, HE grenade, flash bang or molotov/incendiary. It is ridiculous and reminds me of the old stuck-in-the-ground with smoke launched at feet bug in Counter-Strike 1.4. I have the frustrating sensation that I am constantly playing a BETA game, a BETA I have purchased. Also lots of cheaters in Competitive matches. Competitive matches were supposed to be the bread and butter of the new series but the experience is very often destroyed by obvious cheat using players. I guess it is so easy to cheat in this game since there are lots of them. The Overwatch isn't helping much and participating in the Overwatch program ruins the faith in this program because 4 in 5 demos submited to Overwatch have players blatantly using wallhack. I guess the Overwatch can VAC ban one and while 10 more players start using it. In spite of all it has potential, it looks good and the maps, the old ones and the new ones added, are interesting and fun to play.

review: Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a first-person shooter and the next generation of Counter-Strike running on updated Source Engine and has many new features added. The gameplay is also has been revamped so even new players can play the game without much difficulty. This means slightly less weapons recoil and no need to buy weapons ammo anymore. There are many new game modes such as deathmatch, arms race and the competitive online match. There's also the new Arms Deal update where each weapons now has many skins which can be acquired when you play on VAC enabled servers in a timed based item drops or by opening a weapons case with certain bought keys. Weapons skins can be used to show off, traded or sold on Steam marketplace. You can even change your weapons name and add some description about it. You can also submit your own weapon skins or maps if you have the creativity so that maybe Valve will add it in the next game update, therefore supporting the game even further. Graphics in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive has been vastly improved. Characters model are all fresh new while retaining the same design and faction with some new faction added. The map is upgraded even better to look more realistic than ever. The new Source Engine also made the ragdoll physic effect and many effects feels more realistic. Despite all of the upgraded graphics, the game runs amazingly smooth and optimized and doesn't really need high-end system. Oh, but before you buy this or even play the game, you better be ready to throw yourself into a real hot zone out there, as the community of this game is... well... unforgiving. You either die as a noob or live long enough the get a title hacker. This is yet the best Counter-Strike game where casual and hardcore gamers can play. I recommend this. Rating 9/10

review: I really want to recommend this game. It's a more immersive shooter than any of the Call of Duty series, and the way the game is made requires logical thinking and tactical strategies to win rounds with your teammates. When the game goes well, it's buckets of fun. Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this game to newcomers. There are many reasons for this. First of all, unless you plan to mill around in deathmatch or the other lesser-played game modes (so anything but casual/competitive), you're going to die, a lot. And then you wait. You watch your uncooperative anonymous Russian teammates slowly break apart and lose the rounds in the most ludicrious fashion. If you can stand the game long enough to become half decent at it, you may find that you can often shoot someone in the head, literally tracing the bullet into their cranium, only to see that it doesn't register the hit due to the sub-standard 64 tickrate matchmaking servers and/or your West Country internet connection, thus falling victim to yet another unfair situation. If your internet connection is not the problem, you may try using ESEA or Faceit to play your competitive matches with. So you can pay more to play the game for no benefit other than to escape the crap quality of the standard servers, or faff about on Faceit, waiting for the afk team captains to pick maps, or the other team to cower away during the initial deciding knife round. After a few bad experiences, I've decided that Faceit isn't worth the hassle. Playing competitive also puts you in danger of not only numerous wallhackers, but mainly these things called smurfs. Put the image of the little happy blue creature out of your head: these are the players with a high rank on their first steam account, then make second/third/fourth accounts to play against easier opponents. It's that simple, yet it's infuriating and game-destroying for us lower ranked players. And when you discover this in a competitive game, your only choices are to stay there and endure it, gradually losing your sanity, or take a competitive ban. If you're lucky enough to have decent friends, they may just kick you from the game, sparing you of either choice. Having played almost 3 solid week's worth of the game in total, I have accumulated a wide friend group who also shares my pain, but we still play together for the social side. This is when I can recommend the game: when you've already played a lot of CS:GO and have many friends that also play the game. If you're new, and have less patience than a special forces marksman, you're going to hate this game. I hope that if you decide to play this game, you can take my advice with a pinch of salt, as I am admittedly easily riled up in the heat of the moment. However, if you too go ape, you only have yourself to blame. Also, look out for skin collecting. I've been caught by it, it saps a lot of your money, and is literally an addiction. Not a good one like being immersed in a fandom or crack cocaine: one that's ultimately utterly pointless.

review: I honestly do not like this game at all. This is my personal preference, I do not enjoy the round-based gameplay, I very much prefer jumping into a game and enjoying a no holds barred gorefest. But for all the readers out there, I'm throwing away my bias when it comes to reviewing this game! THE GOOD: The graphics for this game are very pretty. The game and everything (or mostly everything) in it has been polished greatly since the last rendition While I don't like the competitive gamemode (or casual, for that matter), I CAN acknowledge that when I DID play the game, I did feel that this gamemode really did capture the charm and tension that the other Counter-Strike games gave off. Deathmatch and Arms Race can be quite fun, using most of the Counter-Strike mechanics without the round-based gameplay that the rest of the game is so popular for THE BAD: The way the skins work make no sense. I can't understand how two people would get the same skin on the same gun, only to have one get factory new and the other battle-scarred. Personally, I feel the skins would make much more sense they would drop as factory new and deteriorate over time. Granted, it'll never work now, as it would definitely ruin the economy... The spawns in Deathmatch/Arms Race are horrible. while they've been improved over the months, I would still have an occasional issue where I'd kill one guy, only to have them respawn close by and shoot me down moments later. OVERALL: While I don't enjoy round-based gameplay, and the deathmatch spawns are too shoddy for me to truly enjoy it, I'd still really recommend the competitive gamemode to those who are really interested in that kind of thing. This game has a HUGE playerbase, so you'll never be left waiting for hours for a game! While this review gives off most of what I wanted to get across, I also wrote a slightly more detailed version over on my blog.

review: Every-time this game goes on sale something inside of me dies. Thinking ( Here comes more hackers and smurfs ) 494,368 in game right now which is the highest peak it ever reached until now. EDIT : Now its 595,439 Anyway Csgo is a great game. I mean if you don't know any of the counter-strike series thats really bad because you have to, it is the basic fps game out there. In csgo it is even more fun and much more in-depth than Counterstrike:source. More modes more maps, and matchmaking systems and customize-able skins. I'v had a few people who don't know it thinking you buy better weapons with money. Nope all players same weapons just different colors ( Skins ) Thats all But the sad part of the game is having a lot of hackers, everytime it goes on sale = more and more hackers. Well that said you can play a lot of games without encountering one and just having some fair maps. But at ( Competitive ) mode you are most likely to encounter more hackers than you can count because thats the ranked mode in the game. Anyway, My favorite Fps on steam, I Loved Source so much but after getting into Global offensive i dont see myself trying source ever again. Also in this game you get weapon drops after finishing maps ( Random drops ) so you can trade/sell on market and gain some money, I got about 89$ from selling those stuff. good for people who wants to waste all their time on an FPS and still get something out of it.

review: So Counter Strike Global Offensive (CSGO) is the latest revision of the long running Half-Life mod fps. Created by Hidden Path the game is more of a refinement towards modern day military shooters then previous instalments such cs 1.6, cscz and css. This is mainly to allow a more broaden appeal to the masses of COD and Battlefield generation. You see CS generally has always had a very hardcore user base that is highly skilled. You'd be lucky to find yourself top of your first few games as a beginner like you could do in the fore-mentioned rival franchises in competitive multiplayer. How have they achieved this and to what extent it is successful is down to personal preference. The newly included arms race and demolition modes allows for a more fast pace and tightly confined CQC mode that allows the players little to no down time unlike the traditional bomb/defuse or hostage maps that most players are familiar with. For me though these modes are not the real meat of the game and if youre an experienced player these will only be glanced over and served as a side show at before delving into the traditional modes. The inclusion of some new weapons and equipment helps to change up csgo such as the Molotov and allow for different variations of old school tactics. Most of the well know maps are available from the offset and the workshop community is as good as it gets with newly created maps, game types and weapon skins to name but a few. There is the introduction of operation payback whereby a selection of community maps are promoted and available for players for a small fee across the whole of csgo and some of these are a delight to play. So why would you choose this over css for the experienced player. I find that it adheres to the original 1.6 far more closely then css ever did. The aiming is tight and follows the recoil sprays on many of the automatic guys far more closely. There are many updates that valve and hidden path are pushing though, such as spectator mode, competition spectators i.e. Dreamhack, newly released weapon finishes through drops and crate drops and newly revised maps being released mirage and cobble to name but a few. For me the main reason for this instalment above all others if the great competitive mode. Ranked csgo was never really available unless you sign up to a league such as ED, played pcws or cups. Now however with competitive mode 5vs5 ranked games are a blast if not for a few small problems that really need to be ironed out. These include dropped players being replaced by bots, hacking and over watch submissions, uneven rank matches to name but a few. If you though take the game as it meant to be played as a highly skilled social and fun game then the latest version of this simple but vastly complex game will delight you as it has me.

review: CS: GO stands as a glowing reminder that quality game design is rewarded in longevity and variety. Valve has not only updated the shooter but has completely outclassed its contemporaries.

review: Whether you're a casual FPS gamer or a very competitive hard-core player, CS:GO is where it's at. A large variety of game modes from frantic action to tactical matches that rely on strategy as heavily as skill give this title plenty of value. There is no single player campaign, though playing with bots is always an option. CS:GO's highly polished gameplay and graphics that look fine without being too flashy let you concentrate on playing a game rather than crazy visuals. It can't be understated that the HUD stays very clean unlike most modern shooters (Battlefield and COD, I'm looking at you!). Unlike previous CS titles, GO includes a weapon drop system similar to DOTA 2 or TF2 but all weapons are skins and merely for aesthetics. You can actually sell your free weapon drops on the Steam market if you're lucky! I've personally made $30 steam bucks so far. For competitive gamers, CS:GO is one of the largest Esports in the world (and THE largest FPS). The DreamHack Winter 2013 tournament featured a prize pool of $250,000! It's easy to get started because there is a great in-game Competitive matchmaker that throws together teams of 5v5. With any internet game, you're going to meet some jerks, but I've had a great experience with the matchmaker and have made a lot of Steam friends that have taught me a lot. Don't be discouraged by the learning curve. With great effort, comes great rewards! Now GO buy it!!

review: Death is a great teacher. Failure in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is, as it always has been for this series, the greatest way to learn where you should have gone, what you shouldn't have done, and how you could have done better. Counter-Strike players spend a lot of time learning -- consequently, they are always getting better. Growth is an important factor in Global Offensive, especially if you're coming into Counter-Strike fresh or after a sabbatical. This is an extremely hardcore, skill-based first-person shooter, and it forces you to think differently than other modern shooters. If youre a Call of Duty player, youre going to need to change your play style to succeed here. Counter-Strike also tries developing into something new here as well, despite doing little to push itself beyond what its always done best. Global Offensive modifies old maps to keep veterans on their toes, and introduces official new modes that encourage different play styles for the first time in almost 15 years. For the uninitiated, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a small-scale, team-based first-person shooter with permanent death. When a counter-terrorist kills a terrorist planting explosives in a classic Defusal match, or a CT escort swallows a sniper round in Hostage Rescue, the victim is dead for good and doesn't respawn until the next round. As such, players on both sides must exercise skill and care. The bomb objective, meanwhile, gives everyone a purpose. Of course matches end when everyone on a team is dead, but a clever and coordinated terrorist team will give the CTs the slip, plant their bomb, and protect the bomb site. Between rounds, everyone spends earned cash on better gear and guns, and the cycle continues. Pieces of the Counter-Strike formula are dated at this point, but the superb heart and soul of Global Offensive is timeless. Teams are small, guns are lethal, and rounds are short. There's an addictive just-one-more-round quality to it, because there's a constant desire to do better than last time, to earn a satisfying kill, or to win in a new way. Call of Duty and Battlefield vets will wonder why they can't sprint to escape enemy fire or look down the iron sights to improve aim; Counter-Strike players will feel like they walked into their redecorated home. Certain map redesigns will catch hardcore fans off guard, but the changes are for the best -- the underpass choke point in de_dust, for instance, has a new escape route. Even in the face of genre evolution, Global Offensive doesnt care to adapt. CSGO is so dedicated to Counter-Strike's aging ideals despite market and trend changes that it brute-forces its way to success. Part of what makes it such an engaging competitive game is that killing in Global Offensive requires a wholly different skill set than other shooters. Everyone is limited to what they have and can see, with little room for character modification or on-the-fly advantages. Running and gunning is a useless play style, even if you've bought a helmet and kevlar that round, to the point that someone standing still is more likely to score the kill. Walking, crouching, or standing are your best bets to reduce the inaccurate spray of machine-gun fire. Consequently, killing in Global Offensive feels good. There's a sickening sensation to dropping someone dead because you know they're not coming back. It's also satisfying knowing you used limited resources to play smarter than your victim. If players aren't watching corners, providing covering fire, or using smoke grenades and flashbangs, they're more likely to take a headshot from a more delicate and patient triggerman. The desire to experience that distinct feeling is a strong motivator to keep playing, even when you're getting steamrolled by an obviously better team. If you've played Counter-Strike before, Global Offensive probably sounds a whole lot like Counter-Strike. Like Counter-Strike: Source before it, Global Offensive exists simply to modernize the look of the classic competitive shooter, while doing little to disrupt the core form and function. At the same time, it does enough to color outside the lines of tradition to justify your time and effort. Fire is one of the most interesting new combat variables. Molotov cocktails and incendiary grenades either roast groups of guys or force them in another direction. Flames are a useful distraction or scare tactic, too. They're particularly useful during Demolition matches, which focus the fight at a single bomb site rather than giving terrorists two to pick between. The new and modified maps in this mode aren't as big as classic Counter-Strike arenas  entire sections have been cut off to direct teams toward a central location  but their thoughtful design is as intricate as ever. The Lake map is a standout -- there's a wide open yet densely populated yard around the bomb site, which is inside a sizable lakeside home with plenty of vantage points and hiding spots. To separate Demolition from Defusal, players can't buy between rounds. Instead, it takes a cue from the other new mode, Arms Race, in which each kill unlocks another weapon instantly. The better you do, the more you have to switch up the way you play, and because Demolition is so fast you'll need to be quick on your feet.

review: Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is arguably the best game on the market. Ever. CS:GO (Counter-Strike: Global Offensive henceforth) sets new standards for FPS gaming. Guns 'n Glory (mostly Guns) CS:GO, like COD: Whatevercrap, features many guns. CS:GO features two different teams, Terrorists and Counter-Terrorists, with distinct armories. Ranging from the classic Desert Eagle, which pwns faces, to the CZ25, a freakin' auto pistol, to the SCAR-20, an AUTOMATIC SNIPER RIFLE, to the infamous AK-47, CS:GO's wide range of weapons allows for adaptable play-style (or in other words, AWP ALL THE ROUNDS). Players can even customize their own guns, naming them, stickering them and painting them with in-game skins. CS:GO also features other non-gun weaponry. Grenades are prominent in rounds, from the classic High Explosive Grenade to Flashbangs to Moltovs. Players also can utilise Kevlar Armor and Helmets, which are useful against most guns. Finally, you can tase people. Fun. Gameplay/Gamemodes Unlike CS:S and 1.6, CS:GO kicks butt with new gamemodes. Different playstyles are designed with time and experience in mind- now, those without much time can play quicker games such as Arms Race, where players compete to get a kill with every weapon. It moves on to Demolition, a "simplified" version of Classic with only one bombsite, and no freedom in what weapons the player uses. Then, we get to the big leagues, with Casual, a drop-in game style much like Competitve, but more relaxed without early-dropout penalties and free armour. Then, there's competitive. This is where it really gets fun. 5v5 teams, the Terrorists and the Counter-Terrorists, fight to the death to plant a bomb or save hostages. Competitive really brings out teamwork and strategy. Players have to buy guns and armour strategically, and winning counts. Competitve is really the crowning jewel of CS:GO. It even evens out the "unfairness" of maps, allowing both teams to play 15 rounds per side. Graphics/Performance CS:GO is not at all taxing on computers. I myself own a 2GB RAM computer, and it runs perfectly fine on lower Graphics settings. Other computers, such as that monster 16GB Alienware, can run on high setttings, beautifully visualising the different maps made by Valve and the Community. Hats? While CS:GO does not have hats (damn), it does feature weapon skins and stickers. Deck your own guns out with sick skins, whether it be as colourful as "Death By Kitty" for the P90, or as bloody serious as Crimson Web for the SCAR-20. Players can get skins by playing on VAC-secured serverts (nobody likes cheaters), unboxing Weapon Crates with Keys (think TF2), trading with other players, or buying them from the community market. Some guns are *special* (like me!), with StatTrak guns letting players count the kills acheived by the gun, or Souvenir-versions based on pro-tournaments. CS:GO also recently added stickers. Players can put stickers on their guns to show support for their favourite pro-teams, support for Eco-Rounds or dancing bannanas. Community CS:GO has an amazing community. The Steam Workshop has new skins and maps for players to try out, and in Operations, Valve adds these wondorus creations to CS:GO. In addition, there is a very supportive community online. Anybody who isn't gets an AWP to the face. Big deterrent. Overall, CS:GO is a great game. BUY IT FREAKIN' NOW!

review: Too many things are wrong in this game,movement is not smooth, awp and deagle are innacurate and not fun to play anymore, p90 and running is , flashes are not efective, nades are not accurate, limited wallbanging and  ammo limitation on M4, maps cluttered with unexpected props and corners to slow you down, certain areas are not wide enough and causes acidental TK on rushes and inability to rush fast as an whole, and the most important, recoil does not allow you to kill multiple enemies in 1 magazine in a short period of time, you are limited to short bursts and take cover, and that removes the ability to clutch rounds which was the most fun aspect in other versions. It prevents good skilled aimers from carrying a team. Also most maps are really bad unbalanced copies of CSS maps, like inferno and train, and people are forced to pay for operation passes to play extra maps in matchmaking. On the other hand there are many improvements in money and weapon balance specially on ecos, and other misc stuff like the GUI, matchmaking and de_nuke balanced, and I would rather play GO with this problems fixed than going back to 1.6 anyday, but at this moment the game is not fun anymore and gameplay is not fully oriented for competitive gameplay. I only play it because nobody plays the other versions anymore, and most people have to eat it up. This game had very low player count before the steam market update since the game was really bad, but after it many people started playing it to earn skins, so most of the players dont care about the game, they just idle for drops and watch streams to know on wich teams to bet on csgolounge, they dont actually care about the game, it is a sad truth and its clear that Hidden Path will never update this game to proper conditions.

review: In my opinion, this game is still very young and undeveloped and all the hate against russians is stupid. I mean i'm not one to talk here i hate them sometimes aswell. I realised something when i was playing one day, the game has gone trough a lot of changes and that it was slowly turning into a moba like game, where rank is more importand than having fun. How valve changed CS for me made me yonder and ponder from the time when i was playing CS 1.6 or CSS. Back then there where no rankings nor matchmaking and the servers where flooded with ads. I really hate how people neglect the times when people were fun to play with. Now people only care about how big your rank is, and how expensive your skins are. Where are the good old times? To me this game is a mess because of the ranking system and i mustn't recommend it for players from CS 1.6 OR CSS. Sure there are different mods, but people mostly play competitive and try to force their rank down your throat.

review: This game was the best tactical game I had ever played. The community was good, people were mature, sportsmanship was very well presented. But all of that changed when the skins came. The community of Counter Strike that we knew and loved got shattered in an instant. This community is turning into TF2 but instead of hats it is skins. It's a pathetic excuse from valve to build an economy to make more money off of virtual items. Really valve? You are turning this game into TF2 and it's a joke. More immature underage children are playing this game now and I don't like and I am certain that I am not the only one who thinks this way. First off, the community now is a disgrace. You could be playing with someone, become really good friends with them and then they ask for one of your good skins to "borrow". BAM! Skins stolen and your hard work has meant nothing. It increases the scamming within this steam community. Second, the competitive mode is great. It is challenging and very teamwork based, but all that can change with a steam sale. Hackers banned? Well then let's price Counter Strike: Global Offensive to 3.50. Oh boy that was a good idea right? A steam sale on this game is not only hurting us but steam as well. People also buy Counter Strike: Global Offensive on a different account, so that means if you are a low rank in competitive not only are you against a higher rank but you are also at a high chance to lose. It's a complete and utter disaster when it happens. It needs to end. Thirdly, Cases are ridiculous. You literally have a 0.01% chance to get a "Rare special item" (Knife). People waste so much money on cases when at the end of the day it's a "Virtual Item". You could go out and buy a real knife for about 50 at highest while the highest in this game is about 600. The economy is terrible. Community is terrible. Skins are a joke and Steam are probably laughing at you as you go out and waste money on cases. Fourthly and lastly is the, "Hit Detection". This game has a pretty bad hit detection system. Valve could go out and buy 124 tick servers but nope! they go out and be cheapskates and buy 64 tick servers which is god awful. I mean Valve, Come on! You make millions of  and $, why can't you actually just think about your game instead of how much money you take a bath in? This game is great once you get into it and "IF" you find a decent server (124 tick) it is pretty fun. One other thing I forgot to mention is when you play competitive there is a cooldown if you "leave", "Kill a teammate", "Kick too many players" or even if your power cuts during a match, you only have "3 minutes" to return to the match. Abandon the match? Ok sir we give you a 7 day ban. A ban ranges from 30 minutes to 2 hours to 24 hours to finally 7 days. It is a bit unfair the banning system. It is automatic so it cannot be revoked. Please Valve, fix your game and your community before it wrecks itself. 6/10 for Gameplay 2/10 for Skins 3/10 for Community 0/10 for Competitive Cooldown

review: Initially I was very hesitant about this game; it seemed very risky to make so many fundamental changes to a formula that was barely changed through Counter-Strike: Source and Condition Zero. However, seeing how much Valve has listened and continues to listen the community, and how quickly they make changes in both the short and long term, it has completely restored my faith in the game. Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is incredibly fun and feature-rich, with plenty to do for both casual and competitive players. On top of this, there is also plenty of ways to promote and support eSports, which is a much-needed and fundamental step in reinvigorating Counter-Strike in the competitive gaming scene. However, the most important thing with this game is that the community is incredibly nice and friendly - and with a game as difficult and intense as Counter-Strike, it's extremely welcoming. Good stuff!

review: Great true Counter-Strike-like competitive feeling in this latest addition to CS games. It has most of the elements from the older CS games (1.6 and Source) but with updated visuals, weapon skins and stickers, matchmaking system and a goal to unite the two different Counter-Strike communitites: CS1.6 and CSS. This game does that pretty well having a lot of the good old content but still a lot of new stuff to discover. + + Easy to use Matchmaking system. + Updated content (some new weapons that were not in CS1.6 or CSS and new versions of all the classic maps) + Overwatch is a great way to get the community involved in banning cheaters but it's not perfect system (not at all) A lot of important information about the match is not available for overwatchers and in order to get ow you need to win 150 matchmaking games and have a rank at atleast Gold Nova 1. Players on that level are usually not good enough to judge is someone is cheating or not and some more suspicious cases may get more votes on "Evidence beyond reasonable doubt" even when no cheating is involved. + Skins and stickers. These things keep a lot more casual players playing the game and gives the more competitive ones new and exiting content in the game after playing the game for thousands of hours. + Operations that make people play the new maps and all the available official gamemodes makes the game to have more content (operations are usually pretty cheap ~5 containing usually 5 or more maps that can be played on Valves official servers and some kind of scoreboard that keeps track of your matchmaking stats like kills, headshot % and matches won) + Big professional tournamets mainly funded by the community. You buy a certain key to open a weapon case (Esport key in this case is the one that supports electronic sports) and a portion of the money goes towards these tournamets. These big events gather a lot of Counter-Strike people together watching the games and having some great entertainment. When the professional scene does well the game itself attracts more people playing it. + Game gets updated really often compared to many other multiplayer shooters. Sometimes there can be updates every week some of them being quite major. Valve even listens to the community sometimes to make the game even better and more enjoyable. (Obviously they want to hear what the pros have to say about the current state of the game) - - Lots of hackers playing in the higher rankings in matchmaking. As Valve killed boosting in its known form most cheaters are just the one who want get to those highest ranks. Still some boosting appears to be seen even tho it doesn't work like that anymore. - Matchmaking system is quite broken. Rankings don't show the true skill and ability to play as a team but it still serves the purpose. MM being 64 tick is the main problem or atleast thats what the community says when it comes to the system itself. Most players would still pick hackers over low tickrate if it was about matchmaking as whole. The problem around this is that to be able to get any advantage of 128 tick your game needs to run at atleast that 128 fps (not exatly but close to it) and according to Valve greatly over half of the players have an average fps of 30 or less. Thats not enough to get any advantage of high tickrate servers. Another proble with matchmaking is that sometimes it puts higher ranks against lower ones which is not equal at all and usually results in a slaughter of either side. Balance just sometimes isn't there. - Bad behaviour among many players makes some matchmaking games really feel like you'd like to punch somebody. People that refuse to use teamwork or communicate are even worse than bad behaving ones when you want/need to win games. - Valve has a weird way of updating something (like buffing a weapon) without any testing if it will actually work like it was supposed to. This has lead to CZ-75, AUG buff, the insane Tec-9 buff and a lot more weird but sometimes even funny updates. Still a little bit of testing on the field wouldn't hurt anyone. All in all I would totally recommend this game for everyone! Even if it may seem difficult at first you can only get better by learning and playing. For me it has been quite 4.5/5 experience so far so if you have the will give it a go!

review: Standart Counter-Strike, with altered graphics. Added a lot of trash on the cards, machine, drums, and more. In some maps, the light falls so that it becomes impossible to watch. Physics has become even more disgusting. Particularly noticeable shooting Deagle. Played since closed beta test, nothing has changed after the release, with the exception of a couple of buttons on top (Show matches, Achievements, Inventory) Fairly well made selection matches conveniently find any game on the official server with good ping. (As there is not official server). In general, play nice, if you spend a lot of time to learn how to shoot. Overall CS and should be such for a given time. 9/10

review: The FUTURE of competitive gaming. I expect to see every family playing counter strike together within the decade. Families gathered around the telescreen, waiting for that last final clutch. The father fires one shot from his polished AK, it's wooden gloss glinting in the sun of the map of the year. The shot rings out, from the speakers of the telescreen. In that moment, the son contemplates his life's future. He sees a happy family playing by a white picket fence, his arm around his young wife's waist as they plant the "SOLD" sign on the front lawn. The daughter sees her prince charming, as they walk down the aisle together into an endless union of love. The father sees his glory days from college, the boys in his frat, and the touchdown pass he made his senior year. The mother sees herself with the young football star she fell in love with, two young mavericks against the world. The shot hits home, the match is won. The family hugs, their joy clearly visible together. They climb the stairs to bed, and prepare for tomorrow's activities. Tonight was just another normal night, but together they've all experienced something they'll never forget together. As you lay in bed this night, picture that scene in your mind's eye. You, your happy family all gathered to enjoy the future of competitive gaming. That's what Counter Strike Global Offensive was made for.

review: It doesn't matter how good you are any more, you will be judged solely on the market value of your inventory. You should have one of your several Karambit knives equipped at all times and inspect it in game whenever possible to ensure that anybody who is spectating you is aware that you are aware you're being watched and you are absolutely showing off that extremely pricey knife you own. Your stats are irrelevant now, most people aren't even aware that the 'Tab' key actually has a function in game. It doesn't matter if you don't know what 'eco' means. Fuck team work. You have a 'BOOM' AWP in your inventory, as long as you have $4750 cash in game you're buying an AWP. You will mock anyone who decided to give their Nova the 'Walnut' skin. Same goes for people who give their FAMAS the 'Doomkitty' skin. You will only equip 'StatTrak' weapons and the first thing you do when you acquire one is go on an idle server and get several hundred kills on AFK players in order to pad the stats so you don't look like a total n00b. Whenever a new case is released you will buy as many cases and keys as it takes in order to acquire 'an Exceedingly Rare Special Item!' Disregard the fact that you will end up spending three times as much as you otherwise would've by buying this directly from the market, it's only your parents' money after all. Besides, your birthday is next month and Christmas/Easter/[insert public holiday here] is just around the corner so you won't have to wait too long before you can blow more of their money on digital goods. You will also plaster ever single skin you own with multiple unseemly stickers with the intention of creating a unique skin for your weapon. Your 'Easy Peasy' and 'Ninjas in Pyjamas' stickers totally don't look ridiculous whatsoever. You will also name tag all of your weapons in order to add that final personal touch to the weapon you invested so much time and money in. You don't own an AK or an M4 any more, you only own weapons with names like 'xXx OG Snoop Dogg' and 'dubstep warrior'. You now have all the knowledge required to start playing CS:GO. Go forth and procure many skins of great value.

review: Revan was only 23 years old. He loved CS:GO so much. He had most of the achievements and items. He prayed to Gaben every night before bed, thanking him for the inventory he's been given. "CS:GO is love," he says, "CS:GO is life." His elder Dragon hears him and calls him a silver scrublord. He knows his elder is just jealous of his son's devotion to Gabe. He calls him a console peasant. He slaps him and sends him to sleep. He's crying now and his face hurts. He lays in bed, and it's really cold. He feels a warmth moving towards him. He looks up. It's Gabe! He's so happy, Gabe whispers into Revan's ear, "Try your chances... Open a case." Gaben grabs Revan with his powerful dev-team hands and puts him on his hands and knees. He's ready. Revan opens his pockets for Gabe. Gabe puts his hands deep into Revan's pockets. It costs so much, but Revan does it for CS:GO. Revan can feel his wallet emptying as his eyes start to water. He accepts the terms and conditions. Revan wants to please Gabe. Gaben lets out a mighty roar as he fills Revan's computer with keys. Revan opens all the cases and gets nothing worth anything at all.

review: Focusing on the quality of servers, my experience has been a 5/10 satisfaction with them. Even though my connection is less than 50 ping, with minimal packet loss, choke, and "var", I have often not been able to kill someone point blank with a FULL clip. Now you might say I'm just "bad" but I've been playing this game for almost 2 months(Yes that's more than 1400 hours!), and the game's physics are like my third hand by now. This is just outrageous that the official valve competitive servers can be this bad. You're better off playing on 3rd party leagues such as ESEA, that have decent servers, and more often than not, cooperative teammates. Moreover, the competitive servers are full of edgy, underaged players who talk down to the opposing team aswell as their own, regardless of your skill. There is an option to mute other players but that just ruins the entire point of the game if you can't communicate with your own team in order to fabricate a strategy to win the round. Nevertheless, that's bound to happen in any game, but its been on the rise on CSGO servers since its debut in August 2012.

review: Ah Counter-Strike. What a wild mistress you are. At times you are loving and caring, offering great joy and hope. Then other times you are mad at me for reasons I do not understand and you cast me out; alone and unloved. First off, let me quickly say that the game mechanics are great. Every gun handles differently and you have to learn each one. It takes skill and practice and makes the game so much more rewarding. As a side note however, it's a bit irritating when you can only see a guys head (i.e, the gun is hidden behind a wall or something) and they can still shoot you. But I digress! So in this game you have a few different modes that you can play, and each one has a very different play style. For instance, in Arms Race, there is no time to be subtle. You need to get 27 kills before the next guy, and you have to do this with every weapon in the game. As soon as you kill someone, your weapon switches out. This can be annoying if you're fighting several people at once, but the game is so fast paced that it really doesn't matter if you die. Instantly respawn and rush back into the field. The speed of this game makes it great for some community banter. You play in a team, but as you are really only playing for yourself, it doesn't matter if your team are doing well or not. I'll come back to this point about teams later. Team Deathmatch is a fairly standard affair if you are familiar with any other FPS game. People spawn in and you have to kill them before they kill you. Simples! As this game mode is slower than Arms Race, you can afford to be a bit more patient. There is a timer instead of a "reach this many points/kills." Also, every now and then a bonus weapon appears, in which you'll get more points if you kill people with that. Respawn with this weapon and kill people within the time limit and you'll bag yourself some extra points. Person with the most points at the end wins. Again, this is a mostly light hearted game mode, and the community really shines through. Next up is Demolition, my least favourite mode. It is much the same as the casual/competitive maps in which you have to try and plant a bomb, but the maps are smaller. The main difference in this game mode is you don't get to choose your gun. You start with a weapon and then when you kill someone in a round you change weapon at the start of the next round. Kill several people and you will be awarded with some grenades as well. The reason I dislike this mode is people can get out of sync with the weapons. If you do really well for several rounds, likelihood is you will now be on a weaker gun, or a gun you cannot personally use well. While it's good to get practice in, the realisation is that the other team can simply be on better weapons, leaving you at a major disadvantage. Again, after a few rounds they may be on a gun that they can't use and it levels the playing field again, but those few rounds can really be an irritant. Now we are onto the meat and two veg. The bit the mistress both loves and despises. Competitive. In my time playing CS I have went from an absolutely horrendous player, having never really played many FPS's, to a fairly competent player. Over the space of a few months I went from unranked up to Master Guardian 1. I felt very proud of myself. However, the journey was not plain sailing. When entering a competitive mode, if you are not searching with friends, you can end up with wildly different experiences. This is where the community behind CS can really fall apart. In a match with strangers you can have a great match with excellent communication (which is really needed in competitive) or have really bad communication and a lot of name calling. If you make a mistake, sometimes you will be supported with a lot of "Unlucky, we'll get them next time!" or you will receive something along the lines of "OMG, YOU SUCK, NOOB, FFS, UNINSTALL." This is particularly true if you're the last one left alive and all eyes are watching you. This isn't just from your team however. I have had games where I have had great communication with the opposition, and everything has been really friendly, but well fought. Othertimes however, they are raging across the keyboard at you. Yes, you can mute players, and often you may have to mute the opposition, but it is quite another to mute your team. As I said, communication is really important in a competitive match. Even if they are only yelling obscenities at you, they may occasionally have insight into where a player is. A main problem for this is it doesn't even matter if you are winning or losing. Your team could just be massively unhelpful. I have had a lot of fun playing competitive matches, however as time goes on it is becoming less and less fun. This could be because of all the steam sales, with people buying the game and jumping on just to be irritating. Maybe they had been banned previously and have made new accounts or some such thing. It just doesn't make for pleasant gaming however. I don't play games to become annoyed and irritated. I play them as a release. There is nothing more satisfying than doing something well. I remember playing a game on inferno as the terrorist and I had went up B. I was to push up and give them a fright while my team was to go up A. As I went up Banana, two guys came down to me. I headshotted them both. It was then that my team were shouting down the headsets. They had lost the bomb at top of middle. Only one team member had survived. He went to try and get the bomb and was instantly killed. I was on my own with 3 opponents left. I turned back round at banana and went up middle. Two were coming towards me and I take them out. Sadly, I was down to 12 health now, and the clock was ticking. I knew that the last guy was up on the left at top of middle. So I went through appartments silently. As luck would have it, a team mate of mine had a smoke grenade that had dropped there. I threw the smoke into top of middle and as it burst out I went for the bomb, with 30 seconds left to plant. The final enemy started spraying into the smoke and I knew where he was. I shot once and killed him, acing the round (or kill every enemey yourself). I've had aces before, but that one was special. My teammates errupted with cheers, as that was a very important round for us. Had we lost we would have had to eco (which is to not buy so you can save some money). It was those cheers and the great support that my team gave me that makes me love this game. The community can be incredible. A quick note about casual is that it is pretty much identical to competitive, except with more players and thus less strategy and communication. Instead of only talking to your team, you are often talking to everyone in the game. The same issues with the community stand however. Sometimes they do a "clutch or kick" where the last surviving member of a team has to kill all the surviving members of the other team and win the round. This can be damn near impossible if your team didn't manage to do anything. This is often said when it's 5v1 or over. Often the community doesn't really kick the person, but I have seen it happen. I have also seen someone clutch a 6v1 and then got kicked regardless. So it's a bit of a hit and miss. Overall, I would highly recommend this game. The mechanics are solid and the community as a whole is really great. The support people give is wonderful. Often there is great banter to be had in the non-ranked matches. Sometimes banter can come into the ranked matches, but more and more of late it has just been abuse. If you want to try your hand at competitive you will need a thick skin.

review: The third game of the famous Counter-Strike franchise. The graphics in CS:GO are amazing , as well as the gameplay. This version includes more gamemode to play , weapon drops and weapon skinning (making weapon skins for Valve to add by submiting them on CS:GO's workshop.), its also a good way to make some profit for your Steam Wallet. You can do that by simply playing and selling your drops on the Steam Community Market. However if you plan on quiting durring a competetive match , its not recommended. You'll be given a few bans and after that every single quit will lead up to a 7 Day ban. CS:GO is like Counter-Strike combined with Team Fortress 2. It's a title that deserves the money. TL;DR I've invested too much to fall back now.

review: Human immunodeficiency virus infection / acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) is a disease of the human immune system caused by infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).[1] During the initial infection, a person may experience a brief period of influenza-like illness. This is typically followed by a prolonged period without symptoms. As the illness progresses, it interferes more and more with the immune system, making the person much more likely to get infections, including opportunistic infections and tumors that do not usually affect people who have working immune systems. HIV is transmitted primarily via unprotected sexual intercourse (including anal and oral sex), contaminated blood transfusions, hypodermic needles, and from mother to child during pregnancy, delivery, or breastfeeding.[2] Some bodily fluids, such as saliva and tears, do not transmit HIV.[3] Prevention of HIV infection, primarily through safe sex and needle-exchange programs, is a key strategy to control the spread of the disease. There is no cure or vaccine; however, antiretroviral treatment can slow the course of the disease and may lead to a near-normal life expectancy. While antiretroviral treatment reduces the risk of death and complications from the disease, these medications are expensive and have side effects. Without treatment, the average survival time after infection with HIV is estimated to be 9 to 11 years, depending on the HIV subtype.[4]

review: Best Game I have Ever Played! And yes I have played that many hours don't judge me :~:. I just love how this game is designed from it's looks to its sounds, I have never heard any sounds like this having alot of bass in them. Sound is your best friend unless you want to get shot in the back of the head with an AK-47. And yet I thought this game couldn't get any better but Valve is still putting out updates for it including skins for your weapons to add that little extra dazzle to them while you deal some heavy damage to those damn terrorists. It also includes a competitive mode and ranking system if you ever want to play a serious game, but beware, most of these people in competitives aren't very nice no matter what you do, however, you may run into a few polite ones along your journey. And even better! When you shoot a chicken they EXPLODE. They also like to dress up into ghosts and reindeers in holiday events! If you ever have a spare $15 PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PICK UP THIS GAME! Plus you can get some extra money from selling those skins for a few dollars ;D. Now please hurry the frick up and BUY THIS GAME 20/10! (Edited paragraphs after dashed line) ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Well now i'm back to this review and oh god can I even begin to tell you how many updates they have put out since I have posted this? They now have a workshop in which you can make you're own camo's/skins to be picked by Valve to be put into this awesome masterpiece (Although, it is a bit complicating). This game is probably the most realistic game out there (next to Insurgency). It's nothing like ing COD where all you have is 10 year old trollers. You actually find people who are willing to help out AS A TEAM. Now I know i'm rambling, but stick with me, i'm gonna put pro's and cons in. Pros:- Quite realistic Can make some extra money Long lasting gameplay Competitive gamemode (ranked) Demolition An awesome arrange of guns Constantly gets updated. Cons:- People aren't always the nicest. Griefers. Well I think that is all I can add to this review apart that it is ic. Pick it up now.

review: This is a great addition to the CS series. The maps look fresh, the models are great, and the gameplay is as tight as ever. The competitive mode offers a very quick way to find (relatively) balanced matches. One drawback though is the frame-rate issues the Arms Deal update has introduced, which many are experiencing and Valve don't really seem to be looking to fix any time soon.

review: First off : I am glad to say that it is nice that Valve gave me something that I can love and waste more time on than someone who loves making molasses, I still can't help feeling: HL3 ??? SHORT VERSION : Great, gameplay is great. Matchmaking is okayish? The weapon skins are also a nice touch but creates a gambling styled addiction among some players to get and open more and more cases. Hackers exist but few and far between generally. Worth astrnomical value on sale even for -33% or -20%. Frankly, it's price is perfect. You don't have to grasp your head around everything at once but it is fun all the same. With the obvious outta the way, this game is great. I can't possibly hate on it when I fail at it and I can't possibly not dance around in joy when I win. It's a fun action FPS once you practice well enough but beyond that is it very tactical. I love how you cannot aim down iron sights in this game seeing as every other game has used that as an excuse for you having such big wavy arm muscles you HAVE to be as accurate as the death star's laser when firing 300 rounds per minute. Instead it forces you to adapt and learn to fire a gun accurately to the point where you can fire the M4 or AK47 30 rounds per clip without spraying once and instead firing each shot individually but more importantly accurately. The gameplay is superb in this way. The game mode's are great but nothing particullarly rivals the Competitive mode which has you challenged so well that it adds to the fun. Arms Race is a great way to practice for beginners and I played it so much having very little time in the day (only a half hour or hour) and being unable to play Competitive that I can easily get to atleast 20 kills in a match of Arms Race or even win within 3 matches (often being the first however). Ever since then I got alot more free time that I had the liberty of playing competitive again! Matches have a nice 2 minute system where after that the defending team wins. Hurray, I can now kill usually between 15-20 people in a match on a good day. I think my record was something like 36 or 34. Good times... Valve really put alot of care into this because they always do. They play tested the crap out of and you can tell this in any Valve game be it Left 4 Dead, Half Life or Team Fortress 2. (Oddly enough, all of those sequels end on 2...) And though this might be the 4th or something, maybe 5th Counter Strike game beginning with the mod, going 1.6, CS Condition Zero/Deleted Scenes, CS Source and Counter Strike Global Offensive it only feels to have gotten much, much better over time. This apparently united the rival forces of 1.6 players and CSS players into one happy community. Hey, I can't argue that Valve put time into this and to speak of it's price tag DURING a sale like Summer or Christmas is astronomical in value. I bought it for 3.50, didn't play it on my old PC since it was crap and couldn't run it, didn't like it at first and kept with GMOD but eventually my friends forced me to get into it. It's use of rounds as opposed to RUN AND GUN mechanics is great. It forces the player to learn the enemy to win if challenged and also to learn themselves to play better and allows the player to be brought up into the game easier. At first the game may seem daunting and frustrating but past that is spectacullarly great. People new to the franchise tend to begin without thought, run and gun that sorta thing however over time you begin to learn to think tactically. I recommend the use of Flashbang and Smoke Grenades as soon as possible as it will save your life. Literally. The game rewards skill and intelligence and unlike other FPSes where the biggest, scariest and most famous gun wins, this has the holy grail of gameplay's as the only thing that matters is skill. And luck, but you can't control that so leave it be! However, there are some issues I have with the game. I have the problem of hackers occuring on lower ranked matches with my friends. I don't understand why anyone would cheat but in this game, where you get the glory of winning by being the smartest I really can't wrap my mind around it. The matchmaking is generally good though. You are put into ranks according to your skill after 10 matches. This allows fair and equal matchmaking generally. You will get into the odd circumstance where you play against very high ranking players like Gold Nova 2's and so on but this isn't ever a problem because with your brain you can find way's around them and how to win. Maps have the issue of being favourable to one team but once you are skilled enough, it means nothing but most people tend to play on maps that are familiar and work for them. I prefer nuke and dust and it is a shame that I just can't enjoy every map equally. Openning cases can create a gambling like addiction in rare cases but I do love how it affects : Nothing, it just maps your crappy looking HD M4A4 into something cool. Stattrak is also pretty nice but I do not like how it is built to give you something crap before something good. Still, I like how everything can we sold on the marketplace for money to put to MORE STEAM GAMES, can't argue. All in all, this game is more fun than a dolphin dancing around a dragon statue worshipping its new fake god. If I had to rate it, i'd say 9/10 for the lack of good maps like Dust II and occassional hackers but everything else is perfect. I recommend buying this game all the way. DO NOT HESITATE!

review: You finally arrive in a deserted place ridden with crime and corruption, No civilians in sight. The sun hurts your eyes and you feel disorientated and wheezy. Its been a long trip, you're tired. You need your rest, you have to be up early in the morning for your first mission. After a restless night you get up and already miss your wife and kids, that could have been the last time you ever saw them. Kiss the photo with your kid on it, don't tear up in front of all the other soldiers. It'll be okay, your loving kid gave you a picture before you left, look at it and smile, keep it in pocket for good luck. Mission is starting soon. You're all geared out and ready to dispatch. Mission starts and your legs are shaking. It'll be okay, it'll be okay. You and your comrade are instructed to flank them, already hearing gunshots and screams elsewhere, sweat dripping off your nose. You teammate goes round the corner, you hear him scream and he gets sprayed down, his body falls over, his eyes wide open, you're stunned and unable to move, his unemotional face staring blankly at you. Your team aren't talking to you, they must have gone. You have no choice but to push forward. Dreading walking around that corner, don't know how many people are behind it. You finally push round the corner and... ING AWPED, THIS GAME IS SO ! >Limp Bizkit has abandoned the match and received a 24 hour competitive matchmaking cooldown.

review: It's important to appreciate games like this for what they are, and this game is a callback to a past chapter of video game history that's been buffed and polished. And unfortunately as someone who never actually played the original Counter-Strike games, I'm not in much of a position to judge exactly how well they pulled this off. Basically, it entirely boils down to the kind of person you are. If you're a die-hard Counter-Strike fan, then this is probably all you can ask for. If you're a more typical gamer who just finished playing Crysis or Battlefield and wants to pick up something to play over the weekend, then trust me when I say that this is NOT the game for you. It's the online FPS equivilent of Dark Souls, in a way.

review: I've spent exactly 1.2k hours playing this game in all my accounts , i've found that this game is the best FPS game you can ever play. And here's why : First of all , you need some skills to play this game correctly , and when you get enough skills , you'll get more fun and more fun! Second , if you play this game with your friends , you'll get into it faster than playing SOLO , so its more fun with your friends instead of playing with randoms , then u'll try to be more better especially if you find a decent mates-team that plays with you , you'll start looking for some strats , then you'll play it more like serious. Third , for graphics , i dont really care about any game's graphics when its fun , but CS:GO's graphics are decent so there is no reason to complain about it. 4th , its gameplay , that every COD player complains about it. especially 'recoil' its really hard to control it but that's the the game you need to practice with your recoil , and try to find out the best settings you can play with. And there is alot of good things about this amazing game but sadly i cannot write them all in one review . And there is some bad things about this game , like after every update some people start getting some weird lags , i think they need to fix it , and if you're looking to play this game more serious , dont play on MatchMaking servers , because its full of R_E_T_A_R_D_S and alot of trolls and its a land of AFKs , thats just made me feel mad , just go on esea , esl , leetway and so on , and one more thing , and its after about every steam sale , CS:GO become a land of cheaters , and thats just redicouless. The reason why I'm not playing much lately because I need to focus on better life decisions and many important things. Finally i hope you find this review a helpful review and thanks for reading.

review: The good points: CS:GO isn't reinventing the wheel of first person shooters. If you've played any iteration of Counter-Strike over the years, you'll find most of the content very familiar. That said, GO adds enough to keep it interesting. All of the weapons feel unique and the variety of gameplay modes will mean endless hours of entertainment. The bad points: I've been playing video games for a long time and the CS:GO community might be the worst I've ever dealt with. In addition to the run-of-the-mill trash talk, you can expect to be inundated with anti-Semitic, racist, and/or homophobic slurs (I've heard some people use all three at a time to insult other players). I don't think I've ever heard someone say something insightful on the mic in all of the matches I've played. Your best bet is to simply mute as many players as possible. All in all, a great game as long as you ignore what everyone says during a match.

review: It's important to appreciate games like this for what they are, and this game is a callback to a past chapter of video game history that's been buffed and polished. And unfortunately as someone who never actually played the original Counter-Strike games, I'm not in much of a position to judge exactly how well they pulled this off. Basically, it entirely boils down to the kind of person you are. If you're a die-hard Counter-Strike fan, then this is probably all you can ask for. If you're a more typical gamer who just finished playing Crysis or Battlefield and wants to pick up something to play over the weekend, then trust me when I say that this is NOT the game for you. It's the online FPS equivilent of Dark Souls, in a way.

review: Counter-Strike. The game that lives up to its name. So simple, yet so much fun. It could be considered the game that began competitive first-person shooters... Or at least to my knowledge, it is. And compared to the other Counter-Strike games, I gotta say... CS:GO was okay. Graphics are nice, old-school maps, and the new item drop system is a nice addition. But, now, the only reason I play it is because I'm playing it with a friend, or I just want a drop that I could sell, no matter how pathetic it would be, or I just wanna waste time. You would find it awesome at first. But, at some point, it didn't give me something CS 1.6 gave me, and still gives today - Thrill. I won't say it's bad. But, then again, your money's probably well-spent on this game on sale... Or well-spent on something else.

review: Global Offensive is the latest franchise in Counter Strike. Awesome new layout in the main menu and the same goes for the buy screen when the start of a match. After each match, the weapons that you are currently using will be load up on ammo automatically. There are several new weapons in this franchise, so...you can look forward on using all the weapons. Another thing that is new in this game will be the weapon camos, I am not 100% sure on how to get this....but from what I've heard from my friends...you can keep on playing the game until you unlock new camos in-game or you can make your own unique camos in the Counter Strike Global Offensive Workshop. There are 5 modes in this game: Demolition, Arms Race, Competitive, Casual and Deathmatch. New maps are added in the game or...you can choose to download extra new maps from the Counter Strike Global Offensive Workshop for more fun!! I recommend on buying this game when it goes on sale!

review: CoD Tetris mode! It's like CoD but without all the fun. Some people might want to lure you in by saying "CoD's fer fukkin kids bra, thissis so realtik", but standing still and shooting (not aiming god forbid) a pixel is surprisingly not as fun as it may sound. This is so realistic that a grenade doesn't kill you and a flashbang makes the screen go white, which is racist. If you're to poor to buy CoD and you don't want to resort to prostitution, I recommend buying this 1999 mod, even though 4,99$ is a bit much for "Pixel Hunt Deluxe"

Even the ones with 2k hours do cheat. Also the 90% of player with new account that play good are either smurfers or cheaters(mostly cheaters). All said, have fun.

review: Global Offensive is a new addition to the Counter Strike series. This game features a unique tactical gameplay with 2 teams. -The Counter Terrorists (CT's): Anti - Terrorist group from over the world. SAS, SWAT, FBI and the Israel Defense Force. Their objective is to rescue hostages in (cs_) maps or in (de_) maps to defend a bombsite from the terrorists. - The Terrorists (T's): Terrorists are the bad guys. They need to defend hostages from being rescued from the CT's or need to bomb bombsites that the CT's must defend. Ofcourse this Counter Strike feature new and the classic maps like de_nuke and one of the best maps : de_dust2 and also features new gamemodes like: -Arms Race an official version of one of the most populair mod gun game. Where people need to make kills with all weapons given. The first one to get a kill with the "golden knife" wins -Demolition a all new gamemode with elements of Arms Race within small demolition maps where T's need to bomb the bombsite. -Deathmatch a deathmatch on Counter Strike maps with the idea of the chaos from game like Quake 3. This game is for everyone. From Counter Strike veterans to people that are new to FPS's altough it can be hard to get started. In my opinion the best thing they added to Counter Strike is the Competetive modes. Counter Strike always was one of the most competetive games ever but you needed to find matches and a team on chatrooms like IRC, Quakenet and those sort of things. Now it doesnt matter if you have a full team or your on your one. You can always find matches like this. This is just the normal Counter Strike maps. But the gameplay changes drastically. This is a dead serious mode so this is not somewhere where you should grief or  around. This is a COMPETETIVE mode. People want to COMPETE. Prepare for battle. However you don't need to be the best in Counter Strike to play competetive mode. After 10 wins you will be set in a skill group. To this skill group you will be matched to people with almost the same skill. So you don't have to worry. The new Arms Deal update provided us with many new skins for you guns. This is a great addition. You can buy and or get weapons for free by playing the game. Also new in this series is temporary map packs like the Operation Payback and the Operation Bravo. This is a mappack that you can pickup for 5 eur's that feature the most liked custom maps on official Valve servers. No lagg and your favorite maps on stable servers. My opinion about Global Offensive is that it is the best Counter Strike. I started playing Counter Strike Source 5 years ago. I loved the gameplay and the tactics. Then Global Offensive came out and i was tought this wasn't gonna be a good game. But it proven itself. Valve did a great job with this game. Most of the things i missed on Source are there in Global Offensive. For example the competetive mode i explained before. Written by Stefan (T-Sweezy)

review: A nice game with the traditional Counter-Strike feeling, i'm not much of a reviewer, the aiming feels alot different compared to 1.6, CZ or Css. I really like the graphical design of the game and it's really fun to play with friends, i like the addition of skins in this game purely for the reason of seeing the same guns all the time can get quite boring, and for some people that likes to collect items for games but never gotten into the more heavier item games such as tf2 or other things, it can be quite nice, though of course there are the fair share of fools who believe that skins makes you imediately better, it really doesn't. But i'd recommend the game, it's kinda fun, but you can get banned if you're too good in a low skillbracket. Just saying.

But CS:GO, this game, its a really good game actually, in the start i was thinking it was bad. Well i was wrong, this game is very good, but i think its mostly for the competitive players. Btw, there is also a new game mode, demolution. If you want to play serious, you should get this instead of CSS. This game is worth the full price! 4.5/5

review: Counter-Strike is one of the biggest names in the PC gaming community, and for good reason: it revolutionized multiplayer FPS games. After the original CS hit shelves, along with 1.6 and Source, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive has set the bar even higher, and jumped over it tenfold. Sticking close to it's roots, Global Offensive employs it's famous bomb defusal and hostage mission game modes (available in both "casual" and ranked 5v5 "competetive" types), along with integrating some other fun modes, such as arms race and deathmatch. Bomb and hostage scenarios are lead by a buying system, encouraging successful kills and objectives (like planting the bomb) to aid in buying gear in the next round. Players are required to use teamwork and tactics in order to come out on top against the enemy team, and winning a game gives a sense of satisfaction unlike any other first-person shooter game I've ever experienced. If you are expecting this game to be anything like Call of Duty or Battlefield, you will be sorely disappointed. Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is an excellent addition to the CS saga, and I strongly recommend picking it up and giving it a try.

review: This game will bring you alot of fun and hours played, I've played the first counterstrike 7 years ago. I've been a Counter-Strike fan since I first tried it out. I've got a total of 4000 hours in total of all the counter-strike games combined over my 7 years of service. This game is alot of fun and the operations are really great! If you feel like you don't hit, either become a better player by training your aim and reaction, or you could switch from Valves standard 64 tick (64 updates per second) to a paid 128 tick server (Costs if you're gonna do it the pro way, some free servers for it in the server browser). This game is very cheap and on some sales (which is common), it can cost around 3. That's the price you sell one or two cases for, which drops very common! This game is updated and maintained alot. This is a very good game and I support it to 100%.

review: Counter-strikes: globals offensive is a game which has surely bucked the trend in making a new counter strikes games as they have put the AWP in TF2 instead which is a better game. my least favourite part of this new counter strikes is when i was was running down the hill at the terrorism man and i shot him first, but he shot me instead. This is like that controversy in star wars when they say 'ham shot the man first' because when georgie lucas remade the film with better actors (it's called Lord Of The Rings if you are interested in watching, the special effects are to die for and there is a talking tree which is just genius) ham solo was shot in the face and died, which made lots of people sad because he was a really good actor, especially that bit when he got frozen in the black ice stuff andhad to stand still in an uncomfortable position for a really long time. I once had a job where i was on the register at a shop and had to stand still for a really long time but i entertained myself by committing minor acts of shoplifting. Really it all just comes back to crime and if you want to be the counter terrorism guy and shoot the bad guys in the face this is the game for you. But if you are a renegade soul who just needs to see the world burn like the bad guy in that batman film who died then i would suggest a different game like Peggle.

review: Another game by the valve company, its the Counter Strike ! The game that we all should love. The competitive part of the gameplay is full with teamwork, skill and tactics, its nice that team with a leader (A guy that command his/her teamates via team chat or voice chat) will always win if they are against a team without a proper leader. Soo the teamwork in this game is very superb. All the weapons in this game is balanced, so no matter which gun you used, as long as you can used it, you can kill even an opponent with a more expensive gun than you, i see alot players with a 800$ weapon win against a players with a 5000$ weapon. And if you didn't like competitive you can have fun too with a Call of duty style team deathmatch, and free for all. Its really fun, all you need to do in this mode is to just kill the enemy, killing another players in this mode is really fun and a stress reliever. Recommended to all competitive and also casual players ! PS: You can actually earned money from this game item drop, so you can actually have fun and earned money. :D

review: Wow...This game is very repetitive! I haven't put alot of hours into it but from those hours that I've been playing, This game is very hard. It's not a bad game at all. It's just the people that play it. There's some people withover 1000hrs on it and then there's me. Only a few hours into the game. Back to my point, This game is good but it's just very fast-paced and sometimes.... unrealistic. You will get mad alot in this game. I repeat, YOU WILL GET MAD IN THIS GAME.... ALOT!! Overall, This game is great! You just have to know what you're doing. I'd give it a 10/10 but with all the rage that has happened, I'd give it an 8.5/10

review: CS:GO is currently my favorite game. No other game comes close to this one. CS:GO is a great game for casual and serious gamers. If you want to have some fun you can just join a casual match or browse the community servers for nice community made mods, like jailbreak, Hide'n'Seek or Zombie Escape. But you can also play serious games by joining competitive games. Those require 2 full teams made of 5 players. They play a full match against each other. Every single match is recorded which means you can report cheaters and other bad gamers. Cheaters get banned pretty fast in this game, sometimes they don't even last 3 hours and they account is banned. This game beats other games like Battlefield for CoD when it comes to competitive gameplay. Once you played cs:go you can't go back to them anymore because they feel like kiddy games. You can also download a lot of custom maps made by the community, Valve doesn't forces you to buy DLC's like other game publishers.

review: It doesn't matter how good you are any more, you will be judged solely on the market value of your inventory. You should have one of your several Karambit knives equipped at all times and inspect it in game whenever possible to ensure that anybody who is spectating you is aware that you are aware you're being watched and you are absolutely showing off that extremely pricey knife you own. Your stats are irrelevant now, most people aren't even aware that the 'Tab' key actually has a function in game. It doesn't matter if you don't know what 'eco' means. Fuck team work. You have a 'BOOM' AWP in your inventory, as long as you have $4750 cash in game you're buying an AWP. You will mock anyone who decided to give their Nova the 'Walnut' skin. Same goes for people who give their FAMAS the 'Doomkitty' skin. You will only equip 'StatTrak' weapons and the first thing you do when you acquire one is go on an idle server and get several hundred kills on AFK players in order to pad the stats so you don't look like a total n00b. Whenever a new case is released you will buy as many cases and keys as it takes in order to acquire 'an Exceedingly Rare Special Item!' Disregard the fact that you will end up spending three times as much as you otherwise would've by buying this directly from the market, it's only your parents' money after all. Besides, your birthday is next month and Christmas/Easter/[insert public holiday here] is just around the corner so you won't have to wait too long before you can blow more of their money on digital goods. You will also plaster ever single skin you own with multiple unseemly stickers with the intention of creating a unique skin for your weapon. Your 'Easy Peasy' and 'Ninjas in Pyjamas' stickers totally don't look ridiculous whatsoever. You will also name tag all of your weapons in order to add that final personal touch to the weapon you invested so much time and money in. You don't own an AK or an M4 any more, you only own weapons with names like 'xXx OG Snoop Dogg' and 'dubstep warrior'. You now have all the knowledge required to start playing CS:GO. Go forth and procure many skins of great value.

review: Revan was only 23 years old. He loved CS:GO so much. He had most of the achievements and items. He prayed to Gaben every night before bed, thanking him for the inventory he's been given. "CS:GO is love," he says, "CS:GO is life." His elder Dragon hears him and calls him a silver scrublord. He knows his elder is just jealous of his son's devotion to Gabe. He calls him a console peasant. He slaps him and sends him to sleep. He's crying now and his face hurts. He lays in bed, and it's really cold. He feels a warmth moving towards him. He looks up. It's Gabe! He's so happy, Gabe whispers into Revan's ear, "Try your chances... Open a case." Gaben grabs Revan with his powerful dev-team hands and puts him on his hands and knees. He's ready. Revan opens his pockets for Gabe. Gabe puts his hands deep into Revan's pockets. It costs so much, but Revan does it for CS:GO. Revan can feel his wallet emptying as his eyes start to water. He accepts the terms and conditions. Revan wants to please Gabe. Gaben lets out a mighty roar as he fills Revan's computer with keys. Revan opens all the cases and gets nothing worth anything at all.

review: A worthy update to Counter-Strike: Source, CS:GO improves upon tons of mechanics that were lack-luster, or made the game too easy to get good at in it's predecessor. I think it's clearly safe to say this game also removed the stain left in the professional Counter-Strike community after a few CAL judges made unnecessary bans to advance their teams through tournaments. It's already had almost two dozen torunaments with multiple professional 5-man teams that many may recognize from CS 1.6. This game made quick work to fix some things that were decidedly annoying in CS:S, one being the too-often consistent bullet patterns when not on a flat surface(e.g. jumping, surfing, et cetera.) Some guns have been removed(looking at you MP5, and M3.), although they have been given replacements, and are joined with other new weapons that make the game much more fresh, and keep things interesting. Overall, combining this with the skin updates that will now be regular, the game can even pay for itself within a few weeks! The features allowing you to download demos of your games, watch the pros and casual high ranks alike live, and tons of exclusives for watching tournaments not only brings up community morale, but increases the excitement of the game. You can also link your twitch account to make it all easier. Very cool. Community servers are surprisingly still full, and almost as numerous as the last 3 games, even though Competitive play has been enhanced with an ELO system, and ranks to go along with it. Like always, if you can get good at this game, you'll be good at any First Person Shooter, making it a key title to own and play. It brings a set of new graphics that are amazing to compare to the other CS games(nostlagia withstanding), made all the better because of Valve's typical work to offload Graphics Processing to the CPU when possible. For what it's worth, it hardly tolls even low-end GPUs like my current 525M, with maxed settings, and very high levels of Anti-Aliasing. I'm able to keep a minimum of 80 Frames Per Second, and average about 150. All in all, I'm pleased to say that I have over 600 hours sunk into this game, and am only about 200 hours off surpassing my CS:S playtime as of writing. Valve did an amazing job with this game, and I can't wait to see what it's successor in Source 2 will look like!

review: I am one of those  'veterans', who started playing with counter strike 1.6 (didn't have my own account by those time, though) and I have long story of 'relationship' with counter strike universe and csgo universe especially. Telling in advance - I made long way from hating csgo up to loving it. But anyway, to the point: For people, who don't know what counter strike is, and who never heard about this game before: Counter strike is unique semi-reallistic game, which is build around global opposition of different terrorist groups (somali pirates, phoenix connection, etc) and different law enforcement groups (SAS, GIGN, GSG-9, SWAT, FBI etc). Game features several rounds (from 16 up to 32, depends on a gamemode and server rules), where every player have only one life per round. As soon as round time ends, or one of the teams eliminated, round is finished. After every round players respawn and acquire a sum of money to buy a weapon and different gadgets (armor, flash and smoke grenades, etc). Game features several game modes: (classic) hostage rescue (maps with ct_prefix): Counter Terrorists must steal hostage (or any of the several hostages) from a place, secured by terrorists and bring this hostage to a safe zone. As soon as hostage is brought, or whole terrorist team eliminated, counter terrorists win. If time ends and counter terrorists did not bring hostage to a safe area, terrorists win. As soon as counter terrorist carries hostage, whone CT team gets extra 1:30 minute time to reach safe place. (classic) bomb defuse (maps with de_prefix): Terrorists must blow one of two bomb plants. Problem is, there's only one bomb per whole team. As soon as bomb carrying terrorist falls dead, another terrorist can pick the bomb and plant it at the bomb plant point. Counter terrorists can not destroy the bomb or bring it to another place, if it's fallen. As soon as bomb is planted, round time stops and to win, counter terrorists must defuse bomb. If bomb is blown, even though all terrorists are dead, terrorist team wins the round. gungame (Honestly, forgive me if I make mistake here, but it's one of the gametypes I barely played): The least teamplay addicted game type. You start with one of the weakest weapons and as soon as you kill anyone, you get new weapon. As soon as you come through all the weapons (including knife), you win the map. You instantly respawn after death. I remember there was also gungame gametype, where you had only one life, but gungame is not my cup of tea, so let's finish on this. deathmatch: Also one of the gametypes where you respawn right after death. But, unlike gungame, you choose weapon you want at the start of a new life. You should kill as many enemies, as you can. Thanks to respawn in random places of the map, fight itself reminds a messy war, where enemy can shoot you in the back (just because he respawned there) and so on. I don't normally play this gametype aswell, but if I remember right, this gametype was brought by community. Also, community made more gametypes, like zombiemod, bunnyhop (or whatever is it called) and deathrun, where you need to reach some point. Now, for people who played cs for a while. Main differences from cs 1.6 and css here are: partially new weapons, updated radio commands, updated hostage rescue mode, where you need to actually PICK UP only ONE hostage and bring him to the safe place. Weapons have changed physics, so you'll need to learn everything again. And, an old problem, which became more important duo to competative gamemode: CHEATERS! Can't say there are many cheaters, but when you meet them, whole fun is ruined. Same when you meet stupid people. As we reviewed the game (I tried to be as short as possible), I'll express my mind on it: Firstly, I hated this game. It seemed like you need to deliver like 10 hits to your enemy. It had (and it still has) changed radio commands (yes, I was one of those few people, who used radio commands), you couldn't (and still can't) choose your player model (only team, like in css beta), you had and (still have) some grenades, which, probably don't even exist (decoy and incendinary, the molotov analogue, btw molotov here bounces from the wall, wtf?), or at least I was unable to find any info about them. In hostage rescue mode, why would you need to save only ONE hostage? Why would cops leave another one behind? You couldn't place silencer on M4 and 'base ct pistol', or use flashlight and many more things which I couldn't remeber right now. With time, Valve fixed their gaps, and I came to some re-analysis of the situation: First of all let's all agree with the fact, that cs:go is, unlike css, a complete SEQUEL of an online game, so OF COURSE it should have some differences, like radio commands, weapon reballance and stuff More over, with time it turns out, you don't need to hit your enemy 10 times, it's just you moving, so THAT'S WHY you don't hit the enemy. The ballance itself is still the same: 1-6 shots, depends on what weapons do you use; Indeed, you can't use player model, but they made 5 different models for each side, so you'll have no more 3 twins, out of 5 people playing, which, actually, compensates your choice of the model. Some changes were made for the sake of ballance (talking of hostages and some weapons' accuracy) Grenades... Well, firstly, I can't say these grenades are something sci-fi like. I believe that even if they don't exist, humanity can create them, using our own technologies. Also, Valve made special inventory, where people choose skins for their weapons and after few updates they brought us some old weapons, so now, you can use old good m4a1 with silencer, just as you did in css and cs 1.6, among with USP and it's silencer and another new pistol for exchange. They also made different skins for all weapons, so you can buy any skin you like and have your weapon in unique military\funny color (though, imo, it's a bit annoying to see all colors of the rainbow on some players' weapons, just because they love colorful schemes). Talking about radio commands again, it's better using VOIP instead of them, so updating radio is not a big deal... And now, I'd say, the best part of cs:go - it's competative mode. Competative mode features only classic gamemodes. In competative mode you play 5vs5. The more wins you get, the higher your rank is, the higher your rank is, the harder opponents and better allies are met. Competative mode is where whole TACTICAL potential of a game is shown. There's no map with perfect spot, enemy can always attack from the side, so you need to coordinate with your allies to cover each other, or rush same place from different directions, to capture it, with no any losses. Here's where all weapons are needed: short range weapons are the best for ambushes behind the corner, long range weapons are the best for long distances and medium range weapons are somewhat between long and short range. Though medium range weapons are the most often used, I must admit. You can play in a party with your friends, but be ready, because game will give you more cooperated team. Of course, not everything is perfect - sometimes game gives you wrong ranks, or you meet always-raging-idiot, or, what is worse, cheater, who kills you through the wall, but all in all it's a good game. A good sequel of one of the best tactical games of the end of the 90ths. What else can I say? If you like tactical shooters and you somehow never heard of counter strike, or you are thinking of buying it or not, my advice is not to waste your time and buy this game. It's just the game you should 'understand'. Too bad that biggest part of our youth is used to judge every game comparing to call of duty and quite often misses really good tactical games.

review: Command and Strike: Global Alert is a game. This turn-based, roleplaying game combimes stealth and action not too distant to the Assassin's Creed series. Unlike the Assassin's Creed series, however, this game doesn't mess around. A risky lack of story really pays off with the powerful emphasis on coopertative puzzle solving. I'd caution new players to the Call of Strike: Global Warfare series, as the steep learning curve is somewhat of a disservice to the overall experience. However, if you can get over that curvature with ease, the experience opens up a lot of interesting rpg elements not typically seen in a third person shooter. If you're looking for a similar feel to the antiquated versions of this game but with more refined visuals, there's no reason to not pick this up. I give this real-time strategy visual novel a Snow White out of a Disney Princess.

review: This game will bring you alot of fun and hours played, I've played the first counterstrike 7 years ago. I've been a Counter-Strike fan since I first tried it out. I've got a total of 4000 hours in total of all the counter-strike games combined over my 7 years of service. This game is alot of fun and the operations are really great! If you feel like you don't hit, either become a better player by training your aim and reaction, or you could switch from Valves standard 64 tick (64 updates per second) to a paid 128 tick server (Costs if you're gonna do it the pro way, some free servers for it in the server browser). This game is very cheap and on some sales (which is common), it can cost around 3. That's the price you sell one or two cases for, which drops very common! This game is updated and maintained alot. This is a very good game and I support it to 100%.

review: Many years ago I was drafted for this war. I was in the most deadly battle you could think of. I had lost all hope of survival and my team was loseing left and right. Then in my darkest hour I saw something that inspired me to keep fighting. It was single chicken that ran by and then I was inspired to fight for my freedom and I died but then I came back into the world. I think the reason was because I had not completed what I had started, I had not shown honor to the chicken yet, but then I saw a group of chickens and thats when I saw the holy chicken the one that I had saw in my time of darkness and I talked to it and became friends with thy chicken. Soon 2 enemys saw me I was traped with no escape I only managed to kill one of them and thats when the other shot but then out of no where the holy chicken flew down and sacrificed his life so that I had time to kill the other and survive. I still think of this chicken today and how he could have left me to die...but he didnt. he sacrificed himself for me as I think of him I shed a single tear and remember the fun times we had. How on that day he changed my life and inspired me that there is still hope in this dark world. How things can get better. From that day I said to myself I will keep fighting, that I will make sure that his death was not in vain and to honor all chickens not just him! You can honor the holy chicken to. All you have to do is purchase this game and fight for the chicken and for what is right! 10/10 Would honor the chicken again.

review: HOLY CRAP THIS GAME!! Its way to different to call of duty to even compare it to that. It is the best multiplayer game ive ever played and is great for people with game sense on the fact that you know where people will be camping and you know where people will go. And it is also good for team tactics unlike some other FPS games where you just go round shooting people (Call Of Duty). 10/10 buy this game 100% worth it!!

review: I don't know what it is but CS:GO just never gets boring for me. I can play it for 20 hours straight, and I'll be loving every second of it. 440+ hrs on record in a 3 month duration and still loving it. Unlike Call of duty & Battlefield, this tactical FPS game is very unpredictable and gets hard on every rank level. I can say CS:GO is one of myaaa... you know, It's a style thing. Never liked the aug / galil so much till now. Ehh & inferno, mirage, nuke, dust and cache are all good maps. Don't queue on d2.

review: Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is one of those games i just wanna play all the time. This game is really good. The graphics are good, the gameplay are fun and the game modes are fantastic. I have been spending so much time on this wonderful game mode Competitive. Competitive is a mode where two teams are fighting against each other and the first team that wins 16 rounds win the match. You can play this game with your friends, you can play this game with yourself and you can play this game with strangers. I really don't get tired of this game, it keeps my mood up and if i don't know what to play i start CS:GO. If you don't already own this game you should be a shame because this is a MUST own. All in all you won't regret that you bought this game if you like FPS games, the CS series and games made by Valve. And here comes the best thing - Skins. You can buy several skins for your favorite guns. There is alot of skins + You get drops every week. These skins can be bought from the Community Market! Another review by Niko Bellic!

review: It's the follow-up to the groundbreaking FPS series "Counter-Strike". And it's brilliant. Counter-Strike: Global Offensive retains the same classic feeling of Counter-Strike and does it while strutting it's stuff. I can remember playing Counter-Strike 1.6 when I was but a small child, and I still have fond memories of it. The graphics feel appropriate, and I love the art style. The fandom for this game still grows strong today, and I can't imagine the funds that it's raised for Valve & it's employees. Good job, guys. Hopefully there may be more to come in the series.

review: Yes. There was this one game I fondly remember where our team was down 14-1 at the half. I discarded my attire to let my testicles breathe and my pen1s immediately started getting more and more erect, ultimately reaching a phallic state and with each kill 0rgasmic pulsations would run throughout my whole body. I caressed the head of my pen1s and I ejaculated onto my keyboard, looking up to the screen to see that our team, had actually won.

review: I recommend this game ONLY on certain parameters. If you're looking for a story, theres none I could find. There's pratically an economy on this game as in people will spend outrageous amounts of actual money on such as gun skins. It has....interesting shooting mechanics to say the least, not your standard shooter, but thats what makes it funner. Like shooting people in the face(ak only)? This is probably the game for you and probably already in your library somewhere.

review: If you want to understand why the human race will not survive long term, then look no further than this game. To say the community is toxic is a bit like saying Escobar did ok in the drug business. You will come across cheats, racists, cheats, kids, cheats, and cheats. Before long the hate will rise inside you, work and family will seem less important than ranking up, you will discover that somehow you can curse fluently in Russian, if anybody plays better than you they must be reported for cheating, and you live only for your next knife kill... after which you scream "rekt!!". New players should not be afraid of losing their first few games. You will find the skill tree a little messed up. High ranking players often have alternate accounts so they can dominate lower ranks for fun. If you are a silver or nova then congratulations, you are almost certainly playing more global elites than actual global elites. If you ever make it out of that hellhole things will get easier, trust me. Good luck, and may God have mercy on you noob. 10/10 c*ka blyat.

review: WHO ARE THOSE IDIOT 5% WHO DONT LIKE THE GAME?!?! CS GO is the best game in the world! It is so strategy based, unlike other fps games, even though individual skill is needed. And even right when you start, you can play casual which is tons of fun with great people. I don't know why you wouldn't get this game.

review: One of the best games of all time. So much achievments,servers,and ranks. Sometimes there's a cheater but hopefully VAC will catch them. There are a multitude of skins,voices,and maps to choose from. Skill is involved. Severs include: Deathmatch,Arms Race,Zombies,Bunny Hop servers and more! You will have a blast playing with friends. Heck even solo is fun! CS:GO honestly,is living up the Counter-Strike legacy. Get this game while it's on sale or full price. Worth it either way!

review: Sometimes you would just rather play with a team of chickens than a team of silver 1s. At least the chickens won't flashbang you. Plus you never have to buy for a chicken, so you can save all your money to buy auto snipers every time. If you get hungry, you can cook them with a molotov and eat them (the silver 1s might complain if you do that, in chat of course because mics are overrated). Best of all, roosters don't have . I'm not sure how that last point was relevant, but I felt like it had to be said. I would rate this game 10 out of 10, but stick to casual if you want to keep your sanity intact. Also avoid spending $200 on a painted knife in a video game. Trust me, it's for the best.

review: Way too balanced. Needs aim assist to help me feel pro, and the balance is so harsh- the game needs overpowered secondaries, needs pointless deathstreaks, needs OP killstreaks, and most importantly, stop making changes in the new versions of the games, but need to put more polygons. Stop putting in good maps by fans, put in terrible maps that looks like circles. Stop helping the community, make the game pay-to-win and put hats in it. lol If what you pay for is what you get, all the other first person shooters are overpriced. For 15$ you get a legendary game, for 60$ you get more polygons.

It is guaranteed that at the very least, 60% of your time spent playing this game will be comprised of spectating your 14 year old Russian non-English speaking teammates continually fling themselves into an Auto-Rifle oblivion barrage and blame you in their foul Slavic tongues for their resulting deaths.

review: It was an ordinary day of solo-queueing, and I had been on the winning team in Workout. We were winning 15-0, and the other team didn't even stand a chance. On the last round, we decided to do a knife only. I turned the corner, noticing a Terrorist come out from the other end. I notice a basketball on the ground, and I hit it. It rolls towards him. He hits it back. A CT joins in, and then a T, and another, until the entire server is playing soccer with the basketball. Ts are winning 3-2. We are all good sports, except for one dude. Xban@TIC64, with 2 kills and 3 assists. He gets frustrated. Yells in teamchat. Then the unthinkable happens. He pulls out a Negev. And holds down the trigger. Instantly, the air is fulled with hundreds of bullets. The Ts dive for cover, but it is too late. They fall one by one, running away with their knives out. The game ends. Counter-Terrorists win. Before the scoreboard comes up and people recieve items, someone on my team starts a votekick to kick Xban@TIC64. It goes through with 4 votes. He is kicked. I have top-scored, with 47 kills and 12 assists. Turning around to get a drink of water, I freeze when I hear the sound of me getting a drop. I turn around slowly, getting ready to face my item. I look at the monitor. I have gotten a Galil | Sage Spray.

review: On Counter-Strike: Global Offensive since the announcement lay a huge responsibility. After all, the continuation of the legendary series of online shooters , a fan is a vast community will not tolerate the slag or just serednyachkovoy game. Benefit , Valve and not the studio that dares to disappoint their fans. Two years later, the clockwise and 691 held in opposition to the special forces and terrorists , I can proudly say that CS: GO is really failed. Even more than . Before continuing my review , it is worth noting that the only worthwhile game mode and remains to this day a bomb clearance , ie confrontation 5x5 , 30 rounds of 1 min. 45 sec. , In which the attacker must detonate a bomb at certain points , and protection appropriate to allow this to happen. One of the major advantages is the fact that CS: GO this type of game ( with minor changes ) placed in a separate section of the menu called ' competitive mode ' . Introduced a system of titles that helps you find a match according to your skill. In CS 1.6 and CS: Source competitive mode by default absent and was available only on certain servers , specially tuned for this type of game. The gameplay is not changed . Actually , nothing changed and is not required , a familiar mechanic works on hurray . Fixed characteristics of some weapons , something removed, something added to the overall picture it does not have nearly no effect. Shooting became more random, yes. But perhaps the most realistic FPS in the moment. If multiplayer shooter from you wait not fancy graphics and ballistics believable and interesting gameplay, then welcome to the CS: GO. Valve managed to make an almost perfect balance of gaming devices. With proper skill you can neutralize the enemy with a much more powerful weapon . Pistol rounds in CS: GO is not known to sink without a chance and an opportunity to take the round even with poor economies . But the most important advantage is the ratio of Valve to his fans . Almost every week there is a free upgrade , changing the gameplay for the better, in order to achieve a perfect balance . Approximately every six months out extensive additions cost 5-7 dollars with soccer fans cards that are available in the competitive mode. That's not counting skins for weapons that can get special opening drawers. In addition to all Valve maintains its competitive community , sponsoring tournaments large sums . And I am delighted that the number of people playing CS: GO, is increasing every day . But on the other hand it is the community CS was for me the only problem in this game. Because it often turns into a competitive mode into a farce and mutual humiliation. The only solution - only play with friends. Total we have a great continuation of one of the greatest franchises in history. To purchase required if gaming is important to you the gameplay itself . Best multiplayer shooter at this point, in my opinion. - beardATTACK @ fren

review: CS:GO may seem too familiar to those who have played Source. Source felt a bit wishy-washy, with no official modes and servers. CS:GO is not only well-organised but more catering to less experienced players whilst still retaining the essence of what makes counter-strike a proffessional gamer's shooter. New weapons may seem more like reskins but I prefer the simplicity of having no silencers and the properly working stats and decent achievements right from the game's release as oppose to an update 5 years after the game's release or something. Global Offensive's graphics aren't vastly different, but it is certainly the best looking shooter on the Source engine to date, and doesn't look as outdated as it should do for a 2004 game engine. The game seems well balanced, snipers are impressive, the Scout/SSG is no longer terrible and genuinely viable in competitive matches. Blur is added to sniper scopes while moving to balance them too. WWeapons do seem balanced and people use more than just AK, MR, Deagle and AWP. The 4 game modes - Casual Competitive, Classic Competitive, Demolition and Arms Race means there's something for everyone. Sure there's no Capture the Flag but in a game where there's no sprinting, health regen, killstreaks, aim down sights or ability to revive or heal teammates, it's probably for the best. Gun game is finally officially supported, and Demolition simplifies the game by removing the need to buy weapons. I've always wanted to try counter-strike properly but Source was just far too disorganised and had other distractions. Global Offensive brings the classic game into a modern setting without falling into the trap of being a Call of Duty clone. It's still counter-strike, with exactly the same gameplay mechanics as the original, but presented in a more appealing and fun package. It certainly feels more welcoming for newcomers than Source, which is a big plus not only for competitive gaming but for the franchise as a whole. The only thing lacking is Team Deathmatch, however this would require a "Create a Class" which would turn it into CoD. Arms Race fills that spot, and Demolition combines Classic CS with Gun Game. The primary reason why this game is more accomodating is because it was meant to be a port of Source to Xbox LIVE, so obviously some things needed to be changed or added to broaden its appeal. And for the most part, Valve have done a great job. Matchmaking is efficient, bots for offline play are exclellent with decent AI programming rather than the predictably linear Source AI and the package as whole is much more modern as oppose to Source, where it was a case of "too little, too late" when they decided to update it. If you haven't played CS before and want to give it a go, this is the best game. Equally if you are a seasoned Veteran it might make for a refereshing start if you are looking to get back into it.

review: Amazing game, Valve have done an amazing job. I used to play 1.6 back in the day-zzz, as well as Source, before quitting for some odd reason that I don't remember. I recently bought CS:GO after seeing how popular it was getting on Steam, and instantly fell in love with it. More realistic gameplay than any other FPS that I've played.

review: Dear, Guy Who Just Quit League of Legend/ Dota Ok i get it you hated being stuck in your elo because your teammates constantly trolled you or threw your promo games and you wanted something new to play with a better community. I'm sorry to be the one to inform you all those same trolls play this game as well and as an added Gaben in your face this game has Hackers out the . All that aside Counter Strike has been one of the greatest FPS consistently throughout our lifetimes and we cant blame them for humanity, we can call them greedy as the skin system in this game was left to the peoples to decide and some conspiracy theories later we end up with digital skins that are worth more than some peoples cars, and you know Gaben is taking that 10% of all market transactions. But if you can avoid the hackers and mute the trolls it is possible to solo carry yourself out of Silver (This games version of Bronze) and make it to Nova where you should find simi skilled players that can communicate with you to a moderate degree about Dust II, BEFRIEND these noble gentleman as they are crucial to making it out of Nova! After that its all Hackers, GE Smurfs, Semi Pros and Streamers i suggest looking into alternative matchmaking prospects to hon your skills such as ESEA, CEVO or FaceiT. Good luck my friend i hope to see you on the sands of Dust soon may Gaben be with you always! Jove_Gaming

review: Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, is probably the most balanced Fps game in all existence. I personally started playing Counter Strike when Source had been out for 2-3 years or so. I've always enjoyed the close quarters strategic combat, and the fact that the game is all skill. The're are no unlockables, the only things you can "earn" by playing are stats, and skins. A pro player will have no statistic advantage over a gamer that's new to the series, other than his skill. +Great Engine +Great Servers +Balanced Gameplay +Smooth Gameplay +Excellently constructed maps +Stays true to the franchise +Cheap -No unlockables (except skins) -InGame purchases with real money 16/03/2014

review: In Counter-Strike:GO you play as Tom Clancy's younger brother; Al Clancy. Growing up Tom gave Al a hard time ruffling his hair and calling him names such as "weird Al" Barbara and John Clancy brought up these two whiper snappers in the state of ohio in the USA. They were a middle class family. When Al turned 7 his mum and dad bought him a pair of Night Vision goggles for Christmas. Tom being the the young nipper scallion he was decided it was a good idea to steal these as they were proper flipping oreyt. The sense of achievment Tom got when he stole these glasses was second to none, it didnt take long for tom to get addicted to ruining christmas. (fun fact, the grinch is loosely based on this story.) As they grew older it became clear that all tom and his football friends wanted to do was ruin christmas, They called themselves Christerrorists. This new movement led to the boys seeing a darker side of themselves, they began finding care packages santa had dropped for deprived children and strapping C4 on them. The ultimate way to ruin Christmas. Al was enraged when he became aware of this, he did the only thing a right wing father of 3 christmas loving American could do in this situation... Bought a metric sh**t tonne of guns and grenades. He began handing these out to friends and neighboors on his cul de sac. They soon became The Count Christerroists. The game is purely story mode. With this special addition you play as both Christerroists and Counter Christerrorists, in a sort of heads to head. (!!!!!!!!spoilers the story gets a little confusing as it is mainly about how many quick scopes you can do with the AWP and standing at Mid With bomb while your team clear a plant site and then losing the game) I dont want to give too much away so I will leave this review here, I hope you found it helpful. I would rate this game a 7/10 it could get a 9 but due to it being a christmas game I can only play around the festive time of year otherwise it seems a little silly. Like when you here Fairy Tale of new york by the pogues in august. It just doesnt feel right.

review: CSGO is a near-perfect multiplayer shooter. Unlike the previous versions, which were often difficult to get in to, this one offers a variety of modes that will appeal to all skill levels. It has a large community and a well supported workshop, ensuring that this discount-priced game will be around for years to come. In short, you either play as the good or bad guys and must either kill the other team or complete objectives to win the round, which will earn you more money to do the same thing again but faster. It's been around for years and has spawned many imitators. The game isn't much of a looker as it is based on the same engine as the original Half Life 2 was. However, Valve have polished it as much as they can and the community consists of lots of awesome mappers who have been churning out brilliantly imaginative and beautiful maps almost on a daily basis. Is it worth getting if you already own Counter Strike: Source? Yes. CSS was always Counter Strike shoe-horned into the Source engine. CSGO feels far more like a standalone game. Valve have very carefully listened to what people have wanted and have made a very appealing game. The best feature must be the competitive play. You cannot leave these matches or you'll suffer a temporary ban from the feature. After 10 wins in this mode you'll be ranked and will be paired up with people of the same skill, meaning that the game is challenging but fair regardless of your skill level. These matches are exciting, occasionally scary or frustrating, but are the most rewarding part of the game and improving your rank is one of the most satisfying experiences in any video game, ever.

Once you get good enough you should start playing ESEA, if you are willing to dedicate that much time and effort into CS:GO.

review: Before I start, I will admit, even if I once was a hardcore first person shooter player, I kind of got tired of them over the years. I had Counter Strike Source and Day of Defeat Source, but I pretty much only wanted them for Garry's Mod. The last CS I played for hours and hours was the 1.6 version of the original, and that was over 10 years ago. Now, after these Summer Sales, I saw CS:GO at 5. Looking at other "mainstream serious FPS" these days, like CoD and Battlefield, that usually go arround the 60-70, not counting the load of DLC's, it seems like the best deal ever! It actually is? The awnser is, yes. Oh man, I do still suck a bit at these games after playing nothing but TF2 for when it comes to FPS games, but I still had fun like the old days. The game is done to perfection. Guns work as intended, no stupid recoil like the recoil you see in other  FPS games, here it looks realistic, and it feels good. The maps are good as well, feel just like the originals, while the new ones add originality, and the ones made by the community are always amazing. The gameplay is smooth. Right now I'm using a  PC, since my old one kind of blew up (it probably could not handle my afro), and this piece of crap runs the game without that much issues on low-mid settings, while games like CoD Ghost or Hardline always bring dumb problems because of horrible optimization. I have like 30 hours so far with this game, and I bought it on the Summer Sales, that ended like a week or two ago. I have been in normal servers, filled with both new and old players, I have tried bots, and I have played 10 matchmaking games so far, and without counting the MM match where I ended with a bunch of Russian s who did nothing but to yell crap on their microphone, blame me, and then ragequit, I had nothing but fun. And that's another thing, the community is amazing. Some people might stay silent most of the time, but they won't get THAT mad, unless you really screw up something, or act 100%  (like dropping your gun at the start of the round, buying nothing, going 1 vs 5 with your knife, and then say that this game is a bad ripoff of Call of Duty. I have found one dude like that, and I think he was not trolling, but totally serious). And well, I did  up at times on my first matches, I wasn't used to the new buy menus, the changes of the maps, the new models, I find of teamkilled 2 friends so far, but they where not mad. Probably because they where new too, at some point, and know how it sucks to be THAT guy. The sale is over, and it doesn't cost 5 anymore. Still, the full price is like 12 or so, and if you really like competitive and serious multiplayer FPS action, this is your game, doesn't matter if you're a filthy casual, a nooblord, or the classic "MLG" that will probably kill the other team in 30 seconds with 5 bullets, all headshots. Oh, and while the weapons feel balanced, I got to say that the shotguns are really underrated. Further more, I f#cking love them. It might be because I'm an old-school Unreal Tournament player (I have been in tournaments, and ), and my favorite weapons from that game was the Flak Cannon, but I find it fairly easy to kill scrubs who tryhard with M4's and AK's with 1 or 2 shoots to the face, while they crouch and spray their bullets all over Mordor. Give them a try if you're new, you won't regret it. If you don't believe it, look at the screenshoot below, at the end. I played nothing but classic pistol rounds and Nova the whole game, and I ended up with 43-18, being the MVP of the match. And I'm not that good, you can probably do it way better than me! Besides, killing 1 player with the Nova gives like 900$, while weapons like the AWP (best Sniper Rifle) only give 100$. What's not to like? And if in the end you find the game boring, just idle on servers. With time, you will get drops and items that you can easily sell in the market. With some time, you will get your money back. I have gotten 2 so far, just with the new crates, so...

review: Counter Strike: Global Offensive is probably one of the best FPS games I have ever played. Not only are the graphics of the old maps polished but also the combat. There is a great range of playing style to suit you, such as rushing in with an SMG or sitting at the back with an AWP, which accommodate you to your best ability. This is an extremely hardcore, skill-based first-person shooter, and it forces you to think differently than other modern shooters. If youre a Call of Duty player, youre going to need to change your play style to succeed here. Another good part of this game is that the teams are small, guns are lethal, and rounds are short so there's an addictive just-one-more-round quality to it, because there's a constant desire to do better than last time, to earn a satisfying kill, or to win in a new way. If you are interested in a both challenging and exhilarating FPS then I recommend you buy Counter Strike: Global Offensive 9.5/10.

review: Whether you are a Counter Strike Legend or a typical new FPS player looking for a fun shooter, everyone should enjoy Counter Strike: Global Offensive. CS:GO is simply an updated, modern game on the Counter Strike series, with outstanding graphics, a variety of weapons, a list of game modes and amazing competitive aspects. This game proves who are the good Counter Strike players, and who are the best. CS:GO, of course, runs on the source engine, giving a smoother experience among lower end CPUs, highly benefiting more Counter Strike players coming from "1.6" or "Source". Counter Strike: Global Offensive is a very solid game which can either be enjoyed casually, or competitively. My reccommendation of this game is very high, as Counter Strike is simply....the best FPS on PC, no doubt.

review: Quoted the "OK! Let's Go!" prolog that started every single round that all shooter fans from the 90s are familiar with. CS:GO is the latest edition to the one of the most well known and played shooter game through out the history of the world - the Counter-Strike franchise. And just like the Counter-Strike back then more than a decade ago was never about fancy features, stunning graphic, or special effects. Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is about the good old classic gameplay but revamped, polished and improved such as gameplay balances, animation, interface, presentation, audios and visuals, then powered by the modern systems and technologies to keep this franchise up-tp-date with the flow of time. However, CS:GO is not Counter-Strike 2 or the Counter-Strike: Source that merely replaced the engine and optimized a bit on top of it, but a better, newer and more advanced edition to the series which can shine its veteran brand that was left untouched in the last 13 years. I recommend this game to those newcomers who wonder how the shooter game back then was played and interested to give it a try as well as a definite must buy to the old players who have been playing shooters before the terms like "ADS, or Aiming Down the Sight, which also known as Iron Sighting" was invented. Q1: What can I expect as a player who never played a shooter without aiming simulation before? A1: You'll notice dropping an opponent is no longer as simple as counting one to two, meaning right click to aim and left click to pull the trigger. You'll also need to hone not only your aiming skills, but also how you fire your weapon, especially the timing in order to synergize the hitting pattern of your weapon on to your target. In simple words, things just got more difficult in a somewhat inhuman way. Q2: What else? A2-1: Counter-Strike has a lot of depths in how you move, how you aim, how you fire your weapon and even how you approach the position you have in mind after a new round started, and that's not the end of it. A2-2: It uses dedlicate server, server browser, and match-making. It focuses in a delicate scale of combat where players will play the game through a 5v5 scale by standard default. Custom scales ranging from 8v8 to 16v16 is supported depending on the actual server-side setting of the server you were connected into. A2-3: Given that there is hardly a cheap easy kill for players, there is no health regen, and it took quite some study and patience to get things started - Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a renewal of a classic way of how players used to play shooter games, a harsh (or perhaps just like I said, inhuman) shooter game by today's standard for average players. Sum: If you neither a old timer or a newcomer who really interested in the old, classic, proven way to play a shooter game, then there won't be any particular reason I should recommend you to get this game with the only exception being you're sicked and tired how easy today's shooter games are like.

review: I remember like it was yesterday, I playing the first counter strike in 2000. Since then, becomes one of the games I played the most in my life! Versions like 1.5 and 1.6 are perfect for me! Over time it seemed that Valve is lost! Until I got the surprise launch of the Global Ofenssive. Counter Strike GO, legend of the FPS back! This game is amazing!

review: Whether you are a Counter Strike Legend or a typical new FPS player looking for a fun shooter, everyone should enjoy Counter Strike: Global Offensive. CS:GO is simply an updated, modern game on the Counter Strike series, with outstanding graphics, a variety of weapons, a list of game modes and amazing competitive aspects. This game proves who are the good Counter Strike players, and who are the best. CS:GO, of course, runs on the source engine, giving a smoother experience among lower end CPUs, highly benefiting more Counter Strike players coming from "1.6" or "Source". Counter Strike: Global Offensive is a very solid game which can either be enjoyed casually, or competitively. My reccommendation of this game is very high, as Counter Strike is simply....the best FPS on PC, no doubt.

review: We're talking about the absolute TITAN in classic competitive first person shooters. The FATHER of addictive multiplayer combat set in a contemporary universe. Before Call of Duty. Before Battlefield. Before anything else that hefts up an AK-47 and and pulls back the charging handle... This did it first. And in many ways, it still does it best. I've met incredible people here. Some of the best friends of my life are actually from this. I've had incredible moments in this game. I've had laughter, moments of triumph, situations to overcome, comradery that I cannot even begin to describe, and a feeling of satisfaction that nothing else for $14.99 can come close to. (Short of a roadside BJ from your locals finest.) Nothing compares to the sharp, precise aim, the satisfying and punchy weapon bob... The sexy, sharpened and modernized gun models, crisp anti-aliased graphics running on a mature and tight version of Source... And the fact that this entirely new looking package is wrapped around the SAME hardcore game that 1.6 popularized way-back when, albeit with a few tweaks between all of the versions, means that it has a whole other layer that Battlefield, and Call of Duty can NEVER touch. "What is that 'layer' you speak of" you say? Many things, and the fact that I can SEE this clearly without ever stepping into the beating heart of CS:GO - competetive [At the time of this posting finally with no text limit, I have finally played 5 rounds of comp. 3 wins! It is a whole other amazing side to the game] is an achievement regarding the message this game wants to send its playerbase. - It's all about the community. It's all about a skill that needs to be HONED, not unlocked. It's about playing for HOURS and perfecting that single shot down that hallway. It's a game that stands perfectly on its own as a shooter, but manages to weave the MLG aspect into it seamlessly, without, in MY opinion... Dividing its playerbase. It's all there, all the time. A feeling of professionalism can wash over ANYONE in this game at least ONCE in their time with it. I can NOT say that about Source, or 1.6. Those were daunting, trudging beasts... Leviathans that I feel newcomers could not make headway in if they just wanted to have some fun and see what all the fuss is about. With the slight exception of Source. My time with that title was a mixed bag. Its graphics felt disjointed, and decidedly a mod, which is perfectly acceptable (duh)... But its shooting seemed almost RANDOM... And many 1.6 purists will say similar regarding not being able to enjoy the ballistics. The fact is that Counter Strike is often all about the MLG nowadays. And yet this entry in the franchise can stand on its own as a FUN game to just mess around in without feeling the pressure.... It is something to truly behold for ANY PC gamer. Being able to enjoy the hardcore without BEING hardcore is a treat. As you get better, the progression of your skill as a gamer feels tangible. You do NOT need unlocks, and idiotic modifiers to your gear to feel like you are getting anywhere. NOTHING gets in the way of your skill. No unlocks, no killstreaks, no aiming down sights... It's just you, your gun, your knife, and your ability to  UP the opposition. NOTHING else. It is such a worthy game that within a year of its release I'd been able to put over 350 hours into it, and I feel like more time could have been spent within its corridors, its rooftops, backrooms, and its long, stressful hallways. The feeling of PERSONAL progression and satisfaction I felt made me say left and right that I wished they'd add some kind of personalization, and a smart system that makes you MORE addicted. Not hats, just some way to make you give back to yourself in a meaningful way. A customization and unlock system for vanity gear would be fantastic, a new horizon for the game. It makes the game feel timeless, and without need of many other entries for some time, just updates for polish. And? Valve always listens. It's not PERFECT, but the skins add a new breath of air to the game. Even if you're not good, you're still the snob with that purple tier weapon, and everyone hates you. And they should. It's ok to hate on it just as much as it's ok to use these new pieces of bling. Everyone is doing it. And to speak of content? Valve games main strength has always been community based content that keeps your game living and breathing. Never slipping into the pile of "used up." There's always more to play with.... And now with the integrated workshop, and official server support for TOP map creations...(if you donate to both Valve and the makers, a hugely smart way for Valve to make money in a less greedy way than map packs). You can be assured that CS:GO has a lot more than just the addicting gameplay, community, the entertaining MLG scene, and most importantly self growth to keep you coming back thanks to these additions. The Arms Deal Update has its hand on your wallet, but through means of community driven sales, not just ones from the company... And NONE of it EVER affects your skill... Unless that purple SSG 552 fills you with divine rage that you just can't help but get headshot fever. you can make some decent digital goods money, and so can everyone else. I so no issue regarding this update, and thankfully after some weeks of growing pains, it seems everyone is on the same page. Intense firefights. Room for skill growth. The ABILITY (good luck) to have incredible social interactions.. Hilarious conversations. Things that I'll never forget. Especially thanks to the people I'd managed to call my best friends from this. Those are all the luck of the draw. But when you buy this game, one thing is for sure- You're buying a piece of gaming history with the freshest breath of fresh air I've ever seen. And it is a triumph.

review: CS:GO is different to most FPS games i've played. It's got 2 teams, both have an objective, and the teams have weapons that balance out according to the objective. Most of the core competitive maps balance out the weapons and objectives even more, and they're also aesthetically pleasing. CS:GO should appeal to all skill levels, with it's competitive ranking system you're almost guarenteed to find a balanced game with people your skill level when you play in matchmaking. Overall, i'd probably give CS:GO a 9.5/10, it could use some more balancing between the M4A4 and M4A1, but other than that it's perfect for an FPS of this day and age.

review: CS:GO is arguably one of the best first person shooters (FPS) currently available. And short story, it's more then worth for the price. Now long story though, there is a lot more to it. First, if you are new to CS series, before you go for it, prepare to die a lot. In this game, fast reflexes and good aim wins the game, and that is something you get only with time, so be persistent, and more you play it, more fun you will have. On the brighter side, weapons are greatly balanced, unlike any other FPS, so no matter what team you pick, you can be sure that your opponents have no adventage over you in that matter. Now there are several mods, and I strongly recommend not to go into competitive unless you are sure you know what you are doing. Reason for this is because your team will offten expect more then what you can give. That will probably result in some insults via chat messages. Also you may get voted off (kicked) out of the game, that further might result in competitive cooldown. So for first time, you probably want to try so called "Arms Race" mod, where you will get your chance to test most of the weapons, and figure how they respond. Also you can move on to some "Deathmatch" for aim improving and of course some "Classic Casual" and "Community Competitive" before you jump on to real thing. Also be aware, as there is people who simply don't like losing the game. They will always find an excuse, and that may be "poor 64 tick server preformanse", or "having cheaters in opposing team" and as you become good, they will probably accuse you as well. For those kind of people there is no help. Actually when I think about it twice, whoever seem to bother you, you can completely mute him, and continue your super-awesome game. For the actuall cheaters, you may hear there is tons of them, but again, read section above. Unfortunatelly there is some here and there (for what I have played I met only few) but they get sorted out by quite unique system called "Overwatch". For the overwatch I won't go into details, but very good players get to decide who is cheating and who's not. In tons of cases they get false reports, again because of people can't stand a loss! (: Bottom line of the review: Get the game, it's among the best currently available, and you will have tons of fun with it!

review: A Review Mostly for me so I know Ive completed the story, high game time as well as feedback on the game. My Thoughts:- A team based FPS CT Vs T can be fun with a bunch of friends and the competitive mode is good fun, with weapon skins and team colours as well as a few good modes to pick from like death match, arms race, casual and some more. Achievements:- 156 of 167 (93%) Achievement Graphics:- An improvement on the last Counter Strike: Source game but nothing too special. Game Play:- Team Based type game where you have to rescue hostages or defuse a bomb. The aiming can take some time to get used to as when you go full auto with weapons you have to follow the bullets and not the crosshair. Story:- N/A Replayability:- Can become addictive if you play with friends or competitive What Could Be Added:- Different player skins/ colours Rating:- 9/10

review: After 250 hours of intense gameplay I learned the meaning of life. I play Counter-Strike: Global Offensive every day. I have not gone a day without Counter-Strike since I first bought it on the Steam store. However I do not like the gameplay of Counter-Strike in any way at all. The game itself is complete trash and was probably developed by the same people who made the first tentacle gang bang video but there is a golden egg among the pile of crap this game is. The chickens. I follow them with my default knife around Inferno, recording their every step with NVIDIA Shadowplay (batteries not included) and counting each individual chicken I spot and add it to THE LIST. The chickens are pretty, simple and flawless. They do not make my frame rate go down (I run CS:GO on the potato from Portal 2) unlike Skyrim's chickens and they explode if they are killed. I have only seen one chicken ever explode and that was in a competetive game in which xKittenfall, my rival, on the terrorist's team slaughtered one in front of my eyes with his Karambit Fade knife. I now suffer from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and kill anyone who comes near my chickens. They are only for me. Do not harm my chickens. Anyone who even bats an eye at one of my precious birds will take an AWP headshot to the foot- be it friend or foe. I fear for the safety of these chickens. They are why I live. I was created by the Chicken God in order to protect the godlike chickens. Chickens are the meaning of life and if you attempt to argue with me I will shoot you until you're dead. Right in the foot. With a Glock-18 (ultra overpowered TBH). Do not mess with my chickens. And if you come across me in a session... Oh wait, you won't, because I swore off multiplayer after people killed the chickens. I only play in Bot Only sessions by myself and kick the bots, following the chickens around and hoping they do something new. I have studied the chickens so well I have memorized all of their spawnpoints on Inferno. There are 14 that spawn on the map and I am obsessed with them. Stay away from my chickens. (PART 2- THE 800 HOUR BENCHMARK) I whip around the corner and 1 tap flusha. The crowd goes wild with excitement. I just won the ESEA tournament for my new team Symbiotic. Confetti falls around me and LED lights illuminate the entire gaming stadium. I won one million dollars for the squad. I began screaming as my team carried me out of the stadium back to the gaming house. When night came I began to work on Source SDK, my life's new legacy. For a month I had been working on an ingame dream home that was secluded from the world and had no guns. It had a back yard exclusive to chickens and a statue in the living room dedicated to chickens. I smiled as I looked over the entire map and began adding more props and chickens to make the house more lively. I looked at each individual chicken to make sure t were on point and ready to be presented in the map. When I finally upload the map on the workshop people will be able to view my amazing home. It is on and island in the middle of the ocean with a home on it. The chickens are safe from all harms in the entire world. The map consists of three skyboxes; The house & island, compiling skybox & the easter egg skybox which can be teleported to through a secret trigger_teleport. In the secret skybox is a race track dedicated to bringing back func_vehicle 2012. Valve did not include func_vehicle (from Source) in CSGO and it angered many mapmakers. They could not make drivable cars in our beloved Counter-Strike? What a scumbag move. We need to bring back func_vehicle to the Counter-Strike series in order to improve our community as a whole. Can we do this? I love chickens and balance the life between competetive gameplay and chicken worshipping on a secluded island. Thank you for considering The Message by Nas.

review: Basically its Counter-Strike. If you dont know what Counter-Strike is and know Battlefield you are safe but if you only know Call of Duty you are not safe. Ok lets get into my personal review about this game: Basically its still Counter-Strike with added features that makes the game more fun to play with. They added skins which you can make money off it or to show to your friends. The one thing I like about CS:GO is their matchmaking system.It groups you into your respective skill group to play against the same ranked people you are in. Beware of Smurfers tho there are alot lately but I find it fun battling smurfers since I can have a little view or insight about how high rankers play. OK about the skins, its not call of duty but its optional. But hey you can make money off it since you can get case drops, skin drops, etc. For the game itself, its still counter-strike. Thats all I can say basically, its still CS with added features and such to make the game more enjoyable than the previous ones. If you get hooked up with the skins you will last a few hundreds of hours, yes, hundreds of hours since I already done this on my first account and I really enjoy doing what I like to do with skins. There may be hackers and such in matchmaking or any other gamemode but all I do is just basically report them and just ignore them throughout the match even if its 100% lose for us. Anyways for me this is the best version of Counter-Strike I ever played since 1.6 which is I played it on another computer :p. Pick this up for 15 bucks or 419 Philippine pesos or whatever price your currency puts it to since its an awesome, enjoyable competitive game and it lasts AGES. Heck 1.6 even has a few hundreds - thousands of players playing it and about this around more than that. Pick it up its a nice First Person Shooter and I will recommend this to ANY kind of person, either casual players or competitive players. I would rate it around 9 - 9.5/10

review: i played CS back in the beta days all the way through when it went source, including a bit of competitive. totally dig this game and CS:GO is actually a very nice combination of all the things that were good from all the various iterations of the game's history (purists, piss off) the problem for me is the community - i've found that the only way to enjoy the casual game is to turn off all voice chat (mute EVERYONE). the game seems to draw some of the most vile hate filled bitter gamers i've ever dealt with. perhaps it's the lack of humour in the game. tf2 has its share of racists and mysogynistic wingnuts but the levity of tf2 draws a incredibly varied set of people that more than offset the bitter element. cs:go, on the other hand, has no such levity, and unless you play with your friends (whom you probably made in tf2) or are a hate filled bitter racist mysogynistic wingnut yourself, you're likely to be turned off. TL;DR? it's still a great game, as long as you don't let the bitter scum get to you. NOTE: competitive mode in cs:go is a different story. the wingnuts seem to stay in casual or are at least more focused in competitive

review: Well,how to give an impartial judge about Counter-Strike:Global Offensive?Really hard to write!!!! First of all,I had a special feeling and connection with the Counter-Strike series.When I was a kid,I used to play some CS1.5 games with my bros and friends after school.We always found so much fun on WLAN games and I never experienced that kinda motivation and attraction from any other game before.When CS1.6 came out,we said:'WOO".A bunch of differences appearing,both police and terrorist had a few new guns and particular one that I still remember is that Goddame Police Shield,haha.So I donated plenty of my time into CS1.6 period,even once an entire summer break is given.My skill in CS1.6 became more and more good and learned a lot of stratagem from match videos.However,after growing up,I didn't have that much time for free to play.Eventually ,I stopped playing CS and didn't contact with this series for several years.Untill last years,maybe June or Junly,I was surfering Online webs and a game news just jumped into my eyes.The brand new edition of Counter-strike was going to come out!!!Suddenly,the funny time which I used to have emerges from my deep memory.Without wasting a second,I searched it and bought it in Steam store.Before that time point,my recognition about CS still stays on CS1.6,and never heard anything about CS:S and CS:GO....... After Valve releasing the game,I start to play alone.Then,I find out the gap might be bigger than what I think.I play suck at the first,don't know how to perserve myself,just go out and die together with enemy.After playing some hours,I believe I catch some hints and play smartly and carefully.Then, I sometimes become top player in matches.But after another match and match,another game and game.I can't feel that kinda fun I used to have when I was a child.CS series used to be the flag of novelty.But now,CS:GO is just a derivative product from the old CS,no new maps,just the regeneration of olds;no new game mode,just the same as olds;no new guns,just the replication of the old stuffs.This is not the time that players only had a few games to choose.They can buy and play other FPS games,like COD series or BF series.Some Coop FPS games such as Borderline series and Payday series are good opitions,too.No new change is a largely flaw!!!!Meanwhile,CS is a comparable game,most CSers need play match and match again and again to make sure they staying in a high level.But for most people,fun is the most important.But so few casual mode existing in CS:GO,how can this game attract new ordinary player to make the game community becoming more prosperious?NIP is awesome,but not every need to be like as invinciable as 'Xizt'or 'Get the Right' in the game,we need a funny game with happiness but not a super badass game with presure. I still love this game,but after playing around 300hours,I choose to delete it,because I feel bored and stressed when I play it.Maybe one day in future,new entertaining modes come out ,I will redownload it and restart to play :P. Now,during Christma discounting,CS:GO only costs your $4 to have it.Even for a reproduction with better graphics,it worths this value.I hope you having a nice time in this game.:P

review: Whether it be the graphics, guns, or the strategy, CS:GO drags the player in to play more and more. I would buy this game even if it was $30, yes it is that good. CS:GO has one of the best selections of game modes and game maps, so you are never bored. Even better, you can play the same map over and over and still like it. CS:GO also has a wide selection of weapons to choose from, and the weapon buying system is ingenious. The recent addition of weapon skins adds just that kick you need when playing. All you want to do is just unbox one. more. crate. for that chance to get a knife worth over $400. Long story short, GET THIS GAME!!! Stay classy, gamers! -JAMEStheGREAT3

review: Countless allnighters come to my mind when I hear the name "Counter-Strike" That game is something I'll remember discovering during my middleschool years. It to me, and i'm sure others, was a great way to escape and unwind after a long day. I don't see it slowing down in that department with Global Offensive. It combines the old with the new and I will admit that there is indeed a learning curve when it comes to aiming with those weapons but all it took was a few rounds of deathmatch and then I could effecetivly kill without being the "bambie" so to speak. Don't think this game is all gold and now scuffs. This game sure does have its short comings but that goes with any top notch game. Unless you're standing still and throwing grenades, you should compensate for the movemnet of the nade. I understand that this use to be something in Cs.s and other titles but I feel it's more apparent in Global. The balistics are far better than previous Counter-Strike games IMO,and it's interesting to see how the different guns have different spread and penetration, etc. This game is fantastic to play with friends, or if you're looking to make friends this game is still fun to play. Don't forget to practice if you're having a hard time with aiming, or understanding the map.

review: Great game, 9 out of 10. CS:GO Is a hard game and takes a lot of time to learn, everyone is equal with the same guns and you can't... unlock new guns like in CoD (Call Of Duty) or so I have heard! Once you learn how to play properly like control ur recoil with every gun and things like that, you might find it hard to stop playing the game and not get addicted :D. I think it's a great game because it has great maps and Dust II is my favourite by far, however the maps aren't exactly balanced I would say. The game is quite funny at times and there is proof in some of my screenshots :D. The only reason why I don't give it 10/10 is because it's not exactly balanced with the maps. The maps have like different camp areas for each team and some areas are better and things like that, bomb spots, hiding spots, etc. But, apart from that, this game has made me play 1500 hours already and I think I've only been playing for a year! You could call me an addict but, once you've played this game, you won't blame me ;).

review: Reviews for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing ---------------------------------------- Overall Game ---------------------------------------- CS:GO has a lot of gameplay options for players - community servers offering a variety of game modes, casual gaming ranging from defuse maps, hostage maps, deathmatch mode, and a fast-paced Arms Race mode where you aim to go through each weapon until you get a Golden Knife kill to win. Beyond casual gaming, there is a competitive system that rank-matches you, similar to many other FPS games, and runs for up to 30 rounds of CS, after which your rank is affected one way or another. Competitive play is both extremely challenging and extremely rewarding, although some players either take it far too seriously or treat it like casual unranked gaming. It's hard to find a team that sits in the nice middle ground between the two. If you've played a shooter game before, GO will be familiar. WASD, crouching, walking (as opposed to running), and grenades. It's relatively straightforward gameplay, only made hard by the skill of your opponents. The game has a bit of a learning curve. Each weapon acts differently and may take some time to learn which you like and which works best in certain situations. After that, the grenades are the next thing to consider attempting to master. They often can turn a losing game into a winning one. The best way to learn is to play, so get in there and have fun. :D Overall Rating: 9/10 ---------------------------------------- Overall Accessibility ---------------------------------------- CS:GO is not very accessible for deaf gamers. The game itself has no captions that I have been able to find, but the only thing that would need captioning is the weapons tutorial that you're likely to use once, if at all. CS can consistently be a challenge to deaf gamers because of the significant impact of sound during play. Many players OFTEN sit and wait for the enemy to come near, reacting to footsteps or grenades/weapon fire that cannot be seen, but can be easily heard. One particular edge hearing gamers have over deaf gamers is guard the target area from a distance by listening for nearby enemies, only moving out of hiding when they need to. A deaf gamer's need to see the target site to properly defend it puts them at greater risk of being killed. Additionally, competitive mode gamers make heavy use of the microphone capability to communicate quickly. There are text/voice binds in game (using the Z, X, and C keys) that can convey significant messages rather quickly and easily, but I find that most hearing gamers at mid-level skill are not receptive to either the voice binds or to text chat. Deaf gamers in competitive gaming may encounter hostility or discrimination from hearing gamers. Rating: 3/10 Subtitles/Text ---------------------------------------- None, though none are really needed. Chatting/Communicating ---------------------------------------- Chatting is available for team and global chat during matches and while observing. Although, as I mentioned, some people are not responsive to chat, it is still offered.

review: Never invite me to CS GO I rage too much. Angry dad appeared ''I thought we talked about this years ago''..... yes that was CSS i stopped afterwards, however now the nightmares are back help me!!!!!! I always find myself standing with a sniper shooting..... 1 miss..... 2 misses..... 10 misses...... afterwards I get killed by other sniper and start raging. this is one of the funniest aspects in the game Pros: Fun gameplay Lots of skins (for the crazy collector in all of us) Good Match making systems. Good Interface Cons: You rage a lot. Angry parents. Too high blood presure during gameplay but no actual errors with the game itself. Therefore i rate this game 10/10 (Do keep in mind this isn't for the softhearted, always have some friends chatting with you otherwise you might destroy your screen)

review: CS:GO is amazing! It took me a while until I got used to the weapon feeling and recoil, but when I got used to it, I was literally addicted to this game! I played it every night with my friends, trying to rank up in competetive or just having some fun conversations and troll around in casual. The only thing they should change is the price for the keys.... It started with 1,79  and after months the price slowly raised to 1,99 . All I can say is that CS:GO is definitely worth it's money.

review: Countless allnighters come to my mind when I hear the name "Counter-Strike" That game is something I'll remember discovering during my middleschool years. It to me, and i'm sure others, was a great way to escape and unwind after a long day. I don't see it slowing down in that department with Global Offensive. It combines the old with the new and I will admit that there is indeed a learning curve when it comes to aiming with those weapons but all it took was a few rounds of deathmatch and then I could effecetivly kill without being the "bambie" so to speak. Don't think this game is all gold and now scuffs. This game sure does have its short comings but that goes with any top notch game. Unless you're standing still and throwing grenades, you should compensate for the movemnet of the nade. I understand that this use to be something in Cs.s and other titles but I feel it's more apparent in Global. The balistics are far better than previous Counter-Strike games IMO,and it's interesting to see how the different guns have different spread and penetration, etc. This game is fantastic to play with friends, or if you're looking to make friends this game is still fun to play. Don't forget to practice if you're having a hard time with aiming, or understanding the map.

review: Highly recommend this game. It's the second most famous esport after league of legends and is pretty oldschool, which all of us like. You plant the c4 and defend it from the counter terrorist team, or if you play as ct, you have to defend your bombsites (A and B) from the terrorists. In certain maps, you can rescue hostages, too. This game has also many mods. Casual, competitive (classic ESL game in cs 1.6, but with cs go ranks) If you want to have fun, this game can also offer it, with the other mods, surf, deathrun etc.

review: Counter Strike might be ur old fashioned fps game from ur childhood but this game has evolved and grow and we too have grow beside it. It was once a worldwie famous tactical fps game and I can easily say that fact has never changed. CS GO's ranking system and its Competitive mode has been a wonderful experience to play with ur friends for skills alone wont help u win the game but tactics and teamwork is the golden apple that is needed to win the match.

review: One of the best "modern" shooters. As long as you dont define a good fps game something simmlar to another game (for example CoD series or some other fps) this game will be awesome. If you expect awesomley thrilling SP campaign - No. you cna play with bots. but the gameplay may seem "outdated". It is nostalgic, not outdated. It has taken some of the best FPS game features and compined it with CS 1.6 and CS:S. great competiteve excperience. Servers sometimes might not be the best for competiteve experience, but there are some free, better server alternatives. You will not like the game if you expect something like huge map invasions like in Planetside 2 or BattleField series. it has awesome team play elements, hard controlable gun recoil. This game is everything you want if you haev the time to actually learn it, and understand the simplest principals of how it works. after that, It is just practise of aiming and teamplay. Awesome game. 9/10

review: This game is a very popular terrorist/ counter-terrorist FPS. It features casual and competitive gameplay. It has a few different game modes and a large player base. The game is very balanced, there is alot of different weapons to choose from and the graphics are fine. You can also play against bots or play Deathmatches. If you happen to die and you have a bot in your team, you can control him to help your team win but it will not increase your own score. I've only played 1 mode so far, it is Bomb Defusing. In this mode you have 2 teams and the terrorist team has a bomber. The person who gets the C4 is chosen randomly and must set the C4 in one of the specific points. The counter-terrorists must defend the points and/ or kill all the terrorists to win the round. The terrorists needs to detonate the C4. The first to win 8 rounds like that ( they take about 2 minutes each, ) wins the match. I think it's a good game overall and if you're a fan of multiplayer FPS games, try it. The only CONS would be that you get crates while playing which requires a key to open ( you have to buy the key with real life money. ) I do believe the only thing those crates contain is cosmetic stuff. It's already a paid game, so it's a bit surprising, but it's not pay to win. Also some servers just lags even if your ping is good, no idea why, but usually finding a good server dosen't take too long.

review: I definitely reccommend this game. It is by far one of the most fun fps's I have come upon. Gameplay is very simple, there are different types of gamemodes with different objectives. Additionally, the variety of maps also makes the game more unique, simply because of the different secret and strategical locations there are. You won't be meeting any cod fanboys in this game because it is simply class, however a recent change made a few guns have scopes similar to COD gun scopes. Guns and all equipment is very well balanced allowing for a fair environment. Counter-Strike Global Offensive simply brings a sense of real fps. No healing, no medics just guns and people trying to shoot other people.

What actually made this game even more active and more popular is THE CS GO SKINS!!! But alot of  out there trying to scam people which i been scammed 4 times and i cried those 4 times like a little  :D , this game should be #1 shooting game in this world , all the call of duty kids need to know what this game kid #fullcalloduty , this game is the best game on the world , If you are reading my review , first of all if your going to download this game i'll give you some tip's , first 4 month of this game when i started i was silver which is the worst rank of the game! So basically i mainly used auto-p90 which pretty sure every silver did to! next 7 month your going to be an MG-MGE- If you go try hard then ur main gun is ak - awp , then after 1-2 years you will see your self making a team and making such nice good friends online! This game is the best guys! you need to get it for who ever doesn't have it! ~Cheers.

review: CSGO is a near-perfect multiplayer shooter. Unlike the previous versions, which were often difficult to get in to, this one offers a variety of modes that will appeal to all skill levels. It has a large community and a well supported workshop, ensuring that this discount-priced game will be around for years to come. In short, you either play as the good or bad guys and must either kill the other team or complete objectives to win the round, which will earn you more money to do the same thing again but faster. It's been around for years and has spawned many imitators. The game isn't much of a looker as it is based on the same engine as the original Half Life 2 was. However, Valve have polished it as much as they can and the community consists of lots of awesome mappers who have been churning out brilliantly imaginative and beautiful maps almost on a daily basis. Is it worth getting if you already own Counter Strike: Source? Yes. CSS was always Counter Strike shoe-horned into the Source engine. CSGO feels far more like a standalone game. Valve have very carefully listened to what people have wanted and have made a very appealing game. The best feature must be the competitive play. You cannot leave these matches or you'll suffer a temporary ban from the feature. After 10 wins in this mode you'll be ranked and will be paired up with people of the same skill, meaning that the game is challenging but fair regardless of your skill level. These matches are exciting, occasionally scary or frustrating, but are the most rewarding part of the game and improving your rank is one of the most satisfying experiences in any video game, ever. There are all kinds of teams and communities that you can join. Really, if I was stuck on a desert island with one game this would most likely be my top choice. It's bigger than you can hope to conquer and has a huge community around it which will likely be around for years to come, something that can't be said for the Call of Duty franchise which is probably its closest rival. Remember that those games are full price and have another one churned out each year, fragmenting the community. Plus you can customise your weapon skins in CSGO. Surely that's the most important feature?! All they need to add now are hats and you might as well live in CSGO.

review: You call this cs:go? Well I call it cs:bad Cmon Valve, you should rename this game to cs: stop...playing it cuz its bad Bad things about this game: This game is total trash, out of all the variety of unique weapons, people only use M4A4/M4A1-S, Ak47, or AWP in this game. The shooting mechanics and recoil is too much and mostly hard for newbies on this useless game. The sounds of this game is a copy from MW3 COD engine, and the gun sounds are too wubby and trappy 4 me. SMGs should be called Small Marshmellow Gun shooters. The damage of SMG's are worse than trying to knife someone, the damage point blank up close on the chest takes 10000000 bullets while you only need lucky headshots on these small tf2 hitboxes, you can get more kills with the lowest tier pistol than an SMG. The only SMG that is decent is p90, you see noob spray that pee pee gun around and spam it to your death. MP7 should have no recoil like COD MW3 and real life #unrealistic game. Shotguns are worse, it's the 100% nerf on COD shotguns. It seems like the bullets are freakin' Hasbro Nerf darts made from Nike sweatshops in China. Up close point blank with any shotgun = no kill. Don't bother about using LMG (why is it called light machine guns when it's more heavy than a OVERSIZE truck full of my diarrhea?) Ak47 is more OP compared to the M4A4 with damage and 1 hit headshots from any range. To even shoot accurately, you have to stand still and memorize the tarded spray pattern. If you move 1 mm, the bullets fly up to the sky then. The scout sniper rifle is a joke, it's only a hitmarker unless it's a headshot. The silenced weapons do more damage and are more accurate. I seriously don't get how big the recoils are for every weapon, it's like the Counter Terrorists are some scrawny 16 year olds and can barely hold the gun and the Terrorists are some recruited ISIS 12 year olds with towels on their head, dumb talibans. I'm surprised the Terrorists doesn't have an RPG, wouldn't matter anyway since it would only do 0.1 damage. The bullet's must not do damage or just dissapear in thin air since most of the shots doesn't register, saying you only did 10 damage with 1 bullet, gg. This is the only game where you need luck and aim for headshots while shooting else where is useless with the armor, oh....and if you get shot at, you move 100000% slower which unrealistic unless it's your legs being shot at, espeically with all that armor. People use hearing like it's sitrep pro from COD MW3 which is annoying to preshoot you and crap. Knfing is useless other than running faster, idk why the camos worth 100000000000000000000000 dollars. Same with any other weapons and their stranges. Who even uses the zeus? The recoil is so horrid, it needs to be mentioned again. Why have a crosshair when you spray, you aim the crosshair where should be on the player, ON THE GROUND so the bullets fly up in the air is now at your target. I think these CT were trained in the Army so that the recoil and aiming is stupid and the Osama Bin Laden squad is just naturally bad at aiming. Stormtroopers can aim better than these useless guns with its mechanics, jesus. The only recoil spread I can master is the AWP. This game has no killstreaks, such wow, lame. Why have the rest of the other unique and well made maps when the only map people play is Dust 2? Demolition is a new game mode that is trash and similar to gun game from CoD, casual is what people only play, deathmatch is the even worse version of TDM in CoD, the spawns are worse than MW2 rust.....I would spawn infront of someone or someone 2 feet away from me and get graped from behind, arms race is just plain stupid, just a copy of CoD mw3 gun game. Hostage is very unique, but only have to rescue one to win?? How bout the other 2 guys that's right next to each other to pick up? Plus the terrorists push more than the CT.... GG. Competitive is full of tryhard plebians and casual is full of smurfs. If you leave a competitive match that's unfinished, you get consquences by can't join another comp match for 30 min, then 2 hours, 24 hours, then week or something. You get temp banned basically....I can understand if people ragequit, but what if I have to take a dump for 10 hours? Or my mom nags me to get off? Or even a shark-nado came and hit my house and I got no power? This is dumb, last time I check this game isn't League of Legends. A genius way for wasting your hard working McDonald job's money, they added camos and stickers to guns. The only good camos for the "only good weapons" in the game are like 100000000000 bucks, worse than buying hats on tf2. Stickers are a rip off, you only have 1 time to apply it with a terrible POV inspecting it before you apply it, you can scrape it which ruins the quality, idk why that is a thing since you can't "scrape" it off and put it back on with a different spot on your gun, just have a remove button instead >.> or at least let you re-apply stickers. The community is terrible, you get kicked if you're bad or if someone calls "clutch or kick" with a lot of ghosters in casual. This game is worse than all the CODs, especially Black ops 1-2 and ghosts. No wonder this game costs less than the old Counter Strike games and still doesn't worth 15 bucks. I am a major Valve fan owning L4d1-2, Tf2, HL series, etc....and this game just dissapoints me, Hidden Path either ruined it or Valve wanted to took a crap on us and want money so Gabe can eat it, thinking it's celery and losing fat. I play video games 24/7 and never go outside. This game makes me want to go outside and burn like the casper the friendly ghost white skin I have from the sun as the vampire I am. This game created Al-Queada and ISIS groups. Blame this game for 9/11. This game gave me cancerous aids, along with everyone else who bought the game. Changes game needs: Shooting mechanics like COD (no mentally ill re-tarded recoil cuz characters in game dont know how to adjust recoil). SMG and shotgun buffs, ak47/m4a4/m4a1-s nerfed. Add rpgs, killstreaks. How do I aim down sights and run? Good things about this game: None.

review: Currently one of the best and only real competitive fps out there. A great variety of weaponry and maps. The game also gets constant updates from community feedback. However it has a vey big learning curve. For the first 50 hours or so you won't be very good at the game. As long as you get decent skill after that, you will have alot more fun.

review: This is an excellent first person shooter that takes time to get used to, it's not your average Call of Duty or Battlefield. You don't frag people for some random scope for your rifle or a suppressor, instead you are trying to master out the legendary weapons that have been in all CS titles. The AK-47, the M4 and the AWP. These are the quite important ones, and the way to go.

review: I've gone through at least 3 keyboards, purchased 4 seperate copies, spent >50 on skins and subscribed to 4 CS:GO twitch.tv channels, all because of this one game. What can I say? It's the purest FPS shooter that money can buy. No killstreaks, no deathstreaks, no commander mode, no marksman bonuses, nothing. You buy a gun, aim it at someone's head, and BANG; the person with the highest skill level level will make it out alive. That's why the game is still so popular. If you enjoy the FPS genre, do yourself a favour... Buy this game.

review: I thought CS 1.6 or Quake would never be outdated but CS:GO managed to make it. I'll go straight to the point: this is the best multiplayer shooter game. A real game for esport and casual competition: - a great gameplay for huge possibilities for whoever can appreciate fps games. - an addictive game when you find a team or people to play with. - graphics are great (cs source players, you're going to feel a change) - a high required level of skill, strategy and game sense, so a really competitive community (that's not CoD, kids). And the game is still young and probably going to be still improved. As usual, many cheaters and some obnoxious players may blot its copybook, but damn, this game is great.

review: When you get the time or have the money I highly recommend you buy this game. If you like to game and haven't bought a Counter Strike game you really haven't played most games. This game is casual and competitive so it suits every type of fps player, and like every valve game you can have custom servers if you don't want to play deathmatch, hostage mission or demolition. From the 300 some hours i've played on this game I'd say it was worth the money. -Droid 1-

This mode is pretty nice when you're having a competition with other players . But if you don't wanna get serious playing you can play casual there are many noobs there seriously but sometimes there're so much players and i don't wanna play with them cause i can't kill anyone :( lol , Anyway there're many funny guys on casual so if you wanna play for fun you can play casual but don't get serious on it cause it's not competition it's just play for fun though. Hope this Guide helps :) See ya.

review: Growth is an important factor in Global Offensive, especially if you're coming into Counter-Strike fresh or after a sabbatical. This is an extremely hardcore, skill-based first-person shooter, and it forces you to think differently than other modern shooters. If youre a Call of Duty player, youre going to need to change your play style to succeed here. Counter-Strike also tries developing into something new here as well, despite doing little to push itself beyond what its always done best. Global Offensive modifies old maps to keep veterans on their toes, and introduces official new modes that encourage different play styles for the first time in almost 15 years.-IGN.

review: In Counter Strike: Global Offensive, you occasionally shoot at people, blow up foreign aid supplies with plastic explosives that kill anyone within a square mile, and rescue tied up middle-age white males that have been given nothing but Mountain Dew from angry punk-rock teenagers. Whilst all this is happening you're getting yelled at by professional gamers who spent their last paycheck on an in-game knife and reading passive-aggressive statements directed at you by the opposing team. Buy it.

review: For those of you who're new to the Counter Strike series, this game has been around longer then any Battlefield or Call of Duty game. Most commonly known to now as CS:GO, this game has been around since 2012 and the previous one, Counter Strike: Source since 2004. Counter Strike Global Offensive features a sufficient amount of gamemodes such as Demolition, Hostage and Defuse missions which actually require teamwork and co-orindation to win. CS:GO has its very own competitive play system which you're placed into a 5v5 match of people the same skill level as you (which is determined by your ranking on official VAC Secured servers) to fight it out on a gamemode and map of your choice. This game isn't for people who like to give up easily, it required skill in knowing the maps, how to handle recoil and working as a team to achieve victory. I'd highly recommend this game to anyone who's looking for a challenge in FPS shooters.

review: The newest addition in the Counter Strike series. Counter Strike remains one of the few first person shooters that features a tremendous skillgap, both for individual play and for cordinating with your team. Playing the classic competitive gamemode truly demands you play at your best... If you want to climb in the ranks, of course. CS:GO has a pretty decent ranking system that pits you against players of your skill level. Fear not, new player. While the precise aiming, timing your movement with your shots and the recoil patterns of the main rifles are difficult to learn at first, once you start controlling them, you will be greatly rewarded. You will notice you will systematically become better than the newer players. At that point, the game starts to become addictive; getting headshots left and right is just so satisfying. In my opinion, anyone who calls himself a competitive first person shooter player should play Counter Strike and invest some time in it. There's really no other shooter quite like it.

review: Awesome game when you first begin to play it, it might seem like  in the beginning, but then it gets more enjoyable. Really like how they put in the competitive mode, but the queue time might be f**ked up from time to time. the first 10 wins should also be more accurate on how YOU performe, cuz if you get "carried" up in rank, you can expect to meet people way above your skill level. All in all, a great game :-D

Even if the community doesn't meet the golden standard of 1.6 and Source, CS:GO will remain a multiplayer classic for those willing to put in the time to learn the maps and weapons.

review: I've been playing CS 1.6 since after its' release, hell i've been playing CS since the release of 1.5 even(Mainly on non-steam LAN tho, i must confess) and thus far this is probably the best. it has the smooth and proper aim of 1.5 for most part when it counts, the accuracy of pistols are absolutely nostalgic in it and all pistols are actually worth playing with now with the change in damages. when it comes to SMGs and Rifles it's much more similar to 1.6 in early days except for AK47, GOD knows how i missed the super-accurate AK47 from 1.6. It also makes more sense to play with Galil and Famas now. About the sniper, well...i've never used sniper when it was serious but an amazing sniper i knew got interested in this game after playing around with AWP and SSG for around 10minutes. Almost forgot about the Heavy group of loadout being muuuuch more fun to play now and how the shotguns aren't useless from more than 10meters away. The only thing which was abit harder to enjoy on this release was jumping. Harder than 1.6 but with much more of a...kinda...air-control, guess i should say. Might be annoying at first, but you'll surely enjoy it after getting used to it. On top of all those improvements, there are weapon skins now making it more fun for the casual players. Another thing worthy of mentioning would be netcode improvements. Since i've always played videogames with higher amounts of pingtime i've been more careful about that part. in CS:GO you get to search for servers with pings as high as 350ms! Now...it doesn't really sound good when said alone, but the netcode is done well enough to make sure it's still playable with such high latency(However you have to cover the high ping time with better and faster reflexes at the end again). On a last note, i really hope valve improves the source engine. A little bit prettier envirounment and characters while saving the simple-looking options wouldn't hurt.

Valve has decided to create the next-gen version of their Counter-Strike franchise and added this great game to the fray! Play with friends, get yelled at for not playing a tactically-perfect manner during the eco round by twelve-year-olds! The gang's all here! Spend your life savings on Stat-trak versions of your favorite guns so you can brag about how many pubs you've "pwned" when you should have been working! A game so amazing and full of crates, you'll wonder why Valve even gives them away! Gabe, you've done it again!

You don't have to worry about leveling up or someone having a better gun then you or attachement, everyone has access to all the same guns making it a completely balanced game. It also offers a very enjoyable casual community and deathmatch for just having fun. Countless amounts of custom servers with addons and mods that add tons of variety to an already near perfect game. The game is constantly updated and improved upon by developers that actively listen to the community.

review: I stand there surveying the battlefield, full of my deceased comrades. During that time i had two things on my mind, one being that my fate determines on this moment, and that my AWP Redline looks intimidating with my newly added "Welcome to the Clutch" sticker. With that boost of confidence I ready myself for whatever comes next. I then instinctivly tap 'tab' to see what im going up against, and mutter under my breath, "Pshhh 1v3.... eZ." I then approach the bombsite where i come in sight of my prey. I stare the target down like a fat boy eyeing a stick of butter. Deciding to make my move I lick my finger, gathering as much saliva as possible, and cram it down the subjects ear. He screams in agonizing pain, and torture. I know I must finish him, so I grasp for his bloomers, and pull. Thus summoning an atomic wedgie which instantly incapacitates the man. Knowing what I have done I cannot help but tea bag the corspe a few times. Meanwhile I recieve a message stating that the bomb was planted. I suddenly stop the nonsense and move on to my next set of victims. Which were going to be tougher to crack than the first. I think of what I am going to do next, knowing I do not have much time, so I do what is best. I conjure my inner animal. Resulting to me being restrained to using the Deagle in a showy manner. I then come into sight of the bombsite, to abruptly run into my pursuers. My inner animal guides me toward my desiard location, and fires resulting in a collateral killing them both. In shock, I swiftly head towards the bomb knowing it will go off at any moment. But all worries fade when I am quickly informed by a gentleman on the opposing team, that F10 is a shortcut for instant defuse. Before executing the task, I mutter,"idiot." And spam the F10 key as fast as I can with my right index finger, overcome with joy I begin my victory chant to celebrate our win. But when I look back at my screen it reveals an EXACT copy of my desktop, that is INTERACTABLE. Holy cannoli, Valve you really did over due your self on this extrodinary easter egg. I really anticipate you guys adding more stuff like this easter egg in the future, never in my life have i seen so much detail be put into something so little.

review: What can I say, this game is made by Valve, therefore I am obligated to love it. In all honesty, this game is in some cases harder than other FPS's I've played, and in other cases easier. The community is large-I've yet to find a lobby that has less than 5 people in it. The game also runs on the Source engine, resulting in very attractive graphics that have a minimal impact on my GPU. Either way, I love this game and recommend it to anybody who is looking for a cheap, easy first person shooter.

review: ---------Sadly i have to edit my review-------------- Im playing this game now for just too long to understand the core thinking of the makers of the game. Sadly i have to give the game a thumbs up anyway because the thumbs up are maybe for the best 1st person shooting game of all time... i played them all fromcs begginings till now even COD, BF probably all versions till now. But i have to admitt all this games cannot top CS:GO. Cs is just a very fast, team oriented 1st person shooter that will pull you in and never let go... Atleast what i thought so till now... Now i have to come to the problem... and the problem is: --------------------------------------------------CHEATING--------------------------------------------------------------------- Since the game came out i knew there would be cheaters... It sadly now belongs to almost every online game there is... But this became different... Allredy at the beggining i was wondering about the price of the game ... found it kinda cheap for such a good game only 14 Euro or something... At that point i allready thougt that its kinda easy for cheaters to rebuy a new account even if they should get banned... But i could never ever even imagine that it gets even better untill i realized that its beeing sold atleast once a month for ca 3 Euro... I dont know if this is aa dream or a insult to all the players who want to play a clean game... i dont think i have to explain what consequences this had on cheating.... So because of that the complainments and reports pilled up and valve was searching for a solution that doesnt cost them a thing and they get the cheaters atleast a lil bit under controll... so they made OVERWATCH... now they dont have to pull a finger and they work is beeing done by slaves (Players) who are hoping on a cleaner game one day... Nice story but whats this the game costs 3 Euro again so this guy (Cheater) buys this time 6 accounts so he has resources now for atleast 4 months to play and cheat... This is getting out of control VALVE you are making allready big money with this Skins and Market stuff why in Gods name cant you spent some of the money for making the game more enjoyable where you bann those cheaters and get us ----------------128-tick------------ SERVERS----------!!!!!! If these arogant stance of yours wont change you will loose probably a lot of players... I am a very active player but i quited the game for almost 2 moths last year because of that...

review: Hello again, If you like Counter-Strike: Source, this is more of the same only much improved. There are added modes of play, but beware when starting out that you should check the key bindings right off because, for example, the buy key is by default the use key. There are other differences, but if you haven't played this series yet, I would advise to get any one of the franchise on sale before ever spending full price on this game. One of the issues is that there are random errors that pop up which Valve/Steam apparently can't fix and which will get you banned in competitive play due to no fault of your own. I've had issues with pure server errors, and I'm hoping I've resolved them. Only time will tell. It kind of sucks that Valve allows an issue to continue in competitive game play where money could ultimately be at stake and which could cause teams to lose, which places abandons in your profile, and which will get you banned ultimately and prevent you from using the license you've paid for. My advice if you can't get Steam to resolve issues with their games is to contact the Better Business Bureau first. Sometimes just the threat of doing so will get a response from customer support. Good luck if you buy this.

review: In the beginning I did not like this game, coming from CSS. However, over time, I have come to enjoy it more than CSS, mainly due to the continued updates to the game and Matchmaking service. Also there seems to be a lot of support for it from developers and the communitiy. All in all, if you like Counter Strike or in general any tactical FPS, then this is a game you must buy. Genuinely 10/10, would recommend.

review: CS:GO is the latest entry into the Counter Strike franchise, and a worthy one at that. Guns feel and sound powerful, classic maps mixed in with the new spice things up a little, and it's oh-so rewarding when you finally master that gun you've been trying so hard to get more equipped with. Pick it up if you're looking for a challenging-but-rewarding multiplayer shooter.

review: Always been a Counter-Strike fan, played them all and this is my favorite one by so far and this brought me back to the series after a long break. Absolutely love the competetive matchmaking to find players to almost equal skill level as you and the feature to party up with your friends and play a game (casual or competetive) with them. And the "new" game modes are also fun and the fact that you can search official CS servers and the community made ones. The game is good, but they need to buff the shotties a little bit (except the Mag-7) cause I'm tired of getting 80-98 damage point blank (espacially with the Nova)! Shotties are made to kill with one shot or medium damage with fast followup shots. :c (okay rant part is over) Summary: I love this game alrdy even tho only 70 hours in the bank, but it has its problems like every game out there. If you like fps games and/or Counter-Strike give this game a try and be brave and try out the competetive matchmaking too! :3

review: First of all, note that graphon really managed. And not even in terms of the "cruisey" hi-endnote graphics, but in terms of quality of work of designers, mappers, modelers, and others. Because the maps look really good, modelki weapons and players are also good (that is, in fact, they just made qualitatively and of themselves are good, but look if they do well in this game is another question) - in short, graton I liked, despite the fact that generally Counter Strike is not a game where important grafon. At least, there is no such flatulence, excessive brightness, as in Source - graphon GO just a nice, where you have the gloomy, where it is bright. In General, good graton, normal, pleases the eye and the stars from the sky is not enough. And the map is very good. That is, as. Most of the maps in GO are copies of classic maps from 1.6. However, in contrast to the same Source environment and the design altered almost completely - if the Source just got my texture, added normal Sormovsky features like lying all over the map garbage, there is virtually completely redesigned the concept and idea cards, leaving almost intact the original structure of the map. For example, de_dust2. In 1.6 and Source is a common Eastern city with pointed domes and intricate paintings a La cartoons about Aladdin. In GO, this map looks like a very levels of some CoD 4, because now this is not the tale of Aladdin, but rather dilapidated streets of, say, Syria. In this respect GO a head taller than their predecessors, meaning you have a lot of attention in the cards given to the parts that compose positive impression.

In this respect GO a head taller than their predecessors, meaning you have a lot of attention in the cards given to the parts that compose positive impression. All salt that GO missing... Like to call it, nanowaste. 1.6 was very simple, very cozy, home to some; Source immediately I did not like - but even he was closer to 1.6. GO looks more like a reincarnation of some Kalouti in the setting of Counter Strike, but not the reincarnation of 1.6, which oldpage will cry tears of joy and childishly happy face to fill the REP, laying bombs. It rather smacks of a banal desire to cut money for the same game for the third time, as would be sad as that sounds Another thing I want to say - GO is very ambiguous in terms of its scall. I.e. developers, for example, wanted to add in a new game mods from the old games that were very popular. This well. But they added for some reason only the GunGame mode - it is here we must pay tribute, implemented well and about no less popular ZombieMod, DeathRun, JailBreak somehow forgot. It seems that the developers do not know how to make the game was close in spirit to the original, but it has pleased the fans of modern soulless postrelushka and add a little bit of everything in the blind hope that this trick will work. Now added, for example, GunGame. Here graton pulled. Well. The REP and iCloud too. But what pushed statistics and ranks these ing. Added new weapon. Why dog on earth, added, everything seems so normal it was. But no - added some idiotic tactical grenades-blende, some Molotov cocktails, which, BL**u, I've never let nobody uses zapili some popsource trailers on YouTube that all so spot on and crap - Oh, what a new counter-Strick soap-cool, go-ka przekazu and get the cannon in TF2. But the whole point of the game is that not myltse, and not even in puschka! Here such pies. Well, something like that. I think of my words and colour illustrations can in principle be what is no idea of Global Offensive. Actually, to make it even with the beta, then I even review I wanted to write, but somehow it never happened. In General, after the beta, not much has changed. Popisil nasty bugs, added new pictures to the main menu (Oh yeah), all other nonsense - but the game itself remains the same. And even then, at the stage of beta, you can understand what is still feil. Because Valve have tried to keep up with two rabbits and make a game that would love and ardent fans of the series, and fans of the new-fangled postrelushka. And chip, fellas, that, for example, those lovers of the postrelushka will not find in the "new" game is none favorite Blokov or hurricane some gameplay or killstreaks, equipment, single campaign in General, starburst solid, and only. And the old farts in the new game will not find the spirit of the old school, old models of weapons, any hints, rasprygat and other joys of life. And it is not clear to me, boys, for whom this game is made. And no, I'm not saying this game is bad, not at all, it is able to inspire, and not even for one night, and maybe even someone to buy the box with the game, which will be even smell good - but from the Studio named Valve everybody has come to expect more. Summing up short, so to say, the verdict, CS:GO is a game for a generation who does not know what B-5-1 and dablack. The only question is, lol, do I need itself GO to this generation.

review: For someone who played Counter-Strike for years, Counter-Strike Global Offensive is the succesion of that legendary game. VALVe perfectly knew that people wanted the real gameplay of Counter-Strike, and they did it good in CS:GO. The gamemodes are awesome, especially the matchmaking. Overwatch is something revolutionary to avoid cheaters, but there are still some that are not respecting fair-play. I recommend CS:GO to every people who want to see what a real FPS is.

review: I just noticed that I haven't recommended this yet. Well, not much to say eitherways. It's not like it's my favourite online FPS of all time or anything! I never played much of the previous games of the franchise but I think I can safely say that CS: GO is a huge improvement in comparison to the previous games, not only in terms of graphical fidelity but also in terms of gameplay, map design, weapon design and overall everything. You know how Valve is eitherways, even though it was Hidden Path Entertainment who developed CS: GO I believe Valve still has some saying on how they did it and how they keep on improving it. The game still is regularly updated, mostly due to community feedback and competetive gamers and profissional players feedback and suggestions. They not only keep optimizing the maps but also they keep tweaking each weapon which is both good and bad, it's mainly bad because it will take some time to get used to how the gun works post patch. I only have some small complaints about the game, the matchmaking system and the hit registration on servers seems to be pretty bad, I've heard from other people that in LAN games CS: GO hit registrations are perfect, one of the best, if not the best out there. Other than that I'm hyped to see how the game will progress and how the hardcore community will react to future updates. Counter Strike: Global Offensive is obviously not a game for everyone, if you're looking for a casual experience you're better off playing Call of Duty or Battlefield, CS: GO requires time, practice and skill. That said, I cannot recommend this game enough, I simply love it.

Counter Terrorists will have the objective to Defuse a Bomb when it gets planted or rescue the Hostages to a safe zone. Customized Weapons are also a good feature. 10/10 I find this as good as TF2

review: This version is a shame to the Counter Strike franchise, terrible map design where all ways to the bombsites are extremely claustrophobic and makes the game extremely CT sided together with powerfull smokes and fire grenades, not to mention useless flashbangs dont help the T side at all, bullet spread is completely wrong and overdone, you can spray 30 bullets into an opponent and only hit 1 or 2 bullets and skilled players are no longer able to clutch 1 vs X situations compared to CS 1.6, unbalanced weapons like MAG7 and P90, wallbanging was for the most part "removed", and sound positioning is terrible too. There are just too many wrong things with this game, if it wasnt for the skins and market system and valve spending money on tournaments this game would have never become popular. Hope this game stops being supported and valve releases a new proper version with help of the competitive community.

It's the purest FPS shooter that money can buy. No killstreaks, no deathstreaks, no commander mode, no marksman bonuses, nothing. You buy a gun, aim it at someone's head, and BANG; the person with the highest skill level level will make it out alive. That's why the game is still so popular. If you enjoy the FPS genre, do yourself a favour... Buy this game.

FPS taken to a whole new level, realistic and requires real skill. You say you've played "insert fps game here" and say you are good, really good? Well don't get your hopes up because you suck here! Mechanics are good, game play is good, learning curve is not that complicated, you just need a lot of practice. Like a lot. P.S. Always carry a defusal kit.. or take from a dead teammate.

review: I've created a strong love for this game, there is something about it to where it doesn't get boring because there's always a great feeling making big plays and being in a 1v3, having your heart racing and being extremely excited you just want more. Im here to say this game is not for everyone but if you want to get into it this is the time. There's always plenty of new players flowing in and learning the game. There are some things that really will ruin your experience and that would be cheaters. Don't be a cheater its good to know the game and gain the skill insteasd of using hacks to improve gameplay. But when you get a truly good match its 15-15 you know you want to win and its super tense thats when you get a love for the game. But if i were you i would truly try to stay away from matchmaking once your past eagle simply because there's to many cheaters and its gotten worse of the years. so i highly recommend deathmatching alot play matchmaking while your unranked or a silver for practice. learn angles, spray control, nade flash spots, team flashing tends to happen alot make sure you avoid that was much as possble. But i highly recommend this game its countless hours of fun expecially with your friends. But the number one rule is never give up your going to die alot there's always going to be better players then you thats why you indure your lack of skill and set a goal to be better then those other players. Also always be positive while doing a competitive matchmake never say good game (gg) just because you lost 3 rounds in a row that kills your attitude and your teams! Which will only guarentee a loss. Also have good sportsmanship like, nice shot (ns), good luck have fun (glhf), good half (gh). And remember this games a learning curve so never give up! because you will excel at the game at some point. So just jeep deathmatching learning map calls gaining game sense and learning angles and NEVER let someone bring you down ignore people who trash talk and make you feel like . always stay positive because you will be big someday... you've just got to own it.

review: Valve serves up a no frills, pure skills, truly enjoyable and all-consuming shooter for your fragging needs. Although, if you are in competitive mode, expect to get owned (which makes the ranking system a point of pride for the community). As a ten year cs noob, I implore you to buy this title: Ziggy-Zoggy, Ziggy-Zoggy, One of us!

review: Counter-Strike is well-known to be the best competitive modern First Person Ego Shooter. Obviously 'competitive' is stressed. This means the game is very hard for the beginners, because of its depth. You simply cannot jump into that game without any knowledge or guide... you can do that on casual ones tough. And there are too many of these out there. E-Sports is also the priority of the game. It is also responsible for the extreme balance and balance fixes that Valve takes care off. This is a significant factor to keep the game enjoyable on the long term. Of course you can run and gun with a P90 or camp with the autosniper, which is easy, but good players can defend themselves well. Some have great crosshair placement to eliminate the threat with a simple click: - "Boom. Headshot." Not only crosshair placement, but also the recoil control, the positioning, the movement or let's just shorten it, the whole experience and skills can differenciate a CS veteran and a simple amateur. These skills and experince need to be trained otherwise you end up being punished. Badly. The main focus of the game is the competitive mode, where you play with four teammates against five enemies for up to an hour. Talking about teammates, playing with friends is the best thing you can do there. In most games the team isn't as important as in CS:GO. Everybody is important since it's 5vs5 and not more. YOU NEED TO COMMUNICATE. This is the actual key to victory aswell as having a glorious match! There are too many strangers who do destroy the game experience and like every competitive game, they can be toxic. After winning a while, you'll get a rank which allows you to play with people with the same skill set as you do. Well, most of the time; I'm talking about smurfers. Those aren't a long term problem tough - they'll get to a certain rank and then it's useless, but can be used for trolling... Luckily I haven't met many trolls. Back to the ranks: I have a certain statement about these. I wish they added team ranking aswell as solo rank just as they did in Dota 2. Oh, they should definitively add more clan functions like the other game I mentioned. Hacks are a minor problems there - Overwatch will take care of it, but someone has to suffer until the hacker gets banned... Many outsiders think that CS has bad graphics. I don't think so since CS:GO. They're decent and acceptable and every other thing makes this "problem" up. The source engine is not bugfree of course, but is has been proven to be relatively reliable. It should not be forgotten that CS can run on many hardware flawless. Skins and operations are not required to be paid - you'll get drops and if your friend has an operation, you still can play with him/her. Skins can be obtained by simply playing, betting through CSGOlounge, buying from the steam market, steam trading and by opening boxes. The boxes require keys, which cost 2 Euros each. You can get a really expensive skins, mediocre skins and skins that you wish you could undo it. Chances are that you end up at the third option and are trying to build a time machine. Operations are seasons passes with maps provided by the community. These only last for a while. I must say that is good idea that the community can earn money from valve by providing maps and skins... when it's successful enough. All in all CS:GO is a good buy if you're willing to spend enough time on it. It'll come to fruition and become a rewarding game. Some matches can ruin it tough. Valve proves again for being one of the greatest video game developer.

review: Counter Strike is a very nice game Each game has its advantages but also its disadvantages Advantages: You have many options to play Counter Strike. You can make competitions, can be played on normal and abnormal funny servers You get temporarily weapons or boxes that you can use in the game Disadvantages: Disadvantages include the Steam or Valve occasionally have problems with the servers ..... It has also cheaters who get nothing in life to the series and want to achieve something in the game Although it has more pros and cons but I think that's enough I recommend it to anyone but do not become addicted;) So have fun with it

review: CS:GO (Counter-Strike: Global Offensive) is an (Online) First Person Shooter game. The game is very simular to the other Counter-Strike games out there, but this one is special, it has new maps, new types of playstyle, a great community & ofcourse skins. It's basically the type of game that you could play for hours and still never get bored of it (thanks to a growing community, new maps etc.) This game isn't a hardcore ''MLG-Pro 720 NoScope'' Simulator like Call of Duty (No offense to the CoD community) This is basically an awesome game. Now to the part why you should buy it.. As I wrote before, you could play for hours and still enjoy it. This game is not too expensive yet not too cheap. It could get expensive, if you get into buying skins and such, but that's just your choice. GAMEPLAY: Gun sounds are good you could recognize every gun, and pretty realistic. (Atleast in my opinion) Sound quality is good, especially if you have good quality headphones. (Footsteps etc. is good to listen to for improved gameplay) Aiming and such is very diffrent to other games but is easy to master if you change your crosshair and your sensitivity to what you like and feel comfortable with. ________________________________________________________ Overall a very good game. Worth the money. 9.8/10 - ChipFlexes

review: CG:GO is a blast to the past; a nod to the old-school days of the late 90's, and it's more than welcome in my gaming livery. Whilst I love COD and Titanfall, there's something uniquely compelling about starting up a match of CS:GO, with it's deliberate and stayed pacing, and it's risk vs reward gameplay mechanics, it's no wonder this game has taken off for the 3rd time in it's lifecycle. It's popular right now for a reason, and that reason is good. A must-buy.

review: Favorite current FPS but not all time. All of the game modes that the game offers are fun if you enjoy the game and often made updates to the game are satisfying (Operation packs). Aside from cheaters and griefers, who you'll come across surely, matchmaking is my favorite along side with Casual. Community servers offer a lot of fun maps and game modes as well such as: zombie; de_surf; de_rats; etc. The game offers a bonus mini-game which is called "Unboxing A Case". If you choose to play it you will often be left with disappointment and questions raised by your family such as "Where has all the money gone?". Some say the ecstasy you recieve from winning some of the rarest items in the game is worth the tears you cry after opening some of these cases. Legend says that by selling the most valuable item recieved from the "Unboxing A Case" game you'll have enough money to buy ever game on Steam. 10/10, would open more.

review: Counter-Strike's newborn. Weapon handling and Movement are nearly perfect. No Aiming down Sights (besides the Sniperrifles) and really hard Recoil/Bulletspread that you can learn to control. It has a hard learning curve but after some time you can get the hang of it. The competitve Matchmaking is really easy to use and you get most of the time people who are in your skill group. After 10 competitive wins you get thrown into a skillgroup. Now you can rank up or get downranked, depends on your skill ingame. You can collect Skins for you weapons. They don't have a advantage. There are some skins called Stattrak that you can just get through opening cases with a key. They have a little killcounter on the weapon that well, count your kills that you made with that weapon. Cases can drop , just like skins, after a match. (BUT NO AFTER EVERY MATCH AND THERE IS A DROP LIMIT PER WEEK!) If you really want a fancy dandy skin, like a M4A4 Asiimov or a special knife(rarest thing you can get) you can either gamble and open cases with bought keys, buy your favourite skins on the Steam market or use the trade-up contract. With the contract (that you can find in your Global offensive inventory ingame) you can trade 10 weapons from one collection for a new better quality weapon from that collection.

review: Okay, time for a real review. This is the first Counter-Strike game I actually got into, and I never realized what I'd been missing all these years. The mechanics of this game make it unlike any other franchise avalible today. But with a game this big, that just means more people and more problems. I'm am currently Distinguished Master Guardian at the time of writing this review, and I can firmly say that each game I play in matchmaking is either against at least one smurf (someone of a high rank on a new account playing against lower ranked players) or a hacker. Sure, there are external matchmaking services like ESEA, CEVO, or FaceIT, but the in-game matchmaking should still be playable. That being said, if you don't already own this game, I would highly suggest getting it, but if you find that you like it a lot, and want to get better, be prepared to play a lot. This is not a game you can just pick up and be amazing at like Call of Duty or any other arcade shooter. You actually have to invest time into this game if you want to play competive matches and get better at the game. For one thing, you shoot while you are moving, and you also need to learn how to control the spray pattern of your weapons, because bullets DO NOT stay on your crosshair. Closing words, this is a fantastic game, with it's flaws of course. Very solid gameplay mechanics that helped shape PC FPSs today, but also ran by a company which is known for not being transparent with their customers. If you really want to get into this game and learn what it's all about, find some friends and start playing, because soon you won't be able to go 3 days without playing a match. glhf.

I've lost a game with over 50 frags. Other then that, the trolls, and general rude people that you'll occasionally meet on any game, It's a good game overall.

Swedish trolls who will  your day so hard youll want to just roll into a ball and cry for the rest of the day 4. Complete noobs in medium/high ranks, about whom youll question yourself how did they got that rank Also rage some more when the  64 tick valve servers decide that that headshot on a still standing player is actually a miss. Get into the exciting action of unboxing crates, as you spend tons of money hoping to get a rare knife, or a nice skin, when all you get are  blue skins which cost 3 cents each. Although great game, 10/10

review: This is a super awesome and fun game that reminds me of CoD: Modern Warfare(better known as Cod4). Anyone who has been playing FPSs for years will understand what I am saying, and generally everyone agrees that CoD4 was one of the best franchise FPS games ever developed. While I don't think CS:GO is on the CoD4 level, it certainly does have that feel to it, and that's what draws me towards this game. The feeling I get from this game is one of simplicity and functionality; something too many game corporations out there continue to skip right past. All they want to do is make these crazy FPS games with all these unnecessary gadgets and "killstreaks" and tons of other crap, when in reality, all the game community wants is a simple, stable, fun, and hardcore matchmaking powerhouse. For me, CS:GO hits all of the high points, while only hitting maybe one or two of the low points. Get this game.

review: Counter Strike: Global Offensive is unlike any other FPS in it's genre with it's old school CS1.6-ish gun mechanics and similar maps from it's predecessor games. You play the role of a terrorist, whose job is to get to a bomb site, plant the bomb there and wait for it to detonate or kill every Counter-Terrorist preventing you from planting that bomb site. On the other hand, you play as a Counter-Terrorist whose job is to prevent the bomb from being planted at any of the bomb sites either by elimination of the aforementioned terrorists or by defusal of the bomb. The game may be viewed as one that has gun mechanics of its own, completely unique from what one may be used to in most FPS games and that it takes a little getting used to the whole game before one can start getting kills. That, and it's all about reaction times, camping the right spots, watching out for your buddies and what not. One minute you're winning and the next thing you know, your buddies have been killed by a flanking SMG bearer. In addition, the game's competitive mode and its integration with the skill system is what makes it and breaks it. The skill system determines your skill and puts you up against players of the same skill level so to ensure a fun user experience however, this very feature is what sometimes breaks it. How? People who buy dual accounts just to play with new players. That's how. All in all, the game's cost is perfectly balanced and no pay2win aspect influences the game in any way. All items that can be bought with money are purely cosmetic. Thumbs up, indeed!

review: Well, first off all. I now know the russian language. I feel pretty comfy with russians now, since im getting forced to teamplay with those.. (Thats a good thing.. Right?) I think I should point something out of CS:GO. - Wannabe pros, who think everyone who kills 'em are hacking.. - Can people stop telling me what to do? - Alot of rage in this game, if you wanna do good every round. - Trolles, only because its "meta".. - Russians. - Russians. - Russians. - Russians... First thing first. The worst thing about this game, you some sort of need to communicate with your teammates, or I need that.. So im forced to learn fluent Russian, since they think the only language in this world is.. Russian.. After that being said, I can move on. People mocking around, telling me what to do is a D:/ Im doing it my way. You might disagree but I dont give a f**k. Trollers. Why is it cool to troll around? Derping to make you teammates rage.. I find it pretty common now adays.. Freakin spaaaaam.. -__- "Stfu, im hearing steps" Russian is not cool! After that being said im done. Some possitive feedback? Yeah.. Great FPS game with alot of tollerance. You need to aim quick, react quick and know each spot on each map. Great maps. You can always get better, and thats something I love. IMO, best FPS game right now. Love the competetive thing, with a different skill level in each rank. You arent a FPS lover before you own this game. BUYBUYBUY ;-) - See you around. eXo.

review: I've determined that Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is from another dimension. It's a game that doesn't need to exist. PC gamers are perfectly served by Counter-Strike: Source and CS 1.6 , content with the decade-something of tuning and attention those games have received. But here's GO: full of doppelganger Desert Eagles and de_dust deja vu, quantum-leaping from some parallel timeline whose game industry briefly intersected with ours. Playing it is like running into a college crush at the supermarket. You immediately notice differences. Oh, you're married? Your hair looks different. But that experience of reconnecting is pleasantthey're mostly still the person you admired during geology. In other words, GO's familiarity helps and hurts. Minor deviations from the CS you might've known or loved are easy to identify. The MP5 is now the MP7, but it lacks the same clicky report and underdoggy this is all I can afford, please don't kill me personality. The TMP is replaced by the MP9. Ragdoll physics don't persist after death, curiously. You can't attach a suppressor to the M4 for some reason. I'm not particularly bothered by this stuff; I don't need the MP5 reproduced precisely as it existed in 2006 or 2009 to live a fulfilling life. What does bug me are some small but significant changes to firing feedback. When you shoot someone in GO, they don't wince. There's a sneeze of blood, and audio that conveys that you're hitting them if you're within a certain range. But they don't do this , and I don't understand the decision to omit a flinch animation on character models. Especially at long range, it takes a little more effort and squinting than it should to tell if I'm hitting someone or not. And counterintuitively, bullet tracers, new in this version of CS, are an unreliable source of feedback. They seem to trail the path of your actual bullet by a few microseconds. With rifles and SMGs, my eyes would wander away from my enemy and crosshairs "what I should be watching" and try to interpret where my bullets were falling based on the slightly-delayed, streaky particle effects. The small upside to tracers is that they mitigate camping a bit.

review: Before i get hate from this review, i want to say i dont hate this game, further more i would not recommend it to any one. but i will still play it everyonce in awhile. First the community is very mean. They take this game as if its real life so if you do buy this game be ready to get yeld at by a ton of russian guys. Next there is no reason to play this game. what i mean by this is that theres not much unlocks from what ive played so far other then new weapon skins. So you really only play for gameplay which i will go over soon. Then theres the cash grab. When you need to buy keys to unlock cases for new weapons that the only real change is the skin on the weapon. I do actually think there are some ways to unlock weapon skins for free but if i pay 15$ for a game, i want the whole game. This is not a free to play game so i should never have to pay more money to make my weapon look less generic and there have been times in game where i was called a Noob and other stupid names for not having a weapon skin...... this feature is out right stupid but made popular due to youtube case unboxings. Gameplay is mostly good. Hard to get good at if you have been playing games like arma or call of duty. Global Offensive's gameplay is super simple but extremely tatical. Simple because you are limited (Which is some cases is not bad) to just kneeing down, cant use iron sights, and etc. then tatical because....... i cant explain it to truely experience it you would need to play the game for yourself but i think its things like not being able to regen health, which doesnt sound big at first but duing most of the gamemodes your health is very critical and a couple of shots can screw you over for the rest of the match. Theres no classes, everytime you die or in the start of a new game you purchase your gear for money which is easy to get in most cases. Yet again i do not hate this game but i guess i was wanting more out of it and the whole cases and keys thing really made me mad that a company like valve would do that. All in all its not a bad game and i would recommend looking at other reviews of this game before you purchase. And if you do buy this game chances are your not going to fell like you just got robbed, chances are you will love it like most of steam, or you may turn out like me and just see Counter-Strike: Global Offensive as not a bad game, but not good.

review: The Counter-Strike series are anything but noob-friendly, requiring you to do well your first two turns to keep expensive weaponry, to keep up your killing sprees. A steady eye is well-rewarded, even when you are behind. This is why many people who have played a few games in Counter-Strike just quit. It's too frustrating to end up every game last on the scoreboard, especially when you are match-made with people who do this for a living, and have been doing so for the last five years or so. However, after dying continuously, I found myself slowly rising higher on the scoreboards, having easier times guessing where enemies will be camping, and learning where to throw my smokes and flashes for optimal value. This feeling, when you no longer end up with a K/D of 0, but .75 instead, makes you want to do better. It makes you want to rise to the top elite, and it's something I haven't experienced with any other game before. For comparison, Team Fortress 2 is a really noob-friendly game, basically giving you a toolset with which you can literally do well without even looking their way (I am talking to you, gunslinger) or by only aiming in the general area your enemies are (Pyro). Counter-Strike is so much more rewarding than that, and it just feels so amazing getting better and better. It feels so amazing going into competitive and winning that match, with a point difference of 1. If you are thinking about buying this game, you should consider asking yourself, "Am I willing to change my lifestyle to fit this in?". If you won't, it will be a waste of money to buy this game, but if you will, it will be a waste of your life not buying it. This game is a kidnapper, and it'll give you Stockholm syndrome. 10/10 doesn't have hats.

review: Since I played 1.6 and stopped it, I thought I would never come back to a Counter-Strike game again.. I WAS WRONG! Saw the game on sale, flipped my  when I couldn't buy it when it was low and bought it at full price. 10/10 Anyway, it really brings the competitive scene that has been missing in Counter-Strike (for casual players). Matchmaking mode is really fun, especially when you get at least decent teammates. My friends list became twice larger ever since I started playing this game. I've had my laughs, I've had my cries in this game, but I still can't get enough of it. You constantly want to improve and get a bigger rank. There are also really good alternative versions of Matchmaking, called PUGS (Pick-Up Games). Really addictive for casual and competitive FPS players.

review: I really like Counter Strike, and this entry is no exepcion, everything is good now and it has a lot more room for expansion. But please, create an East Server so the rest of Europe can have more fun while playing... For more than 20 game in streak, I only listen to Russian, and since a medium percentage of them hates "America", they refuse to speak English, and this is totally unsocial and breaks the communication in game, ending up to a serious problem that leads the player into frustation and despair, summing up in a deffeat... This is the dark side of the community in the CS:GO scene and it can be easily resolved by creating a new Server. With this said I'm not being racist since I'm not that and I have friends in all over the world, but it hurts the community to see the player personal beliefs and cultural influences get inside a game, that is used to relief stress and to socialize a bit more with the world. Dramatic actions should be insued Lord Gabe, just make it happen...

The long-anticipated sequel to the popular Battlefield franchise, this gem features vivid, colorful graphics, a large assortment of carefully balanced weapons and original, never-before-seen maps such as de_dust and de_dust2. As a game of pure skill and strategy, CS:GO also includes a bonus Competitive Mode, where players worldwide can compete against Brazilians. The perfected Matchmaking system will assign new players to a random skill group and match them in a team with and against hackers and hardened Counter-Strike veterans, always resulting in a unique -raping experience. As an added bonus, players with poor internet connection will receive top priority in matchmaking. -Counter Strike Global Offensive in a nut shell

review: Hard game for beginners but eventually it's fun. This is the first FPS game I've played that demands careful shots thanks to recoil than bullet spamming enemies once they're in your crosshair. The bullet penetration adds the real-world flavour and there's even a warmup round for shooting just about anywhere even that filthy hostage if you're on terrorist side. 10/10 Would recommend for challenge-seeking/competitive gamers mostly but not so for the easy-going casual FPS gamers who prefer continuous bullet spam.

But in the end, pay to get more items. 12/10 - "Spend money simulator." PS: It's fun.

Insane things (even sometimes called "people" by their friends) Good for losing hope in humanity, then regaining it for a max of 2 random games, after about 5-9 games of starting to lose every hope you had, ever of humanity being good. (If you are planning to join the marines) This is realy good to semi-train your ears for unprovoked yelling. And ofc this is a fun game, even better if you are playing with friends... awsum sauce.

I have been so mad about losing my ranks it just gets to the point i want to just quit. but i keep playing and I get better ranks. This is a very team based game so make sure you have some type of team to play with you or you might get a guy who wants to tk and mess up the game and purposly make you lose the game. I have ran into a couple hackers but im not complaining,also css had a lot of hackers that i was getting tierd of. Overall I really enjoy playing this game and buying skins to help me play better and also to brag. NiceBlueWolf :D

review: CS:Go certainly is a hard game to master, so if you answer yes to any of these following questions: -You like the shooting system of Call of Duty -You like to stay in cover and recover health -You love games that are P2W Then I'd not recommend this to you, since CS:Go is the exact opposite of that. There is recoil, and tapping doesn't make it easier (with some exceptions, that is). Like many FPS games, CS:Go has a system which indicates your health. There are no weapons you can buy, you can only buy weapon skins on the steam marketplace, these skins do not add anything apart from the skin itself. TL;DR: It's a good FPS game, definitely worth the 14 euros.

review: Probably the worst game I've played in the past year. Recoil patterns make little to no sense, no aiming down the sights (YEAH LEMME JUST HIPFIRE THIS GUY FROM 1500 METERS AWAY), servers lag often and horribly. Game actually makes me want to just off myself sometimes. Still, there's no other competitive fps games and it's fun to troll the idiots that take video games way too seriously

review: You can set the water on fire. You can survive gunshots to the head. You can tank a grenade from point-blank and still survive. You can chase chickens. Chickens can(t) chase you. You can only kill fishes if you throw a nade in the water. Shooting them with guns of any caliber will not harm them at all (Why no fish scales-made armor?! ) You can fall from 20 meters and still run perfectly fine after that. You can get shot in your arm and still be 100% accurate. You can lose all of your money(real money,for skins) and not get anything good. Digital knives actually cost more than real knives. You can lose your mind. You can't swim. Chickens. 10/10

review: Even though i personally would like even sharper graphics for such a slick game, this game clearly proves that counter Strike Source is some Outdated Junk by now. And proves that the same formula that appeared in CS 1.5 back in the day is enjoyable, if made properly, still to this very day. I used to play CS:S just for target practice when idling for random reasons myself, but this game is complete enough to drag me into it; even though again, i find there to be a massive lack of things like Camos, the good old killing spree game mode (Where you can spawn many times; it's about getting the most kills against the enemy team (A clusterfu*k) to win) and the classic zombie modes. So yes, i recommend this game. And even more so when i can get it 75% off because of the winter deal of 2013/2014! By selling some of the first camos you get, you can even make your money back. 6.5/10 (because i am a strict rater!)

review: It doesn't matter how good you are any more, you will be judged solely on the market value of your inventory. You should have one of your several Karambit knives equipped at all times and inspect it in game whenever possible to ensure that anybody who is spectating you is aware that you are aware you're being watched and you are absolutely showing off that extremely pricey knife you own. Your stats are irrelevant now, most people aren't even aware that the 'Tab' key actually has a function in game. It doesn't matter if you don't know what 'eco' means. Fuck team work. You have a 'BOOM' AWP in your inventory, as long as you have $4750 cash in game you're buying an AWP. You will mock anyone who decided to give their Nova the 'Walnut' skin. Same goes for people who give their FAMAS the 'Doomkitty' skin. You will only equip 'StatTrak' weapons and the first thing you do when you acquire one is go on an idle server and get several hundred kills on AFK players in order to pad the stats so you don't look like a total n00b. Whenever a new case is released you will buy as many cases and keys as it takes in order to acquire 'an Exceedingly Rare Special Item!' Disregard the fact that you will end up spending three times as much as you otherwise would've by buying this directly from the market, it's only your parents' money after all. Besides, your birthday is next month and Christmas/Easter/[insert public holiday here] is just around the corner so you won't have to wait too long before you can blow more of their money on digital goods. You will also plaster ever single skin you own with multiple unseemly stickers with the intention of creating a unique skin for your weapon. Your 'Easy Peasy' and 'Ninjas in Pyjamas' stickers totally don't look ridiculous whatsoever. You will also name tag all of your weapons in order to add that final personal touch to the weapon you invested so much time and money in. You don't own an AK or an M4 any more, you only own weapons with names like 'xXx OG Snoop Dogg' and 'dubstep warrior'. You now have all the knowledge required to start playing CS:GO. Go forth and procure many skins of great value.

review: Revan was only 23 years old. He loved CS:GO so much. He had most of the achievements and items. He prayed to Gaben every night before bed, thanking him for the inventory he's been given. "CS:GO is love," he says, "CS:GO is life." His elder Dragon hears him and calls him a silver scrublord. He knows his elder is just jealous of his son's devotion to Gabe. He calls him a console peasant. He slaps him and sends him to sleep. He's crying now and his face hurts. He lays in bed, and it's really cold. He feels a warmth moving towards him. He looks up. It's Gabe! He's so happy, Gabe whispers into Revan's ear, "Try your chances... Open a case." Gaben grabs Revan with his powerful dev-team hands and puts him on his hands and knees. He's ready. Revan opens his pockets for Gabe. Gabe puts his hands deep into Revan's pockets. It costs so much, but Revan does it for CS:GO. Revan can feel his wallet emptying as his eyes start to water. He accepts the terms and conditions. Revan wants to please Gabe. Gaben lets out a mighty roar as he fills Revan's computer with keys. Revan opens all the cases and gets nothing worth anything at all.

review: Counter Strike Global Offensive is a... let's face it, if you don't know what this is you need to climb out from under that rock. CS:GO (as it's often abbreviated to) is rewarding to those with skill, and punishing to the casual gamer when played in competitive mode. To get the best of out this game you need to invest time and effort to learn the maps and the spray patterns of the guns. Watching players with high levels of skill is like watching a football match on TV. Even if you don't like the game you appreciate people who have skill at this game because you can clearly see when a player knows their stuff and when they don't. This game is more of a sport hence it's overwhelming appearances in Esports tournaments like ESL and Dreamhack etc. Overall if you are looking for a bit of fun for an hour or so, STAY AWAY FROM THIS GAME! To get the best from this, you need the practice regularly and get a team of people to play with, then... it's brilliant.

Would reccomend it to anyone who wants to play a shooting game but a tad more slow-paced and more tactical. If you want just a quick game you can do a casual or deathmatch. The competitive scene for this game is great and really expresses the tactics and teamwork of this game. Without that your just a bunch of idiots with guns! 10/10

review: Amazing game, I play it everyday and have been for 2 years. From Competative to casual, or even community servers, theres something here for every FPS player. Most people will enjoy it, but it is a very different FPS to alot of others. I would rate this game 8/10 and you should for sure pick this game up if you havent. Updated 27/03/2015

review: Even though i personally would like even sharper graphics for such a slick game, this game clearly proves that counter Strike Source is some Outdated Junk by now. And proves that the same formula that appeared in CS 1.5 back in the day is enjoyable, if made properly, still to this very day. I used to play CS:S just for target practice when idling for random reasons myself, but this game is complete enough to drag me into it; even though again, i find there to be a massive lack of things like Camos, the good old killing spree game mode (Where you can spawn many times; it's about getting the most kills against the enemy team (A clusterfu*k) to win) and the classic zombie modes. So yes, i recommend this game. And even more so when i can get it 75% off because of the winter deal of 2013/2014! By selling some of the first camos you get, you can even make your money back. 6.5/10 (because i am a strict rater!)

review: CS:go is a fast paced action game with many modes, many skins, many knives, and alot of Competitive players trying to go for the top of the hill. Back when I was involved in the beta, there were few players that I knew, but alot of great enhancments from 1.6 and Source. It did take a while to get used to the new engine, but as I progressed into the game, I got used to the new hitboxes. The Arms Deal Update - this update introduced new ways to customize your weapons with different items from either map packs, collections, or tournament events. Trying to get the rarest can sometimes get easy or rare, cheap or expensive. Knives are hard to get, but also are some of the Covert rifles. Why do I enjoy this game? I am able to play with many other players of similar skill and more of the updates are helping making this game alot better with the Reddit community having a voice.

And when you're last alive ofcourse, your whole team judges every move you make. and when you get into a 1v5 clutch situation you get rekt from behind.. Don't forget the votekick system, they don't like newbies. So prepare to get kicked within 1.5 seconds on a competative match, I do recommend it but pls go play 200 casual b4 you join any competative match, OR YOU COULD JUST BE AN IGNORANT C*** AND DON'T LISTEN TO ALL THE BULL**** I JUST WROTE, JUST JOIN A IN COMPATEIV MATCH AND LEAN ON YOUR VOICE CHAT KEY AND SPAM DARUDE SANDSTORME AND CHEEKI BREEKI ALL OVER DA ING DE_DUST 2 MAP, WHY?

review: Valve Hasn't dissapointed me in 14 years of playing Counter Strike, Counter Strike Source, and now Counter Strike Global Offensive. This is another great title, that will keep the community of Counter Strike Enthusists entertained as long as the franchise has exsisted. If you have seen the rest, CS has never dissapointed, where to start, the awesome drops you receive from competitive or from playing on community servers out there, new skins. The Ultra rare Butterfly knife skin is what lots are looking for. Overwatch is the newest and best system out there to keep out the cheaters who think they can win at all costs, I am glad that Overwatch is out there, I can't wait til it branches out to all Counter strike series. Play CSGO and you will enjoy it.

You will pwn people, dominate them, and get the most beloved Global Elite rank. You will comprehend the euphoric feelings when you get the next rank. Unless you're a skrub.

review: First time playing CS in general. No matter what people say about the CSGO community.... sigh.... I just keep coming back. If you get lucky you're a hacker or a smurf. If you headshot deagle you're a cheater. Everyone's favorite thing to say when you're on the losing team : "Enjoy your ban in hacker!" Everyone's favorite thing to say when you're on the winning team: " Get ." Arguments in CSGO : 1. "You're sh** , enjoy your rank up fa* " *when you're a higher rank and they are silver* 2. "Add my main if you think I'm a hacker." *When you're on an alt account and everyone is calling you a hacker* 3."I play on ESEA KID , get on my level." *self explanatory* 4."How did you shoot me through the smoke? HACKER." *rant continues back and forth about how the shot was made* 5."Good job DDOS noobs you knew you can't win against us. Keep blaming valve" *When out of nowhere every other round is being DDOS and the losing team catches up and wins* 6."Ya'll gonna get rekt guys gg, hf" *warmup round other team is being cocky, arguments in chat back and forth * 7. "I'm done with this game .... stupid broken fu***** game ." * when your team mate gets shot and complains * Overall this is the best game ever and I love the community. Dont hesitate buying this . United we stand hackers,smurfs,noobs,fraggers.

review: This game is worth paying $4 for when its on sale, you'll get your moneys worth. Though the casual servers are usually populated by mic spamming trolls and mongaloids. Or you can hop onto competitive, and if you're lucky you'll get a game without 1. a hacker 2. goober teammates 3. trolls who are out to sabotage or 4. whiners. People aside, the mechanics are slightly horrendous. Alot of the time when you hit someone it won't register. This is due to alot of factors (latency, 64 tick servers and high variation among other things). This effects gameplay tremendously. It seems to be luck based rather than skill based which is kind of cheap in an FPS. Another thing that erks me about how this game was setup.. the skins. Basically they take ideas from the community, implement them into the game and charge 2.49 for a chance of getting it in their crates. Seems really lazy on their part. If they did this with alternative gun models I wouldn't mind so much, but its just 1 model thats coloured differently. It seems like they took alot of elements from 1.6 and source and mashed them into this game. I liked the customization of Counterstrike:Source. You could really make the game your own. Your own sprays, your own UI, your own guns etc. I also loved the accuracy, and feel of cs 1.6. This game has neither of them. I don't know, this game seems more like a cash cow then anything else. If you're a hardcore FPS player its worth giving a shot but at $15 I really wouldn't recommend it.

review: Having this being Valve's latest CS game made so far, I would say they did quite a good job on this one. More new guns, new maps, new game modes, new graphics and animations make this game even more fun to play. But what I HATE about this game is the fact that there are way TOO MANY hackers ruining all the fun. I can't really tell whether I would recommend this or not but if you have always liked the CS series so far, you'll definitely love this one!

review: This game is so fun to play if you've played CSS (Counter Strike Source) then you will love CS:GO with the awesome graphics which make the game fun and the slight realism towards the game "By contrast, CS is totally egalitarian. Everyone has access to the same items, and players aren't ranked. Nobody cares if you play four hours a day, seven days a week. All that matters is how well you negotiate the next firefight. You might take out half of the enemy team... but then again, a much less skilled player might blind you with a flashbang grenade and unload his top-of-the-line shotgun into your skull. It's not unusual to see a good player climb to the top of the scoreboard only to decline back into mediocrity. In CS, skill and alertness are your primary weaponsand when you get tired, there are no unlockables to help you keep your edge."

review: Classic Counter-Strike for the modern age. Taking the feel and style of 1.6 with the graphical and technical improvements of Source, CS:GO makes a strong case to be the best Counter-Strike. A well done matchmaking system makes it easy to find matches with stock rules. This is furthered by the ability to choose between casual rules for when you want to practice and ranked competetitve mode with the original rules. And, should you still want the modded community servers, it's got that too. The eSports Community is alive and well with events like Dreamhack and multiple other major tournaments with massive prize pools, drawing in the top teams from around the world. Counter-Strike:Global Offensive also introduces a weapon skin drop system for customization and seasonal passes to support mapmakers. All in all, this is the best of Source and the best of 1.6 mashed together into one shiny, fluid, and amazing game. If you only are going to get one Counter-Strike, this is the one to get.

review: Graphics and game play are much better than the Counter-Strikes before it... but like all other CS games, playing online can be a bit hectic. Ive played online only a few times and realized that I dont possess the patience needed to play with others in the CS community. There are some that are real great competitive players out there and others that are screaming kids that you have to mute.. but I assure you that I'm neither one those. So, I enjoy casual play offline with bots from time to time.

review: It's worth your time, it's worth your money, it's worth shelving your life for 6 months to learn dem peeks by heart. But are YOU worth it? Seriously, it's the definitive competitive FPS experience and you WILL sink joyful hours into this beast. You'll learn the game in a fortnight, but somehow continue learning for years. The community is mostly friendly and welcomes newcomers, and most will gladly help you out taking the first few steps into each mode of the game and new aspects. If you're one of those guys who puts "family" before gaming, and usually only buys one or two games a year, CSGO will keep you engaged for a long, long time. /family not included./

review: This is probably the best shooter ever made. CS:GO has anything that was in the previous versions of CS, plus it adds awesome skins and item drops like crates. If you're lucky enough you can get rare items dropped, which you then can sell on the market. That being said, you not only have an awesome shooter with millions of maps, plenty game mods and brilliant matchmaking. In CS:GO you also have a cash-cow. Go idling, milk the cow, if you're lucky you'll get an awp skin. Or a knife model. In that case, you can quit your job and lay back.

review: It started back in the 8th grade when I was put in ELL. I was surrounded by  and no matter how much I begged the principal to let me out of there he kept telling me I was also  and there was no way I would suceed in life. I spent days in the ELL classroom learning with people I hated and puzzles I couldn't solve. Coloring inside the lines was not only unacheiveable but I had to watch the coolest kid in ELL Eli Chubin do every day. It wasn't fair I wasn't like the rest of these kids I could do 20 pull ups! If the principal wouldn't advance me to regular classes I would have to it myself. Using the problem solving skills that landed me in ELL I devised the plan to kill every other person in the class because then I have to be moved up, I mean they couldn't have a class just for 1 person right? I searched online to find out how other people did mass murders and it seemed like the most efficient way was with shooting the place up so I decided that was what I would do. I didn't know where to start though so I searched online once again to find out how all these murderers started. I quickly learned that it was violent video games was the thing that all these murderers had in common so I decided that must be the thing that makes killers. I then bought Counter Strike as I heard you could learn how to be a terrorist and played it every day after school. After a week of playing I felt the evil inside of me and I was ready to shoot up the school. Using what I had learned from Counter Strike and the guns I borrowed from my father I went into ELL that day and killed every kid in my class. As a result of that I got moved up into regular classes just like I hoped would happen. Without Counter Strike I would still be in ELL to this day.

review: I am happy to join with you today in what will go down in history as the greatest demonstration for freedom in the history of this game. 1/10 score years ago, a great American, in whose symbolic shadow we stand today, signed the Valve Game Submission Contract. This momentous decree came as a great beacon light of hope to millions of Terrorist slaves who had been seared in the flames of withering injustice. It came as a joyous daybreak to end the long night of their captivity. But two years later, the Terrorist is still is not free. Two years later, the life of the Terrorist is still sadly crippled by the manacles of the M4A1-S and the chains of Counter-Terrorists. Two years later, the Terrorist lives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity. Two years later, the Terrorist is still languished in the corners of Counter-Terrorist society and finds himself an exile in his own land. And so we've come here today to dramatize a shameful condition. In a sense we've come to our nation's capital to cash a check. When the architects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the Trade-Up Contract, they were signing a promissory note to which every player was to fall heir. This note was a promise that all men, yes, Terrorist men as well as Counter-Terrorist men, would be guaranteed the "unalienable Rights" of "Deagle, AWP, and the pursuit of Bomb Sites." It is obvious today that Counter Strike has defaulted on this promissory note, insofar as her players of Terrorism are concerned. Instead of honoring this sacred obligation, Counter Strike has given the Terrorist people a bad check, a check which has come back marked "insufficient funds." But we refuse to believe that the bank of justice is bankrupt. We refuse to believe that there are insufficient funds in the great vaults of opportunity of this game. And so, we've come to cash this check, a check that will give us upon demand the riches of Deagle and the security of AWP. 10/10 would let freedom ring again

review: I absolutely LOVE CSGO. I remember going over to my cousin's house when I was younger and saw him playing either CS or CSGO and always begged him to let me play. He never did, but 5 years later I finally got the game and got to join in on the fun. This game is amazing. I love the communication aspect of it and the community (most of the time). It's worth the money. (: Recommend 110%!

review: In this game you can point and click to kill people, and win a free iPhone*! It also features many great maps including Dust II and Dust II. This game can be very difficult for new players as it features people who are really good, they can get running head shots with an ak-47 from CT to B double doors on the best map, Dust II. It also features a skin system similar to TF 2's item system but skins aren't really usefull they just look nice, and allow you to show off how much money you can throw at people. *No iPhones can actually be won from playing this game, major rage and saddness may occur, please seek a medical proffesional before deciding to use this product.

review: CS:GO is my favorite game on steam so far. As far as competitive gaming goes, look no further than Counter-strike or Dota. Counter-strike is a game where the outcome is based on each player's skill, reaction time, and TEAMWORK! Communication with your fellow soldiers is crucial to win. Calling strategies, reporting enemy whereabouts, and working closely with teammates makes this game more immersive than most PC shooters. Make sure you follow your team's economy to decide what gear to buy at the right times. Learn common locations on all the maps so you can keep your team aware of all happenings around them. It also helps that the game's mechanics are about as fluid as it gets! Have fun.

review: At the momment the only competitive FPS game with some of the good implementetions when it comes to matchmaking and also playing with your friends. Has very steep learning curve when it comes to weapons ( recoil, spread etc.). I would reccomend this game unless you are anoyed by next few things i am about to mention. First and foremost, Russians. Very annoying, trying to communicate in their native language even if it not a international language. Words they use, blyet, sukha. Second problem, kids. Because of this game i decided i will NEVER have kids, they are god awful creatures if you give them PC-s and a bad headset. Tend to scream and curse, even when not provoked. Of course "block communication" is a viable option but then you exlude one of the biggest parts of this game out of it. Still i like the game and i think it would worth you a while to buy it and play it. Added on 2014.10.17 After so many hours, i have found a fundamental flaw with this game. It is called the "a cooldown period". What it does basically is punsihing you for leaving game, killing team mates or dealing damage to your team mates. Also if you lose connection you will be spanked by valve. Why is this a flawed system, well i will explain that with as few words as possible. First of all is noobnes level of the players i play with *silver. You may throw grenade and he might run into it and die, of course who gets punished, YOU. Again russians and how ly persistant they are. If you say B, you can almost guarantee he wil go on A screaming at the same time ", BLYET, OBAMA BAD". So eventually you are forced to kill him, take the bomb and plant. I wrote this review in hope to get some feedback because i play 2-3 matches and then back to 7 day period cooldown. I honestly hope to get some suggestions aty least, and i hope you will find this usefull.

review: Previous players to the Counter-Strike series will fit right at home in Global Offensive. From brilliant graphics and physics to heated game matches with true competivie play i highly recommend CSGO to anyone looking to get into FPS or veterans to the game type. CSGO is a outstanding deal at $15 USD and expansion packs for only $3 USD. Maybe EA should learn a thing or two? *that'll never happen* WARNING** This game is highly addictive and will consume thousands of hours of your life. WARNING LEVEL 2***** This game is also heavily skill based. Do not assume people are hackers right away as many players have 5 years+ and can aim down a scope in 2/10's of a second and take your head off. ^_^ enjoy the game and thanks for reading me review!

review: Smoke mid everyday Rush B everygame Camp Pit everytime Oh and don't forget: if you loose, blame your teammates P.S. This game is a competitive FPS where you play as good guys (CT) or bad guys (T) Bad guys have to plant the bomb or defend hostages while killing the good guys. The good guys have to defuse the bomb or save hostages while killing bad guys. Simple, isn't it ? This game is fun. 10/10 P.S.S. This game's called Counter Strike: Global Offensive but it might look like more Team Counter 2: Fortress Offensive (since the Arms deal update) but if you aren't interested in weapon skins you aren't obliged to buy keys to open cases, skins don't affect the gameplay (But they're F***ing cool tho)

review: Classical game gone wrong, that's my summary at least. If you think the game is even at any point as good as 1.6 or CSS, think again. I'll list some pros and cons. Pros : Good looking skins. Remade maps. Easy to invite friends to a lobby/get a team farily quick. Modes like Arms race (Gun Game) or Deathmatch has been made official gamemodes. Cons : Community is rotten, way through, into the core and back on the other side. Ranking system is completly broken. Spraypatterns take long time to learn and master, especially AK-47. Can't select playable character in casual/competetive gamemodes,neither any other. People tend to buy the game on a different account, leveling up themself with that one so they meet people who are new, with themselfs as very skilled players. Cheating, when you see it you'll understand. Changed spraypatterns. Smaller, and somewhat broken, hitboxes. Wallbanging is rare. If Valve took time and developed a good ranking system this game could have been amazing, but no. The game is about 6 Euros on a steam sale, people buy it, Smurf, and destroy for all the other players. You need about 5 wins in a row to rank up one rank, every god damn time. It doesn't matter if you beat NiP or HeatoN himself, you won't rank up without 5 wins in a row. Good luck with that when the matchmaking isn't working properly because someone wanted to rank up twice. Until Valve fixes this problem, together with the cheating, this game is a big nono. Stick with 1.6 or Source, you'll have trice the fun you have here.

review: This game is very good. It is one of the best shooter games I have ever played. It is super fun to play this game with friends using voice chat. There are different matches you can join. Competative may be hard for new players. this game is hard for new players. It is completely different Counter-Strike game. It has a lot of skins, weapons, maps, and other cool stuff. I recommend this game to everyone who likes games which need teamwork and cooperation.

On his death bed I sent him a box, he didn't have a key though so he had to pay me about tree fiddy. Well he opened it and got a StatTrak Karambit Case Hardened, he's also dead now. Not from the IED. Don't let your war buddies open boxes kids.

review: Previous players to the Counter-Strike series will fit right at home in Global Offensive. From brilliant graphics and physics to heated game matches with true competivie play i highly recommend CSGO to anyone looking to get into FPS or veterans to the game type. CSGO is a outstanding deal at $15 USD and expansion packs for only $3 USD. Maybe EA should learn a thing or two? *that'll never happen* WARNING** This game is highly addictive and will consume thousands of hours of your life. WARNING LEVEL 2***** This game is also heavily skill based. Do not assume people are hackers right away as many players have 5 years+ and can aim down a scope in 2/10's of a second and take your head off. ^_^ enjoy the game and thanks for reading me review!

review: Every Friday after I recieve my paycheck I deposit it. Saturday mornings I wake up not remebering the previous night with a headache and a sore . I roll out of my bed on to the floor and pick myself up just enough to click play on CSGO, I spend the time that it takes me to load CSGO (NO SSD MASTER RACE HERE) getting up from my starting position to sit in my chair (very hard to do with a wrecked bottom) Naturally at this time I start to remeber certain details about the previous night. I check my phone, a text from my bank, I've overdrawn. My Foggy bits and pieces start to clear and gradually turn to horror as I see a little yellow box with a 10 in it under the word inventory, and a message telling me i have new items. I click inventory as i am suddenly overcome with the dawning realization of my previous nights activities as my shiny new Stat Trak skins bounce into view on my screen. so much red. I lose control of my bowels and also vomit all over my keyboard and screen then pass out. If you buy this game. it would be smart to also buy some lube, in bulk, Dont play CSGO if you dont want your anal region violated again and again. game mechanics .... crap teamwork... crap community of friendly people for beginners... crap but u can buy skins for your gunz to make them look pretty so you spend your entire time distracted by the colors while you get shot at and lose the game for your team Valve is a cruel, cruel mistress. I Can't ING WAIT FOR SATURDAY MORNING. 10/10 will buy lube again.

review: So after playing Counter Strike for about 1 year now and putting over 1000 hours into it, I thought I would make a little review. Throughout the time i've played I've seen many Good/Bad changes made to the game. I still think some of the changes are a little stupid but I've come to get used to it. Although there are a lot of cheaters I still manage to have fun. Whenever I encounter a cheater I just laugh and mess around with them, because it's funny to think people would waste 15$ on re-buying the game for multiple accounts to cheat on. I was recently reading a reddit post by a proffesional CS:GO player by the name of DaZeD in where he mentions a way that can reduce cheaters by a mass amount of numbers. He basically stated that CS:GO should add a system so that the first 50 queues are unranked so the cheaters would basically be going against other cheaters. He also said that after you finish the first 50 queues you can start playing for ranks and start playing on 128 tic servers. I agree with all of what he said. This was originally going to be a small review and it turned into a little over a paragraph. If you actually read all of this and have any opinions leave a comment letting me know, and I'll try to get back to you.

review: Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is certainly an interesting game. When I first got into the game I played and was horrible. I then put in a lot of time into this game. I went from Silver 3 when I was first ranked, and now I'm Gold Nova 3. My highest rank was Gold Nova Master. Overall, this game is a quality game. It is frustrating with the ammount of hackers and smurfers. However, I'm learning that it is just a part of the game. Smurfing is understandable, hacking is not. You need to really understand the maps, callouts, smokes and flash spots. When you jump into a competetive game realize that your money is not your money, it is your team's money. If you do not play with that mentality, you have no reason to play competitive. This game is an A- for me overall. It has the most hours for me on steam for a reason. However Valve, please get a better hack detector. I know for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. This time however it seems that the reaction is far better than the action. If you come into this game wanting to play something that is exhilerating and competitive, you my friend have come to the right place.

review: Hey, i am just curious if anyone else does this. Every day when i take a shower, i like to turn the water super hot, hold my nuts in my hand and let the scalding hot water run over them. Lately my balls have been extremely itchy for some reason, so instead of itching them, i burn them with scalding hot water to relieve the itching and it is quite possibly the most amazing sensation i've ever felt in my life. It feels amazing and i'm doing less damage to the skin than if i were to scratch them. I just have to be careful because the hot water hitting my hand or my thighs hurts really bad so it can be difficult to only let the scalding hot water hit my nuts and nothing else. As i've been doing this, the itching has gotten less intense as the days go on so the treatment seems to be working. I know it's weird but i'm telling you it feels incredible. I'm not saying other people should try it, but if you've got an itch, perhaps a better alternative is to burn them with scalding hot water. Posted: 19 April 2014

Unlike many other first person shooter titles, CS: GO offers great tactical teamplay; not just a one man army type game. I really enjoyed playing this game, which also explains 1, 000 hours I've spent on this game. I highly recommend purchase this game if you haven't already, you won't regret it!

review: This is a great game to play together with friends. Matchmaking is not the best, but sometimes you get to play against equally-skilled opponents, resulting in great and intense matches. However, you're not forced to use matchmaking, an old Source-server-browser is of course still available. Music is just perfect. It looks good and the weapons feel alright. Recommended!

review: It doesn't matter how good you are any more, you will be judged solely on the market value of your inventory. You should have one of your several Karambit knives equipped at all times and inspect it in game whenever possible to ensure that anybody who is spectating you is aware that you are aware you're being watched and you are absolutely showing off that extremely pricey knife you own. Your stats are irrelevant now, most people aren't even aware that the 'Tab' key actually has a function in game. It doesn't matter if you don't know what 'eco' means. Fuck team work. You have a 'BOOM' AWP in your inventory, as long as you have $4750 cash in game you're buying an AWP. You will mock anyone who decided to give their Nova the 'Walnut' skin. Same goes for people who give their FAMAS the 'Doomkitty' skin. You will only equip 'StatTrak' weapons and the first thing you do when you acquire one is go on an idle server and get several hundred kills on AFK players in order to pad the stats so you don't look like a total n00b. Whenever a new case is released you will buy as many cases and keys as it takes in order to acquire 'an Exceedingly Rare Special Item!' Disregard the fact that you will end up spending three times as much as you otherwise would've by buying this directly from the market, it's only your parents' money after all. Besides, your birthday is next month and Christmas/Easter/[insert public holiday here] is just around the corner so you won't have to wait too long before you can blow more of their money on digital goods. You will also plaster ever single skin you own with multiple unseemly stickers with the intention of creating a unique skin for your weapon. Your 'Easy Peasy' and 'Ninjas in Pyjamas' stickers totally don't look ridiculous whatsoever. You will also name tag all of your weapons in order to add that final personal touch to the weapon you invested so much time and money in. You don't own an AK or an M4 any more, you only own weapons with names like 'xXx OG Snoop Dogg' and 'dubstep warrior'. You now have all the knowledge required to start playing CS:GO. Go forth and procure many skins of great value.

review: Revan was only 23 years old. He loved CS:GO so much. He had most of the achievements and items. He prayed to Gaben every night before bed, thanking him for the inventory he's been given. "CS:GO is love," he says, "CS:GO is life." His elder Dragon hears him and calls him a silver scrublord. He knows his elder is just jealous of his son's devotion to Gabe. He calls him a console peasant. He slaps him and sends him to sleep. He's crying now and his face hurts. He lays in bed, and it's really cold. He feels a warmth moving towards him. He looks up. It's Gabe! He's so happy, Gabe whispers into Revan's ear, "Try your chances... Open a case." Gaben grabs Revan with his powerful dev-team hands and puts him on his hands and knees. He's ready. Revan opens his pockets for Gabe. Gabe puts his hands deep into Revan's pockets. It costs so much, but Revan does it for CS:GO. Revan can feel his wallet emptying as his eyes start to water. He accepts the terms and conditions. Revan wants to please Gabe. Gaben lets out a mighty roar as he fills Revan's computer with keys. Revan opens all the cases and gets nothing worth anything at all.

Even if the community doesn't meet the golden standard of 1.6 and Source, CS:GO will remain a multiplayer classic for those willing to put in the time to learn the maps and weapons.

review: After over one thousand hours spent this is my review of Counter Strike Global Offensive. First of is... Gameplay! I think the gameplay of CS:GO is so close to perfect that it becomes beyond addicting! Its almost always a challange in almost anything! From Competitive matchmakings to Jailbreak Servers, from Arms Race to Surfing! There is endless creativity out in the community and it keeps getting better with the support of the developers. Is it different from Counter Strike: Source? To be completely honest... Yes. Its not Counter Strike 2, But its something in between! And this is not a bad thing! In fact... Its great! It still has some remaining feel of CS:S but with new looks, maps, gamemodes, skins and UI... The list keeps going. Why should I listen to you? This is my opinion, not yours! All this is just a little push in the right direction for a new player who does not know Counter Strike. The final score! I'll give this game 9/10 for the reason of amazing communities, massive e-sport events, developer support, design, performance and in general its one of those FPS's you need to really grind to get really skilled at. And when you have developed that skill... You will have a new challange waiting around the corner. //Fridge [CS:GO Competitive Player]

review: It is slowly destroying cs 1.6, but it's worth all about it. (1)Wanna learn Russian? -This game has all the lessons needed. (2)Wanna be called a hacker / noob at the same game? -Enough players ready to do that. (3)Wanna open cases and get a 4 cent skin? -Everytime, no worries. (4)Not good at cs games, bad aim? -Blame the lag. Tell me if i forgot something, also let me show you some types of people you will handle in this lovely game: (Type1) Those who just play normally, don't care about the chat or anyone else. (Type2) Those kind of people who don't play this game seriously, they do their best to troll / be funny. (Type3)  got real, they play like it's their last game! (Type4) Afk people, they join a game just to be afk.. (Type5) Mic spammers, mute everything on your settings before your headphones blow up! *Mostly russians* (Type6) They have no idea what's going on, it's like an "adventure game" for them. This game is full of adventure, it's sometimes a pain in the  however i'm fully recommending it.

review: It's still a Counter Strike, but there's a few things that should be changed. This game should be about holding angles, not about checking corners. Map designs should be similar to CS 1.6 maps. Second thing, the flashes should be way more effective, as if you turn around you barely get flashed, while in CSS or CS 1.6 your screen would actually be a lot brighter than in this game. Third thing, quick-scoping with AWP is so random now, unlike in 1.6 where it is perfect as it should be. Fourth and final thing, the deagle: it costs 800$ and you can get P250, which is way more useful, for 300$. Deagle should have the same specifications as it had in previous Counter Strike games, because then those 800$ would be worth of spending.

ENGLISH MODAFUKA DO YOU SPEAK IT?! Skins (If you played already,do you know that creepy virgin guy who stares at your avatar and tries to sell you skins very cheap,just so his teammates will backstab you and your teammates kick you) Desert Eagle is very,very bad compared to previous games Now sad story:mi uncil fight moslem in csgo,moslem plant bomb and laugh,uncil does 720 scope ace and insta kill moslem.dies cuz he forgot to defuse and put sad violin on and said dumb words,then gave me knife skin and die like a wh0r3 that he is and will forever be..like dis if u cri evertime.

review: Have you ever felt excited and frustrated at the same time or laughed and then felt like punching the closest wall to you? Well if not this is the game for you! Counter Strike Global Offensive has a continuously growing player base and incredible content that updates monthly. It is similar to the other cs games so I wont dive into all that but in short its a must if you like a well balanced competitive shooter.

review: One day I bought this because it was on sale for about $2.50. I didn't think much of it but then I started playing. I couldn't believe how addicting it was. I started losing sleep and skipping meals. It started to show on my physical health. My family started bugging me about it and even considered putting me into a rehabilitation center. Let's just say they won't be bugging me anymore. But now I dont have the funds to maintain an internet connection. I've sold everything I have just to play. I can't even go to starbucks and use their wifi because I sold my clothes and apparently they dont accept nudity. So basically I'm writing this review from my phone on top of a bridge. My life isn't worth it without this game. Yet it seems to have ruined my life. Goodbye world. gr8/8

review: Death is a great teacher. Failure in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is, as it always has been for this series, the greatest way to learn where you should have gone, what you shouldn't have done, and how you could have done better. Counter-Strike players spend a lot of time learning -- consequently, they are always getting better. Growth is an important factor in Global Offensive, especially if you're coming into Counter-Strike fresh or after a sabbatical. This is an extremely hardcore, skill-based first-person shooter, and it forces you to think differently than other modern shooters. If youre a Call of Duty player, youre going to need to change your play style to succeed here. Counter-Strike also tries developing into something new here as well, despite doing little to push itself beyond what its always done best. Global Offensive modifies old maps to keep veterans on their toes, and introduces official new modes that encourage different play styles for the first time in almost 15 years. For the uninitiated, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a small-scale, team-based first-person shooter with permanent death. When a counter-terrorist kills a terrorist planting explosives in a classic Defusal match, or a CT escort swallows a sniper round in Hostage Rescue, the victim is dead for good and doesn't respawn until the next round. As such, players on both sides must exercise skill and care. The bomb objective, meanwhile, gives everyone a purpose. Of course matches end when everyone on a team is dead, but a clever and coordinated terrorist team will give the CTs the slip, plant their bomb, and protect the bomb site. Between rounds, everyone spends earned cash on better gear and guns, and the cycle continues. Pieces of the Counter-Strike formula are dated at this point, but the superb heart and soul of Global Offensive is timeless. Teams are small, guns are lethal, and rounds are short. There's an addictive just-one-more-round quality to it, because there's a constant desire to do better than last time, to earn a satisfying kill, or to win in a new way. Call of Duty and Battlefield vets will wonder why they can't sprint to escape enemy fire or look down the iron sights to improve aim; Counter-Strike players will feel like they walked into their redecorated home. Certain map redesigns will catch hardcore fans off guard, but the changes are for the best -- the underpass choke point in de_dust, for instance, has a new escape route. Even in the face of genre evolution, Global Offensive doesnt care to adapt. CSGO is so dedicated to Counter-Strike's aging ideals despite market and trend changes that it brute-forces its way to success. Part of what makes it such an engaging competitive game is that killing in Global Offensive requires a wholly different skill set than other shooters. Everyone is limited to what they have and can see, with little room for character modification or on-the-fly advantages. Running and gunning is a useless play style, even if you've bought a helmet and kevlar that round, to the point that someone standing still is more likely to score the kill. Walking, crouching, or standing are your best bets to reduce the inaccurate spray of machine-gun fire. Consequently, killing in Global Offensive feels good. There's a sickening sensation to dropping someone dead because you know they're not coming back. It's also satisfying knowing you used limited resources to play smarter than your victim. If players aren't watching corners, providing covering fire, or using smoke grenades and flashbangs, they're more likely to take a headshot from a more delicate and patient triggerman. The desire to experience that distinct feeling is a strong motivator to keep playing, even when you're getting steamrolled by an obviously better team. If you've played Counter-Strike before, Global Offensive probably sounds a whole lot like Counter-Strike. Like Counter-Strike: Source before it, Global Offensive exists simply to modernize the look of the classic competitive shooter, while doing little to disrupt the core form and function. At the same time, it does enough to color outside the lines of tradition to justify your time and effort. Fire is one of the most interesting new combat variables. Molotov cocktails and incendiary grenades either roast groups of guys or force them in another direction. Flames are a useful distraction or scare tactic, too. They're particularly useful during Demolition matches, which focus the fight at a single bomb site rather than giving terrorists two to pick between. The new and modified maps in this mode aren't as big as classic Counter-Strike arenas  entire sections have been cut off to direct teams toward a central location  but their thoughtful design is as intricate as ever. The Lake map is a standout -- there's a wide open yet densely populated yard around the bomb site, which is inside a sizable lakeside home with plenty of vantage points and hiding spots. To separate Demolition from Defusal, players can't buy between rounds. Instead, it takes a cue from the other new mode, Arms Race, in which each kill unlocks another weapon instantly. The better you do, the more you have to switch up the way you play, and because Demolition is so fast you'll need to be quick on your feet. Unlike other game types, Arms Race allows for respawns. It's the most chaotic and care-free mode in Global Offensive, with players throwing caution to the wind for the sake of climbing the kill ladder as quickly as possible. It's a shame there are only two maps in Arms Race -- a problem that will more likely persist on consoles than PC. If you have the option, playing the PC version is unquestionably the best way to experience Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. Mods, mouse and keyboard, and the usual PC-only options are better than the ports. Plus, Valve is much better about long-term PC support -- it abandoned Team Fortress 2 on consoles, and Portal 2's level editor was PC exclusive. If you prefer to play on consoles, Global Offensive is the same great game, with the following special bits.

review: Counter-Strike is said to be the most popular tactical team-based first-person shooter with a timeless soul. The fourth full-fledged part of this game, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, makes old school players feel at (renovated) home. The rules are known to all yet hardly anyone knows everything and its obvious that devil is in the details. You can play in several modes but classic competitive deserves attention primarily. Five terrorists against five counter-terrorists in two varieties: planting/defusing bomb or detention/release of hostages. The formula is simple but not simplistic. Its a pity that there are many players trying to cheat. Fortunately, some of them are consistently disqualified by Valve. The most beautiful thing in this game is visible growth and major obstacle may be the first steps and initial figuring out the system and players behavior... There are neither unusual skills nor fancy tricks. The tools are simple - a dozen guns and other weapons like grenades as well as your ideas and tactics, which you can share with others, that actually being a must. It is gratifying that this product is still being patched and from time to time new maps are created and there are real gems among them. Well, of course its a chance to meet a lot of great gamers with whom you can play other productions as well. You must to be prepared to be yelled at sometimes. You may hear you dont know how to play, that you are f**king noob with no skill. One way or another, CS:GO teaches humility and cooperation. I've never been an avid fan of this series but this game is really addictive, because I am able to feel that I play better with each match. The magic progress is oozing and there is no way to measure this numerically.

review: To heck with Hat Simulator 2, this is the new hotspot fellas. Be there or be square. There's skins you can buy for as low as 1 God damn cent (Yeah, like I have that kind of cash.) on the Steam marketplace, but there's also people willing to buy fancy-shmancy knives for over 400 dollars! Wow-whee! Those are the kind of fellas that must get a rad tan during the summer and get a lot girls at the town socials. Reminds me of my friend Rod. Rod used to own a '70 El Camino, but he crashed it into a ditch on the interstate. The air conditioner in it didn't work anyways, cause the car was like, forty years old at the time anyways, and he didn't have seat warmers so it was COMPLETELY useless. Rod's mom is cool, too. When I got sick and vomited in their fireplace, Rod's mom gave me a ride home and everything. I'll stop beating around the bush. Buy the game for cryin' out loud.

review: My opinion about this game can be just positive.I started playing Counter-Strike very long time ago and I always used to like it,but year by year it just became bad because of cheaters,scripts and that stuff,so my friend have gifted me Counter-Strike Global Offensive.In the beginning I thought it is bad game because I only had 20-30FPS and that is considered as unplayable frame rate but I will still playing fine.Now when I upgraded my PC this game seems to be awesome.Why is it awesome? -No much cheaters as in previous versions of CS. -Competitive mode. (I love it!) -New visual effects. -Some new guns. -New game modes. -Skins (No need to download 'em ,just collect) I think if you love Counter-Strike games you should buy this one and try it ,you won't regret it!

review: Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is definitely a step in the right direction. All the people who played the older CS games will feel right at home with all the classic maps. However, everyone, no matter if it's a new player or veteran, will have to get used to new things like recoil patterns, movement, etc. So everyone has an equal chance of winning, depending on how much they've played and gotten use to the game, of course. CS:GO combines tactics with shooting skills so well that it is one of the best well-ballanced and competitive shooters out there.

review: Cs go,the latest competitive valve fps.Worth it?,or just stick with the old ones.? That must the most asked question that everyone makes when facing with the choice of buying this game,well i hope this little review helps you decide. Cs:Go provides some new right choices and some bad ones. Being a competitive game this game excells at almost everything the right way, from the way weapons feel when you shoot them or the maps with new layouts reinvented.Althought from time to time ocasionally suffers from some Ramdomness fireshoots directions where the bullet ends up being away far from where you aim for no appearent reasons.But in rare cases.And with the new patchs upcoming it will probably be fixed. That moment in the decising moments can end up being felling just unfair where you feel you could have done it. The new matchmaking for ranked games work well but then again from time to time it fails horribly,where you find yourself teamming up with players with too much width range of skill gap betwen. where then again you find yourself in a more of a 5vs4 match then a fair match. But it isnt game breaking and doesnt ruin it by far.And on top of ranking lvl that gap quickly disappears. Being that world elite class. The new molotov cocktail granade provides a welcome new mechanic to the game. Being only fully used yet on highter ranks. Believe me it makes a quite difference. The graphics specially the shadows look amazing! The new source 2 engine feels more natural and vibrant then ever. For that in my opinion it deserves a 8.2 out of 10. Being itself not a fps innovator by far it furfills almost all of the cs 1.6 and cs:Source mistakes and errors. And on a good side. Of course some people might argue that 1.6 shooting is the real quake style where skill is the king of the game. that might diverge from person to person. Pros: +Graphics look amazing +mechanics feel more natural. +Hands and movements of Characters feel natural and human. +new map layouts +Competitive ladder +weapon skins unlocks addes quite a welcome variety Cons: -Still has to improve in hitboxes in some ocasions. -Server regions make some people have and average of 87\110 latency\ping in ranked matches... -has lower gamemodes then source and 1.6. -Not casual hasfun game has source or 1.6.

review: Pretty impressed at the fact that Valve improved the graphics quite a lot and added a few more game modes like arms race etc. which does make it a bit COD-ish but still the simplicity of the Counter-Strike series was maintained. Although many new maps were added, we still notice the classic maps like Dust, Dust2, Aztec etc. It's not a very fast paced fps like COD or BF yet it's very enjoyable to play.

review: Competitive game with great community. Addicting, fun and sporty. Don't play after a sale though, lots of hackers are coming! There are more modes of gameplay. There's Arms Race (which is basically gun game for those who have played previous CS titles), Deathmatch, Classic Casual, Classic Competitive. Classic is in my opinion the best to spend time on and once you feel ready you can hop on a competitive with your friends. Don't worry if none are available, the matchmaking system will match you with adversaries and teammates with matching skill. Improve your skill and more important: Have Fun! Who knows, maybe you'll be the one to beat the Champions.

review: Latest in the Counter-Strike series , in theory same thing with fancy graphics , but some weapons changed the way they fire a bit , and not since long , but they added keys and crates into the game , with weapon skins (exactly what it sounds like , some paint finishes for your weapons).And also stat track weapons (stranges counting kills) , because yeah , it's a valve multiplayer game , and like team fortress 2 and dota 2 , it had to go this way :/ Some may complain about the way the weapons fire , how they liked the old look for the maps , incompetent players that are camping or idk what, but i tell you this : give this game a chance, get over 10 hours into it so you can get used to it, and you should begin to like it.However if you still do not like it, you are one of the few people that hate this game, because really , this is a game that is done pretty good. I say it is worth buying , even more if you buy it with the bundle or at a sale.

review: Well.. how to start... I'm counterstrike boy starting from v 1.3. Big fan of CS all the way, it's my favourite game. When CS:GO showed up, i was really sceptic about that game, that's why i didn't bought it in 2012. CS:GO is one of the best FPS games you can find right now on the market. It's really balanced, from every pistol, shotgun, smg. You can kill with anything, weapon is not so much important, as in 1.6, where mostly you heard sounds of AK, Deagle, or AWP. As for me,even if i played more then 2000 hrs of CS 1.6 it was really complicated in my first matches, since textures and graphics changed a "bit". But it's not really that hard to get used to engine, graphics. I really like the competitive system, since i remember that pain in  called "mIRC" :D I'd recommend to buy the game at all costs.

review: CSGO is a near-perfect multiplayer shooter. Unlike the previous versions, which were often difficult to get in to, this one offers a variety of modes that will appeal to all skill levels. It has a large community and a well supported workshop, ensuring that this discount-priced game will be around for years to come. The game isn't much of a looker as it is based on the same engine as the original Half Life 2 was. However, Valve have polished it as much as they can and the community consists of lots of awesome mappers who have been churning out brilliantly imaginative and beautiful maps almost on a daily basis. Is it worth getting if you already own Counter Strike: Source? Yes. CSS was always Counter Strike shoe-horned into the Source engine. CSGO feels far more like a standalone game. Valve have very carefully listened to what people have wanted and have made a very appealing game. The best feature must be the competitive play, where you play 10 games that you cannot leave (unless you want to tarnish your reputation), after which you'll be ranked and will be paired up with people of the same skill, meaning that the game is challenging but fair no matter what skill level you are. There are all kinds of teams and communities that you can join. Really, if I was stuck on a desert island with one game this would most likely be my top choice. It's bigger than you can hope to conquer and has a huge community around it which will likely be around for years to come, something that can't be said for the Call of Duty franchise which is probably its closest rival. Remember that those games are full price and have another one churned out each year, fragmenting the community. Plus you can customise your weapon skins in CSGO. Surely that's the most important feature?! All they need to add now are hats and you might as well live in CSGO.

review: It doesn't matter how good you are any more, you will be judged solely on the market value of your inventory. You should have one of your several Karambit knives equipped at all times and inspect it in game whenever possible to ensure that anybody who is spectating you is aware that you are aware you're being watched and you are absolutely showing off that extremely pricey knife you own. Your stats are irrelevant now, most people aren't even aware that the 'Tab' key actually has a function in game. It doesn't matter if you don't know what 'eco' means. Fuck team work. You have a 'BOOM' AWP in your inventory, as long as you have $4750 cash in game you're buying an AWP. You will mock anyone who decided to give their Nova the 'Walnut' skin. Same goes for people who give their FAMAS the 'Doomkitty' skin. You will only equip 'StatTrak' weapons and the first thing you do when you acquire one is go on an idle server and get several hundred kills on AFK players in order to pad the stats so you don't look like a total n00b. Whenever a new case is released you will buy as many cases and keys as it takes in order to acquire 'an Exceedingly Rare Special Item!' Disregard the fact that you will end up spending three times as much as you otherwise would've by buying this directly from the market, it's only your parents' money after all. Besides, your birthday is next month and Christmas/Easter/[insert public holiday here] is just around the corner so you won't have to wait too long before you can blow more of their money on digital goods. You will also plaster ever single skin you own with multiple unseemly stickers with the intention of creating a unique skin for your weapon. Your 'Easy Peasy' and 'Ninjas in Pyjamas' stickers totally don't look ridiculous whatsoever. You will also name tag all of your weapons in order to add that final personal touch to the weapon you invested so much time and money in. You don't own an AK or an M4 any more, you only own weapons with names like 'xXx OG Snoop Dogg' and 'dubstep warrior'. You now have all the knowledge required to start playing CS:GO. Go forth and procure many skins of great value.

review: Revan was only 23 years old. He loved CS:GO so much. He had most of the achievements and items. He prayed to Gaben every night before bed, thanking him for the inventory he's been given. "CS:GO is love," he says, "CS:GO is life." His elder Dragon hears him and calls him a silver scrublord. He knows his elder is just jealous of his son's devotion to Gabe. He calls him a console peasant. He slaps him and sends him to sleep. He's crying now and his face hurts. He lays in bed, and it's really cold. He feels a warmth moving towards him. He looks up. It's Gabe! He's so happy, Gabe whispers into Revan's ear, "Try your chances... Open a case." Gaben grabs Revan with his powerful dev-team hands and puts him on his hands and knees. He's ready. Revan opens his pockets for Gabe. Gabe puts his hands deep into Revan's pockets. It costs so much, but Revan does it for CS:GO. Revan can feel his wallet emptying as his eyes start to water. He accepts the terms and conditions. Revan wants to please Gabe. Gaben lets out a mighty roar as he fills Revan's computer with keys. Revan opens all the cases and gets nothing worth anything at all.

review: Counter Strike GO is the return to the beloved Multiplayer shooter game Counter Strike but will you want to play the new one or stick to the Classics ? Of course everybody knows what Counter Strike is about. Essiantly Counter terrorist and terrorist fight and each of them have diffrent objectives. Honestly i love this game. The gameplay is way faster, tighter and way smoother than ever. The gunplay and awesome and you feel highly rewarded when youre on a killing spree. The game has a few modes and all of them are fun for theyre own reasons There are some problems that need fixing. The hit detection isnt always the best sometimes when you shoot the enemy square right in the face the shot doesnt connect. Overall the game is really fun and i enjoyed it alot and if you liked the previous Counter Strike games you need to own this title. I give Counter Strike Global Offensive a 8/10

review: The entire Counter-Strike series has prided itself on strategic, competitive, and difficult gameplay. This game is the embodiment of that--highly reliant on teamwork, individual skill, and communication. Anyone who has wanted to play something that makes them yearn for improvement should purchase this game. The skill cap is immense, and there are always new things to learn. Valve (Volvo?) constantly releases patches and updates for the game, and frequently introduces new mechanics to keep the players on their toes. You won't be disappointed.

review: I would honestly give this a 10/10 just due to the fact that this game is fun really for anyone. I have seen girls, boys, and even adults. Everyone is super friendly. The one thing that I do not like really is the fact that some children (I am a child but not like these children I describe) will go completely insane if they just lose 1 game. They will blame their team, and lag, etc. And then someone will say gg (good game) or nice try and they will go nuts with excuses or blame other people for how bad they did. Even if they did good they would still be angry. Now let me just describe this game a little bit. It is a first person shooter, it is very cheap for how much fun it is, you may get bored after about 3/4 hours. (depends on how much you like the game) The games can be very long! And no I do not mean like 10 minute games. I mean games lasting up to an hour and 30 minutes. But if you are quite good at the game and have a good team along with you. You can make the game quite quick. There are I believe 5 or 4 gamemodes you can play. There is Arms race which is basically where you advance a gun every 1 knife or 2 kills with the weapon until you get to the golden knife. If you get a kill with the golden knife you win. And I will just explain one more gamemode for you. Competitive. Competitive is the most popular of them all. It is a 5v5 with terrorists and counter terrorists. From the names I am sure you can guess that the terrorists plant the bomb or kill all the counter terrorists. If they plant the bomb the counter terrorists have to defuse it. If they do not plant the bomb fast enough and the clock hits 0. Not only do you lose you do not recieve any money for that round. So basically kill all the opposing enemies or plant the bomb and watch it explode. One more thing I will explain is the skins. There are certain guns that people just love. And they maybe want to make it look alot cooler than how the default gun looks. So they will go out and win a bunch of matches until they get some skins from winning so must or doing so well. Now so people however like the games so much or are just rich and will spend hundreds of dollars on knives and other skins. The knives are the rarest things in the game. They all range from 60 dollars to 200 dollars. Depends on the quality, if it is stattrak (It counts how many kills you get when you kill people) and the skin it has. But if you want skins basically just buy them, win games, or trade. If you do not know how to trade. I will let you search a video up on youtube to help you out on that. I hope this helped you guys understand how much fun this game is. Have a great day. Feel free to add me if you need/want to I am always open for meeting new people. :) (coopacarp is my steam name) Also, after about 200,230 hours of playing you get something called Overwatch. Which is where when someone has been reported for hacks you watch the game they were reported on and decide wether or he was hacking.

review: Counter strike global offensive and call of duty have some of the most conflicting fanbases. I'm really not on one side or the other as I've played both games for many hours and dislike certain parts of both. However when I really think about it, counter strike go is essentially a slower paced call of duty. Given CS is definately a more strategic experience generally but when you get awp'd 3 seconds into the game on De dust 2 I think otherwise. On that note this game shares the enraging problem I have with call of duty, a sniper rifle that is one shot kill that can be efficently fired at all ranges, pretty much a guarenteed match win in the hands of certain people. You can die in one shot by pretty much every gun in the game but when it's an awp you feel especially defeated because 90% of the time there was nothing you could've done about it. Due partially to this reason I felt myself not staying in games because of fun or determination. But rather for the small chance I could get a new gun skin or a crate that I'd have to spend real world money in order to open. When you feel yourself continuing through rage inducing situations just to have a sticker on your shiny new rifle, it feels incredibly trying to play. The only parts of CS I really enjoyed are playing with my friends on a 5v5 competative match. That being said I had a lot of really good times in that mode, and in my opinion is the only reason I paid the price of this game. Casual matches are nothing but quick scope matches and people grinding to have the option to pay for gun skins. If you want to hop right into the fun with this game, get some friends and go play some competative but other than that you're not going to find anything unique or different from call of duty here. I'm not entirely sure whether or not I'd reccomend this game, however after many hours there must be some reason I keep pressing play and getting myself killed so I guess I've found enjoyment somewhere in here.

review: Do you like First Person Shooters? If you do then make sure to check out this awesome game. Its not anything like the "Call Of Duty" series. This game requires immense teamwork if you want to win. You can't go blazing into bombsites killing all the enemies. You need knowledge, tactics, and skill. A combination of great call-outs, excellent shooting, and amazing tactics can create blazing team synergy that will for sure guarentee you the win. Counter-Strike Global Offensive is a sure game to add to your wishlist.

review: This is a remarkable next step in the Counter-Strike franchise that has been volatile for over a decade. With well-rounded gameplay, near perfect balancing of the weapons, fun, innovative maps, and great graphics that compliment the gameplay, we have a beautiful and challenging first person shooter here. But what separates this from other big franchises like Call of Duty and Battlefield? Well, the almost infinite skill ceiling allows this game to stand out from the rest. While you can still dive into casual games, run around, and score a couple of kills, those who spend hours and hours practicing in competitive mode will have fine tuned their skills to only aiming for headshots and other skilled tactics. Counter-Strike: Global Offensive provides a simple but deep first person shooter experience that provides customization, refreshing content, and a whole lot to learn for an extremely fair price compared to FPS counterparts.

Some of its awesome features: This game focus' on realism, incorporates real world elements: -You can climb ladders without using your hands!! -You can defuse an armed bomb by looking at it!!! -You can only aim with guns that come with scopes (which is like 4!!), all other guns are hip fired!! -You sound like a fat Elephant plodding around when you're running, but when you walk slowly you're as silent as a shadow! -Ragdolls!!!! -Realistic bullet physics and bullet spread!!! -Fall damage!!!! -Friendly Fire!!!! -Jumping!!!!! -Crouching!!!! -Running!!!! -Walking!!!! -Awesome gun skins that come in various qualities and conditions!!! -The ability to show off your awesome gun skins in-game!!!! -Excellent A.I!!!! -Excellent A.I Names!!!!! I don't know what else Valve could do to make the game even MORE fun and realistic!! Valve sure hit the nail on the head with this game!!

review: When i was kid i started play with CS 1.3, then keep playing CS:S comes out. CS:S was not so good, so i stick with 1.6. Now, i really love CS:GO, its more fun than casual 5v5 scrim, its more social, its more realistic. More than game, its very competitive-like.So totally worth it. and of course we love custom skins, community maps + steam workshop is perfect 10/10 if you like FPS genre, must have it!

review: Despite what YouTube griefing videos implied to me, running around in Gun Game knifing people to demote them isn't nearly as easy as it looks, and that experience is all I wanted to get out of this game. This is just another case of me being  at a game and saying its bad because I never wanted to play it in the first place. Hahaha it's really good guys.

review: Counter Strike is a very nice game Each game has its advantages but also its disadvantages Advantages: You have many options to play Counter Strike. You can make competitions, can be played on normal and abnormal funny servers You get temporarily weapons or boxes that you can use in the game Disadvantages: Disadvantages include the Steam or Valve occasionally have problems with the servers ..... It has also cheaters who get nothing in life to the series and want to achieve something in the game Although it has more pros and cons but I think that's enough I recommend it to anyone but do not become addicted;) So have fun with it and if you have some question you can ask me

review: Have you ever wanted to be a car, kid? Well now you still can't but you can cry yourself to sleep over the rounds you dropped, the friends you let down, and the relationships that you destroyed on CS:GO. Also, this game came in first at the Iowa state fair of 1945 for it's help in the Manhattan Project at Trinity. This game has a half-life to that similar to that of Carbon-14, and is now being used for carbon dating techniques based on your win/loss ratio on Vertigo. Whenever a bomb is thrown off of the side of the map, the Carbon-14 deposits plummet by the IQ of the closest spider to the Dalai Lama.

I love Counter Strike Global Offensive and can see myself playing this game for years on end. This is the most value I have gotten for my money ever. I encourage any person either pro or just got on pc, buy Counter Strike Global Offensive, there is a spot for every one here. This means either pro scrims, or pick up games with people on your skill level.

review: This is just a marketing game, even it's named Global Offensive, so its abbreviation come out as GO (DAT MARKETING SKILLS THO), nothing global in this game (although there are some new maps that take place in a different part of the world), but if you liked the CS 1.6, you'll defenitelly like this as much, because the developers were too afraid to adapt any new mechanincs in the game, even the ridiculous ladder climbing remained the same. (They could have made an animation for climbing, but many say that that would slow the gameplay, but not if the character would step two ladder rungs instead of one, or something like this) It's just looks horrible among the few realistic mechanisms But while they tryied to implement realism (the way you have to aim with the scope with rifles) the aiming system is still... well... "undeveloped" to me. It's a good thing that the most liked maps like dust and assault are still in it, and they are all improved with destroyable doors, barrels and other objects, and in the game, not all weapons works the same way, that's a good thing again! This is why it's hard to say wheter I recommend it or not. I, of course recommend from an aspect that many players bougth the game, the 1.6 version were so popular, I BET you have a friend on your list who play this game, but in the other hand this game is nothing but a poor work making new source of money in my opinion. But saying positive again for conclusion, I'm an audiophile, and I LOVE its music, the music system is very well made, when you get killed the dramatic music kicks in and so on, and I can't complain about its graphics if I look away from the animations. Overall, yes, I recommend this game.

review: Being playing Counter-Strike for 10 years and i have to say that the new Version defintily have some improvement but it doesnt have all the maps 1.6 and source have except on community server. The inclusion of competitive gameplay now helps to regulate competitve players to play in a competiton style. While there is a casual style for non-competitive people to play. This game is a definitly must to play if you are veteran of Counter Strike !

review: Take that amazed feeling you had when you first saw CS:S for the first time while playing 1.06. Now get rid of that image because that doesn't apply here. Then take all the challenge of mastering weapon's "behaviours" from 1.6 and Source and get rid of that as well. Then take the broken husk that is left, force it to have a child with Call of Duty and you have Counter-Strike: Go play something else.

You have a good team, and you have fun. But it's like... It's like being obsessed with lemons, and then every day you come home with paper cuts all over your hand. Satisfying as , but it hurts so bad, and you can't really get a good night's sleep. All in all, the quality is good.

review: Counter Strike: Global Offensive; A game that incorporates the original classic, revolutionary, critically acclaimed, features that changed the FPS genre, helping mold what we have today. I'm not finished! Adding a new -needed- take, visually, gameplay wise and performance wise. Counter Strike: Global Offensive is a game created by Valve to bring it to the everyday player and the experienced or not so experienced competitive player! The game looks beautiful, it works like a charm and again, revitalizes the game without straying too far from its roots. If you're a COD player, a BF player, or a player who generally is adapted to playing with a scope will be confused for a couple games. The "weapons course" will help new players and old players alike get a definitely needed insight on how this game plays in comparison to others but again, it works and it really does help you out. The modes include offline and online for players who have different play styles and you won't miss out on any action or feel oppressed by it either. Valve has touched up the game and is continuously updating the game to keep it fresh. The game not only allows you to play preset game modes but allows you in tradition with source, to host, create, and join created maps by the community. What types of mode you're asking? Surf - Players use their keys to surf along linear or non-linear pipes that incorporate puzzles and reaction, speed and etc. Survival - Players play in a "hunger games" styled game mode that pits everyone against each other until the last man (or woman) is left standing. ETC ETC ETC This game has a lot of content for such little that it depends financially and hardware wise. However; there are some flaws that should be duly noted when/if purchasing. It being a Steam play game it may experience some issues with server lag, latency issues, ping issue which disrupt gameplay and well - time. That is the only major hiccup and rarely happens but when it does, it ruins the overall experience. My score? 4/5

review: Probably the best Counter-Strike at the moment. It just keeps getting more features : competitive mode, matchmaking, skins for guns to raise funds for CS league, video and highlights from all your past matches, watch live games, better hostages mode, gun game mode includes. However, they just keep adding stuff without fixing all the issues and bugs from past updates. This games is unplayable for some people over the Internet but great in LAN. The gun skins update brought lower fps to the game, going down by 80 to 120 fps.

review: Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) the newest addition to the Counter-Strike franchise supposedly takes the best from both its most famous predecessors, Counter-Strike 1.6 and Counter-Strike Source. I as a person who has played 1.6 for approximately 8 years cannot confirm that wholy, but I can at least say that the game is fun to play, with the biggest advantage it has over it's older brothers being the matchmaking. I would easily pay Valve $100 for 1.6 with the matchmaking from CS:GO. But that is not gonna happen so for the time being I just have to settle with what CS:GO offers. I might have sounded a little more negative than I wanted. The graphics are nice enough even though well aged Source engine, although with the newest tweaks, cannot compare with latest AAA production. Apart from new look you will find your all time favorites from previous Counter-Strike games, same goes for weapons and game mods. However there is not only an old content. You will find couple of new guns and what I appreciated most were new maps created by community and published in buy-able packs by Valve providing the creators with part of earnings. Later on the game suffered an attack of "dropable" content. Fortunately Valve did not step over cosmetic changes, so you can only spend your hard earned bucks on different weapons skins, at least for now.
game-hours: 589.7
review: this is a great game in many ways it is more accessible then the 1.6 version (which was already very accessible). but new players are able to learn how to play very fast and their enjoyment is greater then the one they would have had at the start of 1.6 or cs source. but on the other hand there is one little gripe i have and it is that i balive they made it to simmple, and when i say little i mean tiny, so the gripe is only personal i believe and it shouldn't effect your gameplay. enjoy the game :)

review: An amazing FPS for original 1.6 players to new comers. From the all new graphics to the awesome inclusion of weapon skins and different knives, brilliant maps (Writing from having a Operation Bravo Pass as well) and amazing community this sets CS:GO to be a great game. While the original formula (T kills CT, CT kills T, T plants bomb/gaurds hostage, CT defuses bomb/rescues hostages) is still a brilliant way to experience CS:GO, with new gamemodes 'Arms Race' and 'Demolition' the gaming experience just got better. If you find yourself tired of these gamemodes after lots of play, the community steps in to help. With hundreds of great community servers to choose from, each sporting their own gameplay style, such as JailBreak, Glassfloors and Zombies you're sure to keep coming back to this game time and time again. It's addictive!

review: Certainly a game you have to stick at for a while to have any sort of fun with! More often than not I am frustrated by my inability to hit simple targets due to the way recoil works; for people like me it can be a brilliant game one moment and horrible the next. The player base in match making seems mostly comprised of people who's main aim in life is to tell you how much you suck at video games and generally treat you with contempt and unfriendliness, but if you play with friends and ignore the unpleasant mob, you can find a rewarding game, and even some genuinely friendly people who are there to help you improve or just have fun in bad situations. Before jumping into competitive, it's probably wise to familiarise yourself with the rules, as friendly fire and dodgy internet connections alike can result in temporary bans. The graphics are quite nice, some of the voice work is a bit weird to me, but often a source of hilarity.

Silti niin aivotonta riskint, ja taktista tiimipeli samaan aikaan, ja Competitive Matchmaking tuo oman lisn peliin, vaikka tst lytyy ihan samallalailla community modeja kuin Kynrist ja Sourcesta, ja pelin storyline on sitkin mahtavampi. ;) Kouluarvosana (4-10) jos pits antaa, sanosin 9, ja 4,5 Salamia 5:st salamista.

review: Its like tf2 with gun skins instead of hats Bought this game for like 2 keys, then i ended up getting up turning this game into a money maker. With all the things i got from this game, i managed to buy a copy of Goat Simulator (amazing game), and have some keys to blow off and unbox, and have some nice  StatTraks to play around with. i turned those 2 keys into at least over $50 in total. Making skins in this game is a fun thing to do also, hopefully one day one of my skins will be accepted into the game

review: Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is what a FPS should be. This has to be the best skill-based FPS on the market. The guns feel powerful and rewarding, and the addition of camos is great. The only problem with the game is the difficulty. The game is played competively, and a good amount of the players on it have been playing Counter-Strike since the beginning are godlike. So the game has a bit of a learing curve in the respect that it takes practice to be able to compete against some of the other players. But once you are to that point, this game is extremely rewarding. Getting a kill in this game is so much more satisfying than any other FPS I've played, mainly because getting kills aren't easy. All in all, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a must have for any FPS fan due to the rewarding gunplay, great map design, and large community as soon as you overcome the learning curve.

review: An amazing addition to the CS series, whith the series best graphics--whilst fast and easy on RAM/GPU systems, interface, and gameplay that is uncomparable to any of the other games. As the gameplay might be closer--it is a FPS--it still keeps the feel and play of CS with an additional amount of new feautres and cleaner HUD. The menu and interfaces in the game unique and works well and is quik and easy to get used to, without distracting or steering away from older/modern interfaces. As for the new official gamemodes for the game adds more hours and fun to the game versus source or any of the others.

review: There has been a great deal of controversy on whether the game fulfilled the peoples' expectations and whether it deserves to be considered as worthy as its ancestors. Many positive points to be noticed: Great graphics (for a cs game) and Satisfying gameplay that can make you unable to stop playing, especially if playing with friends. On the negatives, compared to the previous titles, it has many things that devs could fix/improve. Plus, the matchmaking system is not working as expected, and as it seems, no serious efforts are made to change that. Last but not least, i have to point that the cs go community is likely the worst. Still, worth buying. 7/10 nearly 700 hours of gameplay (multiple accounts)

Getting headshots is really rewarding, you feel as if you just shot someone in the face...people rarely enjoy when I unexpectedly spray my heavy load all over their faces and chest (load of bullets that is). I give this gave a trillion coins...which means that the metascore for it is 98 (ing Awesome !!!).

review: Ah, Counter-Strike...Remember it since I started playing with my brother thinking I can beat him. Memories. Good. Memories. This version of Counter-Strike keeps all the good old memories by not getting rid of the old maps which we love, plus, makes them better. An FPS that will always be remembered. The new addition of skins make people get more and more into the game. There's no moment in which you want to play more than the moment when you get a new, good looking item. From what I've seen yet, this game has an awesome competitive system for new players, who want to get into the game. The silver ranks are the ranks in which you learn tactics and try out new weapons. Maybe master them all. Counter-Strike will never get old. I remember months ago playing 1.6 with a friend on his computer at home. But sadly, I don't know why, I feel like this will be the last Counter-Strike. Like Team Fortress 2. Maybe I feel this because there's no room for "better" anymore. Counter-Strike/10.

review: Basically the same shooting game you have played 1000 times, but if you are obsessed with being the best or smtg, then ranked is for you. Most common languages you will meet is english and russian. Best of it, is that if you are pist off by noobs, you don`t have to worry about it here. Once you gain high rank you will play only with similar ranks. You can find interesting events and communities and hey - mby even friends. And if you have friends, you can play ranked together. The first thing I recommend - NEVER EVER shoot teammates in first second and NEVER EVER leave ranked. Penalty is ridiculously high. And if you think that 11EUR is too much, you can always wait for discounts like 50% & 75% off which is nice.

review: Currently the best competitive FPS indeed ! It is difficult to take in hand the game at the beginning, but with some practice, you should get the mechanics of the game. The strong point is that VALVe publishes updates regularly but also brings a support for the eSport with "eSport cases", team sticker or event cashprize (ESL One, DreamHack). VALVe is also close to the community and also helps map maker with the Operation/Season Pass like Operation Breakout or Operation Phoenix, so you can play community map in competitive mode ! The weak point imo, is the community, you're a noob, ou you're a cheater. Furthermore, there are many cheater when the game is cheap on Steam, but these low prices are usually followed by many VAC ban... This game does not look like other games as the Call of Duty Saga (this game is for child and noob) and they want to make money, CS:GO is a real competitive game which knows how to evolve and which knows how to listen to his community pro and casual community ! GL & HF ! Thanks VOLVO :D

review: I was a bit late to the Counter Strike franchise. I played most cods (MW2, WaW, and Black Ops 1) my life untill shown steam. I do own the other ones but this one, being the most current and with its own competetive online play is fantastic. Get in a group with 4 other friends and you'll have a blast yelling at each other for the entire game as someone will mess up and then everyone will start fighting. It's pretty great fun, especially since after MGE its very common to come across DDosers, wallers, triggerbots and aimbots. All in all, I do recomend this game, its pretty fun, and when you're not in a game with any of those people and you really get into it with some friends, its fantastic to play. Get in there and start Terrorizing or Counter Terrorizing!

I reckon that this is one of the best FPS games on PC at the moment, easily dominating the last few Call of Duty's and Battlefield's. The weapon and sticker collecting in this game is brilliant. The map design is detailed and the develepors cleary tested and thought through everything. This is a good FPS which is pretty underated, and should deserve more attention. (Too bad i cant play most multiplayer games anymore since I moved. The internet here is crap)

review: Counter-Strike: Global Offensive raises the bar for tactical first person shooters. This game is finely tuned and balanced not only in gameplay but with map design as well, to create an even fight for both teams. This pushes players to not simply hope for lucky shots and instead think more strategically about their every move. The introduction of weapon skins gives people a cosmetic incentive to strive for, as there are different weapon skins to fit the individual style of every player. This combination of pristine gameplay and in-game economy makes this one of my favorite first person shooters to date and it will likely never be overshadowed by another.

review: Obvious as it is - this game is next part of legendary "Counter-Strike" series. Would recommend to everyone, who previously played CS 1.6 or CS:S. With lots of graphical improvements, this game still has it's atmosphere of CS. Lots of new maps, workshop content, weapon skins, different stream and competetive matchmaking (5v5) with ranking system will keep you entertained all the time. Higly recommend it. ;)

review: Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a near perfect FPS. It has a ton to offer considering it is an MP only game. It is extremely easy to jump from CS 1.6 or CS Source into this game and do just fine. It is also very friendly to people who are new to the Counter-Strike series. Overall I HIGHLY recomended this game.

review: I do not have a lot of hours on this game, but from playing CSS and CS 1.6 I can say they have done an outstanding job. I love Counter Strike and will always love the game, people care about graphics pfffft, it is all about gameplay and this game has it. It is 1000x better than COD and all other first person shooter, if you are looking for a game that will bring a lot of fun to you this is the game to get. Once you get into it, you can never stop playing from how fun the game is, best gameplay, best first person shooter and I strongly recommend this game.

review: Counter Strike has come a long way since it was a Half-Life mod in the late 90's and is still just as fun as the first day I played it. If you're looking to purchase an FPS that will outlast any COD or Battlefield game you've ever owned stop here. We've been playing on the same core maps since the beginning and we still come back for more. There's no other FPS experience like it. Valves best title in my opinion.

review: One time I went into this random server and there were about 20 people, good guys and bad guys, and they were making a pyramid. They were all so happy. They saw me and said, "Hey, , we need one more person for the top!" They smiled. I climbed up their eager bodies and stood at the top, believing what I was seeing; a whole world and all that lay before me was justice and understanding and people coming together. When I was done unloading my AK-47 into the tops of people's heads, chaos broke out. Sides turned on eachother, brother killed brother, blood filled the room. They cursed my name and said I was banished from the game forever. I believed them but vowed I would return to reclaim my place at the top. Now, more than 10 years later, I am ready to kill those who have wronged me. Actually it's hard. This game is hard: 8/10

review: Why do I even bother? This game is an endless stream of constant death, populated by nerds who have been playing nothing but Counterstrike for 10 years. No matter how hard I try, they keep pushing me aside and I can't break through. There's no talking to them. It's so sad that they're killing me and it takes time to believe it, but after all is said and done, I'm gonna be the lonely one. My aim is hopeless and no amount of practice seems to help. The gun camos and stickers, however, are fantastic. Stattrak? Absolutely beautiful. I can no longer picture my life without it. I can't stop. I won't stop. 200 confirmed kills and counting. I only play this game when I have nothing better to play, and it never fails to crush my self esteem. I am no good at games. I am worthless. What's the point of anything? Where did everything go so wrong? How did I end up like this? I don't care but I do. I don't like me. I just can't do it anymore. I wouldn't hesitate to buy this again.

review: What can I say? This game harbours an explicit way of first person shooters. Run, Aim and Shoot, but you ask yourself, is that really it? My answer and hundreds and thousands will agree with me here in saying, NO! This game is not explicit, this game is so complex that It breaks away from every shooter to date. This game is an anomaly. This game will treat you hours upon hours of enjoyable strategies, intense nail-biting games, immeasurable comebacks, case(key)purchasing, hacker allegations, skin buying and the most celebrated attribute to this game, Fun. Competitive gamemode is what I will be discussing in this paragraph.Counter Strike Global Offensive does what Call of Duty and many other shooters can't, team strategeies. While team strategies don't prove to be utmost prevalent in some Fps's, this game basks in that essence, it basks in that oasis of serenity. Team strategies is so important in this game, that If you have a 'bad' team, you will find yourself a little vexed because one guy cant smoke mid, or cant aim with an AK-47, but when you do find yourself that perfect mix of players, then will you really enjoy the essence of the game. Now the non-competitive gamemodes do add in a sort of haven for people just starting out. Arms race, the gamemode in which you start out with a gun and once you progress killing the opposing team, your guns will also progress. Once you reach the gold knife level, then you really have a challenge. Casual servers are perfect for practicing for competitive and gun aiming too. Now some cons in the competitive servers are that you will find some players are quite belligerent and abasing in the sense that they will troll you, teamkill you, annoy you and will critique the very way you play, but in my opinion, just have fun and try not to get those types of people inside your head. In conclusion, I strongly believe that this game is fantastic, it strays away from that different side of fps's and delivers fantastic gameplay and enjoyable hours. I reccomend this game to anyone that owns steam.

review: Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is definitely a step in the right direction. All the people who played the older CS games will feel right at home with all the classic maps. However, everyone, no matter if it's a new player or veteran, will have to get used to new things like recoil patterns, movement, etc. So everyone has an equal chance of winning, depending on how much they've played and gotten use to the game, of course. CS:GO combines tactics with shooting skills so well that it is one of the best well-ballanced and competitive shooters out there.

review: The Classic thinking mans shooter, updated with contemporary graphics and online fixins', this is the only FPS for me. Period. It was preceded by Counter-Strike Source, probably one of the greatest competitive FPS games of all time, and only added great things to it with the new update. The Console version sucks, this is the one to play. Like someone before me said more eloquently, "You either die like a -s c r u b- , or live long enough to be called a hacker..."

I love Counter Strike and will always love the game, people care about graphics pfffft, it is all about gameplay and this game has it. It is 1000x better than COD and all other first person shooter, if you are looking for a game that will bring a lot of fun to you this is the game to get. Once you get into it, you can never stop playing from how fun the game is, best gameplay, best first person shooter and I strongly recommend this game.

review: Counter Strike has come a long way since it was a Half-Life mod in the late 90's and is still just as fun as the first day I played it. If you're looking to purchase an FPS that will outlast any COD or Battlefield game you've ever owned stop here. We've been playing on the same core maps since the beginning and we still come back for more. There's no other FPS experience like it. Valves best title in my opinion.

review: Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS GO) offers a simple, yet surprisingly fun approach to the FPS genre. Coming from Battlefield 3 (which I find fun as well), I found CS GO to be a refreshing alternative. While there isn't much variety in what weapon one is able to use compared to many other shooters, it does make it easier for the developers to ensure that gameplay is well balanced. The fact that it is so easy to find a match to jump into also helps to make CS GO a great game. My only criticism is that you are not able to disable bots in private matches (either that, or I can't find the option to do so), when I sometimes want to play 1 vs 1 with a friend. *EDIT: You can disable bots using the "bot_kick" command ingame* Overall, at the normal price of $14.99 USD, which is the price of some DLC's in many games, CS GO is a great value game that is worth every cent, let alone its price during the many sales Valve holds on steam.

review: This game, I picked up on multiple other accounts. Why? For support. Haha, just kidding. It was because competitive bans are stupidly hard-. Oh, there's trolls on your game... and they kicked you? Be banned for a week. You had to go help your roommate put away groceries? Get an auto-kick and 2 minutes later be banned. It goes WARNING > 30 MINUTES > 2 HOURS > 24 HOURS ... and I don't remember from there. Either you have trolls, foreigners because of the terrible matchmaking, unranked terribad players or AFK'ers. There's the off chance you get awesome teammates who communicate, call, voice chat and are really cool. That's nice to have once or twice. The ranking system is absolute . I am still an SEM when I have clutched 90 point games multiple times as SEM. I practically get 2 aces a game, and am called a hacker by silver. I don't get the ranking system, and don't get me started on foreigners + the TERRIBLE tick rates. I have shot, over a few games in my time point blank and he killed me with myself doing 0. Little things like this just add to your hatred of the game, but you always come back. Why? Because it's addicting. That's why I gave this game a positive recommendation. Get this game.

review: When it comes down to it, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive may follow the same old formula of gameplay seen in previous versions of Counter-Strike, but it's still a well-rounded tactical shooter. It may not try anything drastically different or revolutionize the series by taking it in a new direction, but there's still enough there to appeal to newbies and hardcore fans alike.

review: It doesn't matter how good you are any more, you will be judged solely on the market value of your inventory. You should have one of your several Karambit knives equipped at all times and inspect it in game whenever possible to ensure that anybody who is spectating you is aware that you are aware you're being watched and you are absolutely showing off that extremely pricey knife you own. Your stats are irrelevant now, most people aren't even aware that the 'Tab' key actually has a function in game. It doesn't matter if you don't know what 'eco' means. Fuck team work. You have a 'BOOM' AWP in your inventory, as long as you have $4750 cash in game you're buying an AWP. You will mock anyone who decided to give their Nova the 'Walnut' skin. Same goes for people who give their FAMAS the 'Doomkitty' skin. You will only equip 'StatTrak' weapons and the first thing you do when you acquire one is go on an idle server and get several hundred kills on AFK players in order to pad the stats so you don't look like a total n00b. Whenever a new case is released you will buy as many cases and keys as it takes in order to acquire 'an Exceedingly Rare Special Item!' Disregard the fact that you will end up spending three times as much as you otherwise would've by buying this directly from the market, it's only your parents' money after all. Besides, your birthday is next month and Christmas/Easter/[insert public holiday here] is just around the corner so you won't have to wait too long before you can blow more of their money on digital goods. You will also plaster ever single skin you own with multiple unseemly stickers with the intention of creating a unique skin for your weapon. Your 'Easy Peasy' and 'Ninjas in Pyjamas' stickers totally don't look ridiculous whatsoever. You will also name tag all of your weapons in order to add that final personal touch to the weapon you invested so much time and money in. You don't own an AK or an M4 any more, you only own weapons with names like 'xXx OG Snoop Dogg' and 'dubstep warrior'. You now have all the knowledge required to start playing CS:GO. Go forth and procure many skins of great value.

review: Revan was only 23 years old. He loved CS:GO so much. He had most of the achievements and items. He prayed to Gaben every night before bed, thanking him for the inventory he's been given. "CS:GO is love," he says, "CS:GO is life." His elder Dragon hears him and calls him a silver scrublord. He knows his elder is just jealous of his son's devotion to Gabe. He calls him a console peasant. He slaps him and sends him to sleep. He's crying now and his face hurts. He lays in bed, and it's really cold. He feels a warmth moving towards him. He looks up. It's Gabe! He's so happy, Gabe whispers into Revan's ear, "Try your chances... Open a case." Gaben grabs Revan with his powerful dev-team hands and puts him on his hands and knees. He's ready. Revan opens his pockets for Gabe. Gabe puts his hands deep into Revan's pockets. It costs so much, but Revan does it for CS:GO. Revan can feel his wallet emptying as his eyes start to water. He accepts the terms and conditions. Revan wants to please Gabe. Gaben lets out a mighty roar as he fills Revan's computer with keys. Revan opens all the cases and gets nothing worth anything at all.

review: When i bought this game in early 2013 i didnt think it would become into on eof the most biggest eSport games of 2014/2015. At first i wasnt that keen on the game, everything was unbalanced and it was so weird and bad compered to 1.6 and Source, then when Valve decided to put some efort into polishing this game it turned out to be one (if not the best) game that they made. Everyone on Steam needs to have this masterpiece of a game. 10/10

review: Recently got hooked on this game and it is fanastic. Been playing a lot recently. Casual is blatantly not very fun. Arms race can have its moments however. The real fun in the game is found through competitive. You work your way through various skill groups and earn cool weapon camo's that have the potential to go for upwards of $100 USD on the market. Great game, highly recommended.

review: Since I have a tie and have a masters in Keyboard warrioring (game design) this is a well ballenced and competitive game. From my over 600 hours of record at the game I have still not learned a single thing but I still keep on coming back. I am currently I SILVER 2 and LOVE THE PLAYERBASE, every game I either get kicked for teamm8s afking in my fire or walking into my nades. Atleast in CALL OF DUTY BLOPS 5423525425525435 there is no competitive enviorment because all they care about is $15 DLC for crap maps. This game is amazing Remember kids EZ skins EZ life You can guess if your teamm8s are good at the game just by looking at their names EG xXquickscopezXx is B4D while GlobalElieteMeister is probably a SILVER 1 and is going to wrek you Overall I stil am typing random crap anyways just got qued up for a league game so my verdict is 9.9/10 -Bryan Porter Diamond I ADC

review: Counter Strike, if you haven't played it, you should. the competitive playstyle of the game makes it that much better than any other First Person Shooter I've played. This game requires a lot of strategizing during competitive gameplay, or "ranked" as I deem it. You really have to pay attention to th little things, where your crew is, if you hear footsteps or placing your shots directley on the head. Personally, I think this was one of the best if not best purchase I've made on steam.

review: I was in a 1v5 situtation and we were the CT's. I headshot a guy with my m4a4 and then went over to his body and picked up his AK47. I then went down a staircase to find a guy staring down at me. I shot him down quickly whilst also seeing another guy coming. I backed off and let him rush out, then killed him. By then, the bomb had been planted. I went to A bombsite and saw an AWPer so I killed him before he could 1 shot me. The last guy was camping next to the bomb with a P90, so I picked up the guy's AWP and saw a small bit of his head peeking out. Bam. He's dead. I quickly ran with my knife to the bomb and defused it...well most of it anyway. We lost because I was a second too late and the bomb exploded. 11/10 would play again

review: Very great game and can be handled by even an under-budget pc on high settings, fun for all and the best part about the game is competitive play, you have ranks which improve as you improve, so you get ranked with the people from your skill level, and as your skill level improves, you improve your rank as well so you get higher ranked people as enemies and teammates. It's very cheap aswell and you can even make money with the game itself from the drops that you get after a game. It's not much but the game is very big and also has it's own community servers, has ongoing support from the creators and gets updated around every month with new skins for guns. There is no in game purchaseable content (except for the operation challenge coins) which give you an advantage over other people. Very fun game and I greatly recommend it!

review: This game is a skill game unlike Call of duty and Battlefiled. You have no iron sights,so you have to know how to shot your weapons. If you have played Counter Strike-Source or other CS games,then this is the game for you. This game is not noob friendly. It requires you to work as a team. It is not a 'rush in and kill everyone yourself" game. You have to be careful as if it was a real life moment. How ever it is still a fun game. If you have the nerve you can still learn to play and be as good as everyone else. I hope this helps you. Becuase it would have helped me.

review: It is quite a change. CS:GO is clearly not the same game as CSS or 1.6. Weapons feel more realistic, and the gameplay feels a lot stiffer than CSS. There are new weapons and introduces very different aspects to the already famous game. This time around it really feels like a professionals game. Nontheless, CS:GO is very fun, and if you're a fan of the Counter-Strike series, i think you'll enjoy this too. You just have to get used to the new mechanics. It's not the best of the lot, but Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a welcome change to the CS community.

It just keeps getting more features : competitive mode, matchmaking, skins for guns to raise funds for CS league, video and highlights from all your past matches, watch live games, better hostages mode, gun game mode includes. However, they just keep adding stuff without fixing all the issues and bugs from past updates. This games is unplayable for some people over the Internet but great in LAN. The gun skins update brought lower fps to the game, going down by 80 to 120 fps.

review: Wow. This game is great. At first, you will get your  handed to you like a scrub. Unless you played Counter Strike and Counter Strike Source. In which case, you should be fine. This game can only be played well, with good internet. And you need to not rage. Trust me, its hard not to, but its way more fun to have fun. (Makes sense, right? XD) Anyways, this game is a money grabber, and can bag you dollars as well. With the case system, your chances of getting rare weapons are slim, but when you do get one, you feel amazing. (Espically that damn Butterfly Knife) I extremely recommend this game to anyone looking for an FPS. Even COD players could play this game. Granted that they know the game controls. And don't ask, "How does one aim down sights." Because you can't. Never. Bottom-line Good game. Buy it.

review: Great game, classic shooter. Really strays from the "Modern Millitary Shooters" we have today. The community has a large ammount of veteran players that are often rude but the game has to go down in history as one of the greatest first person shooters of all time due to it's attention to detail. Where the bullet lands is an important role in this game and just because you get the jump on someone does not mean you're coming out alive.

review: It is an okay game and could be lots of fun, but the real problem is the haters of noob's. If you are new to the game most are just haters and not friendly. This game takes time to learn to play and most are not willing to teach you, much the same as in Dota 2. If you are lucky to find someone willing to teach you then the haters harass them also and want to know why you are doing it. Sorry but this is true and if you are one one the haters remember you where once new to the game, and not all learn at the same rate. Try to be more kind to your fellow gamer and help them out.

review: While getting into this game can be kinda hard since it's not your average noskill shooter. The moment you get the basics this game become extreme fun. You rely in your teammates more than you would think and communication is key. I would buy this game if you like teamwork and you like games that require skill to play. Or you can just buy a p90, rush, and enjoy silver rank.

It teaches you that team work and calling someone a "ing " for missing a shot. It teaches you that it is okay to invest thousand's of dollars into a game worth $15. Overall, this game teaches you many things. 10/10 would let my future children play.

review: Counter - Strike : Global - Offensive, where do i start? First of all: The maps look pretty nice! The gameplay seems pretty realistic! I recommend this game, because of the play style and the amount of fun you can have with friends. You can play a Casual game, where you can pracise your every move. Or you could go on a community server and fool around. Or if you have more competitive tastes you can play competitive games against other people. What ever it is you do, if you want a legit game with actual aiming and strategic gameplay and that you want a fully fleshed out game, then this is the game for you. A must get, action packed game. P.S Played a game with all Russians on my team Won 16-0 Best game evar

review: Another addition to the Counter Strike franchise. Been playing this game for 10 years plus, and still am finding new ways to do things each and every day.

review: Pretty impressed at the fact that Valve improved the graphics quite a lot and added a few more game modes like arms race etc. which does make it a bit COD-ish but still the simplicity of the Counter-Strike series was maintained. Although many new maps were added, we still notice the classic maps like Dust, Dust2, Aztec etc. It's not a very fast paced fps like COD or BF yet it's very enjoyable to play.

review: Competitive game with great community. Addicting, fun and sporty. Don't play after a sale though, lots of hackers are coming! There are more modes of gameplay. There's Arms Race (which is basically gun game for those who have played previous CS titles), Deathmatch, Classic Casual, Classic Competitive. Classic is in my opinion the best to spend time on and once you feel ready you can hop on a competitive with your friends. Don't worry if none are available, the matchmaking system will match you with adversaries and teammates with matching skill. Improve your skill and more important: Have Fun! Who knows, maybe you'll be the one to beat the Champions.

review: One of the funnest/most addicting multiplayer games out there today. This is easily one of the best games I have ever played. With that being said, it does have its flaws. For starters the community is one of the worst in the video game industry. Constant arguments, insults, sarcastic, and obnoxious people littered all over CS:GO. Competitive is taken very seriously and you better hope you have a good team, or else it wont be a fun experience. Be prepared to get randomly kicked in games sometimes, and insulted for no reason. Besides some technical flaws, and the community, once again, CS:GO is one of the funnest games on the market to date. (10/10) -CM

I was a little hesitant in getting it and asked a few Steam friends about it and they said it was very good. I like the new graphical updates to source, it looks great and runs smooth. Sound and music are well done also. I like the stat and achievement tracking feature it has. I also like the fact that it has bot support for when I do not feel like dealing with whiny 10 year old punk kids. I enjoyed checking the new maps and gameplay options out, they are a lot of fun & challenging. CS:GO is a great addition to the franchise. I highly recommend picking this up for the low price tag it is being offered for. I look forward to all the new content that Valve has in store for CS:GO as well. That is the great thing about CS is its mod support and added content that unlike Battlefield and COD you seem to have to pay for or its no as user friendly for mods. Recommended

review: Ever since experiencing the release of the Half-Life I have supported Valve in full respect and purchased nearly all of the games they have released. Much creative freedom is allotted to any gaming community when a game's engine and development tools are released/updated for public use, as we can all agree on. It is extremely rare & valuable when a such development company finds more ways to reward its fanbase and community. Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is an excellent multi-player shooter that offers the most to its players than any other game on Steam. The competitive matches are extremely addictive, challenging and fun to play with a regular set of friends or teammates. A built-in video recorder allows you to watch/download your matches. Among other exciting elements are various live streams, competitive leagues and the community workshop. But what specifically highlights this game from the rest is the Marketplace. Being able to sell my unwanted guns/cases/rewards for Steam Wallet cash allows me purchase new games without spending much, if not anything. A MUST OWN! 10/10

review: This strategic team-based first person shooter brings back the classic elements of an old-school arena shooter, but with a strategic, almost MOBA style map design. A very refreshing shooter in a genre dominated by arcade shooters that don't require any level of skill. Well crafted with beautiful maps and solid mechanics, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is the only game that deserves to follow it's predecessors. If you buy this gem, beware: you WILL lose days of your life to this masterpiece of a multiplayer first person shooter. The only serious issue I had with this game is almost bad enough to turn me off of every valve game: the soldiers wear very bland shoes. How difficult would It be to give the soldiers some colourful shoes, with pointy tips of maybe springs in the heels. why would the developers not take into consideration the fact that players spends so much time looking at their feet, that perhaps, just maybe they would want to see something other than generic, boring, quite frankly lame shoes on the feet of their character. Step it up, Valve! This game is a solid 8/10, as it still lacks tactically more entertaining footwear

review: When it comes down to it, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive may follow the same old formula of gameplay seen in previous versions of Counter-Strike, but it's still a well-rounded tactical shooter. It may not try anything drastically different or revolutionize the series by taking it in a new direction, but there's still enough there to appeal to newbies and hardcore fans alike.

review: It's kind of hard to actually recommend this game since it's so similar to Counter-Strike: Source. It really looks like an updated version of source with "high definition" graphics and some extras. Of the new things included are offline with bots, which is a nice touch and can be used to farm achievements. The bot's AI are very nice and the difficulty scales well, easy will be easy, hard will be hard. Everything regarding multiplayer is almost completely the same with workshop support. Nothing is really added at all in that area, though it has the feeling like Call of Duty, where people buy the product because they know multiplayer will be fun. There is also an added menu for choosing which game style you want (Deathmatch, Planting the Bomb, Arms Race, Competitive, etc). Gameplay mechanics are very similar to Source. Literally, they are the same. Same old ladder climbing, same old running and walking, same everything. It's basically an HD remake of Counter-Strike: Source on the Source engine. One other bonus is the twitch.tv support. I assume it has to do with tournament streaming, etc because competitive mode is a rather large thing. If you've never played a Counter-Strike game, I definitely recommend it. If you have, buying is "border-line". Would you buy Call of Duty: Black Ops 2 if you heard it was similar to Call of Duty: Black Ops? You get many people who upgrade for the hell of it and the others who decide to stick to the older game as they feel like the sequel is a waste of money. CS:GO is definitely the case of that. Of course, keep in mind that this is a much newer game and has updated Steam connectivity. Very, very easy to connect to your friends or join a random game for a quick round. Playing with a microphone is highly advised. Not to be played with a controller. Valve does not rub out players for money for DLCs or anything that makes this game "pay-to-win." Anything received in game could even be sold for a profit (real-life, that is). Obligatory score: 9/10

review: Very great game and can be handled by even an under-budget pc on high settings, fun for all and the best part about the game is competitive play, you have ranks which improve as you improve, so you get ranked with the people from your skill level, and as your skill level improves, you improve your rank as well so you get higher ranked people as enemies and teammates. It's very cheap aswell and you can even make money with the game itself from the drops that you get after a game. It's not much but the game is very big and also has it's own community servers, has ongoing support from the creators and gets updated around every month with new skins for guns. There is no in game purchaseable content (except for the operation challenge coins) which give you an advantage over other people. Very fun game and I greatly recommend it!

The real fun in the game is found through competitive. You work your way through various skill groups and earn cool weapon camo's that have the potential to go for upwards of $100 USD on the market. Great game, highly recommended.

review: Since I have a tie and have a masters in Keyboard warrioring (game design) this is a well ballenced and competitive game. From my over 600 hours of record at the game I have still not learned a single thing but I still keep on coming back. I am currently I SILVER 2 and LOVE THE PLAYERBASE, every game I either get kicked for teamm8s afking in my fire or walking into my nades. Atleast in CALL OF DUTY BLOPS 5423525425525435 there is no competitive enviorment because all they care about is $15 DLC for crap maps. This game is amazing Remember kids EZ skins EZ life You can guess if your teamm8s are good at the game just by looking at their names EG xXquickscopezXx is B4D while GlobalElieteMeister is probably a SILVER 1 and is going to wrek you Overall I stil am typing random crap anyways just got qued up for a league game so my verdict is 9.9/10 -Bryan Porter Diamond I ADC

review: this game is absolutely fantastic. valve took all the loved aspects of the original game and added even more. now it's even easier to get into the game, all the things are noob friendly. you don't need to choose a map, CS:GO will pick your only loved Dust2 for you. aiming with ak47 is finally unnecessary as now it hits only in the head. if the game gets unbalanced, empty slots will be filled with easy bots that will help you to finally end this faster and start another match. playing with friends never was this easy. ask a friend to join you in the private lobby and enjoy searching for the match forever! or he can just join you as a spectator when you are in a game already with no availiable slots. finally CS:GO has a korean loot drop system, with a random drop rate. you can get a lovely skin to show off to your enemies or even a box, which you can open with a key bought in market for only 1.99$ to get extra vip luxury skin to show off to your enemies. again, the drop is random so it's unnecessary to win the game (please, explain this to everyone, so they could just run around and die, as they'll probably get their items no matter what, so why to struggle to have the best score?) also the game has a lovely feature to lag hard which allows you to run around but denies any damage dealt or taken which improves your surviving skills a lot. even more, DEATHMATCH mode! get your enemies spawned right behind you to double the fun! or just stand still and invulnerable waiting and aiming for the first one to come. if this is not enough for you, you can buy a ticket to an extra mode, because you just didn't spend enough money on the game itself and the skins for weapons you don't usually use. this game is brilliant. it has all the features an excellent FPS game should have. it's fun and not rage enducing at all. 10/10. buy it. then spend all of your mom's money on keys and boxes to be fabulous, only noobs play with basic skins.

review: Certainly a game you have to stick at for a while to have any sort of fun with! More often than not I am frustrated by my inability to hit simple targets due to the way recoil works; for people like me it can be a brilliant game one moment and horrible the next. The player base in match making seems mostly comprised of people who's main aim in life is to tell you how much you suck at video games and generally treat you with contempt and unfriendliness, but if you play with friends and ignore the unpleasant mob, you can find a rewarding game, and even some genuinely friendly people who are there to help you improve or just have fun in bad situations. Before jumping into competitive, it's probably wise to familiarise yourself with the rules, as friendly fire and dodgy internet connections alike can result in temporary bans. The graphics are quite nice, some of the voice work is a bit weird to me, but often a source of hilarity.

review: Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) the newest addition to the Counter-Strike franchise supposedly takes the best from both its most famous predecessors, Counter-Strike 1.6 and Counter-Strike Source. I as a person who has played 1.6 for approximately 8 years cannot confirm that wholy, but I can at least say that the game is fun to play, with the biggest advantage it has over it's older brothers being the matchmaking. I would easily pay Valve $100 for 1.6 with the matchmaking from CS:GO. But that is not gonna happen so for the time being I just have to settle with what CS:GO offers. I might have sounded a little more negative than I wanted. The graphics are nice enough even though well aged Source engine, although with the newest tweaks, cannot compare with latest AAA production. Apart from new look you will find your all time favorites from previous Counter-Strike games, same goes for weapons and game mods. However there is not only an old content. You will find couple of new guns and what I appreciated most were new maps created by community and published in buy-able packs by Valve providing the creators with part of earnings. Later on the game suffered an attack of "dropable" content. Fortunately Valve did not step over cosmetic changes, so you can only spend your hard earned bucks on different weapons skins, at least for now.

review: this is a great game in many ways it is more accessible then the 1.6 version (which was already very accessible). but new players are able to learn how to play very fast and their enjoyment is greater then the one they would have had at the start of 1.6 or cs source. but on the other hand there is one little gripe i have and it is that i balive they made it to simmple, and when i say little i mean tiny, so the gripe is only personal i believe and it shouldn't effect your gameplay. enjoy the game :)

review: Counter Strike Global Offensive has a perfect mix of Casual and Competetive Gaming. If you are just starting out on the game you can play modes such as deathmatch, demolition and arms race before jumping in to competetive. Competetive is the perfect way to prove yourself as a good player as you will be placed in to games based on your competetive rank which is good for new-comers to the game. I personally enjoy the competetive aspect of the game over casual although I have noticed a few faults with in the matchmaking system. Sometimes somebody who is a low level gold (such as myself) you are sometimes placed in to a game with the top level golds or sometimes even Master Guardians. This could be because the MG's are playing with their lower leveled friends or it may be the system trying to test your level for promotion. I would give this game a 8/10 and recommed it to anybody who hasn't tried it.

However after recently buying it, I noticed that it has changed a lot since beta, and I enjoy playing it. If someone likes CS:Source but has never tried CS:GO before, then I recommend buying this. I think it's a lot better than CS:Source ever was.

review: One of my favorite games, I play it every day. One of the only FPS i like at the moment. It's really fair, if you die it's most likely your own fault and not by some cheap killstreak reward. Love the competitive matchmaking. It also has dedicated servers with most of the mods from Source. If you like CS it is a must buy. If you are not really good at shooters it can be fun to play arms race, deathmatch and other random custom gamemodes. Can be really hard to get into though, but the game has ranks that will match you with opponents with the same skill level. If you put some time on it you will improve quickly :)

You feel like becoming a better person is the goal of the game each time: you get a "clutch" victory or even die in a bad 1v1. This is a skill based shooter! The game is not about getting a new scope for your weapon... Improvement of yourself as a person and understanding how things work. I cannot recommend this game enough to anyone I talk to. If you want to become a better person and learn about discipline, self-respect, and teamwork. You need to try this game!

review: The true successor to 1.6. VALVe really went out of their way to make sure this game came out the way it did, catering both to the grizzled ancients and newbies alike. The engine feels just right when it comes down to firing your weapon and landing the shots, if not rewarding, but expect to be punished for careless mistakes as it always has been on the series in general. The skill ceiling is a high one, as expected, but the game does its best to prepare you for online play with the increased range of difficulty levels for the bots (with 'casual' being nothing short of a shot gallery rather than an actual bot match) as well as the general course; this last one I think works as more of an introduction to the series than an actual tutorial for those already familiar with the basic game mechanics. While I still remain iffy about the introduction of microtransactions to the series, I think VALVe has done it just right by limiting your purchase of skins to the marketplace (a completely optional feature of Steam in general) and, of course, their infamous "crates" first featured in Team Fortress and relabled as "Cases" for the sake of consistency with the in-game universe. As always, Counter-Strike isn't a game for everyone, but whether you're a veteran to the series or just interested in seeing what the fuzz is all about and make a first break into the games, I highly recommend CS:GO. Also, I apologize for my incessant use of run-on sentences.

review: Ok so a lot of people are complaining that this "isn't like the older counter-strikes". In my opinion, it does feel more like call of duty than anything else, and sometimes the spawns are bloody terrible. But considering call of duty is ridiculoulsy overpriced on Steam, cs go is a good, cheap, alternative. I especially like the remakes of the older maps.

review: This is just a marketing game, even it's named Global Offensive, so its abbreviation come out as GO (DAT MARKETING SKILLS THO), nothing global in this game (although there are some new maps that take place in a different part of the world), but if you liked the CS 1.6, you'll defenitelly like this as much, because the developers were too afraid to adapt any new mechanincs in the game, even the ridiculous ladder climbing remained the same. (They could have made an animation for climbing, but many say that that would slow the gameplay, but not if the character would step two ladder rungs instead of one, or something like this) It's just looks horrible among the few realistic mechanisms But while they tryied to implement realism (the way you have to aim with the scope with rifles) the aiming system is still... well... "undeveloped" to me. It's a good thing that the most liked maps like dust and assault are still in it, and they are all improved with destroyable doors, barrels and other objects, and in the game, not all weapons works the same way, that's a good thing again! This is why it's hard to say wheter I recommend it or not. I, of course recommend from an aspect that many players bougth the game, the 1.6 version were so popular, I BET you have a friend on your list who play this game, but in the other hand this game is nothing but a poor work making new source of money in my opinion. But saying positive again for conclusion, I'm an audiophile, and I LOVE its music, the music system is very well made, when you get killed the dramatic music kicks in and so on, and I can't complain about its graphics if I look away from the animations. Overall, yes, I recommend this game.

review: The definitive Competitive online FPS, It blow's away the competion with good map design, and the overall gameplay. This game is all about getting every slight advantage you can, and using it against your oppenent. This game is not like Battlefeild, or CoD this game is very much like chess, where your placement and positioning can affect the outcome of a game. This all adds up to make CS:GO one of the most addicting game's I've ever played. I'd reccomend playing with friends instead of solo queing, because you are very likely to lose if you solo que. With that said, Good Luck HAVE FUN!

review: This game is very fun and can get addicting. All the game modes are enjoyable. I personally pick this one over CSS because of the graphics. There are also cool skins in this game, but getting them will burn a hole in your wallet. To get skins you either have to buy them or earn them by playing online, but even if you earn them, you will have to purchase a key to actually open it. That is why you will end up spending a lot of money if you are really into skins. Overall, this is a great first person shooter game that you will enjoy.

review: What can I say... Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is one of the better first person shooters, not because it has the better visuals or because the game has a more upstanding community but because the gameplay in this particular game was bred for competitive play. Counter-Strike has been achieveing this level competitive play since the begining and hasn't stopped since. If you are looking to pickup Counter-Strike: Global Offensive here are some reasons to persuade you to pick up CS:GO over it's competitors. 1. CS:GO is not about running and gunning - In CS:GO accuracy is everything and timing your shots could be the difference between life and death, where in games like Call of Duty and Battlefield where the game has a community of squeaking children who "dropshot" in order to get a kill, In CS:GO you will find it more likely than not if you run around and spray you will die more than you will frag, this is because of the accuracy system. 2. Unlike most other first person shooter games CS:GO requires alot of teamplay to actually achieve a victory in the competitive gamemodes. If you come into the game unprepared you will probably get yelled at by some experienced players but do not let them discourage you, you will become better and surpass even their skill level. Learn calls, smokes and any other tactical thing you can learn in this game to give yourself the edge and most of all never talk negative to your teammates as this will just provide stress and tension between your teammates and yourself. 3. Skill Groups are a big part of CS:GO, In games like battlefield and call of duty your skill group will always go up as you play the game and earn exp, but in CS:GO the ranking system is a little different, ELO is what CS:GO uses and it does a really good job of accurately matching you against an opponent of your skill level. Everytime you play a full competitve match of CS:GO whether it be a win or a loss your ELO will take a hit, so if you win your ELO ranking will increase and if you win most of your games you will end up at a higher skill group which is displayed by an ingame rank. If you lose most of your games you will most likely downrank which is fair as if you lose most of your games you probably do not belong in your skill group and got there by pure luck or beating other people that do not belong at their skill group. 4. Skins - Alot of people hated skins when they first added them as they thought the game was going through a transformation into Team Fortress 2 but they couldn't be more wrong about such an event. Skins were added to the game to be monetary gain and to show support for the game by making it so community members could create and possibly get their content implemented into the game. This allowed the general community to have a bigger impact on more things in the game. Skins come in all colors, shapes and sizes to fit the default guns in the game and add an artisitc visual to the game that is otherwise non-existant by the games map and other textures. Skins can also be traded and vary in prices so you can make money just from playing the game and also sink tons of dough into the game. 5. It's fun - This game will not always be fun as the learning curve in this game is massive and you will probably find yourself asking yourself why you are even playing this game but then you will remember that you want to learn how to be better and once you do the game will open up and become one of the better games you play as this game is has everything that other games from the same genre are missing. Keep playing and never giveup. This is just a taste of the game and everything else their is to love in CS:GO comes naturally to those that play the game frequently, I hope you read this review fully and are intrigued if you do not already own this game.

review: This is by far the best game I've ever played. I like shooters, so that's what I tend to look for on steam. When you pick this game up, you're going to have to forget everything you know about modern shooters if you want to win. First off, the game has an insane competitive atmosphere. 5v5 matches that use a (mediocre) ranking system last up to 90 minutes at a time, leaving you on the edge of your seat for those clutch moments. The community is amazing at helping you learn the game, and you'll find the right people and the right playstyle. You have to be dedicated to win here, learning map call-outs and memorizing different plays, recoil patterns and likely spots where an enemy can be. It's a great game to pick up and play casually, but even better to go hardcore with your buddies. However, with every great game, there are bad parts to it. As mentioned before, the ranking system is slightly mediocre. Nobody really knows how it works but some games end up unfair. Next, you'll stumble upon hackers often, especially at the high high ranks. You can report them, and they'll get banned(most of the time), but most of the time you lose the game and you'll get deranked. (recent changes make it so that if a hacker is reported and banned, the loss will not count towards your official stats/wins, but if you do manage to win it still counts). Lastly, there's the workshop. If you're talented, you can make skins and maps for the community and if Valve likes them they go into weapon cases; then they can be sold on the market. Some weapons can run you up to $400 dollars while others are a measly 2 cents. OVERVIEW PROS: +Competitive scene +playing with buddies +awesome people you can meet +teamplay CONS: -Hackers -Scammers -s -Mediocre ranking Conclusion - if you like shooters and competitions, pick this game up for you and 4 of your friends and go own some noobs.

review: CSGO continues the brutal, infuriating, and wonderful Counter-Strike series that taunts you to be a better player with every game. I was somewhat skeptical during the beta before the addition of the casual mode, but the continuous updates and gameplay additions makes it the new TF2 in my mind. The bifurcation of competitive from casual and gungame does a good job grouping players with like minds. This title is endlessly playable with a vibrant community that is quite a bit more mature than the cod (fish?) players that slime around the net. The map system and continued mod extensibility makes it a premiere title on steam. My lame complaints (No more TMP) (MP7/UMP are too awful) (Aimpunch kinda broken) don't really detract from the goodness to be had. Graphics got a very nice upgrade over source and most of the maps got carried over. 9/10 for my next obsession.

review: This game is one of the best, no, the best FPS I have ever played and will continue to be because it's so unique, it's different to Call of Duty, Battlefield and Medal Of Honor, this game is just spectacular and will be one of my favourite games of all time, but... there's one problem with CS:GO, it goes on sale way to often... I want more people to play CS:GO but not when those people already own it and they just use it to smurf and hack, the sale harms the game more than it does any good. If you got some spare pounds pick up this game but don't go into the game and expect everyone to be all lovey-dovey to you, some will be very harsh if you don't throw a flash well or if you don't get the kill so do prepare to get shoutted at a lot, the shouting helps, if someone says something that you should of done most of the times the person is teaching you what to do. This game is fantastic so do get it and do have a lot of fun with it.

review: Steam / VALVE big FAILURE!!!! Couples things why I like CS, its tactical games, and I made few good friends that I play with them alot. I like competitive match, because its required alot of teamwork during the game. Communications are very important. For me, winning game that play with good teamwork are more exciting to watch or rewarding feeling. Alot of tough players out there, some legits but also alot of players outhere are cheaters or hackers. By the way, just remember this is only game, winning or losing its not important, but again please dont spend your money on stupid skins. The more you buy, the more these creator taking advantage of your money. Money are hard to earn. At the end, please be smart!!! Ok, finally....I have to add this comments: 1. WHY YOU NEED TO HACKS OR CHEATS? if you like to win, please just play against bots. 2. VAC is big time FAILURE!!!! 3. OMG, please do something against SMURFS, CHEATERS, and HACKERS....stop making stupid skins, or create stupid boxes!!!!! Improve the VAC BAN, Active Moderator!!!! 4. CSGO Community, please dont be greedy!!!!! Y'all creating a loophole for the hackers. Stop drop the price...CSGO should be 50 dollars by now, so even hacker need to think twice. 5. At the end(the worst part), VALVE and STEAM failed to protect their custormer or members. Some of the people, their inventory got hacked by hacker so easily!!!! Scam everywhere!!!! VAC and steam need wake up!!!!

review: This, is the ultimate fps-title. No questions asked. It's not even a thing of opinion, it's clear, that a battlefield-game, and a call of duty-game comes up every year delievering same thing every year. This is different. There are multiple reasons why cs:go is superior over ANY other fps game i've ever seen/heard/played: Price, it's dirt--cheap. Yes, no csgo2 coming up next year. Gameplay: This game is competetive all the way. None of that CoD "competetive", where there is a kid from Iran singing some one direction song in the lobby. Community: one of the most active communities out there! Map-makers, skin-makers. You name it. Content: In this game, there aren't any map dlc's. The only things close to dlc's, are the "operations" where you can pay a couple of bucks to support the community map-makers, and getting access to those maps in official valve servers. Yes, and the official matchmaking is the nail in the other games' coffing. It offers not only a great (but annoying :D) rank system, it brings out serious gaming for the meta. Only thing i curse in this game, is the tickrate. Any cs-player knows the  behind Valve's servers, the tickrate. (the rate that in the server updates in a second) Usual tickrate for official matches, is 128. Valve servers offer 64. WHAT THE HELL VALVE!? But still, it offers HUGELY enjoyable expirience. This game has become one of my alltime favorite's. Why? Because it's the ultimate competetive shooter with tactical gameplay, teamwork, need of gamesense, and a kickass skin system! That's why!

review: Highly competitive! While the feeling of losing after a painful 45 minute competitive match, the feeling of a close win makes you so happy that your uterus will hurt... Personally I find myself to be the most inconsistent player in the world, and consistency is a key thing required for this game, as you need to win games in a row in order to rank up. I can't handle this and therefore my punishment is keeping my forever in the silver-zone. There are quite a number of hackers you may meet eventually though...

review: Counter Strike Global Offensive is a very good game, and you can even win items for some profit. I will jump right away to the pros and cons. Pros: -Steam Trading Cards. They do cost a nice amount of 6 cents, and you get a good amount from them from buying the game. -Accuracy improvement(sometimes) and some items to make your game more happy and colourful. -Settings allow you to change gameplay by a lot, HUD colours, minimap radar scale and much more! -You can even play 5 minutes if you are in a rush, and train your aim with other people. -A lot of community servers with a good amount of gamemodes and maps. -Overwatch for dedicated players. very good. no spoilerino spammerino. Cons: -You will get angry, occasionally. If you lose a "sure" shot on an enemy, you will daym. And even if he gets you with one shot without even any knowledge, you will call him a hacker. -Do not waste money on keys, really. It's a waste of time, and you can buy more games with that. Your luck may be with you, but you don't know. -People do spam a lot of their microphones and even have unlimited amount of reports to report anyone that is feeding, griefing or hacking. -Troll and griefing everywhere, people teamkilling you and they don't even get kicked. -----------------------------------| "Thanks ya for reading" -Zer0dg -| -----------------------------------|

review: Haven't played an CS games before and bought this because I can see a lot of my friends play this. The first time I played this game and I hooked myself into this game. Apart from little bit waiting time in matchmaking servers, I don't have any negatives for this game. Graphics is good, Maps are excellent, Control is easy and overall game is fun and enjoyable. It takes time to master the game but nevertheless it is a good game. I rate this game a 10/10. It is a must buy for all gamer for it's sheer variety of game types.

review: I'm gonna redo the review since mine was outdated. GO is Counter-Strike, and it's just as punishing as the other ones, but compared to Source you have better hitboxes and recoil system. What makes it the most played CS today is that for one it's the newest one, but more importantly Valve actually updates it, and built it from ground up from pro and community feedback. Gameplay-wise you'll have the same experience with enhanced visuals if you're a seasoned CS:GO player, but if you're new, you're probably going to get dominated if you simply jump into Competitive games. New players should watch Pro plays to get an understanding of game sense and get comfortable with a role, and for your own sake, don't solo-queue or you'll grow a hatred on everything that remotely sounds Russian. The roles are Entry and Second Rifler, Lurker, and AWPer. Even though many say AWPing is for noobs, don't get discouraged. If you feel yourself comfortable with the scoped 1shot rifle, go for the role regardless. As for matchmaking community, it goes as is. Silver will be the nicest teammates you can have, and might even gift you skins, but their kindness doesn't make up for skill if you seek the Competetive edge. Nova will be okay-ish, but there's some toxicity. Master Guardian to DMG will be toxics who flame you if you don't execute a play their way, even if it's a win. Eagles and upwards take this game too seriously, pursue a career in eSports, or soon will have a VAC badge on their account. Now that I've aforementioned skins, Arms Deal introduced them. At first it was recieved negative fire from the community, and even called TF2fication. Nowadays you'll find everyone being in posession of skins. There's even gambling sites for digital items from this game and keys have become a digital currency, making the TF2 point somewhat true in terms of economy. You'll want to consider whether or not to jump into this game, as it'll take a lot of time to be "decent", since the competitive part has a lot to learn. If you're more of a casual player, there's also game modes that cover that, and the legacy Community Servers which are put into the background, but luckily still existent and very active. Competetive or not, it's a worthwhile shooter for it's price which can even pay itself if you have sufficient semantics skill or are plain lucky, and if you look long enough you might find the nicer part of this community. But also pay attention to your expenses, should you get into unboxings, as special offers and music kits, are also cosmetic items. In a nutshell: You don't need them because they're cosmetic, but you get them anyway for bragging rights or to be part of the cool kids. Now jump in, and don't forget the Defuse Kit. [If you happen to be Russian, ignore the last sentence.]

review: Global Offensive is definitely a Counter-Strike sequel -- it looks and feels familiar , with minor tweaks here and there to help balance old issues and surprise longtime players . This is a demanding , skill-based multiplayer game that's as satisfying now as it ever was , but it's for a specific kind of player . If you're not willing to learn to play different than you're used to , look elsewhere . Otherwise , this is a top-tier tactics game that will probably share the long-tailed legacy of its predecessors .

review: I have mix feelings of this game...so heres a Rice Krispy recipe: 1/4 cup butter 1 (10 oz., about 40) pkg. regular marshmallows or 3 cups miniature marshmallows 6 cups Kellogg's Rice Krispies cereal In a large saucepan, melt butter over low heat. Add the marshmallows and continue to stir until the marshmallows have completely melted. Remove from heat. Stir in the Kellogg's Rice Krispies cereal coating them well with the melted marshmallow mixture. Using a buttered or silicone spatula, press the mixture evenly into a 13 x 9 x 2 inch pan which has been buttered or sprayed with non-stick spray or lined with wax paper. Cut into squares when the mixture cools. Makes 24 squares.

review: This game is probably the best game i've purchased on steam. I mainly play this game competetively, so if you dont like games that get harder and require practice to eventually be really good at, i would'nt think that you'd love this game. But I am not saying that this is a bad game by any means, i have tons of friends that never play competetive but still love the game. This game is also fun to play with friends on community servers to play common things like surf, mini games, or jailbreak. Even if you dont like the competetive aspect of the game you should still buy it and try it out considering that its only 15 dollars! Another thing that makes this game great is the economy; i've probably made about $25 dollars off the game so far, but also given back about $30 dollars from gun camo's, DLC, and cases, etc... If you have an extra $15 to spend i tottaly recommend this game, but you never know, you might just end up with about +500 hours in the game like me.

review: This game actually forced me to study russian. This game is genuinely good if, and only if, you have a full team to play with. If you go solo queue, it's 99% that you will get the ruskipolskiblyat team that calls gg after the lost pistol round / and then again you will get a full team of svenskapojkar in your enemy team that have the most luck in this game no explanation available. -Start pistol round, buy kevlar, go somewhere, see a T running on the otherside of the map->one dinks you in the head. Also the timing in this game is something magical. Get a nade/knife in hand or reload -> no matter what situation enemy will be 500% more likely to peek. Watch a certain spot for 30secs, turn around, get killed from the spot. -Half time, the screaming and all nonsense noise contest. Once it gets in your blood, you can't quit.

review: Counter-Strike: Global Offensive created by Valve is first person shooter which needs a lot of teamwork to play and win. There have been many CS released such as Source and Condition Zero all I have but have not gotten around to play them yet at the time of this review. The only CS I have played other that GO is Source and comparing them together GO has seemed better from a grahical and easy to use stand point but that is my opinion. CS does not seem to have a campaign and is full on muiltplayer which some people might called that bad but it effects the game none. There are some gamemodes in CSGO like Arms Race, Search & Destroy and Hostage all quite gamemodes to play and really enjoyable. Other than these gamemodes there are to catorgies that the game falls under, Causal where you can just play for fun and Competitive which I find the most fun because people can't leave unless they want to have temp ban which keeps the game fun for everyone. During your time going for headshots and back stabbing afkers after every game you will have a chance like in TF2 to get a item but instead of items there are camos kinda of easy to guess since its made by valve these make the game even better having all different types of camos instead of looking at a bland gun. I rate this 9/10 because some points teamwork is a advantage and make you work with your team to win also is great fun to play. I do think 11.99 is a bit much but i defently got my money out of it even if your not a big first person shooter.

review: After almost a year of owning and playing this game, csgo all of a sudden takes up 1.2GB of memory for whatever reason putting my ping to a constant 500+. If there is a way to fix this please tell me because i am no longer able to play the game. 5/10 due to that.

review: Let's start off by saying this game is the best one in the CS series. I'd say that CS:GO is a remade version of 1.6, which suits the needs of the current generation - better graphics, stuff is fancy. There is also this gambling aspect of opening cases and betting skins. I really do not know if I like it or not. Some kids get happy over their new stuff when the other kids are crying after losing their whole skin collection in one click. Now, the game itself. There's a new "mode" called competitive. People take this rather seriously. You can play it to get higher in rank - in case you've got what it needs to get there, which means you'll get better opponents when you advance. Remember that you have to be on the same (or higher!) level as your opponents to get higher. You can also play it to realize you belong to the bottom floor. But being on the bottom floor is okay, right? You can only get better.
game-hours: 357.1
review: Of course CS:GO also has the classic server browser, wherein you can browse the servers, search them by tags/maps/player count/ping, regular stuff. Some of these servers also feature funmodes, which you can play when you feel like playing CS:GO but you CBA to tryhard. Most of those servers are noob-friendly. This game gets constant updates, which means tweaks to guns if some are deemed 'overpowered' or 'underpowered', new skins, new operations, new maps, and more. Be sure to have your credit card ready when these things happen, though!

review: Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) would have to be one of my favorite games on Steam or out of all Valve games! I love all the Counter-Strike games but when I played this I fell in love at first sight! Such nice gameplay the weapons are beautiful! I love collecting, I love to open up crates and cross my fingers for a good random gun! The game I was really impressed with! The teamwork and stratergy of the game is great as well!

review: The game is actually quite fun once you take some time to learn how the game works. At first, it is quite different from all fps due to the insane recoil patterns of the guns. There are only 4 guns to my knowledge that have scopes, the rest are hip-fire so you must rely on your reticle rather than sights to attain kills. Play and you will get better, however many games are luck of the draw. I find myself either being middle-of-the-road in most matches, or somewhere near the top. Of course, there's those comp games that go 16-1 and are infuritating but that is to be expected. This game is quite fun with friends, especially if you have mics to coordinate your attacks. There are a lot of wtf moments but also a lot of kick- ones. If I had a qualm, it would be that the ak is next to god when put in the right hands, but I guess that could be said for any weapon above par. Visuals are nice. Great community maps. Arms race is quite fun, similar to Call of Dooty's gun game but you descend guns rather than ascend which makes for a more even playtime. People I've encountered were mostly mixed, as there were a few douches but also a few cool people. However, if someone decides to be a  in comp it is frustrating as a bot replaces them. Solid 8/10 would recommend. Skins look cool however I wish there were more of them. Friend unboxed a knife 3rd key and I have yet to use a key for this game. :)

review: An FPS with MMO-style drops and items. This game does a lot of things right, and a couple things wrong (casual play is slightly skewed by an overabundance of the cheesiest sniper rifle ever put in an FPS), but all in all it's fun and addictive and a great way to hang out with your friends. 400+ hours in a game that cost me $4. It's hard not to recommend a game which presents that kind of dollar to time ratio.

review: I was only 13 years old, I loved Counter-Strike so much; I had every skin in the game, I prayed to Gaben every night before bed, thanking him for the life I had been given, I would chant, "Gaben is love, Gaben is life", My friend Cryptic hears me and calls me a noob, I knew he was just jealous of all my skins and my devotion to lord Gaben, So I called him a loser, He then deagles me and sends me to go get vac banned, I'm crying now, and I have a vac ban now due to him reporting me, I lay down, and I remember all the good times I had on CSGO, Then warm sensation starts to move towards me, I feel something touch me, It's Gaben, I am so happy, He whispers in my ear, "Thy ban shall be gone", He grabs me with his powerful hands and puts me on my hands and knees, I tell him, "I'm ready", I spread my butt for Gaben, He then penetrates my butt-hole, I can feel my butt-hole tearing and my eyes start to water, It hurts so much, but I cannot disappoint lord Gaben, I try push against his force but he is too strong, Then I remember this is for lord Gaben, so I have to endure the pain, He then roars a mighty Dragon roar and fills my butt with his majestic love, My friend Cryptic now walks in and stares at what is being done, Gaben looks at him straight in the eyes and says, "You are vac banned now", Gaben then flies out my window, I look out my window to find what no one has ever seen before, Gaben looks at me holding a copy of Half-Life 3 in his hands, Gaben then gives me an early access pass to test it, I then chant, "Gaben is love, Gaben is life"

review: I love this game. I have an insane fetish for getting shot in the face. Other games just couldn't satisfy this urge but jesus thank you CS:GO, now I join lobbies with a player hitting me in the face with a 7.62mm from an AK-47 that joyfully squishes into my face and turns in into a pulp. Oh god yes. As I visualize the copper lead bounce around in my skull, I achieve an  unbeknowest by any man, women, or living being on this planet, then I take a shower and cry. Overall 10000000000/10, greap fap material.

review: Gameplay: 5/5 Matchmaking: 3/5 Mechanics: 4.5/5 Visual: 4/5 Optimization:5/5 My pc isn't horrible but horrible pc's can run this. CS:GO In a nutshell: Very good game like the other counter-strike series, and is my favorite amongst them all. The gameplay is great, mechanics are amazing aswell although there are some bugs here and there. Game is geared towards smooth FPS and gameplay rather then the graphics/visual but still looks very appealing. This game isn't pay to win in any aspect which makes it absolutely skilled based. You can spend some money on it to get weapon 'skins' which are 100% cosmetic and have no change on the game. As a matter of fact, some weapon skins just make the gun easier to see and can lead the player holding it at a disadvantage. However, there are some exclusive maps in operations that are sold in passes which cost money. Despite that, the original maps are still the best in my opinion. Only thing I dislike about CS:GO is the matchmaking system. Sometimes it makes sense and sometimes it doesn't. In CS:GO there is a 'Competitive' mode for getting ranked and playing 5v5 in classic mode style. You can either play as a premade team which is up to 5 players partied up and ready to play, or solo queue. Now don't get me wrong, solo queueing is risky in this game and doing it is very ballsy. You might get matched up with trolls, players out of your skill level (better or worse than you by ALOT). You should probably get a team or at least 3 friends to play with that can help you improve in the game. When playing competitive try not to invite friends that are simply friends and are not good at the game (trust me, they can lose you many games and possibly even get you demoted). Valve tries to keep you matched up with people around your skill level. If you had a silver 1 (lowest rank) and a global elite (highest rank)premade, they will likely be placed against Nova or Guardian ranks. (Averageish ranks). Game can be frustrating sometimes but remember. Teamwork is key. Getting a random solo queue team that you're playing with to follow your strats will practically win you the game. Yelling at your teammates or being toxic isn't going to help. If you don't feel comfortable or simply want to play the game for fun and not getting ranked, there is casual. Casual is basically where you can just have some fun :). If you want to get better, read guides on the internet and practice, practice and practice. Deathmatch is good for getting your aim down and community aim maps are good too. There are also community servers for multiple gamemodes. Note: While playing CS:GO you can get drops in the game. You can then sell them on the market and they can get you some small change which you could later spend on some cheap skins. If you're lucky you could get some crazy skins worth quite a bit but that's very unlikely. Yes, this does mean you can make profit and trade in this game!

review: As hard as it is to wrap my head around first-person shooters, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive was unexpectedly one of the easier games to pick up and wrap my head around. I was always afraid of competitive- I'd never played a multiplayer match until about a month or so ago- and I never expected much by way of nice attitudes from the community. Boy, was I wrong. Bout 90% of the matches we hit had fair, nice, understanding, and overall good-hearted players. They'd understand if you made a mistake- and would help you through it on occasion. This game has its fair share of exploiters, hackers, and general douches who will act like  to you, but they're quite the minority from what I've seen.

review: Cs:Go is probably the best shooter out there. There are so many "AAA" Shooters out there for example "Battlefield" or "Call of Duty". Every Year there is a new "AAA" Game like this and you have to spend 30-60$ for this games. For Cs:Go you only have to spend 10-15$, and a new Counter Strike game comes only all 8-12 years. But you shouldn't start playing this game alone, tell your friends and play with them. So why should you buy the game? -It is very cheap -You can play it with your friends -You can earn money with it (creating weapon skins, bet on pro teams with skins or real money) -The Cs:Go Community is the probably biggest and best Community there is out there :) Thanks for reading, I hope you enjoyed my review :).

Every summer this is hands down the most fun you will experience making 12 year old children cry, without the risk of a restraining order. Listen to their pre-pubescent cries of "OMG H4X" as an endless series of small children who all claim to have slept with our mothers fail to understand that the AK-47 is perfectly accurate on the first shot, and that AWPs can kill through walls. 10/10 would make the children suffer again.

Practice in a fast-paced game of deathmatch, or a more relaxed battle of wits in a competitive match. It won't be long before you find yourself back on the community aim servers training your ever so important reflexes. This game is definatly a 10/10, and lives up to the reputations of the previous Counter-Strikes.

review: It's Counter Strike, the best FPS game to ever exist. Played CS since 1.5 days, took a long break between 1.6 and Source but couldn't resist the urge to come back and play. Classic maps, great gameplay, and I actually like the new addition of skins, stickers, etc. They bring a new dimension to the game that I believe many ppl enjoys. Highly recommended to anyone that enjoys playing FPS games. It's priced at a VERY FAIR price of $14.99, too.

review: Counter-Strike is one of the best games out there that you can purchase. It does bring back all of the stuff from CS:S but it adds many more features. It brings you many more gamemodes that can be fun, But Challenging as well. They also Brought in Camos which is very unique. And this game has been out for a Year, and it Still Updates every Week. Like the CZ75 just came out last week and there is a New Pass forgot the name but a New pass just came this week, it get's updated Constantly so it won't get boring Anytime soon. Also not just that, you don't need a Full Blown gaming computer to play this game. I use an i3-3227U 1.9 GHz and with Intel HD 4000 Graphics and I can run this game perfectly fine. I play at 1366x768, Anti-Aliasing off, Motion Blur:Off, and Shadows and Global Shadows turned all the way down and I manage to get 30-70 FPS. So if you don't have a Gaming computer but you want to play a Game where it doesn't drop below 30 FPS, This is a Game for you. It's worth buying this game, it's challenging and fun, It's worth it.

review: It doesn't matter how good you are any more, you will be judged solely on the market value of your inventory. You should have one of your several Karambit knives equipped at all times and inspect it in game whenever possible to ensure that anybody who is spectating you is aware that you are aware you're being watched and you are absolutely showing off that extremely pricey knife you own. Your stats are irrelevant now, most people aren't even aware that the 'Tab' key actually has a function in game. It doesn't matter if you don't know what 'eco' means. Fuck team work. You have a 'BOOM' AWP in your inventory, as long as you have $4750 cash in game you're buying an AWP. You will mock anyone who decided to give their Nova the 'Walnut' skin. Same goes for people who give their FAMAS the 'Doomkitty' skin. You will only equip 'StatTrak' weapons and the first thing you do when you acquire one is go on an idle server and get several hundred kills on AFK players in order to pad the stats so you don't look like a total n00b. Whenever a new case is released you will buy as many cases and keys as it takes in order to acquire 'an Exceedingly Rare Special Item!' Disregard the fact that you will end up spending three times as much as you otherwise would've by buying this directly from the market, it's only your parents' money after all. Besides, your birthday is next month and Christmas/Easter/[insert public holiday here] is just around the corner so you won't have to wait too long before you can blow more of their money on digital goods. You will also plaster ever single skin you own with multiple unseemly stickers with the intention of creating a unique skin for your weapon. Your 'Easy Peasy' and 'Ninjas in Pyjamas' stickers totally don't look ridiculous whatsoever. You will also name tag all of your weapons in order to add that final personal touch to the weapon you invested so much time and money in. You don't own an AK or an M4 any more, you only own weapons with names like 'xXx OG Snoop Dogg' and 'dubstep warrior'. You now have all the knowledge required to start playing CS:GO. Go forth and procure many skins of great value.

review: Revan was only 23 years old. He loved CS:GO so much. He had most of the achievements and items. He prayed to Gaben every night before bed, thanking him for the inventory he's been given. "CS:GO is love," he says, "CS:GO is life." His elder Dragon hears him and calls him a silver scrublord. He knows his elder is just jealous of his son's devotion to Gabe. He calls him a console peasant. He slaps him and sends him to sleep. He's crying now and his face hurts. He lays in bed, and it's really cold. He feels a warmth moving towards him. He looks up. It's Gabe! He's so happy, Gabe whispers into Revan's ear, "Try your chances... Open a case." Gaben grabs Revan with his powerful dev-team hands and puts him on his hands and knees. He's ready. Revan opens his pockets for Gabe. Gabe puts his hands deep into Revan's pockets. It costs so much, but Revan does it for CS:GO. Revan can feel his wallet emptying as his eyes start to water. He accepts the terms and conditions. Revan wants to please Gabe. Gaben lets out a mighty roar as he fills Revan's computer with keys. Revan opens all the cases and gets nothing worth anything at all.

review: Do I recommend this game? Yes, in the most ironic way possible. Counter Strike is not your traditional First Person Shooter. But by golly, is it one of the best. What I love about this game is the fact that running around and spraying doesn't work AT ALL. Sorry Call of Duty. If you do that, you won't even get a single hit on your target, just a shot to the head and not a second thought. This game revolves around coordinated team work, and if you don't have that, you are NOT going to win a single match. Being good at shooting will only get you so far. This game is best played with a group of friends to form your own 5 man team because sitting on Skype or any other third party voice communication program with 5 people you know is a lot easier than holding a key to talk to people you don't know. But, the beauty of this game is that most of the time you have to learn to stratagize with people you have never talked to before, and that is really cool. Everyone wants to win, so everyone works together. Of course, there are always some people who team kill, don't work with the team, or just spout "OMG HAX" everytime they die. But don't let these few people scare you away from this game. It is the most fustrating, yet sastifying FPS I have ever played. Each day I get better at it, and each day I enjoy it more and more. Only about 50 hours in... and lots more to go to be a Global Elite. In summary; CS:GO requires practice, team work, and patience. But when you start getting the hang of it, by damn is it a great time. No matter how angry it can make you, it's a whole lot of fun.

review: The game is unforgiving at first, with a steep learning curve. But after playing and watching other players you will learn what works and good tactics. Your first matches will be all deaths, but eventually you get called a hacker. 10/10

review: The recent installment of one of, if not, the greatest competitive FPS games ever created. If you know CS from past installments then you'll fit right with CSGO. If you're completely new then good news, CSGO has helped create a balanced and fun game for all skill ranges from people that are brand new and for those of us that have been playing CS competitively since long long ago. Highly recommend this game.

review: Man, where to begin. This game... Is unbelievable. I may have only played it for a short 40 hours, but my time with this game has been astonishing. The maps are incredible. The gameplay is smooth even on lower level computers. There are hundreds, no, THOUSANDS of skins for the twenty-some different weapons, so there is plenty of variety. There is also FIVE different gamemodes for picky players. There are a few cons, however. There is a steep learning curve for new players. It took me at least thirty of my forty hours to actually get half-way decent, and a single week without playing destroyed most of that skill. Keep in mind that this game has been out on the market for over FIVE YEARS. There WILL be people a LOT better than you, so don't be discouraged in the first few hours. The other problem is the skins. I know that I made a point of saying that they are a good thing, but you have to pay for them. Yes, you do earn skins in drops, but after playing this game for forty hours, I have gotten two cheap skins. TWO. Another way to get skins is buying crates. The crates are pretty cheap, usually six to twelve cents. The keys needed to open the crates, however, are usually around $2.50 for a one-use key. The only efficient way to the skins is on the Steam Market, where they are much cheaper per skin. That's just about it for my long-winded speech. If you read this all the way through, congrats and thanks. I hope it was helpful. See you in game!

review: An FPS with MMO-style drops and items. This game does a lot of things right, and a couple things wrong (casual play is slightly skewed by an overabundance of the cheesiest sniper rifle ever put in an FPS), but all in all it's fun and addictive and a great way to hang out with your friends. 400+ hours in a game that cost me $4. It's hard not to recommend a game which presents that kind of dollar to time ratio.

review: In this game you are a Terrorist or an elite Counter-Terrorist who has never fired a gun in their life before a round starts. You must help your character learn how to control their guns while killing enemies. The Goddess of Guns can materialize guns in your characters hands a few seconds before a round starts. However, your character must pay for the guns, which have vastly overinflated prices. When you have the right amount of money, the Goddess will flash a menu in your character's eyes, allowing them to select the guns they want. More advanced users can make guns materialize out of thin air with their mind as long as they have the right amount of money. Maps are often about evil terrorists trying to bomb deserted places. Vandalism is a very serious crime in the Counter-Strike series, so elite Counter-Terrorists are deployed to stop them. Unfortunately for the Terrorists, they are dumb and only packed one bomb. However, the Counter-Terrorists do not know how to pick up a dropped bomb, so the Terrorists can still pick it up after it is dropped by a fallen friend. In some maps, the Terrorists have kidnapped a janitor and low-level desk jockey in a building. The Counter-Terrorists have been deployed to save one, not both, of the hostages. In reality, this is just a thinly-veiled excuse for the Counter-Terrorists to murder the Terrorists while pumping rounds into invincible hostages. One weird thing about hostage maps is that you can purchase a "Hostage Rescue Kit", which somehow gives you the ability to put a grown man on your shoulders in a second. Perhaps it is a spell scroll that allows hostages to hover to your character's shoulders. When your character wears a kevlar vest, every part of your character, except the head, are made out of steel. Therefore, the only way to quickly kill people is to shoot them in the head. This can be annoying at first, but you will soon get used to shooting a small smudge of pixels on top of a character's body. Overall, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a surprisingly solid game about people with the worst gun handling abilities ever seen on Earth. Even though your characters have the aiming abilities of someone with Parkinson's disease, you have many tactical options that make the game very fun and dynamic. It's worth picking up and I highly recommend this game.

review: Valve Softwares has done it again! With the collaboration of Gabe Newell and his son, Justin Bieber, they have reached a new standard of PC gaming. A classic mix of sitcom blend with a hint of romance. Gabe Newell presents you one of THE best romance storytelling of all time. With reviews from IGN and PCGamer rating it 10/10, there's really no choice BUT to buy this game. If you want a nice time where boys can be boys and where life is like a box of chocolates, the Global Offensive franchise will definitely pique your interest. After 10 years of development, hopefully it will have been worth the weight. Thanks, and have fun.

review: Counter-Strike: Global Offensive created by Valve is first person shooter which needs a lot of teamwork to play and win. There have been many CS released such as Source and Condition Zero all I have but have not gotten around to play them yet at the time of this review. The only CS I have played other that GO is Source and comparing them together GO has seemed better from a grahical and easy to use stand point but that is my opinion. CS does not seem to have a campaign and is full on muiltplayer which some people might called that bad but it effects the game none. There are some gamemodes in CSGO like Arms Race, Search & Destroy and Hostage all quite gamemodes to play and really enjoyable. Other than these gamemodes there are to catorgies that the game falls under, Causal where you can just play for fun and Competitive which I find the most fun because people can't leave unless they want to have temp ban which keeps the game fun for everyone. During your time going for headshots and back stabbing afkers after every game you will have a chance like in TF2 to get a item but instead of items there are camos kinda of easy to guess since its made by valve these make the game even better having all different types of camos instead of looking at a bland gun. I rate this 9/10 because some points teamwork is a advantage and make you work with your team to win also is great fun to play. I do think 11.99 is a bit much but i defently got my money out of it even if your not a big first person shooter.

review: Counter Strike: Global Offensive is a good fps game that may be hard at first especially if it is your first fps game. There are a few reasons it is hard, I find it hard because it is difficult for me to aim with no iron or attached sights because I am used to Call of Duty. It is also difficult to learn the different spray patterns of the guns that are available for use. There are a lot of things that you can learn ingame by hours and hours of playing, I mean I have played 800+ hours and I still can't use the ak properly xD. I definitely recommend that people give this game a go, I have enjoyed my experience so far.

Love the competitive matchmaking. It also has dedicated servers with most of the mods from Source. If you like CS it is a must buy. If you are not really good at shooters it can be fun to play arms race, deathmatch and other random custom gamemodes. Can be really hard to get into though, but the game has ranks that will match you with opponents with the same skill level. If you put some time on it you will improve quickly :)

review: I mostly love this game because of the new COMPETITIVE mode. If you want to know more about it, read the first paragraph. If you want to know about every other game modes, read the whole review :). With the Competitive game mode, Counter Strike became one of the most interesting, intensive and thrilling FPS game. Competitive game mode is about to play 5v5 matches with your team where you need tactics, skills and knowledge of the game, maps and spots. There are a maximum of 30 rounds / competitive game. The team that wins 16 rounds will Win the whole match. If your team wins, members of the team climb up on a virtual ladder. Winning more and more matches may get you better ranks by the time and with ranks of course, harder enemies in the future matches. When you are playing Competitive mode, every step, move and shot matters. A fault can easily loose you a round out of the 30 or a better shot or lucky move can get a win for you and your team. Even it makes pressure on you to prove your skills, you have to stay calm to be able to do your best! Play it with friends, make a clan, and create one of the best team or just solo queue for the matches you will enjoy the game (except when you get bad team mates with zero tactics). The second new game mode is Arms Race. Still you can select what team you are in, but it isn't really matter. There are Arms Race specialized maps (unfortunately only a few) where you start with an SMG and every kill brings you a new weapon. You have to be the fastest to fight yourself through every weapon and get a kill with every one of them. The last one is a knife (golden knife in this game mode). If you manage to get the kill with the knife before anyone else you win the match. This game mode is fast-paced and excellent for some fun, and stress beating. The 3rd one is the Demolition mode. You can play the classic game on smaller maps with only one bomb site combined with the element of Arms Race what means every round you get frag makes you jump on the next weapon in the next round. Ofc there is the old game mode, called CASUAL where you play the classic maps with huge teams and there is a DM where you can select what weapon you want to play and then go and kill the enemy team members until the time goes down and the round ends. I recommend this game for every FPS player. You can play DM or Arms Race if you want some brainless shooting, Casual or Demolition for short time playing/casual play ofc, or Competitive if you have more time to play and not scared for some team work, thinking and ranking ;).

game-hours: 256.6
review: Quite a fun game, has it's ups and downs but I think it's more of a good game than a bad game. First of all, the game is very tactical and is filled with alot of different ways to play, but the most important part in the game is TEAMWORK. The game is best played when you have a couple of friends with microphones. The Competitive System in the game is quite fun. Matchmaking isn't terrible, no netcode problems, and really I have nothing bad to say except for the community. The Community of the game isn't harsh, but sometimes you may meet with some people which will be a little "y" throughout the game and may ruin your whole multiplayer experience. Overall, the game is wonderful and amazing, I personally enjoy it and recommend it to those FPS game lovers, THOUGH BE WARY that the aim in this game is nowhere like any other game, you don't have recoil but the ammount of bullet spray may get a little too much when you spray you gun rather than burst firing. Brilliant Game, Great Competition, Tactical Online Experience.

review: One of the best games i have ever played. There are some anoyying bits here and there, like how you get cooldowns after every 2 games you win if you are unranked or if your computer shuts down and you dont get back in the 3 very very very short minutes then you get a cooldown and if that happens over and over again you can get a 7 day ban. Well other than that it is a fantastic game. I have been playing it for 3 weeks and have had so much fun. Competetive is the best its not like your playing call of duty and you can just play for fun. Most of the time its serious because you are trying to not derank and you are trying to rankup. Overall 5/5

review: I recommend CS:GO to veteran players and beginners alike as the game has a balanced community, you can meet people who are complete s yet find some that are rather tolerant. The graphics are OK for a game that was pretty recent and maps created by the community are also playable. If you're aspiring for an competitive environment this is the place for you!

review: It doesn't matter how good you are any more, you will be judged solely on the market value of your inventory. You should have one of your several Karambit knives equipped at all times and inspect it in game whenever possible to ensure that anybody who is spectating you is aware that you are aware you're being watched and you are absolutely showing off that extremely pricey knife you own. Your stats are irrelevant now, most people aren't even aware that the 'Tab' key actually has a function in game. It doesn't matter if you don't know what 'eco' means. Fuck team work. You have a 'BOOM' AWP in your inventory, as long as you have $4750 cash in game you're buying an AWP. You will mock anyone who decided to give their Nova the 'Walnut' skin. Same goes for people who give their FAMAS the 'Doomkitty' skin. You will only equip 'StatTrak' weapons and the first thing you do when you acquire one is go on an idle server and get several hundred kills on AFK players in order to pad the stats so you don't look like a total n00b. Whenever a new case is released you will buy as many cases and keys as it takes in order to acquire 'an Exceedingly Rare Special Item!' Disregard the fact that you will end up spending three times as much as you otherwise would've by buying this directly from the market, it's only your parents' money after all. Besides, your birthday is next month and Christmas/Easter/[insert public holiday here] is just around the corner so you won't have to wait too long before you can blow more of their money on digital goods. You will also plaster ever single skin you own with multiple unseemly stickers with the intention of creating a unique skin for your weapon. Your 'Easy Peasy' and 'Ninjas in Pyjamas' stickers totally don't look ridiculous whatsoever. You will also name tag all of your weapons in order to add that final personal touch to the weapon you invested so much time and money in. You don't own an AK or an M4 any more, you only own weapons with names like 'xXx OG Snoop Dogg' and 'dubstep warrior'. You now have all the knowledge required to start playing CS:GO. Go forth and procure many skins of great value.

review: Revan was only 23 years old. He loved CS:GO so much. He had most of the achievements and items. He prayed to Gaben every night before bed, thanking him for the inventory he's been given. "CS:GO is love," he says, "CS:GO is life." His elder Dragon hears him and calls him a silver scrublord. He knows his elder is just jealous of his son's devotion to Gabe. He calls him a console peasant. He slaps him and sends him to sleep. He's crying now and his face hurts. He lays in bed, and it's really cold. He feels a warmth moving towards him. He looks up. It's Gabe! He's so happy, Gabe whispers into Revan's ear, "Try your chances... Open a case." Gaben grabs Revan with his powerful dev-team hands and puts him on his hands and knees. He's ready. Revan opens his pockets for Gabe. Gabe puts his hands deep into Revan's pockets. It costs so much, but Revan does it for CS:GO. Revan can feel his wallet emptying as his eyes start to water. He accepts the terms and conditions. Revan wants to please Gabe. Gaben lets out a mighty roar as he fills Revan's computer with keys. Revan opens all the cases and gets nothing worth anything at all.

review: Let's start off by saying this game is the best one in the CS series. I'd say that CS:GO is a remade version of 1.6, which suits the needs of the current generation - better graphics, stuff is fancy. There is also this gambling aspect of opening cases and betting skins. I really do not know if I like it or not. Some kids get happy over their new stuff when the other kids are crying after losing their whole skin collection in one click. Now, the game itself. There's a new "mode" called competitive. People take this rather seriously. You can play it to get higher in rank - in case you've got what it needs to get there, which means you'll get better opponents when you advance. Remember that you have to be on the same (or higher!) level as your opponents to get higher. You can also play it to realize you belong to the bottom floor. But being on the bottom floor is okay, right? You can only get better.

review: Of course CS:GO also has the classic server browser, wherein you can browse the servers, search them by tags/maps/player count/ping, regular stuff. Some of these servers also feature funmodes, which you can play when you feel like playing CS:GO but you CBA to tryhard. Most of those servers are noob-friendly. This game gets constant updates, which means tweaks to guns if some are deemed 'overpowered' or 'underpowered', new skins, new operations, new maps, and more. Be sure to have your credit card ready when these things happen, though!

review: Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) would have to be one of my favorite games on Steam or out of all Valve games! I love all the Counter-Strike games but when I played this I fell in love at first sight! Such nice gameplay the weapons are beautiful! I love collecting, I love to open up crates and cross my fingers for a good random gun! The game I was really impressed with! The teamwork and stratergy of the game is great as well!

review: The game is actually quite fun once you take some time to learn how the game works. At first, it is quite different from all fps due to the insane recoil patterns of the guns. There are only 4 guns to my knowledge that have scopes, the rest are hip-fire so you must rely on your reticle rather than sights to attain kills. Play and you will get better, however many games are luck of the draw. I find myself either being middle-of-the-road in most matches, or somewhere near the top. Of course, there's those comp games that go 16-1 and are infuritating but that is to be expected. This game is quite fun with friends, especially if you have mics to coordinate your attacks. There are a lot of wtf moments but also a lot of kick- ones. If I had a qualm, it would be that the ak is next to god when put in the right hands, but I guess that could be said for any weapon above par. Visuals are nice. Great community maps. Arms race is quite fun, similar to Call of Dooty's gun game but you descend guns rather than ascend which makes for a more even playtime. People I've encountered were mostly mixed, as there were a few douches but also a few cool people. However, if someone decides to be a  in comp it is frustrating as a bot replaces them. Solid 8/10 would recommend. Skins look cool however I wish there were more of them. Friend unboxed a knife 3rd key and I have yet to use a key for this game. :)

review: The true successor to 1.6. VALVe really went out of their way to make sure this game came out the way it did, catering both to the grizzled ancients and newbies alike. The engine feels just right when it comes down to firing your weapon and landing the shots, if not rewarding, but expect to be punished for careless mistakes as it always has been on the series in general. The skill ceiling is a high one, as expected, but the game does its best to prepare you for online play with the increased range of difficulty levels for the bots (with 'casual' being nothing short of a shot gallery rather than an actual bot match) as well as the general course; this last one I think works as more of an introduction to the series than an actual tutorial for those already familiar with the basic game mechanics. While I still remain iffy about the introduction of microtransactions to the series, I think VALVe has done it just right by limiting your purchase of skins to the marketplace (a completely optional feature of Steam in general) and, of course, their infamous "crates" first featured in Team Fortress and relabled as "Cases" for the sake of consistency with the in-game universe. As always, Counter-Strike isn't a game for everyone, but whether you're a veteran to the series or just interested in seeing what the fuzz is all about and make a first break into the games, I highly recommend CS:GO. Also, I apologize for my incessant use of run-on sentences.

review: The game is very strange to me The gameplay mechanics, the maps, the coordination, the matchmaking and the fun past times game modes.....all beautiful. But if because of the people who play it, the game takes the downfall. More and more, people hack and smurf and they are not letting the new begginer players even play the game and going 5 minutes without eating s*it. Valve of course wont be able to 100% fix this for because if they did, fair players would suffer too. So get yourself atleast a 3-man premade team b4 u start anything and pray that no-one bad i waiting for you on the other team. Just cause of the bad community its a 6/10

review: EDIT : I just reached the >50hour mark while playing "competitive" matchmaking mode with some of the ventouza squad members, this mode is very popular and i can see why. There's an actual sense of progression when you enter a higher skill group instead of just leveling up as time goes by, everyone should try matchmaking no matter their skill level and wether they are playing with their own team or like to go solo. Everyone can be a lvl 100 schitbucket while playing bugfield 3 for example, you can do it within 400hrs of playtime, 500 or even 900 if you are noob enough :p while playing matchmaking i managed to enter the "master guardian II" skill group after 12 wins ! (my mates still can't believe it lol ) The problem lies within the execution, playing on a 64tick server is more troublesome than it sounds ! especially when you ping over 70-80ms, as i said earlier, everything feels a little bit de-synced during firefights, you can shoot at places where the enemy model has been just 1200ms ago and still score a headshot at long range, CQB has its "man that's total BS !!" moments as well It still feels pretty rewarding when you get to win a match, since the whole MM thingie ( which is the meat and the potatoes of this CSS re-skin ) tries to find you opponents and teammates near your skill level so you will usually play a close "balanced" game instead of experiencing the random skill public server cluster  which is found in almost every other PC multiplayer fps. Soooo, I feel now obliged to change my review from negative to positive ( neutral-positive actually ) peace bros !!!

review: Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is tactical and first-person shooter.Each player joins either the Terrorist or Counter-Terrorist team and attempts to complete objectives or eliminate the enemy team. The game operates in short rounds that end when all players on one side are dead or a team's objective is completed. For most game modes, once a player dies, they must wait until the round ends to respawn. Players purchase weapons and equipment at the beginning of every round with money awarded based on their performance. Completing objectives or killing enemies earns the player money while negative actions, like killing a teammate or hostage, takes money away from the player. Counter Strike 1.6 die so we have now new great game with excellent maps.This is a 're-master' of the classic shooter that you've grown to love. The game remains largely unchanged at its core, as it moves and feels no different than CS 1.6/CS Source when mechanics are concerned. This is a good thing - don't fix it if it ain't broke, right? CSGO is so dedicated to Counter-Strike's aging ideals despite market and trend changes that it brute-forces its way to success. Part of what makes it such an engaging competitive game is that killing in Global Offensive requires a wholly different skill set than other shooters. Everyone is limited to what they have and can see, with little room for character modification or on-the-fly advantages. Running and gunning is a useless play style, even if you've bought a helmet and kevlar that round, to the point that someone standing still is more likely to score the kill. Walking, crouching, or standing are your best bets to reduce the inaccurate spray of machine-gun fire.I love the new look, and feel like I've been infected with a new CS bug - I think it's going to take quite a lot of time to get this one out of my system, but I love this game so play,play and play!

review: CS:GO is a great multiplayer online shooter. Even though you cant ADS that doesnt matter, also its a valve game that should be expected. I've put a lot of time into this game and i dont plan on stopping any time soon. The community only seems to grow and playing competitive is a lot of fun since you dont really ever get teammates that troll (from my experience so far). Overall its the best online shooter i have ever played since CS:S.

review: This game is one of the most amazing games ever created. You will find yourself losing hours in this game whether it be happily or with a frustrated tone. The game itself is relatively simple; you plants bombs or you try to stop others from doing so. The vast amount of guns helps keep the game interesting(don't use auto snipers in competitive...just don't). Also all guns have alternate skins for the gun so collecting those can be fun to do, but you may end up spending hundreds of dollars on keys and cases, so in my opinion just buying the skin outright is cheaper than opening tons of cases to look for one you want. Overall the game will frustrate you, and please you all in the same hour and you'll always return to it so you should get this game.

review: I think CS: GO is one of the best FPS games. You can play normal games and you can play competitive games. The competitive games are 5 vs 5 and by playing you get a rank. If you loose much your rank will decrease, and if you win much your rank will increase. You can buy weapons of the Steam Market for Steam Wallet money. You can watch streams of pros and tournaments.

review: I am not a great fan of PFS Online. CS: GO is my total exception especially because it's my money grabber that feeds my steam wallet with some euros, enough in time to buy games in special deals. Still, you will find the community in this game to be erratic. You'll find nice people in one side and complete  bags in the other, that think they're the best players in the game just for you to find out they're trolling you and cheating hard. If you don't have the stomach consider yourself warned! Play this for fun and be nice to people, if you do that the matches tend to be a wonderful experience and better according to the team's mood, believe me!

review: Cunter Stroke: Global Uhfensiv is a strategy oriented moba with mmorpgfps69danknoscop elements. Easy to get used to, and fun for the whole family. Akin to levels of greatness of games such as Silent Hill 2 and Shadow of the Colossus, Coochie Stank: GO has a plethora of interesting features, such as being called a  by children who have not yet learned how to multiply double-digit numbers, being called a  by grown men with jobs and lives (probably not), or using teamwork and strategy to achieve victory in a fast-paced competetive battle of the wits...........NOT. oris Stark: Globular Osprey has a friendly, and intellegent community that will make you feel right at home. I cant tell you how many times my life and my my mothers viginity has been put to risk by the kind and noble souls down at Cordoray Skunk: Giblet Oxtesticle. So come on down, buy a copy! Or why not two or three copies? Everyone else is doing it? So  it! Make sure to buy a  ton of keys so we can have the financial support to make ier variations of well loved maps too! 69/420 would bang.

review: CS: GO stands as a glowing reminder that quality game design is rewarded in longevity and variety. Valve has not only updated the shooter but has completely outclassed its contemporaries. This is Counter-Strike, whatever the format you choose to play it on, and there isn't a higher recommendation than that.

review: Truck driver Jack Burton (Kurt Russell) and his friend, restaurant owner Wang Chi (Dennis Dun), go to the airport to pick up Wang's fiancee Miao Yin (Suzee Pai), who is arriving from China. A Chinese street gang, the Lords of Death, kidnaps Miao Yin, intending to sell her as a sex slave. In Jack's big-rig truck, he and Wang track the Lords of Death to the back alleys of Chinatown, where they find a funeral procession that quickly erupts into a street fight between the Chang Sing and Wing Kong, two ancient Chinese societies. When "The Three Storms" (Thunder, Rain, and Lightning) appear, slaughtering the Chang Sing, Jack tries to escape but runs over Lo Pan (James Hong), a powerful and legendary sorcerer, as well as the leader of the Wing Kong. Horrified, Jack exits his truck, only to be blinded by Lo Pan, who is merely annoyed. Wang hurriedly guides Jack through the alleys, escaping the carnage and mayhem, but Jack's truck is stolen. Wang takes Jack to his restaurant, where they meet up with lawyer Gracie Law (Kim Cattrall), Wang's friend Eddie Lee (Donald Li), and magician Egg Shen (Victor Wong), a local authority on Lo Pan. They try to explain to an incredulous Jack some of the ancient knowledge and sorcery the Chinese brought with them to America, eventually devising a plan to infiltrate a brothel, where they think Miao Yin is being held. However, the Storms make off with Miao Yin, bringing her to a front owned by Lo Pan. Trying to rescue her, Jack and Wang are quickly subdued by Rain and taken to see Lo Pan, now in the form of a crippled, old man. Wang tells Jack that Lo Pan needs a special green-eyed girl to break an ancient curse, and he intends to sacrifice Miao Yin. When Jack and Wang's friends attempt to save them, they are also captured, and Lo Pan notes that Gracie has green eyes, too. Lo Pan decides to sacrifice Gracie, while making Miao Yin his unwilling wife. After getting the drop on Thunder, Jack and Wang escape, also freeing many women kept in holding cells. Wang and Jack go to see Egg Shen, and, with the help of the Chang Sing, they enter an underground cavern and reach Lo Pan's headquarters. Egg pours each of the group a potent potion that Jack says makes him feel "kind of invincible." During the wedding ceremony, a huge fight ensues, which Jack misses, due to accidentally knocking himself out. Wang kills Rain in a sword duel, while Jack and Gracie try to catch Lo Pan. Wang joins them, and, just when all seems lost, Jack kills Lo Pan, with a skillful knife throw. Thunder, enraged and dishonored at his failure to protect his master, starts to inflate to an enormous size, exploding and killing himself. Jack, Wang, Gracie, and Miao Yin are cornered by Lightning in a corridor, which he makes collapse. Egg rescues them with a rope and kills Lightning, when he tries to follow. After finding Jack's truck, they escape back to Wang's restaurant. Lo Pan having been defeated, the group celebrates in a warm and family-like way: Wang and Miao are obviously about to marry; Margo, Gracie's journalist friend, seems to be about to pair-up with Eddie; and Egg decides to go on a prolonged vacation, saying China is in the heart. Jack, instead of starting up a new life with Gracie, (as everyone was expecting up to that point), begs farewell to the group and hits the open road, with an unknown-to-him stowaway  one of the remaining monsters from Lo Pan's labyrinth.

review: Ever played one of those free-to-play shooters with cash shops? Behold, now you can pay $15 for another cash shop shooter! Now, don't get me wrong; the cash shop in this game does not give players an advantage over each other (thankfully). What cheeses me is the fact that we have to pay additional money if we want to enjoy other aspects of our game. I paid $15 for the game and now I need to pay extra for locked content? That's like selling someone a 12 pack of condoms for 15 bucks only to tell the user that they can only use 4 of them. They would have to pay extra for the rest of the condoms. It makes no logical sense - this business practise is plaguing the industry and I can't believe the developers bought into it. It's very disappointing. Now, about the game. It's nothing special, really. You've got your typical Counter-Strike with better graphics. The interface is also improved which is a plus. Gameplay hasn't changed much which is understandable but it's really nothing special. It's pretty much like every free-to-play shooter on the market nowadays. You're better off playing a game like Cross Fire or Ghost Recon Phantoms because it is very similar to those two. No singleplayer, just multiplayer with your default maps. You need to pay if you want more maps. Honestly, it's not worth your money. I'm not saying this out of spite, this is sheer honesty here. I thought I would get more bang for my buck but I was mistaken. 5/10 for me. This game is average.

review: CS:GO Is an Amazing FPS game! You can trade, buy & reward skins. Play with friends and climb yourself to a rank! There are a lot of tips, guides and videos over this game, so it wont be hard to get into this game with no-experience. I recommend that you play a few bot games or until you understand and can perform the basic mechanics such as movement & aiming etc. And you can use those games and take time to customize your own graphic & gameplay settings to your own personal chose. (You can change the difficulty of the bots however, I recommend if you have a few hours played, that you can quite fast move on, to play some games with real people. Because bots will do mostly the opposite of humans.) There are a few game modes at the moment: Classic Casual and Competitive: Is the mostmost played mode. In these modes are both bomb missions as hostage missions a possibility. The intention is to eliminate your opponents, to plant the bomb (as terrorists) or defuse (If Counter-Terrorist). Arms Race: In this mode, the main goal is to eliminate your opponents. If you kill someone, you will be rewarded with the next weapon. The person who kills all players with all weapons is the winner! Demolition: If you kill someone from the other team in this mode, you will be rewarded with a weapon from a predefined set of weapons. Deathmatch: Deathmatch is one of the easiest modes. The idea is that you eliminate the other team. If you kill someone, you get points based on the type of weapon you are using. Who at the end of the 10 minute long round the most points wins. My Metascore: 9.6 / 10.0

review: To the uninitiated: Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is hitting an upward stride in the modern military competitive shooter world for good reason. Partially due to its strengths, but also Id argue (not here), due to the state of the game industry. Theres little reason to be a PC gamer and shooter fan and be clueless to this juggernaut. If you have even a bit of try-hard in you and a bit of skill, Id highly advocate absorbing CS:GO like a sponge and saying goodbye to any other shooter you previously thought was relevant. I could go on and on about the honed balance structure; from the economy, to the maps, to the weapons; all asymmetrically tilted to empower skill and enable strategy. But I wont. Take my word for it, its as close to perfect as Ive seen a game get. Dont get me wrong, I can nitpick some things; a few minor fringe gun complaints, 64 tick servers instead of 128 tick, but their patch performance at least shows overall that theyre on the right track. The chief of these points being restructuring maps to play better competitively (something I cant remember seeing in any other competitive fps, ever, maybe in the UT Quake days idk). BUT! Theres a good chance you already knew of this legend. Youve heard the fanboyish cries of devotion and likely thought to yourself Why the hell would someone pay $150 for a gun skin?! The game is that good when you get into the competitive aspect. HOWEVER! I must say for a casual player, especially one who has little to no interest learning competitive, theres not much here for you. There are casual modes, but theyre hard to enjoy knowing more light and care-free shooters are out there to play instead. The casual side of CS:GO is functional and passable, but itll feel like owning a Ferrari and only driving it in first gear, youre really not getting the potential out of the product. But who am I to judge? Perhaps youll get into the gun skin craze too and play the casual modes and have a blast! I doubt it, but hell the game is cheap and goes on practically-free sales every time we turn around, so why the hell are you reading this? Just buy the thing! All the cool kids are doing it!

review: One of the best games i have ever played. There are some anoyying bits here and there, like how you get cooldowns after every 2 games you win if you are unranked or if your computer shuts down and you dont get back in the 3 very very very short minutes then you get a cooldown and if that happens over and over again you can get a 7 day ban. Well other than that it is a fantastic game. I have been playing it for 3 weeks and have had so much fun. Competetive is the best its not like your playing call of duty and you can just play for fun. Most of the time its serious because you are trying to not derank and you are trying to rankup. Overall 5/5

review: The recent installment of one of, if not, the greatest competitive FPS games ever created. If you know CS from past installments then you'll fit right with CSGO.

Highly recommend this game.

review: Man, where to begin. This game... Is unbelievable. I may have only played it for a short 40 hours, but my time with this game has been astonishing. The maps are incredible. The gameplay is smooth even on lower level computers. There are hundreds, no, THOUSANDS of skins for the twenty-some different weapons, so there is plenty of variety. There is also FIVE different gamemodes for picky players. There are a few cons, however. There is a steep learning curve for new players. It took me at least thirty of my forty hours to actually get half-way decent, and a single week without playing destroyed most of that skill. Keep in mind that this game has been out on the market for over FIVE YEARS. There WILL be people a LOT better than you, so don't be discouraged in the first few hours. The other problem is the skins. I know that I made a point of saying that they are a good thing, but you have to pay for them. Yes, you do earn skins in drops, but after playing this game for forty hours, I have gotten two cheap skins. TWO. Another way to get skins is buying crates. The crates are pretty cheap, usually six to twelve cents. The keys needed to open the crates, however, are usually around $2.50 for a one-use key. The only efficient way to the skins is on the Steam Market, where they are much cheaper per skin. That's just about it for my long-winded speech. If you read this all the way through, congrats and thanks. I hope it was helpful. See you in game!

review: I finally decided to write a proper review for CS:GO. So... I bought this game within a week of playing my first few games of Counter Strike: Source. I was not disappointed. [h] Will you run it? [/h] Chances are you'll be able to run it... It isn't exactly the most intensive game so you'll probably be able to run it smooth at a constant 60fps with anything built less than five years ago. [h] Community [/h] The community is nice enough and often help you in the form of them raging at you through the mic. Okay... So, the community... Isn't the nicest. Before people rage at me... Not all of the community is so bad, just the minority that can be... Pardon my language... D********... Some people complain about the russians, some of them can be quite annoying... Thank god for the 'block communication' feature but not all scream ' blyat' down the mic. [h] Graphics [/h] If you're looking for a super aesthetically pleasing-Planetside 2 ultra looking game then CS isn't for you... The graphics aren't bad but it's not going to win any prizes either. What I will say is that it's a large jump from Source... Where this game truly shines is in its gameplay. [h] Gameplay [/h] The game is largely skill based, and from what I've played so far, requires a large amount of dedication to learn maps and how to use each of the weapons. If you're coming from COD-like shooters as I did you're going to need to be prepared to spend hours of practice in casual in order to learn spray patterns, smoke spots and other subtle hints which can make a massive difference in competitive play. As I said earlier, the community does help sometimes, most often in competitive however. [h] Sounds [/h] The weapon sounds aren't accurate in the slightest but do however sound pleasing and distinctive which can help in competitive play. Sneaky beaky like... The first time I heard that I lolled<--Nuff said... [h] Overall [/h] A word of warning... This game isn't fun... It's repetitive, boring, really fustrating but  f****** addictive... If you're looking for a game that's fun I'd suggest COD but it doesn't have the same... 'feel' as CS and not near enough rewarding when you get a kill. Overall I'd give it a solid 9/10 just down to the fact that some of the community isn't the nicest at the best of times...

review: Counter-Strike has always held a special place in my heart, so it may be hard to speak without bias. That being said, if you are looking for a competative First person shooter, this is your game. It is no call of duty where blood distorts your view, its no battlefield with explosions all around you, it is a highly refined competative first person shooter, the phrase "easy to learn, hard to master" could not apply anymore to this game, the controls are simple, the maps are easy to learn, but the tacticts, teamwork, recoil compensation, and economy are something that may take you years to master. The game has a huge competative scene with multiple tournaments with prize rewards in the hundreds of thousands every year. The difficulty of the game, and the rewarding feel of getting an AK-47 headshot are something that never go away, Highly recommend 10/10.

The gunplay is remarkably fun and veterans to the franchise will no doubt tell you of the strategy and competitive nature of the game. Semi-easy to learn, difficult to master, and tons of fun to play.

game-hours: 341.7
review: If you like CSS, I would reccomend getting CSGO. The game is a much fancier, nicer, and smoother version of CSS. The matchmaking in my opinion, is fairly well balanced. The only problems with the matchmaking is purely that people go into groups, with much higher stat guys which can sometimes make the game seem unfair. The UI is simpler, and nicer then CSS. My favorite aspect of the game, while sometimes looked down upon is the inventory system. Yes it has been called "TF2" for having skins, but they are purely cosmetic, and not only that they look absolutely amazing. I talk all the time about how I want that amazing skin, or how I actualyl preffer a gun just because of its skin! Their isn't a billion different guns (Where as hats ya know...) and most of them are obtainable without even spending a dime! StatTrack being my favorite, makes the game a lot more fun, will I get a new skin? Will i be able to sell the skin and save for a cheap game? Secondly I enjoy the simplicity of competitive. I never quite understood how to do comp in CSS, and always played DM or another type of gamemode, CSGO makes it easy! Select competitive! Or, want a different gamemode? Just select it and wait! While waiting doesn't sound the greatest, it is very nice, get a snack, talk, plan, etc. Gives time to think through, and get friends! I rate this game an 8/10 and would deffinetaly get it!

review: This game is truly a masterpiece; it provides hours of fun weather you are playing alone or with friends. It has a competitve stage for people who really just want to play to win and there are tons of community servers with different mods and gamemodes. The game also has skins, which change the appearence of you weapons in game. You can get these skins by random chance at the end of each game or open up boxes for a chance at different skins for a fee; these skins can then be sold on the steam market for real money or traded for other skins. While this game is amazing it also has it's cons; there is a notable amount of hackers in the game, even though valve is trying it's best to keep them out of the game they are still there. But that is the main con, of course the game has some glitches here and there but the hackers are really the main issue. Even with it's cons this game is really amazing. 9/10

review: This is a great team game. If you have four friends, and you want something to do to pass 30-60 minutes, then go play competitive mode, which will put you with people of similar skill level using a ranking system. It has better graphics(which i doubt anyone really cares about but it's nice,) it has new weapons from CS:S, It keep bunnyhopping, (but it's much more difficult) and it's an all around great team game. I definitely recommend it as it has stolen 800 hours from my life as of writing this. EDIT: At 1,200 hours taken away from me, it's amazing ;w; EDIT 2: my friend killled the last guy, he found an awp, i tk'd him because i wanted it, the whole time he was screaming NONONONONO and i picked it up and he yelled WHYYYYYYY and i said "i wanted it" and then he asked for it back and i walked to my site to watch and he tked me and got banned, i swapped to the bot to find the awp, my other friend went to go get it, i killed him and got banned rip 1.5k hours

review: One of the best first person shooters I've played, Counter Strike: Global Offensive is worth buying now! I would say it's not really a game for the 'Call of Duty' fans as it is not a boring grind in which you run around a map killing people with no tactics required. CS:GO goes (no pun intended) much further as unless you are playing Deathmatch or Arms Race, there is no instant respawn. Therefore your life is important and not something you'll get back in 3 seconds. Even if you're not the best tactical thinker it's a good game as you've always got your fellow team to help you (If they don't swear at everyone in the game). The economy is also quite good with drops being spaced out and are all marketable. Even the crates are worth something! (Looking at you TF2). Overall I reccomend to anyone who likes First Person Shooters (even if you are a COD fan as there's always deathmatch mode) and if you already have the game I reccomend Operations as they are also worth it with new maps from the community that are very enjoyable. 10/10 P.S. If there's any spelling mistakes complain to Valve not me as there is no spellcheck and I often make mistakes while typing.

review: To the uninitiated: Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is hitting an upward stride in the modern military competitive shooter world for good reason. Partially due to its strengths, but also Id argue (not here), due to the state of the game industry. Theres little reason to be a PC gamer and shooter fan and be clueless to this juggernaut. If you have even a bit of try-hard in you and a bit of skill, Id highly advocate absorbing CS:GO like a sponge and saying goodbye to any other shooter you previously thought was relevant. I could go on and on about the honed balance structure; from the economy, to the maps, to the weapons; all asymmetrically tilted to empower skill and enable strategy. But I wont. Take my word for it, its as close to perfect as Ive seen a game get. Dont get me wrong, I can nitpick some things; a few minor fringe gun complaints, 64 tick servers instead of 128 tick, but their patch performance at least shows overall that theyre on the right track. The chief of these points being restructuring maps to play better competitively (something I cant remember seeing in any other competitive fps, ever, maybe in the UT Quake days idk). BUT! Theres a good chance you already knew of this legend. Youve heard the fanboyish cries of devotion and likely thought to yourself Why the hell would someone pay $150 for a gun skin?! The game is that good when you get into the competitive aspect. HOWEVER! I must say for a casual player, especially one who has little to no interest learning competitive, theres not much here for you. There are casual modes, but theyre hard to enjoy knowing more light and care-free shooters are out there to play instead. The casual side of CS:GO is functional and passable, but itll feel like owning a Ferrari and only driving it in first gear, youre really not getting the potential out of the product. But who am I to judge? Perhaps youll get into the gun skin craze too and play the casual modes and have a blast! I doubt it, but hell the game is cheap and goes on practically-free sales every time we turn around, so why the hell are you reading this? Just buy the thing! All the cool kids are doing it!

review: Death is a great teacher. Failure in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is, as it always has been for this series, the greatest way to learn where you should have gone, what you shouldn't have done, and how you could have done better. Counter-Strike players spend a lot of time learning -- consequently, they are always getting better. Growth is an important factor in Global Offensive, especially if you're coming into Counter-Strike fresh or after a sabbatical. This is an extremely hardcore, skill-based first-person shooter, and it forces you to think differently than other modern shooters. If youre a Call of Duty player, youre going to need to change your play style to succeed here. Counter-Strike also tries developing into something new here as well, despite doing little to push itself beyond what its always done best. Global Offensive modifies old maps to keep veterans on their toes, and introduces official new modes that encourage different play styles for the first time in almost 15 years. For the uninitiated, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a small-scale, team-based first-person shooter with permanent death. When a counter-terrorist kills a terrorist planting explosives in a classic Defusal match, or a CT escort swallows a sniper round in Hostage Rescue, the victim is dead for good and doesn't respawn until the next round. As such, players on both sides must exercise skill and care. The bomb objective, meanwhile, gives everyone a purpose. Of course matches end when everyone on a team is dead, but a clever and coordinated terrorist team will give the CTs the slip, plant their bomb, and protect the bomb site. Between rounds, everyone spends earned cash on better gear and guns, and the cycle continues. Pieces of the Counter-Strike formula are dated at this point, but the superb heart and soul of Global Offensive is timeless. Teams are small, guns are lethal, and rounds are short. There's an addictive just-one-more-round quality to it, because there's a constant desire to do better than last time, to earn a satisfying kill, or to win in a new way. Call of Duty and Battlefield vets will wonder why they can't sprint to escape enemy fire or look down the iron sights to improve aim; Counter-Strike players will feel like they walked into their redecorated home. Certain map redesigns will catch hardcore fans off guard, but the changes are for the best -- the underpass choke point in de_dust, for instance, has a new escape route. Even in the face of genre evolution, Global Offensive doesnt care to adapt. CSGO is so dedicated to Counter-Strike's aging ideals despite market and trend changes that it brute-forces its way to success. Part of what makes it such an engaging competitive game is that killing in Global Offensive requires a wholly different skill set than other shooters. Everyone is limited to what they have and can see, with little room for character modification or on-the-fly advantages. Running and gunning is a useless play style, even if you've bought a helmet and kevlar that round, to the point that someone standing still is more likely to score the kill. Walking, crouching, or standing are your best bets to reduce the inaccurate spray of machine-gun fire. Consequently, killing in Global Offensive feels good. There's a sickening sensation to dropping someone dead because you know they're not coming back. It's also satisfying knowing you used limited resources to play smarter than your victim. If players aren't watching corners, providing covering fire, or using smoke grenades and flashbangs, they're more likely to take a headshot from a more delicate and patient triggerman. The desire to experience that distinct feeling is a strong motivator to keep playing, even when you're getting steamrolled by an obviously better team. If you've played Counter-Strike before, Global Offensive probably sounds a whole lot like Counter-Strike. Like Counter-Strike: Source before it, Global Offensive exists simply to modernize the look of the classic competitive shooter, while doing little to disrupt the core form and function. At the same time, it does enough to color outside the lines of tradition to justify your time and effort. There's a sickening sensation to dropping someone dead because you know they're not coming back. Fire is one of the most interesting new combat variables. Molotov cocktails and incendiary grenades either roast groups of guys or force them in another direction. Flames are a useful distraction or scare tactic, too. They're particularly useful during Demolition matches, which focus the fight at a single bomb site rather than giving terrorists two to pick between. The new and modified maps in this mode aren't as big as classic Counter-Strike arenas  entire sections have been cut off to direct teams toward a central location  but their thoughtful design is as intricate as ever. The Lake map is a standout -- there's a wide open yet densely populated yard around the bomb site, which is inside a sizable lakeside home with plenty of vantage points and hiding spots. To separate Demolition from Defusal, players can't buy between rounds. Instead, it takes a cue from the other new mode, Arms Race, in which each kill unlocks another weapon instantly. The better you do, the more you have to switch up the way you play, and because Demolition is so fast you'll need to be quick on your feet. Unlike other game types, Arms Race allows for respawns. It's the most chaotic and care-free mode in Global Offensive, with players throwing caution to the wind for the sake of climbing the kill ladder as quickly as possible. It's a shame there are only two maps in Arms Race -- a problem that will more likely persist on consoles than PC. If you have the option, playing the PC version is unquestionably the best way to experience Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. Mods, mouse and keyboard, and the usual PC-only options are better than the ports. Plus, Valve is much better about long-term PC support -- it abandoned Team Fortress 2 on consoles, and Portal 2's level editor was PC exclusive. If you prefer to play on consoles, Global Offensive is the same great game, with the following special bits: PlayStation 3 For those who want to play on PlayStation 3 but dont want to deal with the imprecision of analog sticks, Counter-Strike: GO supports mouse and keyboard, giving it a pretty noticeable edge over the Xbox 360 version. If youre feeling saucy, Move is another option, although nuance dies with the motion controller. Move is accurate, and your quick reflexes will score kills, but the unavoidable instability of holding a remote will give your cursor some seriously unpleasant wobble. Worse, moving the wand quickly can confuse the controller, which often and irritatingly misinterprets basic left/right looks as a want to turn around 180 degrees. Xbox 360 Aside from the lack of keyboard/mouse input, the Xbox 360 version of Global Offensive is functionally identical to that on PS3 -- the new radial user-interface on both platforms is as elegant as it is on PC. Because its a hardcore competitive game, Counter-Strike blocks party chat in an effort to combat cheating, forcing players with headsets to play with friends or brave the Wild West of obscenity that is Xbox Live. THE VERDICT Global Offensive is definitely a Counter-Strike sequel -- it looks and feels familiar, with minor tweaks here and there to help balance old issues and surprise longtime players. This is a demanding, skill-based multiplayer game that's as satisfying now as it ever was, but it's for a specific kind of player. If you're not willing to learn to play different than you're used to, look elsewhere. Otherwise, this is a top-tier tactics game that will probably share the long-tailed legacy of its predecessors.

review: This game is truly a masterpiece; it provides hours of fun weather you are playing alone or with friends. It has a competitve stage for people who really just want to play to win and there are tons of community servers with different mods and gamemodes. The game also has skins, which change the appearence of you weapons in game. You can get these skins by random chance at the end of each game or open up boxes for a chance at different skins for a fee; these skins can then be sold on the steam market for real money or traded for other skins. While this game is amazing it also has it's cons; there is a notable amount of hackers in the game, even though valve is trying it's best to keep them out of the game they are still there. But that is the main con, of course the game has some glitches here and there but the hackers are really the main issue. Even with it's cons this game is really amazing. 9/10

review: This is a great team game. If you have four friends, and you want something to do to pass 30-60 minutes, then go play competitive mode, which will put you with people of similar skill level using a ranking system. It has better graphics(which i doubt anyone really cares about but it's nice,) it has new weapons from CS:S, It keep bunnyhopping, (but it's much more difficult) and it's an all around great team game. I definitely recommend it as it has stolen 800 hours from my life as of writing this. EDIT: At 1,200 hours taken away from me, it's amazing ;w; EDIT 2: my friend killled the last guy, he found an awp, i tk'd him because i wanted it, the whole time he was screaming NONONONONO and i picked it up and he yelled WHYYYYYYY and i said "i wanted it" and then he asked for it back and i walked to my site to watch and he tked me and got banned, i swapped to the bot to find the awp, my other friend went to go get it, i killed him and got banned rip 1.5k hours

review: It doesn't matter how good you are any more, you will be judged solely on the market value of your inventory. You should have one of your several Karambit knives equipped at all times and inspect it in game whenever possible to ensure that anybody who is spectating you is aware that you are aware you're being watched and you are absolutely showing off that extremely pricey knife you own. Your stats are irrelevant now, most people aren't even aware that the 'Tab' key actually has a function in game. It doesn't matter if you don't know what 'eco' means. Fuck team work. You have a 'BOOM' AWP in your inventory, as long as you have $4750 cash in game you're buying an AWP. You will mock anyone who decided to give their Nova the 'Walnut' skin. Same goes for people who give their FAMAS the 'Doomkitty' skin. You will only equip 'StatTrak' weapons and the first thing you do when you acquire one is go on an idle server and get several hundred kills on AFK players in order to pad the stats so you don't look like a total n00b. Whenever a new case is released you will buy as many cases and keys as it takes in order to acquire 'an Exceedingly Rare Special Item!' Disregard the fact that you will end up spending three times as much as you otherwise would've by buying this directly from the market, it's only your parents' money after all. Besides, your birthday is next month and Christmas/Easter/[insert public holiday here] is just around the corner so you won't have to wait too long before you can blow more of their money on digital goods. You will also plaster ever single skin you own with multiple unseemly stickers with the intention of creating a unique skin for your weapon. Your 'Easy Peasy' and 'Ninjas in Pyjamas' stickers totally don't look ridiculous whatsoever. You will also name tag all of your weapons in order to add that final personal touch to the weapon you invested so much time and money in. You don't own an AK or an M4 any more, you only own weapons with names like 'xXx OG Snoop Dogg' and 'dubstep warrior'. You now have all the knowledge required to start playing CS:GO. Go forth and procure many skins of great value.

review: Revan was only 23 years old. He loved CS:GO so much. He had most of the achievements and items. He prayed to Gaben every night before bed, thanking him for the inventory he's been given. "CS:GO is love," he says, "CS:GO is life." His elder Dragon hears him and calls him a silver scrublord. He knows his elder is just jealous of his son's devotion to Gabe. He calls him a console peasant. He slaps him and sends him to sleep. He's crying now and his face hurts. He lays in bed, and it's really cold. He feels a warmth moving towards him. He looks up. It's Gabe! He's so happy, Gabe whispers into Revan's ear, "Try your chances... Open a case." Gaben grabs Revan with his powerful dev-team hands and puts him on his hands and knees. He's ready. Revan opens his pockets for Gabe. Gabe puts his hands deep into Revan's pockets. It costs so much, but Revan does it for CS:GO. Revan can feel his wallet emptying as his eyes start to water. He accepts the terms and conditions. Revan wants to please Gabe. Gaben lets out a mighty roar as he fills Revan's computer with keys. Revan opens all the cases and gets nothing worth anything at all.

review: Counter-Strike has always held a special place in my heart, so it may be hard to speak without bias. That being said, if you are looking for a competative First person shooter, this is your game. It is no call of duty where blood distorts your view, its no battlefield with explosions all around you, it is a highly refined competative first person shooter, the phrase "easy to learn, hard to master" could not apply anymore to this game, the controls are simple, the maps are easy to learn, but the tacticts, teamwork, recoil compensation, and economy are something that may take you years to master. The game has a huge competative scene with multiple tournaments with prize rewards in the hundreds of thousands every year. The difficulty of the game, and the rewarding feel of getting an AK-47 headshot are something that never go away, Highly recommend 10/10.

It has become an excellent modern replacement to CSS. There are servers for all players, from noob to elite, and they're populated all day and night. Graphics options are top shelf and well optimized. Great job making CSGO what it should be Valve.

Full of Russians who wont communicate with you and only yell  suka idi nahhui etc. You cant get out of Silver once you get in there.There are lots of guys who are smurfs,specially when the sale is on.There are lots of guys who have only 16hrs of cs or even 10hrs - Most guys dont have sound/dont know how to sound,always going to wrong plant when bomb is planted,dont understand anything about this game and wonders how enemy is knifing him from behind,calling everyone who kills them hackers and then attacking teammates because they want to get kicked. I find this game fun until you have great team who are trying to win the game not give up on after losing first round. 1 annyoing thing is that when you go duo rank with someone you will always get guys who are unranked or dont understand anything about this game in your team and enemy team has 4 premade (even with clantag) or just very good players. IMO(In My Opinion) Counter Strike should make something like this- If you have under 50hrs total of csgo you cant go competitive mode If you have under 20hrs of actually playing in game vs real enemys you cant go to competitive mode I love this game but I hate the matchmaking system,Im still going to recommend this game because you can actually sometimes laugh how your teammates who are very bad are playing.

A game where if you do headshot someone you're a lucker. A game where you get killed through smoke you're an idiot. A game where if you kill someone through smoke you're a waller.

review: It doesn't matter how good you are any more, you will be judged solely on the market value of your inventory. You should have one of your several Karambit knives equipped at all times and inspect it in game whenever possible to ensure that anybody who is spectating you is aware that you are aware you're being watched and you are absolutely showing off that extremely pricey knife you own. Your stats are irrelevant now, most people aren't even aware that the 'Tab' key actually has a function in game. It doesn't matter if you don't know what 'eco' means. Fuck team work. You have a 'BOOM' AWP in your inventory, as long as you have $4750 cash in game you're buying an AWP. You will mock anyone who decided to give their Nova the 'Walnut' skin. Same goes for people who give their FAMAS the 'Doomkitty' skin. You will only equip 'StatTrak' weapons and the first thing you do when you acquire one is go on an idle server and get several hundred kills on AFK players in order to pad the stats so you don't look like a total n00b. Whenever a new case is released you will buy as many cases and keys as it takes in order to acquire 'an Exceedingly Rare Special Item!' Disregard the fact that you will end up spending three times as much as you otherwise would've by buying this directly from the market, it's only your parents' money after all. Besides, your birthday is next month and Christmas/Easter/[insert public holiday here] is just around the corner so you won't have to wait too long before you can blow more of their money on digital goods. You will also plaster ever single skin you own with multiple unseemly stickers with the intention of creating a unique skin for your weapon. Your 'Easy Peasy' and 'Ninjas in Pyjamas' stickers totally don't look ridiculous whatsoever. You will also name tag all of your weapons in order to add that final personal touch to the weapon you invested so much time and money in. You don't own an AK or an M4 any more, you only own weapons with names like 'xXx OG Snoop Dogg' and 'dubstep warrior'. You now have all the knowledge required to start playing CS:GO. Go forth and procure many skins of great value.

review: Revan was only 23 years old. He loved CS:GO so much. He had most of the achievements and items. He prayed to Gaben every night before bed, thanking him for the inventory he's been given. "CS:GO is love," he says, "CS:GO is life." His elder Dragon hears him and calls him a silver scrublord. He knows his elder is just jealous of his son's devotion to Gabe. He calls him a console peasant. He slaps him and sends him to sleep. He's crying now and his face hurts. He lays in bed, and it's really cold. He feels a warmth moving towards him. He looks up. It's Gabe! He's so happy, Gabe whispers into Revan's ear, "Try your chances... Open a case." Gaben grabs Revan with his powerful dev-team hands and puts him on his hands and knees. He's ready. Revan opens his pockets for Gabe. Gabe puts his hands deep into Revan's pockets. It costs so much, but Revan does it for CS:GO. Revan can feel his wallet emptying as his eyes start to water. He accepts the terms and conditions. Revan wants to please Gabe. Gaben lets out a mighty roar as he fills Revan's computer with keys. Revan opens all the cases and gets nothing worth anything at all.

review: This game is the next level of shooters, When i first started playing this game i had no idea what type of fun i was getting into. The game provides team communication which is the most important feature in this. If you're bad at shooters, this game helps you get better. It will teach you how to aim, when to shoot, and how to be a team player. Without this game i would be a really bad sniper, and team leader. This is a MUST have game.
game-hours: 289.1
review: One of the best first person shooters I've played, Counter Strike: Global Offensive is worth buying now! I would say it's not really a game for the 'Call of Duty' fans as it is not a boring grind in which you run around a map killing people with no tactics required. CS:GO goes (no pun intended) much further as unless you are playing Deathmatch or Arms Race, there is no instant respawn. Therefore your life is important and not something you'll get back in 3 seconds. Even if you're not the best tactical thinker it's a good game as you've always got your fellow team to help you (If they don't swear at everyone in the game). The economy is also quite good with drops being spaced out and are all marketable. Even the crates are worth something! (Looking at you TF2). Overall I reccomend to anyone who likes First Person Shooters (even if you are a COD fan as there's always deathmatch mode) and if you already have the game I reccomend Operations as they are also worth it with new maps from the community that are very enjoyable. 10/10 P.S. If there's any spelling mistakes complain to Valve not me as there is no spellcheck and I often make mistakes while typing.

review: I bought this game in hopes to slay my one and only true enemy, chickens. Little did i know i was in for more than that. After spending 600 hours of learning Russian and killing chickens, one day a man came to me, he said " Bingo Bango Bongo Bish Bash Bosh " which obviously means "come join the ct" in russian. So i did. That was a mistake. We got dropped off by chopper to a German nuclear plant and we all rushed in with one of our members screaming "SILVERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR". We went in with a PP-Bizon SMG and mine was painted with a Urban Hazard spray. It looked very Scarred. I watched everyone in my team get shot in the face as they walked in and i was alone. At that very moment, Lord Gaben came to me and said "I may give you power, but it will cost you" so I gave him all my steam credit and he granted godly powers to my PP-Bizon. I turned the corner and killed all the terrorist with funny hats in one clip. I defused the bomb and won. But at what cost. Little did I know that my powers also were a curse. I now wonder the Casual and spray with my Bizon to this day. In hopes that one day I will leave the silver rank. Want to know the curse? I cant. Never. Wont rank up past silver. You have been warned, this game will consume you, your life will be devoured by constant case opening and killing. The sad part? You will enjoy it, you sick f***

review: WHY YOU NEED TO BUY THIS GAME! PLEASE READ AND RATE! 1. CS:GO Is alot more simple than other FPS' such as call of duty or battlefield, CS:GO is very basic and easy to learn all the steps on becoming a very advanced player. Other games like Call of Duty offer things like attachments, Killstreaks, Prestiges, Levels, and Advanced player options which can be good for some players, but it takes quite a while to get use to all the controls and how everything works. But in Counter Strike You get the game and start playing right away not having to learn all the controls. 2. You can make money. Counter Strike and other games by valve such as TF2 and Dota 2 Offer an in game market place. In the market you can Buy and Sell Tools, Guns, Stickers, Crates, Keys and Many more things. The market allows you to convert in game items into real money which will be put onto your steam wallet as soon as some one purchases your item, Now games like Call of Duty don't allow you to make money, all you can do is play the game. 3. The game offers free Downloadable Content. CS:GO Gives everyplayer the latest update/DLC for free, Games like Battlefield, Call of Duty, And Borderlands 2 Make you buy the game which is very expensive and on top of that the DLC charges you about 15 Dollars and Up! 4. The Game is cheap. Counter strike is only $14.99 On steam and it goes on sale very frequently, Most FPS Games cost anywhere from 30-60 dollars such as the new call of duty games which all cost $60 on release. So obviously you will be saving alot of money. 5. The game is over all very fun. Now i can't argue this point because Call of Duty and other FPS games are also very great games but CS:GO is worth the money. So i suggest you go ahead and start playing, you will LOVE it!

Not stickers, UI and HUD changes or skins. And stop messing around with the weapons.

review: Frosty was only 16 years old. He loved CS:GO so much. He had most of the achievements and items. He prayed to Gaben every night before bed, thanking him for the inventory he's been given. "CS:GO is love," he says, "CS:GO is life,". His dad hears him and and call him a silver scrublord. He knows his dad is just jealous of his devotion to Gabe. He calls him a console peasant. He slaps him and sends him to sleep. He's crying now and his face hurts. He lays in bed, and it's really cold. He feels a warmth moving towards him. He looks up. It's Gaben! He is so happy. Gabe whispers into Frosty's ear, "Try your chances... Open a case,". Gaben grabs Frosty with his powerful dev-team hands and puts him on his hands and knees. He's ready. Frosty opens his pockets for Gabe. Gabe puts his hands deep into Frosty's pockets. It costs so much, but Frosty does it for CS:GO. Frosty can feel his wallet emptying as his eyes begin to water. He accepts the terms and conditions. Frosty wants to please Gabe. Gaben lets out a mighty roar as he fills Frosty's computer with keys. Frosty opens all the cases and gets nothing but blues. CS:GO is love, CS:GO is life.

review: Great game for the casual or the competetive FPS player. Coming from games like OC, Quake, and Uberstrike, this game really forces you to improve your reflex time as well as your accuracy. I wasn't much for the modern games until I tried this one out, I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a great FPS. Here's a little "Pro/Con". Pros: Extremely fun and addicting gameplay Balenced gameplay Good graphics with exellent map designs Engaging gameplay Great community and team aspect Skill cap is extremely high Playable on even low grade computers (mine's 1.5 Ghz) Cons: Costs real money, if you're a usual F2P gamer then this might detract you from it Learning curve is extremely steep, you'll need to invest time into this game (not really a con but for some people they just want a "fun" game to run around on. If that's the case, this game is not for you No major FOV changes, (I realize there are a few things you can do to change it, but for a Quake player like myself, it was rough to get used to after playing with 115 FOV for a while) Requires a mic (To be completely honest, if you want to get good at this game and engage in teamplay, you WILL need a mic , otherwise you'll be hardpressed to type out strats and the status' of your enemies) Hackers. Just like most games out there you will run into these . They are easy to report but be warned, they do exist. If you get my gist, the cons are really just minor things. Nothing really is so annoying that I would consider stopping playing this game. 9/10 Spiegel

review: First the Good review: - It's CS 10/10 - The weapons sistem is nothing like the others cs, you can gain the skin weapons by playing or opening boxes or buying them on the market, and that's very cool. Now the bad review, and this one makes me so angry: - The competitive: 1 - The team, if can find those noob teams that kill their own partners or just be AFK the whole game! 2 - The Competitve Cooldown, now this one it's just annoying and overwhelming stupid, because you get kicked by leaving the game and that's fine but imagine that your net goes down or our PC was turn off because of some lightning, you will get that same kick and you can't to nothing about it and that's makes me so angry because you get 7 days of penalty because you net was down and that's not fair. Hope that this will help someone!

review: Only have 50Hours+ But so far this is the best FPS out there. It beats CoD and Battlefield just the community on there brings rewards from its self. I would really recommend this to my friends and to everyone if they are into FPS. Plus I've been a Counterstike kid since 2005 now its 2014 and the love is still here for the CS community. Keep the game the way its suppost to be :) : >5Stars< EDIT: Its been over 400 hours now and still satified

review: CS:GO is the best competitive FPS game I have ever played. I believe it's difficult enough to be a challenging game for gamers. Plus, It's a really nice and enjoyable game. It has improved graphics from the other CS games and you can find it for only 10,99! There are two bad things about this game, one is that the competitive matchmaking can sometimes ruin your game (join you with noobs), the second one is that a lot of people get addicted with the weapon skins (Valve items) and can spend a lot of money in cases and keys. To sum up, I recommend this game to everyone who's looking for a good FPS to play. My Rating is: 9.5/10.

review: this is the best game i have ever played. its my favirote game its so skill based and not just a stupid grind like cod and other shooters the aiming is skill base and matches require tactics and team play to win once 1 has mastered the game he can take down a team of 5 all on himself. this game has hundreds of hours of play time that will not make you bored one bit (unless you lose all the time)

But CS:GO is a very well made competitive game. But if you are me, you would prefer CSS over this game. But both are spectacular games. Thank you once again, Valve :)

review: Love this game, besides from all the campers, this is really fun, join a casual competetive, and you just start rampaging, this game has amazing graphics, beautiful soundtrack, and amazing weapon sounds, although some things are worse then in cs:s (wich was the ground for competetive fps gamers) it still is amazing. Play with friends, go online, do what you want! Steam market, yus, made me happy. Buy whatever you want, getawesome cool skins for your guns, and be famous. 9/10, some bugs remain, some netcode bugs aswell (run around corner, but still die D:) But, still amazing!

review: This game is definitely an improvement on the previous games. Now its super easy to find a competitive match. I found it very hard on css and cs 1.6. Also you dont even have to be in a group of 5 to find one.Another thing which was annoying about the previous ones if that people can lie about their skill group which left the match unbalanced. CSGO has a ranking system which will put you against people with a similar rank, and its a good thing to strive towards reaching that next rank. Put that together with the custom gun skins they have brought into it, it turns into a fun and very replayable game. 9/10

review: It's not 1.3-1.6, but then 1.6 is dead. Games without a flouishing population become stale and boring quickly. Same can be said about Day of Defeat 1.3. The prior 2 games are what I consider truly the best FPS' to ever hit the market. But CS:GO captures something from the days of yore, and is by far the best modern FPS on the market. The skill index is high, there's a lot to learn, Match Making serves as a nice bridge between casual pubbing to competitive play. It's not a perfect system, but acts as a nice gateway to private PUG systems like ESEA, altPUG, Leetway, and FaceIT (some more popular than others, depending on region); which act as a gateway to Open league play, so on and so forth. If you're into competitive MP FPS get this game.

review: If you like destroying the world or saving it from Terrorists, this is your kind of game. A FPS cooperative shooter aimed around teamwork above all else, this game is a must have. You can play either as a Counter-Terrorist or Terrorist. Your aim is to stop the other 5 players from achieving their goal in competitive mode. Other modes such as, Demolition and Arms Race are really fun as well. Competitive mode is where it's at though. You can group up with your friends or you can brave it solo trying to rank up to Global Elite. No matter what your playstyle is, enjoy the game for it's unique way of gameplay. This game is a must have if you love PC FPS.

review: tl;dr : Counter-strike : Global Offensive will ruin your life. So you like RPG games sometimes? Maybe a good ol beat em up? Well shut your mouth cause once you get into competitive CS:GO youll never play another game AGAIN. Youll make friends that the second you get online invite you to play go, why? Cause theyre also addicted. Its been only 10 months of me playing and Ive bought it twice and have over 1k hours combined between my two accounts. Seriously dont play this game. (Obnoxious acting aside) CS:GO is the best way of showing how valve still can manage games (cause they really made someone else make this game.) in a great way! CS:GO is a game where people will hate, love and worship you all depending on how well you do in game. It takes skill devotion and a lot of anger *sheds tear*. Valve added a microtransaction system that all in all is great as it doesnt effect anything in game, theyre just skins. Thanks to places like r/globaloffensive cs:go news is fast and quickly fixed youll read about people complaining about the CZ so Valve nerfed it and now people want it buffed again! The community is okay for a FPS but the professional side has never been emphasized so much before! you get incentives for watching tournaments and betting on who will win. causing you to research and begin to love teams (Cloud9 :)). Remeber the above statement? It isnt wrong, CS:GO ruined my outlook on other games for the better I now look for more team based games instead of run and gun CoDs released every other year. This review is getting to the point where I should score the game though 10/10 Would ruin life again.

review: This game has the best Chicken AI of gaming history. 10/10 would knife those chickens again. CSGO is a near-perfect multiplayer shooter. Unlike the previous versions, which were often difficult to get in to, this one offers a variety of modes that will appeal to all skill levels. It has a large community and a well supported workshop, ensuring that this discount-priced game will be around for years to come. In short, you either play as the good or bad guys and must either kill the other team or complete objectives to win the round, which will earn you more money to do the same thing again but faster. It's been around for years and has spawned many imitators. The game isn't much of a looker as it is based on the same engine as the original Half Life 2 was. However, Valve have polished it as much as they can and the community consists of lots of awesome mappers who have been churning out brilliantly imaginative and beautiful maps almost on a daily basis. Is it worth getting if you already own Counter Strike: Source? Yes. CSS was always Counter Strike shoe-horned into the Source engine. CSGO feels far more like a standalone game. Valve have very carefully listened to what people have wanted and have made a very appealing game. The best feature must be the competitive play, where you play 10 games that you cannot leave (unless you want to tarnish your reputation), after which you'll be ranked and will be paired up with people of the same skill, meaning that the game is challenging but fair no matter what skill level you are. There are all kinds of teams and communities that you can join. Really, if I was stuck on a desert island with one game this would most likely be my top choice. It's bigger than you can hope to conquer and has a huge community around it which will likely be around for years to come, something that can't be said for the Call of Duty franchise which is probably its closest rival. Remember that those games are full price and have another one churned out each year, fragmenting the community. Plus you can customise your weapon skins in CSGO. Surely that's the most important feature?! All they need to add now are hats and you might as well live in CSGO. This game has the best Chicken AI of gaming history. 10/10 would knife those chickens again.

review: This is my favourite game in the Cooking Mama series. Unlike the previous games, this one goes through various platforms. Strangely the PC version is the only version that's updated, I mean the SNES is a pretty big competitor to the PC. THE GAME ITSELF: "Counter-Strike: Terrorism X" is an addictive RPG game where the player must complete puzzles with his/her teammates, I personally think "Counter-Strike: A Letter to his Son About His Father" done it better, most of the community seems to agree. This creates a very competitive situation, but luckily the community knows it's all a game and is made for fun. The weapons I usually use are Energy Sword and Rail Gun. THE COMMUNITY: On the topic of community, it is by far the nicest I've ever played with, they know people make mistakes and don't have the ability to fight 5 over players by themselves. There is a kick button that's never used for the player's personal use so they may not face the penalities of deranking, as that's ridicolous and it's only a game. THE GRAPHICS: Made with Frostbite, the graphics are stunning. THE VERDICT: 4.5/5 Shrek: Forever After is good at what it does. My actual review? This game is full of people with their heads screwed so far up their asses. The community is toxic enough to make the planet extinct. It's good.

review: It doesn't matter how good you are any more, you will be judged solely on the market value of your inventory. You should have one of your several Karambit knives equipped at all times and inspect it in game whenever possible to ensure that anybody who is spectating you is aware that you are aware you're being watched and you are absolutely showing off that extremely pricey knife you own. Your stats are irrelevant now, most people aren't even aware that the 'Tab' key actually has a function in game. It doesn't matter if you don't know what 'eco' means. Fuck team work. You have a 'BOOM' AWP in your inventory, as long as you have $4750 cash in game you're buying an AWP. You will mock anyone who decided to give their Nova the 'Walnut' skin. Same goes for people who give their FAMAS the 'Doomkitty' skin. You will only equip 'StatTrak' weapons and the first thing you do when you acquire one is go on an idle server and get several hundred kills on AFK players in order to pad the stats so you don't look like a total n00b. Whenever a new case is released you will buy as many cases and keys as it takes in order to acquire 'an Exceedingly Rare Special Item!' Disregard the fact that you will end up spending three times as much as you otherwise would've by buying this directly from the market, it's only your parents' money after all. Besides, your birthday is next month and Christmas/Easter/[insert public holiday here] is just around the corner so you won't have to wait too long before you can blow more of their money on digital goods. You will also plaster ever single skin you own with multiple unseemly stickers with the intention of creating a unique skin for your weapon. Your 'Easy Peasy' and 'Ninjas in Pyjamas' stickers totally don't look ridiculous whatsoever. You will also name tag all of your weapons in order to add that final personal touch to the weapon you invested so much time and money in. You don't own an AK or an M4 any more, you only own weapons with names like 'xXx OG Snoop Dogg' and 'dubstep warrior'. You now have all the knowledge required to start playing CS:GO. Go forth and procure many skins of great value.

review: Revan was only 23 years old. He loved CS:GO so much. He had most of the achievements and items. He prayed to Gaben every night before bed, thanking him for the inventory he's been given. "CS:GO is love," he says, "CS:GO is life." His elder Dragon hears him and calls him a silver scrublord. He knows his elder is just jealous of his son's devotion to Gabe. He calls him a console peasant. He slaps him and sends him to sleep. He's crying now and his face hurts. He lays in bed, and it's really cold. He feels a warmth moving towards him. He looks up. It's Gabe! He's so happy, Gabe whispers into Revan's ear, "Try your chances... Open a case." Gaben grabs Revan with his powerful dev-team hands and puts him on his hands and knees. He's ready. Revan opens his pockets for Gabe. Gabe puts his hands deep into Revan's pockets. It costs so much, but Revan does it for CS:GO. Revan can feel his wallet emptying as his eyes start to water. He accepts the terms and conditions. Revan wants to please Gabe. Gaben lets out a mighty roar as he fills Revan's computer with keys. Revan opens all the cases and gets nothing worth anything at all.

review: I think it is a terrible game. It stole all of it's gamemodes from Call of Duty. CS:GO competitive is just extended search and destroy and Valve didn't even bother to rename Demolition, they must be pretty lazy. The aim sucks because the bullets don't go straight to the center but spray all over. Even with that small difference it is still blatant copy of Call of Dewty. What kind of a game steals everything from Call of Duty and doesn't implement some of the best features, like the Intervention sniper rifle. As a Silver 1 I would just like to show everyone how I quickscope in Call of Dewty. I mean, what engine is this game on? Is it that dated engine quake ran on; Just look at how good fall of duty looks each year since they revamp the engine from scratch every year. Basically, you want to play Call of Booty. CS:GO is for people who are casuals, COD is for hardcore gamres and takes sooooo much more skill. If you don't belieev me message me on steam and we can 1v1 on MW2 Rust, Quickscopes only.

review: Really good game one of best fps games out there for pc so quit cod and battle field and come to Counter Strike Global offensive.
game-hours: 813.9
review: A full upgrade over its predecessor Counter-Strike: Source, Global Offensive manages to revive its playerbase that was lost from the previous game and (as always) introduces new players to the franchise. If I were to briefly describe it, I'd say it's a "Modern Day Classic". There are 4 modes: The main 2 are Casual and Competitive, while the other 2 are Arms Race (Gun game) and Demolition (like Gun game but a kill awards only 1 weapon to be used in the next round). There is also a Deathmatch mode, basicaly TDM, that is usually used for practising different weapons. With the Arms Deal update, which introduced camos and some weapons to the game, there are drops at the end of matches and it slightly feels like TF2, but not to that extent. The Matchmaking system is kind of "meh", although it is much better than some other games I've played. In Competitive, there is a 50-50 chance for you to join a balanced game without your team being on a losing streak (that is if you go solo....it's quite a gamble...) There are also some minor hitreg issues that are barely noticable but still important enough to determine the outcome of the round...aaaaaand it's very freaking annoying too (64 tick.... -_-) If you intend to take this game seriously, you can join a competitive team (5 people) and spend time practising recoils patterns and the like. Who knows! You might end up entering a tournament! As far as game content is concerned, new guns and camos are constantly being added to the game. Plus, Valve introduces Operations (Last one was Operation Phoenix and current one is Operation Breakout) that include a handful of new maps from the workshop. After about 2-3 months ( I may be wrong) the Operation ends and there is a vote about which maps people enjoyed the most. 2 of the most voted maps are added to the main game while some others pass on to the next Operation. The only thing I dislike about this, is the fact that a ticket is required and will set you back 6$ if you are willing buy it at the start. The price drops over time so I suggest entering when it is about a dollar or so. Overall, with the price of 11 (~15$) it's much more than you pay for and with more than 550 hours currently in the game, I can safely say I'm very satisfied. Great game 9.5/10.

review: It's a great first person shooter. you can get very competitive or you can just play casual if you want to relax alittle bit. The competitive part of the game is balanced a lot, you're not going to play against alot of high skilled players if you are low rank and the other way around. Valve really thought this game through or atleast more than counter-strike: source. the weapons damage, recoil, cost and magazine size seems to be balanced enough, but some weapons are better than other, if you master them. The overwatch part is great, finally the community can decied if players are hacking or not, or they have more to say about, in the end Valve decieds i guess. when you start playing the game you really forget how long you have played. there is also skilled map makers and skins makers for the game and sometimes Valve release an update with maps and new skins. they call in an "Operation." and there is much more to love about this game, Sticker, Skins, Maps, Community and all kind of other things

review: CS:GO is the latest game in the famous Counter-Strike series and contains a mix of many of the original features from Counter-Strike 1.6 as well as some features from Counter-Strike: Source, all with newer graphics and a couple of new weapons, all balanced close to near perfection. One of the later patches also added collective skins for the weapons, which, while not too far from the system in Team Fortress 2, doesn't impact gameplay and is purely cosmetical. There has also been added an Workshop for maps (so you can easily get custom maps) and skins (so you can submit your own). I can easily recommend this game and guarantee it will bring you many hours of good fun, provided you liked 1.6 or Source.

review: Counter strike global offensive is the newest Counter Strike game out there, CS:GO uses the same engine Portal 2 ran on (which is a source engine but modified a bit) Anyways CS:GO is a Counter terrorism / terrorism game where you can play as counter terrorists or terrorists, there are currently 4 official game modes ranging from competitive, casual and so and so. Did I mention competitive? If so CS:GO has a big competitive group (like every other counter strike game) the game also has community made maps and gun skins, so if you're good at skinning or map making you could possibly try out and put your skin / map on the workshop for this game, at the end of the day, Counter Strike Global Offensive is a must buy when on sale, and even when it's off sale, you should save up some money or just buy it.

review: Quite simply, this feels like a reskin of CS:S. Sure some backend stuff may have changed but to me as a player, it feels the same. This leaves the game in an awkward sort of limbo between old and new with fancy graphics that, if anything, make the outdated gameplay stand out more than ever. If you really love CS, but for some reason cannot play CS:S without improved graphics, get this. If you are new to the series, don't buy it or you will just end up feeling lost, hurt and confused :/
