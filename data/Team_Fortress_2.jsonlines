I wrote something for real! These hours are legit, I played this game a lot in the past to avoid some tragic stuff in real life. I was young and didn't really have my gaming consoles anymore because of my brothers and I had a really bad pc, which i still own. TF2 was one of the games i could play pretty well on this pc but with horrid graphics, but it was one of the more fun games I installed. I met some real cool and nice people on this game as well as people who i plan to keep by my side. The community back then was more humble compared to nowadays. You have competitive gamers who spam their bind keys with unfunny/gross jokes and very obnoxious people who are either yelling at you or telling you to do specific things to win the game. When really, it doesn't even matter if you win or lose. However, you also have those people who are really awesome and you may meet some nice friends along the way! Although you never know what kinda person you're going to meet on this game. In my honest opinion, if you want to have a game to just waste time on (and money) or just mess around with people you know (which is what I do now), this is perfect. Esspecially the mann vs. machine co-op. I mainly play that now. Although to me, the game lost its touch, update wise, and I moved onto other games. I believe it's worth a shot to try it out but other than that, I'd keep it as a casual game. I don't think the competitive scene is worth getting into anymore because it's being flooded by crude people. Atleast from my experiance after over about 4+ years of playing it just got worse and worse. You will eventually be tied into drama even if you try to avoid it. You'll be more stressed than actually having fun, I'll tell you that! Although in all seriousness, this game is losing its touch and probably isn't worth making it your main game MAINLY because the updates they've been releasing are becoming very dull and not as great as they used to be. BUT, it's a great game to just play to pass the time and have fun! All you'll really notice nowdays is...people really love to trade more than actually play. Living off as a free to play would be very tough and you'd need to be patient with items you would want, unless you got that MONEY! Hope this helps. One last thing, I am not saying this game is bad in any way. I am saying that it's worth trying and playing with friends, or even meeting people! Although there are some downsides that you won't like, such as some stuff I pointed out above. Strictly towards the community. I personally think you should have this game as a side game rather than your come home to play sorta thing. Have it as a once in a while game, because it's nothing to be big about, unless you really do not like most of the millions of other games out there. Just give it a shot and see what you think!

Being ranked as the third most-played game [steamcharts.com] on Steam, Team Fortress 2 is probably one of the best free-to-play games we've got. Why is it so popular? Let's take a look, shall we? First off, the obvious: It's free. 100% free. This means its accessible to everyone on Steam. This is just the icing on the cake though. What really shines about TF2 is the game itself. Team Fortress 2 usually consists of two teams (Red and Blue) going head to head against each other. Sometimes fulfilling certain objectives or just downright killing each other. There are many, many maps and modes, such as Payload, Capture Points, and Mann VS Machine. But the general idea no matter the map or mode is to KILL EVERYTHING THAT MOVES! And my god, is it fun to do so. The game has 9 playable mercenaries, each actually being a certain \"class\". Each class is divided into 3 different roles: Offense, Defense, and Support. Let's go over each role and class. Offensive roles specialize in dealing damage to the opposing team. These are your main attack force. Scouts are the speedy hit and run class, with the ability to double or even triple jump depending on equipped items. Soldiers pack a bit more firepower with their rocket launchers, which gives them not only power, but mobility due to the ability known as \"rocket jumping\". The Pyro is great at setting the opposition on fire, as well as extinguishing burning teammates using an airblast. Defensive roles serve to inhibit enemy access and to hold enemies back from vital points on the map. Overall, the defensive group has the most firepower of all the groups. Demomen can safeguard areas with stickybombs that they can detonate when enemies come by. Heavies are great for mowing down incoming troops and pushing back forces. Heavies can also keep enemies in an area while whittling their health for teammates to finish off. Engineers can build Sentry Guns for effective area defense, as well as build Teleporters and Dispensers for logistical support of the team. Support classes cannot hold the fight on their own, but their specialized abilities can tip the balance in their team's favor. They offer the offensive and defensive classes an extra edge in battle and can help turn the tide of the game. Whether crippling the enemy advance from behind or keeping teammates healed, the support classes are always handy to have around. Medics are the team healers, capable of providing numerous buffs depending on their equipments. Spies are great for sneak attacks or eiliminating key threats. Snipers excel at long range, also eliminating key threats, as well as extinguishing burning teammates with jarate and providing a damage boost to teammates. Next, let's look at the presentation. TF2 has a very unqiue art style. It's somewhat cartoonish, but very appealing. It's simple, and un-complex. But it doesn't need to be complex. It's simplicity is it's strength. Everything is detailed enough to where you can easily tell whats going on, what a specific model or item is, and they all stand out. The soundtrack is also very appealing and catchy, especially the main theme. I personally have it as a ringtone/alarm tone on my smartphone! :) One of the best aspects of TF2 is the Steam Workshop. Users can submit designs for items and weapons, and possibly have them added to the game! A very lucrative sub-market has also emerged from this game in the form of the Crate Keys. That's a whole different ballgame in and of itself, so we won't get into it here. During normal gameplay on most servers, you can obtain random items, weapons, and sometimes crates, and taunts....through the item drops system. You can only receive so many drops per week, and you will get them randomly as you play. You can use these items and weapons to customise your mercenary's loadout, or you can use them to craft other items, hats, and weapons. You can take multiples of items and craft them into Scrap, then Reclaimed Metal, then Refined Metal. You can then use these metals to craft specific class weapons/items, among other things. The crafting system is simple yet robust, with lots of possiblities. Some of it is very luck based. You can take some very common items and end up crafting a super rare hat or gun worth a lot of moolah on the Steam Market! All-in-all, Team Fortress 2 is just a very fun game. Endless entertainment awaits when you start up this game, especially if you play with friends on your favorite server. Probably the best free-to-play game on Steam. http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=383235670 Highly Recommended Be sure to check out Nerd House Gaming for more reviews!", "num_found_helpful": 0, "num_guides": 0, "num_screenshots": 0, "num_badges": null, "profile_url": "http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse", "found_helpful_percentage": 0, "total_game_hours_last_two_weeks": 0.2, "review_url": "http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/recommended/440/", "num_games_owned": 0, "achievement_progress": {"num_achievements_attained": null, "num_achievements_percentage": null, "num_achievements_possible": null}, "num_found_unhelpful": 0, "username": "Nerd House", "total_game_hours": 256.4, "rating": "Recommended", "num_reviews": 0, "date_posted": "Oct 23, 2014, 8:20PM", "steam_id_number": "nerdhouse", "num_found_funny": 0, "num_comments": 30}

I actually find it a LOT more fun now! I think Jerma summed up this game pretty nicely... \"Maybe you got like two Pyros that just installed the game ten minutes ago. They don't have any hats, they're spraying  and they're having a blast. They might even be at the wrong point. They might be going backwards to the point that's already been capped. On the same team, there's a Scout with a Hale's Own Scattergun. He's got 18 kills with a 17 killstreak, he just got 18. He's going 'I just got 18, sick!' He runs up the stairs, he's trying his  off. He's get *beeping noises* dodging the 'Oh, the sentry almost got me!' He looks up to his left when he gets up the stairs on Gorge and there's two sandwich Heavies having a ing picnic. So he stops for a second and goes, 'Two... nnnggh!' so he walks forward and gets blown up by a soldier's rocket next door... ...The two sandwich Heavies then decide to move their picnic. There's ants. 'There's ants here, honey. I wanna get out of here.' So they get up, they pack their sandwiches, pack up their lunches, and their breakfast, and whatever the  they're eating. They get up and walk toward the door to go to RED because they think, 'That spot near the A point for RED is pretty good.' They walk out the door, and they see four Level 3 Sentry Guns pointing at them. They get shot a million times and blow up, and there's like nine Engineers swinging their wrenches in random directions. The BLU Scout, at this point, respawns, and walks by the at least 3-4 statues because we all know there's four people AFK when you play this game, you go by the museum of people standing still. He walks out the door and readies his weapon, he's ready, 'I'm going to get another 20 killstreak, just you watch Gaben, I'm going to praise Gaben!' And he goes forward and starts shooting, and he gets backstabbed by a Spy that has been sitting with the Cloak and Dagger in the corner for at least the last 68 seconds.\" Normally when I do reviews, I turn into a critic and start to examine that game, pointing out every little flaw and pro and determining a final score. However, Team Fortress 2 (or TF2 for short) helped me make so many memories that if I actually tried to make a fair review on it, it would still be way too biased to consider a valid review. Team Fortress 2, is, obviously, an amazing game. The teamplay is necessary and going out and attacking solo may be difficult. You need teammates in order to survive and win. The graphics are unique to a shooter game and really makes it a special game. I'm not here to explain the gameplay or graphics or whatnot. I love this game because of its charm. The game has such a unique and diverse cast of characters, you can't help to love all of them at some point. Scout is cocky and overconfident. Spy, another one of the characters in the game, is technically Scout's father. Soldier is a crazed WWII American patriot. He never actually joined the Army, but instead, he had his own personal Nazi killing spree. His roommate was a magician named Merasmus, who grew to hate Soldier. Pyro is mysterious, but portrays the world as one big happy paradise, known as Pyroland. Demoman is a Scottish alcoholic who, due to Merasmus, lost his eye that is now haunted. Heavy, although he appears to be dim-witted, is actually very intelligent and looks over three sisters. Engineer is very intelligent as well, and his grandfather was a major contributor to keeping the war with RED and BLU continue. Medic isn't fond of normal forms of medicine, but is still an important member nonetheless. Sniper is from New Zealand, but was raised in Australia. He prefers working from a distance and his backstory is very similar to Superman's. Spy is the master of disguise, and is technically Scout's father, as said before. Of all the characters, he appears to be the most \"mature\" and appears to be the ringleader at many times. Not only that, but the game has an interesting story. I would not like to get too detailed with it. However, it makes little to no sense but is still funny, engaging, and gives TF2 much more depth. There is also a storyline that takes place a few years later where Mann Co. is being attacked, so the mercenaries have to defend it, called Mann vs. Machine. This game mode ties in with the TF comics, which explain many characters' backstories and is currently still in the works as of this review. The other comics (all of which can be found on TF2's official website) are all funny and charming in their own way as well. The community has been quite debatable on how nice it is at many times, but in the end, it's still an overall great community. I've seen people give out stuff, others mentor some of the newbs (something I do as well) along with much, much more. Yes. the game is considered a \"pay-to-win game\" but it isn't necessarily a pay-to-win game. With lots of patience, you will get what you want from the game, whether it be hats, weapons, or whatever it is you want. The game has a learning curve that isn't too steep, but become dedicated and you'll fall in love with it. No matter how many times you rage to a W+M1 pyro that destroyed your 16 killstreak, or cheer when you unbox an Unusual, or maybe discover a few friends or learn a few things, Team Fortress 2 has been a huge part of my PC gaming life and without it, I would be as bored as hell. I cannot recommend this game enough, and I hope that many more memories are made on here. Valve may be cash cows, but you can't help but admit they are amazing when it comes to making games. Portal, Half-Life 2, Counter-Strike, but this game stands out from the rest to me. Do I recommend this game?

There is absolutely no other simulator quite like this one. The first time you start the simulator, you join a server where you can play a minigame where you show off your hats and items. If you kill a person three times in a row in the minigame, you get your very first hat: the Gibus. This is where it really starts; To play the simulator correctly, you have to spend money in the market place, made by Valve. After that, while you play the minigame, you can find hats which you can trade for, or collect! There is many other people who wants to collect and trade hats, just like you! After you collect enough items and/or hats, try joining a trade server! There, the REAL fun begins! Good luck, and beware of ending up poor!", "num_found_helpful": 0, "num_guides": 3, "num_screenshots": 201, "num_badges": 249, "profile_url": "http://steamcommunity.com/id/Im_Special", "found_helpful_percentage": 0, "total_game_hours_last_two_weeks": 0.0, "review_url": "http://steamcommunity.com/id/Im_Special/recommended/440/", "num_games_owned": 2197, "achievement_progress": {"num_achievements_attained": 108, "num_achievements_percentage": 0.33540372670807456, "num_achievements_possible": 322}, "num_found_unhelpful": 0, "username": "Special", "total_game_hours": 777.4, "rating": "Recommended", "num_reviews": 54, "date_posted": "Aug 30, 2013, 3:00PM", "steam_id_number": "Im_Special", "num_found_funny": 0, "num_comments": 54}
