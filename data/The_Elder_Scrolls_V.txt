review: Of all the games I play.. this is the one that always has a cozy fire and a hot cup of steaming chocolate ready to welcome me back. It's the game that welcomes me with a big friendly smile and open arms. Even when I keep playing away it says, 'come on home' and gives me a nice warm hug. It must surely be the best game of all time. I don't know if I will ever finish it - but then, I don't really want to. I have it both on PS3 and here on PC. I have restarted it several times playing different characters. It has not dated at all, in no small part due to a large modding community, many HD updates and a friendly community. There must be more mods for this game than there are devious politicians. If you don't already own it you need to correct the error of your ways immediately or expect to be disciplined! You know who you are and you know you want it. Should you get the legendary edition? Look into my eyes, what do you think. Just say "Yes Miss"

And all you end up doing is becoming a horder!! Release your inner klepto and stash it in one of the many houses you own, and never use it again! Want to eat twenty 10 pound cheese wheels with no ill effects at once... THEN DO It my friends. This is the game for you! For you will get sucked into the world of wonder where you can do so much you wished in your life. Sleep standing?! Posh! WHO needs sleep!! You can run for weeks, and never tire!! You can become a Werewolf or Vampire... Once you destroy the Sun you never have to worry about the pesky burning feeling. FISHING!!!!!!!!!! ITs all in this game.

review: Bethesda is a game company that knows what the f*ck they are doing. In a time where game creators are scrambleing for the newest thing like new hit boxes, new guns, dlc's just to play the game, sh*tty dialoge, stupid plots. Bethesda comes out of the middle of butt f*uck no where and shows them all up. Its like Bethesda actually wants you to have fun in this game They want you to like the story. They want you to get involved with the world that they created. They want you to have fun, because god forebid that new games cant do that! And I am just sitting here with my mouth open in awe at what I am looking at. This game really shows what happens when game creators take time and hell even THOUGHT AND EFFORT into making there game. Ok, now that Ive kissed Bethesda a*s. Lets talk about the game. Skyrim is a game set back in....I dunno. And you start off as a prisoner who has been captured for following a cult who is agianst the system of Skyrim. You escape because a dragon is like," dont worry bro, I got you." and blows up the place right before you get almost get beheaded....I am still going to kill that dragon though. Then the rest is a journey that you decide. What I like about this game: 1.The action is amazing. Everything seems smooth and up to date even though this game came out in like 2012. 2. The story is rich and it just keeps on going and going. 3.There are plenty of missions and hours of gameplay. 4. The characthers sometimes are funny and the voice acting is fairly decent. 5. ITS ONLY 5 GB....HOLY S*IT!!!!!! F*ckin, sleeping dogs is 13 gb and they dont even have half as much of story as this does. 6. I can run it on my sh*tty computer...with the graphics down but whatever. 7. EVERYTHING! Now for the bad things: 1. It glitches from time to time but Bethesda does that with there xbox to computer games. And thats it for the bad. Just please god, if you havent played it. GET IT RIGHT NOW My Gaming Score: 10 SkyrimGasms/ 10. I still like Ride to Hell Retrubution better, though. (jking that game is )

Diffrent charactors introduce a diffrent style of gameplay which will make you want to try a diffrent style keeping the fun going. Overall a great game with few minor glitches/bugs.

review: It's a great game, I have dedicated many hours especially on Xbox i pc. It is a game which is to create your custom character i discovering landscapes in a colossal map, enemies, dungeons, in my opinion, the highlight are the missions. There are also political comflictos and battles, guilds of thieves, assassins, knights, and a big immensity of missions, I myself xbox 517 hours I could not finish. What I really like about this game is, the large number of objects that are i the freedom it gives you this role, I found no such thing in Assassins creed. The atmosphere of the streets, comversaciones on the market, this well heco. I there are beautiful landscapes, impressive i. Pity, i I consider an error of the game, is that there is online, but the story is very well cast. Another incomveniente are many physical errors, for example, sometimes a mammoth flying or is fallin from the sky. But overall it is a high quality game i being the 2011 is very well. Warning: can be very adictiovo. The fun is to play without cheats. This is my experience as a veteran i review Skyrim.

review: You will get tired of this game, and eventually forget about it for a while to play others, but you will always come back. There is always something you want to do and you can't help but play a little bit here and there. Complete quests you've done half a hundred times, just because you enjoyed them, run around in your favourite dungeons and get hungry by staring at the brightly coloured food you cooked. Then you'll shout Lydia off High Hrothgar again and quit for a while longer. But you know you'll come back. You'll always come back.

review: Rating: Tubular, Dude! This game summs up all together a game that I would most like to play. It's got the lush landscapes ranging from Snowy ice caps to heated boggs, It's got the emmense gameplay that keeps you hanging on wanting to see more, and it even has the traditional Elder scrolls lag after you've downloaded too many CBBE mods. I simply love this game, and can't wait to see what else Bethesda can crap all over us to make money. Although, I'd rather play Super Mario brothers 2.

review: This game is a unbelieveable adventure, even if you haven't played the older Elders Scrolls games it doesn't matter. There are some inside jokes, that you might not understand unless you have played the older ones (Mai'q I'm looking at you). With the addition of Steam Workshop you can mod this game very easily to increase the graphical fidelity, or add more quests, although the main quest, is already excellent and the sidequest are great. The graphics on their own are good, but not great. But remember we're looking at a 2 year old game so the graphics, aren't at 2013 level. With the addition of Dawnguard and Dragonborn you can add two whole new questlines which both you can affect like the main games quests. Pros: Quests are great. Even after completing the main quest line, you will have a lot of interesting side quests. The attention to detail is amazing. The world levels with you, after you break a certain level you will see new enemies. Cons: Voice acting isn't the strongest part of this game; the same voice actors are recycled from character to character. The graphics aren't the best, but remember, we're looking at a 2011 years game.

You can add quests, new lands, Armour, weapons, creatures, textures and even make yourself a regular joe in skyrim. 10/10

Some npcs are dumb , but others are really smart that makes the game equilibrated . Every choose can have different reactions . This is art in pixels , this is skyrim .

review: Beautilful, Unique, and Charming... Skyrim provides better experience of this RPG open-world series. Beside the main quest and radiant sidequest which can surprise you in different events. Pretty genuis scripts and storyline lead you to new places, new conflicts, and dragons as random encounter. The level system is not new, but it has improvement and design. Places are full of mysteries, activites, and NPCs, lifefull indeed. Smithing and enchanting are deep and impact to your combat as magics and shouts are balanced and provide new tactics. I could say I'm in love with this fifth series. Even some people may face with minor bugs (For me, it just minor graphic bugs now.) Inventory system is hard to track (Fix by using Skyrim UI Mod) and problem in AI direction. All I say it just common thing in this kind of game which cant interrupt you from amazing experience. Totally worthy in every dollar/baht you paid. Whatever you are fan of series or not. Try once in your owned. :)

review: One of my favorite games of all time. The modding community is great, but the game doesn't even need it. It is a very immersive game, that doesnt restrict you on what to do when to do it. If you dont want to do a quest, you can simple ignore it. You are Dovahkiin(Dragonborn), you find that out after you fight your first dragon. The story is rather short it makes up for it in the countless hours on shenanigans and lollygagging. Your character seems unrealisticly special throughout the game. What I mean by that is you become the top of every class and yet you are still just another adventurer. The game is beautiful, and just worth your time. This game was release 11-11-11 and it still is one of the best games of the decade. The game is a must buy, even if you don't like RPG's genre. I am sure you may come out of your shell and let your inter nerd come out and become all powerful! Youre going to try to sell me something. Well, I aint interested. Olda 10/10

review: Really fun game. I had it on ps3, but I couldn't get into it. The graphical quality was pretty bad, and I wasn't a fan of the controls. On PC, you can get the HD texture pack if you have a good graphics card, and turn the settings up. It looks great, and plays well. Also, there's console commands, so if you're in trouble, you can get yourself out of it. Controls in combat are a bit odd, because weapons are inverted for your mouse buttons, but i swapped them. Takes a bit of getting used to, but it's much better. You can explore and discover new places, and fight bandits in dungeons. You can create potions and armor, buy a house to store your stuff in, and take on many different quests. You can join different factions as well, even become a werewolf. Great game, would buy. If you don't have 30 bucks, wait up until it's on sale and grab legendary edition.

review: I had not played Pokemon games before--I was under the wrong impression that they were just for children and then there was a lot of media attention on Fire Red and Leaf Green--I was going on a long trip so I got Fire Red. It takes a lot of memorization skills to play Pokemon games WELL so adults can enjoy these games, in my opinion. For those who haven't played before, Pokemon are actually VERY intricate and there are different TYPES of Pokemon so you have to remember their abilities and what types can easily beat other types and you switch Pokemon in battle depending on their strengths and abilities. Of course the graphics on this game are very, very good. What I liked best was the ability to get ingame help and for some reason it just really tickles me to see the little hand pick up my Pokemon and move them to or from the storage boxes. I also like the fact that when I turn the game on it rehashes the last few things I did before stopping gameplay last time. This is really good for me because I don't get to play everyday and if too much time goes by, I do forget my last "moves". I also have Pokemon Crystal for GBC and, I think it is a little easier...so if you'd like to try Pokemon, maybe that is a better game to learn first...Both have been very fun and entertaining for this adult gamer. Gotta catch 'em all...

review: Everyone knows this is the best game ever made and if you think otherwise then you are wrong. This is an open world action RPG, It is my favourite game by far and only the next sequel can ever top it. You start off as a prisoner who's about to be beheaded, from there you create your character from a variety of different races (human or beast) There is endless customization with what you can create and how realistic you character will look if you use mods, you don't have to because without this will still be your favourite game experience ever, but i don't see why not because it's simple to download mods from the nexus with just a few clicks and if you don't want to do that then you can easily browse the workshop from your library and install mods with a click of a button, that's what has kept this game so fun for so long and it will never get boring or old. There's various factions throughout the game you can join and become leader of, you can even become a werewolf or a vampire, the characters are all unique and loveable and you can have followers and even get married to your favourite ones, You can craft armor and weapons, enchant them, upgrade them, you can create potions, you can have your own home in this game, you level up and gain skill points to build the type of character you want, you can make a perk legendary when it get's to 100 so you level endlessely, there's always a rewarding amount of loot in each cave or dungeon you clear, i could go on forever, even just standing in the town enjoying the view of the lake is enjoyable in this game! The possibilitys with this game because of mods are endless, there's no need in other games when this game has EVERYTHING you could think of Seriously you have to buy it, if you want a game you will never get bored of, be easy to go back to whenever you want, never 100% complete because there's to much to do, then buy Skyrim

review: An open big world waiting to be explored. Though the actual fighting mechanic doesn't really inspire, gets repetitive and simple in the end, the actual exploration is a lot of fun. A MUST for a person who digs to just go out and explore places and loot stuff. Beware, might be a time sink.

review: I was stacking books on a shelf in my house in Whiterun, one of Skyrim's major cities, when I noticed a weapon rack right beside it. I set a sacrificial dagger in one slot, an Orcish mace in the other. They were on display for nobody but me and my computer-controlled housecarl, Lydia, who sat at a table patiently waiting for me to ask her to go questing. The chest upstairs was reserved for excess weapons and armor, the bedside table for smithing ingots and ores, the one next to the Alchemy table for ingredients. I'd meticulously organized my owned virtual property not because I had to, but because tending to the minutia of domestic life is a comforting break from dealing with screaming frost trolls, dragons, a civil war, and job assignments that never seem to go as planned. It's even a sensible thing to do; a seemingly natural component of every day existence in Skyrim, one of the most fully-realized, easily enjoyable, and utterly engrossing role-playing games ever made. Part of what makes it so enjoyable has to do with how legacy Elder Scrolls clutter has been condensed and in some cases eliminated. In Skyrim, there's no more moon-hopping between hilltops with a maxed out Acrobatics skill. That's gone, so is Athletics. The Elder Scrolls V pares down the amount of skills and cuts out attributes like Endurance and Intelligence altogether. There's no time wasted on the character creation screen agonizing over which skills to assign as major. You don't assign major and minor skills at all, but instead pick one of ten races, each with a specific bonus. High Elves can once a day regenerate magicka quickly, Orcs can enter a berserk rage for more effective close-range combat. These abilities are best paired with certain character builds  the High Elf regeneration is useful for a magic user  but don't represent a rigid class choice. Major decisions don't need to be made until you're already out in the world and can try out magic, sneaking and weapon combat, emphasizing first-hand experience over instruction manual study, letting you specialize only when you're ready. It contributes to the thrilling sense of freedom associated with life in Skyrim. Do a quest, kill a dragon, snatch torchbugs from the air, munch on butterfly wings or simply wander while listening to one of the best game soundtracks in recent memory. Despite the enormity of the world and the colossal amount of content contained within, little feels random and useless. Even chewing on a butterfly wing has purpose, as it reveals one of several alchemical parameters later useful in potion making at an alchemy table. Mined ore and scraps of metal from Dwemer ruins can be smelted into ingots and fashioned into armor sets, pelts lifted from slain wildlife can be turned into leather armor sets, and random books plucked from ancient ruins can trigger hidden quest lines that lead to valuable rewards. Skyrim's land mass is absolutely stuffed with content and curiosities, making every step you take, even if it's through what seems like total wilderness, an exciting one, as something unexpected often lies just over the next ridge. Many times the unexpected takes the form of a dragon. Sometimes they're purposefully placed to guard relics, sometimes they swoop over cities and attack at seemingly random times. In the middle of a fight against a camp of bandits a dragon might strike, screaming through the sky and searing foe and friendly alike with frost or flame. Momentarily all on the battlefield unite, directing arrows and magic blasts upward to knock down the creature, creating impromptu moments of camaraderie -- a surprising change from what may have been yet another by-the-numbers bandit camp sweep. Dragons show up often, their presence announced by an ominous flap of broad wings or an otherworldly scream from high above. The scale and startling detail built into each creature's appearance and animations as it circles, stops to attack, circles again and slams to the ground makes encounters thrilling, though their predictable attack patterns lessen the excitement after a few battles. In the long run they're far less irritating than the Oblivion gate equivalent from The Elder Scrolls IV, can be completed in a few minutes, and always offer a useful reward. Killing a dragon yields a soul, which powers Skyrim's new Shout system. These are magical abilities any character can use, you don't have to specialize in spell casting to slow time, throw your voice, change the weather, call in allies, blast out ice and fire, or knock back enemies with a rolling wave of pure force. Even if you favor sword, shield and heavy armor and ignore magic entirely, you'll still be able to take full advantage of these abilities provided you find the proper words  each Shout has three  hidden on Skyrim's high snowy peaks and in the depths of forgotten dungeons, serving as another reason to continue exploring long after you've exhausted the main quest story, joined with the Thieves Guild, fought alongside the Dark Brotherhood, or thrown your support behind one of the factions vying for control of Skyrim. Not only is this land under assault by dragons, long thought to be dead, it's also ripped in two by civil war. You can choose one side or the other, but so much of the allure of Skyrim is how, even outside of the confines of quest lines, the embattled state of the world is evident, and steeped in a rich fictional legacy. Lord of the Rings this is not, but with the release of every Elder Scrolls game, the fiction becomes denser, and the cross-referencing for long-time fans all the more rewarding. Skyrim's residents are all aware of current events. They'll comment on the civil war, some sympathizing with the rebels, others thinking the establishment sold its soul. The peasants complain about the Jarls who control each settlement, the Jarls complain about the rebels or foreign policy, the overprotective College librarian complains when I drop dragon scales all over his floor; many characters feel like whole, distinct personalities instead of vacuous nothings that hand out quests like a downtown greeter hands out flyers for discount jeans. Characters stereotype based on race, they double-cross at even the slightest hint it might be profitable, and they react to your evolving stature within the world. It makes a ridiculous realm, filled with computer-controlled cat people and humanoid reptiles, demon gods and dragons, feel authentic, like a world that existed long before you showed up and will continue to exist long after you leave. 10/10 frome me lads :)

And there's hundred's of side quests to do and an ENORMOUS map, It's so hard to get bored! So if you don't have this game GET IT, you're missing out.

review: So I started my latest game of Skyrim with the aim to try every single type of combat, try smithing, enchanting, alchemy and as many quests as I could find. I was going to absorb everything this game had to offer. Then my girlfriend got involved.... She decided she liked this game full of dragons, magic, swords and being a badass who could destroy it all. I was hopeful that I had finally found a game we could both play and talk about. NOPE. Her idea of playing has become sitting on the second computer chair, browsing facebook and ordering me to kill people at random. I can no longer enter any of the cities without being molestered by several angry guards and I'm pretty sure I have lost a lot of minor quest characters. This game no longer has any meaning to me. I will play again when I have rid myself of my real world companion... So that I may return in peace to my Skyrim ones

review: I've lost way too much of my life to this game. That said, I'd absolutely suggest that everyone else should do the same. Skyrim spent quite a while in production, and it shows. The world is absolutely beautiful, and the gameplay is just awesome. If you're hesitant to spend the money, I assure you that it's worth it; there are hours upon hours of content, and I'd say that it also has a good replay value.

review: Absolutely fantastic game - if it should even be refered to as a "game". A masterpiece in terms of graphic design, beautiful landscapes and carefully tinkered dungeons are just around the corner, no matter where you are. Above everything else, this game will take up so much of your time; not because of frustrating moments, but the sheer amount of gameplay that's been put into this game. Apart from the main questline, there's hundreds of other sidequests to take part in. The imersion of natrual beauty is incredible, however little can be said about NPC realism. NPCs aren't very quote "smart", as they tend to repeat the same lines continuously and grow to be quite annoying. That's just one of the few downsides about this game however, next to the glitches and awkward combat system. All in all, very great 3D RPG, to anyone who doesn't have it: get it NOW!

review: I love this game. Its simple beauty lies in the amount of control the player has over how they play. Skyrim is a different game for each person, whether you like to play as a mage, a warrior, or a thief. With seemingly never-ending quests and objectives, you'll never grow bored of this game, because even if you can't find anything more to do, creating a new character creates an entirely new game and a new series of adventures. Trust me when I say it's really hard to get tired of this game. To top it off, the graphics are amazing, and Bethesda's new engine is gentle even to some underpowered systems. I can't recommend this game enough.

You can level up and get armor for your Lydia and let it fight other people. You can also trade your Lydia for another follower with diffferent skills. Lydia herself has no skills except almost getting killed several times a quest making her a good distraction. Adopt a lydia today and she comes with a free set of gear tand ons of room to carry around the crap you want to keep but don't want to have in your inventory.

review: I can kill gods and demons that have lived for millenia with nothing more than a spoon that I stole from an elderly couple, but I can't kill the scantily-clad woman that works at the mill with the most powerful greatsword in existence. Though I must admit, no satisfaction is equal to the feeling of achievement when you lure a Draugr Death Overlord to the edge of a cliff and subsequently yell at them; causing the Death Overlord to be catapulted to their splattery death hundreds of meters below. Or perhaps when you sneak up behind a merchant, carefully reach into their back pocket and pull out the person's skull and heart, only to then sell said organs back to the merchant because they're a merchant. 10/10 best shouting simulator in Tamriel.

review: Skyrim does a very good job of giving you a huge world to explore, unfortunately the scale might be its greatest downside as well. It feels like not enough butter spread over too much bread. There are little to no memorable characters besides dragons and there are very few genuinely interesting quests to partake in. In my 81 hours spent wandering the lands of Skyrim, no particular moment truly stands out to me. I find this to be rather disappointing after playing Oblivion... I'll never forget my skooma escapades or my quests for the Madgod, but my memories of yelling at some wrinkly old men on top of a mountain are already fading.

review: This game is a unbelieveable adventure, even if you haven't played the older Elders Scrolls games it doesn't matter. There are some inside jokes, that you might not understand unless you have played the older ones (Mai'q I'm looking at you). With the addition of Steam Workshop you can mod this game very easily to increase the graphical fidelity, or add more quests, although the main quest, is already excellent and the sidequest are great. The graphics on their own are good, but not great. But remember we're looking at a 2 year old game so the graphics, aren't at 2013 level. With the addition of Dawnguard and Dragonborn you can add two whole new questlines which both you can affect like the main games quests. Pros: Quests are great. Even after completing the main quest line, you will have a lot of interesting side quests. The attention to detail is amazing. The world levels with you, after you break a certain level you will see new enemies. Cons: Voice acting isn't the strongest part of this game; the same voice actors are recycled from character to character. The graphics aren't the best, but remember, we're looking at a 2011 years game.

review: I first played this game on xbox 360 and completed the entire game and DLC. I then purchased it on my computer and have had an absolutely wonderful experience on my second play through. I have over 200 hours of game time into modding alone and still havent finished the main quest. The modding community has put the game into the beyond ps4 era if you have the hardware. I have nothing but good remarks and can honestly say this may be my favorite game of all time (Zelda is a close second). If your on the fence with this one, delve into Skyrim because you can make this game better than anything that will come out in the next five years if you have the patience and determination.

review: Surely a game this massive in scale requires a review of similar proportion. Where do I begin? The graphics? The gameplay? The lore? I'll start at the beginning. First off, this game is nothing like Roller Coaster Tycoon. In fact, Skyrim and RCT are about as far away from each other on the spectrum of gaming as they can be. So if you're looking for a quality theme park building/management simulator (or any theme park building/management simulator), do not look to the Elder Scrolls series. You begin your quest as a lowly prisoner in the back of a wagon. The offense is border hopping, and the punishment is death by axe (sure beats a big ol' wall, huh U.S. government?). On the way to the execution you meet fellow prisoner Roggvir, a key member in a group of rebels called the Stormcloaks, who want to take back Skyrim from the Imperial Legion (the people who are executing you) and put the Nords back in command. When you arrive at the execution...place in Helgen, a guard asks you for your name. Now say what you want about the Imperial Legion, but these people have some patience. I sat there for 45 minutes thinking of a name and rearranging my race, face, and gender to my liking, and they just waited for me to finish. Finally I decided on Jikrel, a magician/juggler inspired by my hero, Penn Jillette. Properly named and pampered, I'm ready to get my head chopped off! Just before the axe comes down, however, a conveniently timed plot device* swoops down and proceeds to burn the city to the ground. It is at this point that the player can decide whether to escape with Roggvir, the handsome rebel with a cause, or someoneelseIforgothisname, a dirty Imperial pig. While the choice doesn't make a difference at this point in the game, it presents the player with the concept of choosing sides in a convoluted, almost entirely pointless side quest involving the great Civil War of Skyrim. Racist rebels or idiotic Imperials? The choice is yours to make (or not). Once you've escaped, you're free to go anywhere in the overworld you desire, do any side quests you want, tackle the main storyline, or just goof around and break the game's A.I. I opted for the latter. Don't get me wrong, there are a lot of things to do in Skyrim, it's just that most of them aren't fun or interesting. I tried to give the main quest a go, but around the seventeenth plot device* and ninth fetch quest or so, I just got sick of it and quit. I had to replace the stock plot device* fighthing music to a pitched-down rendition of Frank Zappa's "No Not Now" just to make it that far. I'm going to be honest here: the most fun I've had playing this game I've had roleplaying a psychopathic serial rap-ist/ene-ma bandit/murderer that slits people's throats, dry humps their still warm corpses and dumps them in the nearest river/crevice/humorous location he can find. What this says about myself, I don't know. But I do know what it says about the game's quests: they're not good. In fact, I found the game's quests were obstructing my overall goal of blindly murdering everything in my path. Ever since Oblivion, Bethesda has felt the need to make certain NPC's that are essential to the game's completion unkillable. I had to download a mod so that I could kill them and thus continue having fun. Oh, and don't get me started on the mods! Nude mods, "better female" mods, "sexy armor" mods, what is this a sick joke?! How horny are you people?! But I digress. To sum it up: Skyrim is worse than Oblivion because it is better than Oblivion. Bethesda don't seem to realize that their games are inherently goofy and are perfect that way. The more they try to make it "badass" or "epic" or the more bad face textures and A.I. bugs they fix the worse it gets. I don't even think the intended audience for these games takes them seriously considering the number of great dumb mods there are out there (Battletoad Rash!) All in all, I'd buy it because it's still a pretty enjoyable experience and I'm sure everybody can find something to do in this massively dumb role-playing action-adventure game. Oh, and the graphics are pretty good I guess. 7/10 *plot device=dragon

review: Ahhh, Skyrim. Returning to the continent of Tamriel after Oblivion, Skyrim is a huge, beautiful, entertaining game that has much of what made Oblivion grand, while changing, omiting or adding to that formula to make the game even more compelling. The crafting and enchanting of items, for example, gives a personal tocuh for those who want to forge their own destiny with their own hand-made tools. The vistas and terrain is nothing short of beautiful, with sprawling ruins, vast mountains, snowy peaks, grassy highlands, wooded areas and even a volcanic/hot springs type area. The main quest is . . . much like any Bethesda Main Quest. Servicable, but not specifically stunning. However, music, visuals, small, personal little legends in dungeons, and those little stories told in the severed outstretched arm reaching for a treasure box, the dungeon specific quests, the little errands that can turn into something sprawling the entire land, books whose information can lead you on a merry chase to adventure and treasure, and last but not least the dragons and the shouts (special powers you gain over time exploring and finding Words of Power-type walls) that are unlocked and empowered by dragon's souls all push this game up to one of my favorite games I've ever played. Nothing compares to the rush of a legendary dragon attacking a settlement, and you rushing to defend it. If you can swing the expansions, you can also build your own houses, sail to a strange and almost alien island, and contend with Skyrim's vampires as well. The house building is the next logical step for anyone who sees the game itself as little more than a reason to craft their own items because they are awesome. The Island of Solstheim is both strange and engaging for me in much the same way the alien realm of the Mad God was in Oblivion. And the Vampires are fun if for no other reason than they've gotten bold enough to attack settlements, leading again to a battle between vamps, you and the city inhabitants. For the uninitiated, though, games like this on the computer run very well with mods, and this is no exception. My favorites of those (I found them on Nexus Mods, I'm not sure how many are on the Steam Workshop as well) are Run For Your Lives (citizens will hide when a dragon attacks), When Vampires Attack (the same but for when vamps attack settlements), Glowing Ore 300 (because otherwise ore is very hard to pick out), WATER (Makes water prettier), Green Water Fix (fixes a problem of not being able to see anything underwater because patches are fun) and finally all the "Unoffical" Patches (because they make the game run smoother). The TL; DR version? For the massive adventure it is, Skyrim is a must have for any adventerous soul. Just note that both mods and the expansions do nothing but enhance the experience. ;)

review: I've never invested as much time in a world as I have in Tamriel. The Elder Scroll series has set the standard for RGP's going back to the beginning but most notable with Morrowind, Obvlivion and now Skyrim. Skyrim is not just a game to be played but to be immersed in. It's an experience not to be missed.

review: One of the most enjoyable gaming experiences I have had. The base game is amazing enough, though the main quest is rather short and gets less exciting every time you start a new game. The DLC's add quite a bit of gameplay and new content, and don't forget about the tens of thousands of mods to choose from to further enhance the game. It removes many of the spells that were in Morrowind and Oblivion, but replaces them with new powers and "Shouts". There is no Acrobatics skill, so jumping height is very limited, but replaces it with a sprinting function. Many things are missing from previous title's character development, but there are mods to remedy this. After many hours of playing Skyrim, you'll learn that many of the game's wondrous encounters, NPC's, and environments (towns, cities, dungeons, etc.) start to taste a bit sour, and get repetitive and boring. But with mods in tow, you'll never have a bad experience while playing this game. Skyrim is an amazing game, but loses much of it's robust taste with every play-through, and soon becomes saccharine. But with the 30,000+ mods available to you, and the Official DLC's, this game will never get old, or lose any of it's grizzly wonderfulness that you experience the first time around. All-in-all, Skyrim (with lots of mods installed) is a must buy for any lover of this game style. Highly recommended, and worth every penny.

review: Without the lengthy paragraph, Skyrim is probably one of the best RPG's out there, the mods super-extend it's shelf life, and there are so many quests built into the game that it could taske 100's of hours to complete. The only complaint is no Co-op

review: The Elder Scrolss V: Skyrim......oh boy....This here ladies and gents, is the game you buy and play if you want to lock yourself up in a room for 267 hours worth of you life dedicated to doing all the crap in this fantasticly fantasmic world of Elves and Orcs and intelligent walking dinosaurs. Skyrim is big. REALLY...big. And that's not just accounting for the world map I'm talking about the quests, weapons, skills, MODS (very important btw. Once you use mods you can never go back to vanilla skyrim again.), and pretty much everything the game has to offer is downright amazing. But I do have a few nickpicks. Don't get me wrong though reader of my little review here, Skyrim is my favorite in the series of The Elder Scrolls, but that might be because it's the only ES I have ever played in my life O_o anyway, the game does suffer from some things here and there. The modloader is great in all, but the MAJOR problem I have with it is that it doesn't tell you what mods are conflicting or not, so you'll be playing the game and it just closes for no reason. If there's a setting that you can adjust so you can see the conflicting mods then plz send me a PM and regard my last statement as irrelevent. Skyrim also suffers from an extreme amount of what I like to call "Grey effect." What does this mean? It means Skyrim looks very bland and washed out. Nothing really stands out unless you use mods like Increased saturation boost or Increased contrast boost and other types of shader mods. Another thing I have a nick pick with is that fact that at the end of the game, the cool armor you once wore like Nightingale, Shroud armor, Thiefs guild, etc. become incredibly inferior to the dragon versions. IMHO I really don't like the look of the dragon armors. They give myself of a sense of character. It makes my interesting dragonborn not so interesting. The last topic I have to cover is mages. I...HATE....MAGES.......Pretty much one hit kills once you reach level 28 and above if you don't have like level 80 enchanting so you can have resistances. They are broken. And the player version of a mage is just not worth it. It's just not worth it. But it does add a bit of challenge fun here and there. That's my review! Hope you enjoyed it! I definitley recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of open world games and RPG's. Peace-

review: An all-around fantastic adventure game. While the Elder Scrolls is famous for its RPGs, Skyrim feels like more of a fantasy adventure with RPG elements, rather than a traditional RPG. The Elder Scrolls III and IV both give the player more of a traditional RPG feel, giving your character special skills and increasing individual attributes such as strength or dexterity, whereas Skyrim allows the character to only build up skills such as smithing, destruction magic, etc. Undoubtedly, the quests in Skyrim have been made much more simple since Oblivion and Morrowind, but the action and basic story (if there is one for that particular quest) make up for the challenges of finding the location of the treasure/bandit camp, etc. Like most Elder Scrolls games, one does not simply "finish" it. There are mountains of quests and events for the player to find and complete, and you can easily dump hundreds of hours into it. With a growing mod community on Steam and Nexus, players can immerse themselves in one of the greatest adventure RPGs in existance.

review: Love the game, its long story, and replayability make it very interesting, as well as not being even close to linear. My only problems were that its sandbox mechanic is severely lacking, but I'm sure mod makers will make up for it. As well as some seemingly unfinished questlines. ||SPOILER|| Like the College of Winterhold, you should actually be able to learn about the game's definition of magic, and its mechanic through this college. Instead, it may aswell be a small insignificant bunch of side-quests leading up to becoming arch-mage.

review: The way it is with all Bethseda Games: Beautiful world, great setting, short main storyline, interesting side story, many many sidequests, much to see and much to do - the other side of the coin? Bugs - bugs everywhere. Glitchin through objects and gettin stuck - NPC's glitchin around, quests not starting, some quests become stuck and can't be completed, random CTD's and so on - thanks to the Community, there are Unofficial Patches for the game and the DLC's and boy, they are needed - Bestheda, one question - What would you do, without the Community that loves your games? Let me answer that question for you - You would be out of business in 6 months. And for the enhanced game experience, go get yourself a lot of mods. But be careful of the random CTD's.

review: Utterly beautiful graphics, vastly more content than you can shake a hundred sticks at, visceral combat, awesome dragons and absolutely worth playing. However, it's not without some significant flaws. If you're familiar with the magic system from the previous Elder Scrolls games, prepare for disappointment. The range of effects is vastly reduced (there are only three types of Destruction, for instance), and there's no spellmaking. Although you have the awesome ability to cast two spells at once (one from either hand), they completely missed the opportunity to make spell combinations. It all feels generic, dumbed-down and consoley. Though there's a million and thirty side-quests, they're pretty much all identical: go to X dungeon and kill a bunch of identical undead. The thieves' guild quest doesn't actually require you to steal things. People treat you exactly the same when you're level 1 as they do when you're master of all the guilds and wearing a dead dragon on your shoulders. Definitely get it - but be prepared to get a little jaded faster than you might have imagined.

review: A wonderful game and a true testament to the Elder Scrolls Series. Not as big as my beloved Daggerfall or Arena, but complete immersion into the environment is still possible. An easy to use skill system (though I do miss the in-depth ones of old) and a great character generation system make the game easy to play your way. Above all I love the customizability of the game itself, leaving it to the end-user to shape the game as they see fit. A great and immersive set of stories to go through, with DLC expanding it to many hours of enjoyable fun. This is by far one of the greatest games that I have ever played, and continue to play!

review: Skyrim is one of those games you could play constantly for weeks, or even months and it's still fun. Then even after you get bored of it you can return months later, start a new adventure and have just as much fun as last time, if not more. Throw mods on top of it, the game just gets even better. The open world exploration is fantastic and there is always something new to discover, it's truly an adventure game and I recommend it for anyone who likes fantasy games and open world games.

review: I very first started with a barbaric Nord who weilded 2-handers and dawned heavy armor and completely smashed everything in sight. I next played a Redguard Conjuration Mage Thief who dual wielded conjured weapons. And now I'm an Orc Werewolf Archer who is really good at pick pocketing. There is really no end to the amount of customization this game gives you. The player has complete and full control of who and what they want their character to be. I've played through this game so many times (originally had it for 360) and I STILL find all new areas to explore. I've never had so much fun with a game. 10/10 for a game after 3 years since it's release and still holds my attention for long periods of time.

review: This game can be very..very..very..long if your OCD for sidequests like I am..(i dont even know if i have the main story in my quests) and worried about walking into the infinate looping sidequests. The game has a few bugs in but its nothing game breaking, its enjoyable to RPG fans and obviously to elder scrolls fans. The 1st dragon kill can be very satisifiying but after like 10 of them it just feels like a normal enemy since the random spawn is so common.

review: 3 and a half years after its release, Skyrim is still more captivating than any RPG I've ever played. The modding community is dedicated, quirky, and practical. The game is very much tailored by personal experience and values, not only in the selection of guilds, but in the character development as well. You will find yourself debating whether or not to let a man live based upon the actions of his peers, be they bandits, Thalmor, Stormcloaks, Imperials, etc. The social dynamics of the game are often overlooked in favor of the graphic quality, questlines, and combat, but it is the dialogues and familial nature of Skyrim that has truly made this an excellent experience- one I'd say every game enthusiast ought to appreciate. 10/10.

review: Skyrim is the open world RPG game. It is the fifth installment in The Elder Scrolls series developed by Bethseda Softworks. You play as the Dragonborn destined to save Skyrim as well as the world of Nirn from annihilation from an evil in the form of an ancient dragon named Alduin. You travel across the province of Skyrim progressing in power, engaging in side quests, joining guilds or picking a side in the civil war that rages the land. Your character is very customizable through the many classes and races. The main story is rather short but makes up for it through the myriad side quests. But most of the game, you spend exploring the unfathomably vast landscape. The combat system is rather stiff but weapons are very diverse due to enchantments. The skill tree is nice allowing you to customize your character in specific skills from the points you gain when leveling up. The graphics of the game are quite stunning for its time and Jeremy Soule has created a masterpiece to your ears which fits the tone of the game. The game has a realistic feel through the lore and the environment. Bethseda took the time and made books adding to the realism. Everything seems to fit and comprehendable lorewise. The replay value of the game is increase due to the fantastic community. You can add mod from the Steam Workshop as well as the Skyrim Nexus adding to the fun of the game. Bethseda has released 3 DLCs where can expand on the story through vampires and the first Dragonborn as well as making your own family. This game is simply breathtaking and one of the best if not the best RPG I have experienced. Rating: 98/100

review: OH what a game!!! So many choices, so many things to do. Follow the quest, run off on sidequests, or just wander aimlessly to your heart's content... It's all in there. Focus on magic, be the best mage you can be: favor destroying stuff, become a Destructionist mage and burn, freeze, zap everything in your way. Like to protect yourself, specialize in the Alteration school. There are other schools as well; something for everyone. Or, just do a little bit of everything. Doesn't matter, you can tailor your playthrough to the way you want to play it. Fancy yourself a sneaky type? Focus on stealth, put everything in powerful daggers and level up backstabbing, and nothing will stand in your way. Want to snipe enemies from the shadows? Just start putting experience into bows and enchanting and take down targets' health, stamina, or magicka level from a distance so that one or two hits from your dagger or sword will make short work of them. Find or craft you a soul-trapping weapon and you can gather an infinite supply of souls to recharge your magical bows or melee weapons to keep doing massive amounts of damage. Burly warrior or wily agile fighter... you pick. The sky's the limit as you can basically do anything or be anything you want to be. Spend hours, days, months even, just exploring. Make a career out of hunting wild animals and gathering their pelts to sell for money so you can afford your own place, so you can even get married and adopt some kids. Just wander, if you want, as there are thousands of places (towns, villages, lone cottages, caves, mines, and mills) to enjoy, interact with, take on a job just about any place. I don't see how this game could get any better or do it better so that you can enjoy playing it your way... Oh wait, there are literally thousands of mods that do just that: from hundreds of new weapons, armor types, loot, potions, poisons, capes...it's just endless. And then there are all the mods for improving the low-quality objects found in the vanilla game, texture enhancements, gameplay enhancements, crafting overhauls, hundreds of new followers, creature types... it's just incredible what you can do. I don't see how anyone could NOT like this game. It's phenomenal.

review: Skyrim Is probably the most Beautiful Elder Scrolls games ever, and one of the best games ever. The map is fun to explore with many different characters to fall in love with. Its one of the only games I enjoy levelling up my Miscellanious skills (Blacksmithing speech etc.) You Are not a gamer if you never played a tleast one of the Elder scrolls games , so If you haven't, Skyrim is the place to Start. Although, not even a year after buying the game I found that I was heavily relying on different mods and DLC. The story is basically the same no matter what and even though there are some small choices, there isn't a lot for an RPG. The choices all lead to the same out come (just some different dialogue).

review: This is hands down one of the greatest RPG's of all time..... The Elder Scrolls V has proven to still be one of the finest pieces of art Bethesda has published and is still proven to be a masterpeice nearly two years on. Whether you quest for weapons, armour or just seek adventure this game has it all. In terms of gameplay, while the combat may be seen in some eyes as 'crap', there are many mods available on the workshop to tweak your game to perfection. The PC edition runs much quicker than PS3/XBOX and is greatly obtimised. Loading times are minimal and even old computers can run this game fine which is incredible considering the sheer magnitude of the game. Sadly this game is only singleplayer but don't let that get to you. Talking about it with your friends is just as good :) You will never get bored with the simply hundereds of quests to complete. Perhaps you can make personal quests for finding mighty armour or slaying some annoying beasts. Maybe you just want to use a dragon shout to knock a giant off a cliff. Anything is possible. This game has proven to be in my top 3 favourite games ever made (which is saying something. I have A LOT of games). The game is cheaper than ever on steam and has such an amazing community helping out by making and testing mods, giving feedback ect. This game certainly is playable without mods (you are not obliged :D) however, there is something in the workshop for everyone. James Wood-Dedicated Nord with a big sword.

review: A masterpiece from the XX century: great graphics and music, huge map and variety of quests, interesting storyline and a big amount of weapons, armor, potions, enchantments, etc. Almost the same game style as Fallout 3 (being that it was made by the same company), but instead of guns, we have medieval weapons: swords, knifes, axes, bows, even a big amount of magic spells. The level up system works not just by killing people and creatures, but by performing different actions, such as sneak by, selling stuff, archery, different magic schools, theft, alchemy and more. Even though the game looks like a FPS, I think it's a fair game when it comes to battles and it has the posibility to change camera views. What it makes it unique from the other sequels is that the main enemies are dragons which you have to fight and defeat throughout the game. A fully recommended game which takes quite a lot hours to be beat and another amazing game from Bethesda Softworks.

review: The closest thing we have to a fully fledged duck simulator! Embark on the most vivid 300x300 reseloution treasure hunt you could ever imagine! Perfect for gamers who never want to lose , Skyrim offers a vast land of snow for you to have snowball fights with dragons and other foes! And for you sneaky fellows out there, Skyrim sneak realism is incredible, you will be able to live out all your dreams of being completley invisible! Boasts a gigantic cast of 3 voice actors, guiding you through this incredible tale of god versus the little lizards trying to end the world. Skyrim also takes the cake for the most snow in a video game ever! FIlled with rediculously fun quests and activities that make you say "What a terrefic game, it is not easy at all and very rewarding , also i think the sneak system is very balanced and realistic and not op, oh and the winged salamanders are challenging with fun mechanics" The vast arsenal of weapons and tools provided for the player is almost on par with bad rats, simply incredible. In conclusion IGN rated this game a 9.5/10, but i think they are wrong this game deserves a solid 10/10 and should be in every household, it has achevied classic status nearly instantly with its griping sneak mechanics , incredible stealth and flawless sneak mechanics making it the game of the year for every year. P.S The best part about the game is the fact that the blonde haired blue eyed people are incredibly racist, and sneak

review: The Zelda Chronicles V: Skyman is a pretty decent game. Link finally trades in that dopey green hat and "master" sword for some sweet armor and a horse that totally doesn't need a million carrots to run. Zelda has gotten herself trapped inside some mythical Triforce dragon called "Al'duin" who has summoned his wyvern army with the help of Gannon to take over the mythical land of Skyman. Things of note missing from this latest Zelda game are: 1) The iconic chest opening noise 2) Fairy jars and 3) Rupee coinpurse purchases The balancing issues with eliminating the need for buying a bigger coinpurse presented much more of a challenge than the developers could handle. I could purchase the bow relatively quickly in my first playthrough; during the second, through a glitch of some sort, I was able to pick one up from a defeated enemy. Come on Zelda, have you ever worked like that? I didn't understand why this game was called Skyman until I encountered the Giant enemy. Upon my defeat he launched me 1,000,000 into the air. I guess that's why they call it Skyman. 8/10 best Zelda since the one with the Windy Time Fish and the Dreamlands of Not-Zelda.

review: This is the best game that I've played yet. It takes you back to medieval times, when people fight using swords and not guns. The main story is about dragons who got resurrected and they want to conquer Skyrim. Many people asked "Can you beat this game?" You can't. Only the main story takes 1-2 weeks to complete, and there're TONS of side quests available. This game too can be dangerously addictive. The soundtrack is amazing, the graphics are great and even low end PC's can play the game. If you're bored, try installing mods. It will cure your boredom and there are plenty of awesome & crazy mods out there. I would really recommend it, 10/10!

Once you complete most of the game, you can literally download an entirely new game for free on the Workshop. This is a fantastic deal for an awesome game.

review: Hi everyone! Please check out my profile for more reviews! This was clearly a massive breakthrough for Bethesda and the begginings for the Elder Scrolls series. This is the RPG that finally took open world fun over the top. Clearly, I am very happy with this game, which is quite rare for me. The first person gameplay again freakin' dragons really make the gameplay intense. The graphics are fantastic. Also, there is a free DLC available for better graphics and textures. It truly sets a great speed for the memory it takes up. Really, that is one of the only things I have to say about this game that I dislike. The memory space for it, especially if you download the DLC's, is kind of nasty. But if you have a computer that's built for gaming (like mine) then I'm sure we can handle a couple seconds of bad RAM. Refering to the earlier comments on the DLC, they have four of them (including the free bit). The majority of the DLC's only affect the gameplay, enemies, and spells that you can use. It's very suprising that this game is twenty bucks. I received it on a sale for five dollars! My brother had been showing me the gameplay on his Xbox (the first Xbox game I played) and got me hooked onto the serious in which I played the second and fourth (and obviously fifth) games of the Elder Scrolls series. I was super excited when I played it for the first time. Note, please, that I was young at the time, and never really had any magnificent experiences on video games. At the time, the only really big systems were the Gamecube, Wii, and DS (Was I a big fan of Nintendo? Yes). So you couldn't imagine my excitement when I purchased it for such a low price. Be thankful that this game is sometimes lower than five bucks, and they have sales for it quite often. The Workshop is quite fun. You have alot of crap you can do and some overpowered deeds you can commit to. Of course, as we all know, when you play a game, the last thing you want to do is die quickly. In this case, at the beggining, you have collected some stuff that you can use to your advantage from the original Elder Scrolls, like the destruction, healing, and other useful things. The spawns amoung the forests and mountains are very well done.

review: One of the best role-playing games I have ever played. Following the footsteps of the previous Elder Scrolls and improving in most aspects of the series, Skyrim has everything you want on a role-playing game. From exploring the world and killing dragons to creating your own house and cooking, the game rarely gets boring as you have a lot to do. Ridiculous amount of quests, gear, cities, landmarks, character builds make the game very enjoyable to play more than once.

review: One of the rare sequels that manages to live up to its title and it goes way beyond that. You have to see it in order to believe it: massive open world, tons of things to do, magic, politics, bandits, monsters, dragons you name it. On the other hand you have the Creation Kit and a friendly modding community. There is no doubt in my mind that The Elder Scrolls Skyrim is one of the best games ever created.

review: This game redefines masterpiece. I keep typing and backspacing because I am at a loss for words, because trying to describe this game makes me think about how amazing this game is, and I can't think of what to say. Yep. It's the game of my dreams. The ultimate roleplay experience. Pretty much everything I could wish for in a game. Never a roleplaying game so very long-lasting. Whether you play as a badass, or a simple person existing in the world... you'll still feel awesome. Replayability value is extreeeeeeeemely high. Never a game so beautiful and IMMERSIVE in every way possible too. I always turn the volume way up. I cried even on the main menu because it was so amazing and the music and the awesome. There is not a more amazing game series than the Elder Scrolls. I have played the first four TES games, and this game just sent my fanboy heart and turned it into a Viking.

review: My Opinion: -Game of the Year 2012 -Game of the Year 2013 -Game of the Year 2014 -Game of the Year 2015 -Game of the Year 2890 Epic game that can give hundreds of hours of gameplay, and when you get bored just download mods out of the thousands upon thousands of mods out there on steam workshop.

review: Well I have only spent a few hours on the game ok ok a little over 200 hours ! I really should not have to say anything more than that but this such a fanastic game I have to share. This game is all about role playing if you enjoy being immersed within a game you will love this game. Once you play the core story line hell there is many core storylines to the game but once you have got into them your can use the workshop to add even more. Not that it is needed but I believe this is a fantastic way to build a game just for you. In the game you can do the following : Adopt Children Get Married Ride Horses Ride Dragons change the way look throughout the game. Change gender Go on quest Indulge your OCD (There is even homes that are mods perfect for this) Make potions Make armour Enchant Items ......Well to be honest I could be here all day telling you what is available for 10 which you can buy it for less in the sale I have had way ove 300 hours play time since I also played it on another account before this one. Where can you get value for money like that elsewhere. And not only that the workshop then provides you with so much more free just download it and that is so easy to do. Find a mod you like subscribe to it in the workshop and then just make sure it loads before you hit play for the 2nd time. I can't make you buy the game I just know once you have you will not be sorry on doing so. Before buying this game I played World of Warcraft for some 3 years plus since getting this I have let my subscription slide not needing it, So what it would cost me for one months play I have had many months of play and really enjoyed myself doing so. If after all my ranting you are still on the fence if you want this game wait till the sales cheapskate ...... lol For 10 you really will not get so much within a game that you do with skyrim in fact I waited for the sales and got all the DLC also for very little too although with all the mods out you can add new DLC free every week some mods do however require you to have already got the official content also to work within your game so always read the information given with each mod. Happy Gaming in Skyrim Just a note I thought about after you can also wait for DLC to be on sale think I got both for about 6 or even less so even that is worth it for an extra 30 or so hours of play or more to be honest if you want to do all quest in that area. Again Happy Gaming x

review: One of the best RPG's i've played. Even though I owned this game on my xbox I brought it again on Steam and can happily say it was a good decision. I own the Hearthfire and Dragonborn DLC at the moment and have over 200 hours in this game after completing it on xbox as well. If you're willing to mod you can add so much more to the game which is especially useful if you're looking to add more hours of gameplay in if you get bored after a while. Great game overall.

review: After escaping Helgen, I could've just walked straigh to riverden or whatever the hell it's called. Instead, I turned left and took the long way around. I killed 3 bandits, met a fairly attractive woman and talked with her about her ways of life, walked over a mountain, killed some wolves, killed and raided a bunch of bandits guarding a fort, met some of my fellow cat-people, had some good talks with the guards of whtierun, rode a horse back over a mountain, saw a Beowulf reference, killed my horse unintentionally (damned cliffs) and met some traders at that river-place. I'd give it a 12/10. P.S. I my character name is Master Shifu since he bears a great resemblence to him.

review: Although I have few hours on my PC, I have well over 1,200 hours on my PS3 playing this game and I can tell you, PC is better in every aspect. This game never ends, as soon as you think "I wonder if there's a mod for..." There is. You can go install mods that add new followers to ones that allow you to open your own market stall, to be tended by said followers. You can slay dragons, conquer dungeons, and best of all, get smashed. If you're on the borderline about getting this game, get the Legendary Edition. Hearthfire really allows you to immerse yourself in the game, while Dawnguard and Dragonborn provide more challenges than the average missions. 10/10

review: Totally blew away my initial expectations, and has everything Oblivion had and more. The story of this game definitely lives up to the Elder Scrolls series, throwing you into the middle of a country on the brink of war between the empire loyalists and the stormcloaks. While this is going on, an ancient prophecy begins to unfold as well, marking the return of dragons in Skyrim. I have to say this storyline was incredibly engaging and satisfying to me, especially since you have the ability to choose a side in the war and follow that path through to the end. The soundtrack of this game is still very good, although I still prefer the music from Oblivion more. As far as things to do, there is so much to do in this game it is insane. There are hundreds of hours of gameplay to be found in activities and questlines in a single playthrough alone, and the game even warrents multiple playthroughs due to the heavy level of customization present in character creation and skill trees. I myself had more than one playthrough of this game doing different types of characters, some more satisfying than others. This is easily one of the greatest RPG's of the year, if not of all time to date.

review: People tell me to enjoy life you have to stop and smell the flowers. Well, people, its kind of hard to do that when even the flowers are spurting consumerism all over your face in a strangely suggestive manner. The hype surrounding the release of Skyrim was the truest example of this and I dont think Ive ever seen so many nerds swoon at one time. The game will see you as a prisoner again (these guards really have to stop arresting the worlds greatest heroes) when youre freed by a reptilian anger management escapee; a story for the ages for sure. Finally, after choosing to follow your death penalty chum or the man that nearly turned you into the next Eugene Armstrong, you are let loose upon the unsuspecting land of Skyrim. At this point youre left to your own devices and by all means you can follow the ever present arrow to the following plot point or you can jog off, find a shop, put a cooking pot on the shopkeepers head and steal all his goods assuming you play the PC version, if not you can suck on my dragon bone. However, there are situations the game randomly drops you in. I fondly look upon the time I killed a blacksmith and received money from her will even though that was the first time I met her. Of course then her boyfriend caught on and hired mercenaries to kill me, but ended up killing an innocent bystander, who I then also received money from, suckers! I bet youre expecting an ending statement here, but Im afraid the reptile had an aneurism and burned it up. By the way, I know you'll get the nude and killable children mods.

review: Probably my least favorite TES that I have played, though that doesn't mean its horrible, it has a lot of copy and pasted content (Castles, Crypts, Caves). For a 3D game it still focuses more on stats then skill which is a bit of a problem but mods like Duel or Ace can fix combat and the AI performance to make it a little more fun and bearable. There is a lot to do in this game though its a lot of the same thing over and over again, it has a few stand out quests/dungeons and has a fun and intriguing main storyline though the civil war campaign is garbage and most of the things in the game get very repetative. The puzzles in this game are incredibly easy (and the same over and over again much like the combat and stealth). - AI - The AI in the game aren't very good when it comes to combat (or common sense for that matter). A lot of the AI have cool personalities and some of them even have very unique backgrounds. As I said earlier mods like Duel, Ace can improve AI combat performance. - Stealth - The stealth system is almost completely stat based, it requires at low levels you will be detected fairly easily but after leveling up your stealth (perks or not) you become almost impossible to detect. - Combat - As I implied earlier the combat in this game is very generic and easy. Fighting as a warrior all you have to do is kite, attacking then running back over and over. Fighting as an archer (stealth or not) is just about draining as many arrows as you can in them before they get close to you. It is hard to miss as an archer because of the crosshair (which you can disable) (<-- I did) but at very distant ranges it can become a bit challenging. Mages in this game are bad and boring to put it simply, they don't do much damage until they are very high levels and even then you feel more like a glass rifle then a glass cannon. - Wrap-up - This game feels like it is just trying to make dumb people feel like badasses rather then challenging the players in any way (I feel Morrowind made players think and put effort forth to figure things out a majority of the time). The game is good for one vanilla playthrough since the stupid level up system they put in this game enables you to not have to choose a playstyle and stick with it (the game does that a lot in different ways giving you many chances to back out of a choice after you learned the consequences). The level up system makes replaying the game practically pointless (if you are looking to have different playthrough experiences) since there are almost no choices in the game that have any real impact on anything. 6/10 as a standalone game. 5/10 as a TES game. 1/10 required intelligence level (MOST OF THE THINGS I SAID THAT WERE WRONG WITH THIS GAME CAN BE IMPROVED WITH MODS THOUGH THAT SHOULD NOT BE AN EXCUSE TO SAY THE GAME IS GOOD. MY RATING IS BASED OFF OF THE VANILLA GAME EXPERIENCE.)

(Even though i advise you to play without mods first and then mod the **** out of it) New armours, weapons, awesome questlines made by awesome people, even if you play Vanilla, if you didn't play it before, BUY IT! What are you waiting for! i bought it on sales and it was the best decision i've ever made after dipping fries in ice cream.

review: Really nice open world RPG with gorgeous nordic landscapes. The biggest downside is that quests and the charracters are a bit "flat". I wish I would care when I kill some random farmer in the world, so I guess the immersion is lacking here. But you get distracted enough by other things that you kind of forget it. If you've played past Elder Scrolls game, expect the same experience, for some people it's good, for other it isn't. Most important thing : Mod it, mod it, mod it. This game is day and night with mods and it fixes a ton of issues Bethesda did not care to fix.

Got legendary on pc, testing the limits of modding and console commands is really making this more exciting than the last 2 play-throughs. Especially finding the room that has 1 of everything that you can console command coc to, I've done all these f'n quests before, it's great to be able to just go grab all the game's keys and super special items so you can just enjoy your play-through without trivial bs. Also, thomas the truck.  yeah. Oh, one more thing, it looked good on 360. it looked great on ps3. It loads a billion times faster and plays WAY smoother on PC. Got my ps3 controller wirelessly hooked up with motionjoy and this is the best skyrim experience I've ever had.

review: Skyrim is one of those games that have a very poor storyline the truth is that it takes only about an hours to finish skyrim main storyline. And if you play for good storyline dont buy skyrim get a different game. Skyrim is that kind of game where every dungeon will look the same each side quest will be generic and similar, however what makes skyrim a game I will recommend to others is the ability to do what you want as a player. Skyrim allows you to freeroam in a huge open world, as well as ability to mod the game. Modding this game is what it means to play skyrim download 30+ mods and explore endless possibilities. If you like to mess around with games and you wouldnt mind to spend few minutes to understand how to add mods to your game then pick skyrim because I could play this game for days with no sleep as long as I find a good pack of mods. However without the mods this game can only keep one interested for 10hours or so.

review: Skyrim is no doubt one of the best games I have ever played. I got hooked once I got into the game. It'll take you up to a dozen hours just to fully explore and get to know the world of Skyrim. Despite the few bug and glitches, I have spent up to 100 hours on this game and absoutley loved it. The graphics are absoutely stunning and the vast amount of variety in this game is amazing. Combat and character progression are just one side of the game. Traveling the world and completing quests is the other, and this is the heart and soul of Skyrim. The world is a snow-covered land full of mountains, rivers, waterfalls, tiny villages, deep caves, and huge cities. While there might not be a lot of diversity in the look of outdoor areas, the environments and views are still breathtaking. Players could spend hours just wandering around the vast terrain and still not find everything, as there are lot of hidden locations and treasures. Simply veering off the beaten path to explore some mysterious ruins might open up a whole new quest line. Thankfully, it is easy to get around in Skyrim, as fast-travel is still available along with horses to ride and carriages that move between all of the major cities in the game. The main quest of Skyrim is woven so seamlessly into the overall world that it is almost indistinguishable. Players take on the role of a Dragonborn, one prophesied to return to the land at a time when dragons are returning in order to stand against them. While there are not a lot of gut-wrenching, role-playing decisions to be made, the experience of simply visiting all the locations and meeting those who live within it is more than adequate. Regardless of the choices that are made, NPCs rarely respond to the main character any differently, so unless players go on a killing spree, no one takes notice. The atmosphere and setting of Skyrim is fantastic. The graphical process at work here is impressive, but the new game engine's impact mostly shows in the world at large, as its characters are still fairly expressionless. That aside, the graphical detail for even those dead-faced characters looks considerably better than any prior Bethesda offering and is all the better for it. Despite taking place in a rugged snowy area, locations are highly detailed and do an amazing job of really shaping the world into what one would expect from an area like this. The game's soundtrack further adds to this atmosphere, as music fades in and out to complement the presence or absence of dramatic moments. The visuals, music, and high-quality voice acting all add up to a very immersive experience. Side note : HAGRAVENS SCARE THE S H I T OUTTA ME .

GRAPHICS: It all depends on your specs, and if you mod it. -Low Resolution, no mods: It's essentially a large N64 game, polygons EVERYWHERE. -Med Resolution, no mods: Looks very good, water and shadows are rought, and large models may repeat patterns, but still looks great. -High Resolution, no mods: Probably the most beautiful game you'll ever see, if you have the capabilities to run it. Everything looks great, the water, shadows, trees, even that angry Nord hitting you in the face with a battleaxe. -High Resolution, with mods: Naked people,  arrows, and bondage slaves everywhere. Be careful with skyrim mods, with resolution packs, the game looks incredibly lifelike, but theres some... strange ones out there (MLP: Friendship is Murder Mod Pack) -Graphics: 10/10 (It all depends on your specs) Story: The great thing about Skyrim is that, while the main quest is short, and fairly easy to complete, theres an INSANE amount of quests and alternate storylines! It goes from delivering a sword literally 100 feet away from where you're standing, to stopping a midget symbolic representation from getting beaten up by a normal sized symbolic representation, to waking up after getting black-out drunk with a god and fondling a religious statue, to SO MUCH MORE. And with all the radiant quests and random encounters, you'll never finish it all. Storyline/Quests: 9/10 (A lot of them repeat) AI/NPCs: Whoo, boy. This is where Skyrim (And really almost all Bethesda/Zenimax games) meet some kind of downfall. Updates have fixed them a lot since the release, but many, MANY times has a follower died because they walked straight into my own spell/sword swing, or repeated the same line over and over, or got stuck. Recently, it's been much better, but its still not very good. The characters themselves, however, are all very good. They all have backstories, and motives, and are all unique. AI/NPCS: 7.5/10 Lore: Theres hundreds of books, and character dialogue, and quests all to tell you the story of Tamriel and individual characters. The tiniest things have their own mention. Even if you've never played a single Elder Scrolls game before this, you'll pick it up easily. But, that being said, it can be overwhelming when you first start, and everything revolves around past lore. Lore: 9/10 Overview: Pros: -Great graphics -Good combat system -Skill trees let you become whatever you want -Story is incredible -Nearly no end to the amount of quests -Easy to mod, and a massive modding community -Hail Sithis Cons: -ING AI -High specs needed to run at full potential -Mods and DLC can be wonky with existing saves -No lollygaggin' Overview: 9/10 What, did someone steal your sweetroll?

The game is molded to how ever you want to play it. Your skills and weapons are your choice. To reach the maximum flexibility and fun of the game I recommend to pick up the Legendary edition and get modding! You can add quests, new lands, Armour, weapons, creatures, textures and even make yourself a regular joe in skyrim. 10/10

review: One of the best Elder scrolls game out, The base game has a great main quest line and if you get bored of that you have 100s+ side quests to do, or you could go around finding little hiddle spots around the map. The dawnguard DLC is fun and gives you alot more side quests with a good main quest line. But the best DLC so far has to be the Dragonborn DLC im still going through doing the black books i mean theres alot of stuff to do so you wont get bored with the plot and say "Omg this sucks why did i even buy it" because i love it. Overall the game is great, plus all the mods you can download really gives the game alot of life and stuff to do. I give this game a perfect 10/10 an amazing game please do buy.

review: Skyrim is an AMAZING game. I've put 109 hours into this masterpiece and do not regret it. The story is a bit short IMO but the side missions and the open world bring you a whole lot of stuff to do. Run up mountains. Enter dungeons / Caves. Ride a horse. Kill a dragon. Buy a house. Get married. etc. And btw, 10/10 for using consolecommands and changing my name into Jesus and flying up to the skies. EDIT: Played a bit of Skyrim last night, went on a horse.

review: Played through on 360, beat regular skyrim. Playthrough 2 on ps3, dabbled in legendary, long way to go before complete. Got legendary on pc, testing the limits of modding and console commands is really making this more exciting than the last 2 play-throughs. Especially finding the room that has 1 of everything that you can console command coc to, I've done all these f'n quests before, it's great to be able to just go grab all the game's keys and super special items so you can just enjoy your play-through without trivial bs. Also, thomas the truck.  yeah. Oh, one more thing, it looked good on 360. it looked great on ps3. It loads a billion times faster and plays WAY smoother on PC. Got my ps3 controller wirelessly hooked up with motionjoy and this is the best skyrim experience I've ever had.

review: An amazing Medieval adventure/RPG. I have never played an Elder Scrolls game before this one but I had played Fallout so I made assumptions they were similar. To an extent they are but there are some major differences (Other than the technology difference). I loved fallout and I love this game too. It involves adventure over a massive world exploring towns, killing dragons, stealling from people, assassinating people - It's got everything! The game is similar to fallout in the way they are both Published by Bethesda and are both RPGs. Skyrim is pretty much your typical RPG with one extremely important difference (IMO), The level system. Enemies don't have levels, nor do quests so you don't have to grind for 8 hours trying to reach level 16 so you can do this quest which gives you a reward that is for level 14s and useless to you. Skyrim and fallout both have a system in which levels give you better perks but don't matter in terms of progression, which IMO is what makes these games the best RPGs. I could go on for ages but if you're too lazy to read that at least read this... Goog game, great RPG/Adventure, you can kill a dragon... 9/10

review: Definately one of the most fantastic games i have ever played, I put off buying the PC version for over a year, instead playing the Xbox 360 version every once in a while, i must say, the PC version far surpasses that of the console, what with the upped graphics and mod support, this is a must have for ANY PC gamer. The game in itself is truly amazing, you could play for days and still stumble upon some old crypt that, before then, you had no idea existed. The game is huge, and the vast ammount of user created content availlable is, beyond awe inspiring. Skyrim is a must have - the storyline, world, lore, and everything to do with it is beyond anything seen in any other game ever.

review: Skyrim is the best game I've ever played and anyone who hasn't played it is missing out. There is so much to do and many different approaches you can take in the game. The questlines and individual quests are all fun in different ways, they are hugely varied. There are so many places to explore and the graphics are excellent, not to mention the fantastic music and voice acting. The DLCs are all of a very high standard, providing many more quests, lots more places to explore (even a separarte island), and different items to use, as well as powers. Anyone who likes to roam free in a game and take whatever approach they want in an incredible world should definitely get this game.

review: People tell me to enjoy life you have to stop and smell the flowers. Well, people, its kind of hard to do that when even the flowers are spurting consumerism all over your face in a strangely suggestive manner. The hype surrounding the release of Skyrim was the truest example of this and I dont think Ive ever seen so many nerds swoon at one time. The game will see you as a prisoner again (these guards really have to stop arresting the worlds greatest heroes) when youre freed by a reptilian anger management escapee; a story for the ages for sure. Finally, after choosing to follow your death penalty chum or the man that nearly turned you into the next Eugene Armstrong, you are let loose upon the unsuspecting land of Skyrim. At this point youre left to your own devices and by all means you can follow the ever present arrow to the following plot point or you can jog off, find a shop, put a cooking pot on the shopkeepers head and steal all his goods assuming you play the PC version, if not you can suck on my dragon bone. However, there are situations the game randomly drops you in. I fondly look upon the time I killed a blacksmith and received money from her will even though that was the first time I met her. Of course then her boyfriend caught on and hired mercenaries to kill me, but ended up killing an innocent bystander, who I then also received money from, suckers! I bet youre expecting an ending statement here, but Im afraid the reptile had an aneurism and burned it up. By the way, I know you'll get the nude and killable children mods.

review: I've been playing for over a month now and the game never ceases to amaze me. You can lose yourself in the world and become a part of it. There's not just one story, there are hundreds. Sure there's one driving story, but all stories together make for fantastic adventures. I'm around 90 hours in and I think I've only just grazed the surface of this epic tale. There are times where I just sat back at looked at a vista and how the sun cast shadows. If you have heart, you'll want this game. If you don't, don't worry. The game has more than enough heart for you.

review: Perhaps one of the most amazing games I've ever played in my life. As a lover of the sword n' shield era, I always find myself jumping head-first into Bethseda's Elder Scrolls series. The story is immense but it doesn't rush you; This game demands that you explore every crevice it has to offer. The creation-workshop mechanic is very well made, you could literally be anything, fight anything and nearly have no limits; But challenging as it should be. An extrordinary piece of work that you should not miss out on!

review: Set approximately 200 years after events which transpired in Oblivion, Skyrim invites you into a journey filled with adventure, battle, and destiny. Continuing to build upon the expansive lore and history etched by the saga, and the "open world" sandbox premise of the previous games, right away you are struck with the huge realization that you can do what you want, when you want, and how you want! Fancy being a mighty sword wielding warrior, a deadly, stealthy assassin, a mage who has mastered the arcane arts, or a combination of all? Skyrim makes this possible. Though not without flaws (bugs), the depth and scale of this game coupled with the interactive gameplay, compelling stories and quests create an enjoyable gaming experience. With beautiful graphics, stunning soundtrack, and immersive feel, Skyrim is definitely a gaming journey of epic proportions!

review: In my opinion this is the best game of all time. Amazing graphics, amazing story, amazing sountrack, amazing everything. I have around 800 hours on the xbox 360 version and I still want to invest time into the pc version since there is now awesome mods that increase graphics, gameplay and even the story. The open world is fun to explore but after a while it does tend to feel a little tiresome when walking for a long period of time. But thankfully there is a fast travel system that speeds up the process. You also stumble apon unscipted avents when roaming the open world such as dragon attacks and bandits. There is also AI that you meet when traveling the roads of skyrim like guard patrols and traders. This is a game you must play.

review: This is the game the never, ever ends. I picked this game up thinking I wouldn't like it having never played a previous TES game before. Sat in my Library untouched for about a month or two, and finally took the plunge. I was wrong. I was so very, very wrong. This is probably the best purchase I've ever made on steam. Add in the unlimited potential of modding, and it's an adventure that continues forever. I've probably restarted over a hundred times by now with a new character, and still only have beaten Alduin once. ONCE. There's still so much more do to and explore that I'm still discovering quests and areas and little hidden things. I still can't believe how much there is to do and I'm still finding more. At it stands I'll probably wake up one day having lost all touch with reality and actually start seeing the world as Skyrim with how much I've played. And I'm totally ok with that.

review: If I had to choose between this game, and my girlfriend. I'd pick this game. EDIT: I'm single now ON A MORE SERIOUS NOTE: This game is the best in its genre. In previous Bethesda games they made a sad balance in between Questing, and Exploration. Some having more quests and less places to go, and others having very few quests and more places to explore. But in Skyrim, there is no shortage of quests, and if you are like myself and just wander around aimlessly, you will stumble into places that just blow your mind. Every time I have replayed this game, I stumbled into something new. For more info i'd very much recommend mods, with mods such as texture packs, difficulty, quests, armor, and weapons, this games replay value is endless. Go through the game once with plain skyrim, then mod the hell out of it. Overall I'd rate this game an EASY 10/10. If you haven't already. Please buy it, give it a little, and I swear you will be hooked.

review: An epic game made all the more epic by the fact that it is so easy to mod and so well supported by the modding community. The Elder Scrolls series has a large following and often you will hear people argue over each new TES game comparing it to the last, but for me each TES game stands on its own merits, and Skyrim is no exception. The story is pretty good and there are plenty of side quests, but what makes Skyrim so great even when not modded is its large and open nature. This is a land you can just pick a direction and with no quest in mind and just explore. You will find danger and excitement on your journey ... and loot. Lots and lots of loot. But once you start modding this game, that is when you unlock the true value that is Skyrim. Potentially thousands more hours content (for free) in a game that can be improved ten thousand different ways from graphics, textures and sounds all the way to game mechanics and user interface changes. You can make the game exactly what you need it to be, and play it for so long you may still be playing when the next game in this series comes out.... and sometimes longer than even that. If you are interested in modding the PC version of the game, be sure to check out my guide for beginners:

review: I was stacking books on a shelf in my house in Whiterun, one of Skyrim's major cities, when I noticed a weapon rack right beside it. I set a sacrificial dagger in one slot, an Orcish mace in the other. They were on display for nobody but me and my computer-controlled housecarl, Lydia, who sat at a table patiently waiting for me to ask her to go questing. The chest upstairs was reserved for excess weapons and armor, the bedside table for smithing ingots and ores, the one next to the Alchemy table for ingredients. I'd meticulously organized my owned virtual property not because I had to, but because tending to the minutia of domestic life is a comforting break from dealing with screaming frost trolls, dragons, a civil war, and job assignments that never seem to go as planned. It's even a sensible thing to do; a seemingly natural component of every day existence in Skyrim, one of the most fully-realized, easily enjoyable, and utterly engrossing role-playing games ever made. Part of what makes it so enjoyable has to do with how legacy Elder Scrolls clutter has been condensed and in some cases eliminated. In Skyrim, there's no more moon-hopping between hilltops with a maxed out Acrobatics skill. That's gone, so is Athletics. The Elder Scrolls V pares down the amount of skills and cuts out attributes like Endurance and Intelligence altogether. There's no time wasted on the character creation screen agonizing over which skills to assign as major. You don't assign major and minor skills at all, but instead pick one of ten races, each with a specific bonus. High Elves can once a day regenerate magicka quickly, Orcs can enter a berserk rage for more effective close-range combat. These abilities are best paired with certain character builds  the High Elf regeneration is useful for a magic user  but don't represent a rigid class choice. Major decisions don't need to be made until you're already out in the world and can try out magic, sneaking and weapon combat, emphasizing first-hand experience over instruction manual study, letting you specialize only when you're ready. It contributes to the thrilling sense of freedom associated with life in Skyrim. Do a quest, kill a dragon, snatch torchbugs from the air, munch on butterfly wings or simply wander while listening to one of the best game soundtracks in recent memory. Despite the enormity of the world and the colossal amount of content contained within, little feels random and useless. Even chewing on a butterfly wing has purpose, as it reveals one of several alchemical parameters later useful in potion making at an alchemy table. Mined ore and scraps of metal from Dwemer ruins can be smelted into ingots and fashioned into armor sets, pelts lifted from slain wildlife can be turned into leather armor sets, and random books plucked from ancient ruins can trigger hidden quest lines that lead to valuable rewards. Skyrim's land mass is absolutely stuffed with content and curiosities, making every step you take, even if it's through what seems like total wilderness, an exciting one, as something unexpected often lies just over the next ridge. Many times the unexpected takes the form of a dragon. Sometimes they're purposefully placed to guard relics, sometimes they swoop over cities and attack at seemingly random times. In the middle of a fight against a camp of bandits a dragon might strike, screaming through the sky and searing foe and friendly alike with frost or flame. Momentarily all on the battlefield unite, directing arrows and magic blasts upward to knock down the creature, creating impromptu moments of camaraderie -- a surprising change from what may have been yet another by-the-numbers bandit camp sweep. Dragons show up often, their presence announced by an ominous flap of broad wings or an otherworldly scream from high above. The scale and startling detail built into each creature's appearance and animations as it circles, stops to attack, circles again and slams to the ground makes encounters thrilling, though their predictable attack patterns lessen the excitement after a few battles. In the long run they're far less irritating than the Oblivion gate equivalent from The Elder Scrolls IV, can be completed in a few minutes, and always offer a useful reward. Killing a dragon yields a soul, which powers Skyrim's new Shout system. These are magical abilities any character can use, you don't have to specialize in spell casting to slow time, throw your voice, change the weather, call in allies, blast out ice and fire, or knock back enemies with a rolling wave of pure force. Even if you favor sword, shield and heavy armor and ignore magic entirely, you'll still be able to take full advantage of these abilities provided you find the proper words  each Shout has three  hidden on Skyrim's high snowy peaks and in the depths of forgotten dungeons, serving as another reason to continue exploring long after you've exhausted the main quest story, joined with the Thieves Guild, fought alongside the Dark Brotherhood, or thrown your support behind one of the factions vying for control of Skyrim. Not only is this land under assault by dragons, long thought to be dead, it's also ripped in two by civil war. You can choose one side or the other, but so much of the allure of Skyrim is how, even outside of the confines of quest lines, the embattled state of the world is evident, and steeped in a rich fictional legacy. Lord of the Rings this is not, but with the release of every Elder Scrolls game, the fiction becomes denser, and the cross-referencing for long-time fans all the more rewarding. Skyrim's residents are all aware of current events. They'll comment on the civil war, some sympathizing with the rebels, others thinking the establishment sold its soul. The peasants complain about the Jarls who control each settlement, the Jarls complain about the rebels or foreign policy, the overprotective College librarian complains when I drop dragon scales all over his floor; many characters feel like whole, distinct personalities instead of vacuous nothings that hand out quests like a downtown greeter hands out flyers for discount jeans. Characters stereotype based on race, they double-cross at even the slightest hint it might be profitable, and they react to your evolving stature within the world. It makes a ridiculous realm, filled with computer-controlled cat people and humanoid reptiles, demon gods and dragons, feel authentic, like a world that existed long before you showed up and will continue to exist long after you leave.

review: great game. 200 hours in and I have finished the theives guild questline, dark brotherhood questline, and the college of winterhold questline, and have close to 50,000 gold. along with the quests, the DLCs are also worth the money. words of wisdom: Dragonborn DLC is not a good idea to purchase before level 40-50. I tried at level 5, kept on dying, tried again at 20, also kept on dying, and once again at level 45 and let me tell you, even then it is still pretty hard. The hearthfire DLC is pretty cool, you get to build a house, adopt kids, move in with your wife etc. The only problem is; be prepared to spend a lot of gold and collect a lot of recources, because you have to build EVERYTHING in your house. I mean EVERYTHING. Unless you want to spend 10,000 gold to have your housecarl (you can move people like lydia into your house) and have them decorate for you. overall, the game is very time consuming, fun, and well put together. 10/10

review: Some tips if you buy this game: 1. Kill the horse and driver that's driving you with the console at the start of the game (restart after sitting there for about 10 minutes). 2. Spawn in 20 bandits on top of a cliff and shout at them. 3. Type in the console "player.placeatme 00064b33 1000" (don't actually do this... unless you want to). 4. NEVER type "caqs" in the console. Just don't. 5. Download mods. A lot of them. 6. I mean it when I say don't type in "caqs" in the console. 7. pls dont type it in. srsly. 8. I ran out of ideas. 9. Just play the game. Welcome to Skyrim on the PC. P.S. Type "caqs" in the console.

review: IMPORTANT: Do yourself a favor and buy the Legendary Version of Skyrim instead. There are a LOT of good mods that require all the DLC's and it would be a shame if you wouldn't be able to use it because you don't have the dlc's. The legendary edition is definitely worth it especially during sales. Alone without mods? It's one of those games that you pick up and enjoy, get tired of, and then never come back to. With mods? All of a sudden, this game has become an easy candidate for the best game of ALL TIME. You will be able to tweak whatever gameplay settings that bothered you from the original game. You can have new buildings/characters/weapons/quests from mods without having to buy DLC. You can change the entire landscape of Skyrim with graphical enhancements. Oblivion and Morrowind simply cannot compare to this game in the mods department. I used a lot of Lord of the Rings Weapons mods, as well as some star wars mods. If you have a good computer, there are lots of graphic overhauls.

review: Stole a sweetroll and everyone wanted to kill me. Tried again when i put a basket on everyone that could see me and nobody noticed anything 10/10 best stealth simulator would steal again Pros: *Lots of quests to do *Good amount of customization of your character *Lots of Skill trees to make your character unique in power *Lockpicking system is great *You can craft lots of different types or armor and weapons and you can sharpen certain weapons. *Vampire dlc adds a new skill tree and transformation *Dawnfire DLC allows you to build a house in a location(certain areas) and adopt children. *Too many pros to list Cons: *Odd glitches most are patched[got my body sent into space when i died by a sword]breaks immersion but usually makes you laugh *Dragons are random and can mess up your missions *Random stuff which dont really have a purpose for example the windmill and wood saw [i think correct me if im wrong] you dont get any items out of it, would have been more immersive and made it have a purpose. Great game overall. 9.5/10

review: Honestly, before I bought this game, I just went around saying it was a piece of junk. I then bought it a couple months ago, back in '13. Love it. It's a great game, perfect for a medieval setting like Mount and Blade: Warband, except it has more fantasy in it, such as magic and the dragons. Either way, I would recommend this. Especially when it's on sale.

Hunt through the ancient ruins of Nords and fight through armies of zombies just to get bored in the end and murder everyone in Windhelm just for the hell of it.

review: It seems long ago now, looking back, when this game was first released. I had played Morrowind, I have played Oblivion, loved both, and I was left eagerly awaiting Skyrim. And I was not disappointed. Bethesda again reminds me of what true quality is. In short, this game is amazing. But more that that, it gives everyone who would give it a chance, everyone that would allow themselves to gently fall into it's landscape, a fantastical escape from the occasional blandness of life. We all need escapes, time away from the coffee and the concrete, and Skyrim provides a window. It's not a replacement for anything, it's merely an avenue to get lost in your own imagination. Those who can't let go, can't dream of fantasy, should avoid Skyrim. For everyone else, I high recommend you give this game a try and give yourself a chance to get lost in its wonder.

It is another world to get lost in and never come out. I have to stop and just take in the sites sometimes. Yes, it has some small problems,,,but I don't even feel like going into them because the game as a whole is so good. If these guys screw around and focus on the money pit the TES online will end up being and ignore thier real cash cow and fan base it will be ashame. Time to come out with TES VI ....don't let the real TES single player fans down!

These days I remember Skyrim for all the times I've been screwed over by bugs and glitches that would hinder me in completing quests. But those 200+ hours were not completely wasted, partially but not completely. Also don't buy the dlc unless they are on 99 % sale or something... Considering they cost more than the base game and add maybe 5 hours extra content and a few useless items for gear that is not even better than the crap you farmed for a hundred hours in the vanilla game!!!!!!!"#!#!" 8/10 - Oblivion was better (don't kill chickens)

Best RPG, best open-world, best stealh, best hunting simulator, best waifu simulator, best mod support (Nexus+Mod Organizer) and mod offering (thousands), good graphics, fine controls, big world, never ending quest supply and endless replayability. Skyrim is pretty much what you want it to be. First person? Do it! Third person? Do it! Mouse and keyboard? Go ahead! Controller? Oh yes! Vampire simulator? Live the life of an medieval alchemist? Be an Orc bandit? A rogue Mage? Check! Check! Check and check.. The base game alone provides countless ways of playing and thus earns the rare right to be called an open world and sandbox RPG, with thousands of mods to create a unique experience. Skyrim has no direct competition on the market and that's a sad fact for us gamers. 97/100

review: [warning, this review was originally posted on 12 Aug, 2012 and when done none of the existing DLCs were out, nore most of the mods available for this game atm] Ok so after i think i've done absolutely everything there was to do in teh original game (cos ofc there are a bazillion mods out there). I managed to do every single non radiant quest there is in uesp's Skyrim list, and tried most radiants i could do before getting bored of them. Checked all skills, others maxed by natual game play (Archery) others by cheating (Alchemy omfg). Achievements all done (hellz yeah) And after a really really long time have passed since my last review. There's so much to say about Skyrim and still this feels like a very tinny opinion analysis to what i would feel like writing hehe The time came and I think it's time to say a few words for this game.. Oh and... pardon my crazy grammar.. u gonna have your eyes poped [warning given] :p The following does not include information about specific mods, neither DLC. OK...so... Skyrim; The fifth game in the Elder Scrolls series. A game taking place 200 years after "The Great Anguish" (the war between Daedra and the people of Tamriel). Lets take this in parts as i often love to do in my reviews. Graphics Bethesda did quite a good job with the graphics. The difference is noticable moving from Oblivion to Skyrim. But some times it feels like it's not good enough. My rig is not a really strong one. Core2Duo at 2.13 and a GTS250 the strongest i could find from all the series at that time. I was pretty happy to see that Skyrim was actually runable in pretty high specs. not ultra. But the frame rate was still hanging there after spawning 200 guards and 4 dragons over a vilage letting me sit back and watch the show. So after my experiece and after watching reviews on youtube with tests with a lot better GPUs out there, i have to admit that Bethesda could have done better. It took a noticable number of mods on order to make Skyrim run in HD textures, better lighting and shading, better fire and magic effects, better mapping, better geometries etc. And most of them out right a couple of months after the game was released. Why? Why is a game that comes out near the end of 2011 needs so many mods to have it's graphics perform better just a few months after release while teh game itself took so long to come out? And why is peoples' and animals' hair and fur so.. sticky and not-so-well rendered? Don't get me wrong there. My whinning entrance shall not deceive you about the graphics of the game. The engine is still brilliant. Offers unlimited possibilities. Super vast enironment, very well designed nature and animals. The nature.... God the natire is godlike. I felt like walking through the entire map than fasttraveling. I could stare at the trees, the flowers, the desert, the rivers and the waterfalls. I felt like i could fall in love with the scandinavian culture and the history of teh vikings. I literaly spent hours just staring views and details from all over the places. Also the characters are fascinating. Very realistic face designs. Great animation. The job done is amazing. But just not that perfect. When Morrowind came, graphics seemed centuries ahead from Daggerfall. When Oblivion came, graphics seemed centuries ahead from Morrowind. When Skyrim came.... graphics seemed like 6 years ahead from Oblivion.... just like how it literally was (maybe got too subjective there) Scripting and AI The AI is very good. Some enemies can find cheaky ways to hurt you like using spells from large distances with hit and run tactics. The dialogues are very good, the impact of your decisions won't bring great changes in teh world, but they will influence the average way your character acts and reacts during dialogue and also how people like you and stuff or even how characters from around the map will react at your presence. Can't say there was something really extraordinary. Most things were as expected. Companions are always fun (and even mroe fun with mods). Marriege system was a good idea (but also took some moding to get to be more interesting). Also a word about characters. All NPCs have very natural and realistic actions and reactions furing quests and/or interractions. Also great to see their daily occupations. Each NPC has a routine. Wether if it's a guard or a hunter, a shopkeeper or a fisherman. There's some really great effort put there. Scripting issues will become a matter of daily routine once of start checking out mods. Collisions are some times imminent even while using special tools like Wrye Bash. Quests A bunch of quests. Radiant and non-radiant quests. Stories. Guilds (most of what we've already seen from Oblivion). Chances to help or kill people. Choosing your way through. Gaining special items. Finding rare kickass gear. Getting and house. Doing "jobs". (also completing some nice achievements). Training. Tons of stuff to do. And of cource, a super cool main story to follow. HOWEVER. Quest lines are in average short. You can be easily done with most guilds in a matter of few hours (except the thieves guild if you want that achievement). Where did all the storytelling go? Yes, everything is cool and fine, but sometimes it literally takes half the time to complete a guild's quest line that what it took you to do the same guild's questline in Oblivion. For example, Oblivion's mages guild had me doing quests for days while in Skyrim the mages guild was a matter of a few hours. Even if my memory is bad on this, the feeling of short storylines is strong. the whole feeling about guild quests; Very enjoyable. But kinda short. Bugs Bugs in games. Can't do with them. Can't do without them... Skyrim has enough bug reports from around the communities. But i for once can across a very very few of them during the original game. In particular only 2, during 2 different questlines which i had to overcome by using the console to move the next quest stage after verifying the nature of the bug. I've seen funny stuff about bugs through the net. I guess I was a damn lucky bstd i gotta admit that Music Still missing the awesomeness of some tracks from Morrowing, maybe a few from Oblivion. Skyrim stands alone with its own character. Sure the elder scrolls nature is noticable in most themes. You know, the usual epic music, orchestra styled tunes, some calm nature backround noice. However still Skyrim's tunes is a bit unique. It doesn't connect with TESIII and TESIV. There is this whole viking and gothic(no, not the modern goth thing, im talkign about the ancient middle northern european goth war cultur and nature of things) nothern feeling in everything around the music. A stronger epicness, a war rythm, a sound with a serious and raw character in it. I actually kinda liked that a LOT. Gameplay Absolutely awesome. Little things to say. You just have to play teh game to see for yourself. Dual dual wield in weapons and magic. Some awesome and epic slow motion or cut scenes in battles. Interacting it absolutelly ing e-v-e-r-y-t-h-i-n-g around you. Gazillion of items to use and interact with. From weapons and armor, to flowers and butterflies and bugs (yes, you can even catch and collect butterflies!) Value through time Bethesda may not have given their best for this game, but they know what they are doing. Mods will add years in the game. Skyrim is still an awesome piece of The Elder Scrolls series. However i fear it won't last as long as Oblivion did. A percentage of the fanbase did compain a lot. And you can see that their studios could have put more work on the game while they didn't (maybe because they wanted to work on the future MMORPG title[?]) I personaly fear that the game will be left without many additions. The Elder Scrolls had shaped a "culture" of bringing tones of awesome things v

review: Ive played every single game of the Elder Scrolls Franchise for many hundred hours and Skyrim is no exception here. Although I loved especially Morrowind too, I can honestly say that this is my favourite RPG so far and i can hardly imagine that even an Elder Scrolls VI can kick this from my throne. Skyrim, the part of Tamriel this game is about, is wonderful desined, very large and filled with hundreds of locations and thousands of quests. I have dozens of characters ranging from level 20 to over level 1000, have explored every location and cleared most of the quests many times, but however even after that amount of hours played, when i just stumble through the beautiful wilderness I often find some secret, amazing place, easter egg or just an interesting NPC i`ve never seen before. That gives an example of the amount of passion the developers had when designing this game. While the vanilla game itself will enjoy you for hundreds of hours, the thing that differences Skyrim from the large amount of other good RPGs is the modifiability. There are hundreds of thousands mods out there, nearly every sword and armor ever used in a video game or movie is available here. But then there are greater things like mods that add entire towns with dozens of new quests and stuff to explore. And then there are giant mod projects, like "Skywind", which adds the entire gameworld from "The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind" with all quests, towns, dungeons and NPCs to your Skyrim game. You can also change the entire game concept to what you like to play, I really enjoyed modding skyrim to a Fantasy-Survival-RPG with hunger, thirst, temperature status you must take care of and permadeath on legendary difficulty. The Goal? Simply look how long you`re able to survive and which level you can reach. Very enjoyale! To come to an end here, I can highly recommend this amazing game without any doubt.

review: I would not have recommended this game three years ago. However the mod community, lowered price and *excellent* expansion pack content make Skyrim a must-own, and not for the vanilla experience. I will stand by my opinion that Oblivion was better, especilly in the uniqueness of the quests it offered as opposed to "find x in cave full of draugr", and don't get me started on the BS "but the combat is better in Skyrim" argument since the same bad combat system is just hid behind fancy execution moves. But the expansion pack content is genuinely interesting and through modding I've made my game a hardcore and fast-paced experience that feels not unlike Diablo, (to clarify that's in pure intensity and not literally like a dungeon-crawler). It's disappointing to have to merely say "the mods make this game" but that's the harsh reality in this case. The expansion content however, as I've stated twice already, is high-quality and only emphasises how mediocre the vanilla game is. Edit: Also I would highly recommend playing this game with a controller. The character feels more weighty to me that way, although that could be personal preference - you WILL have trouble playing an archer that way.

review: Well where do I begin. The Elder Scroll Skyrim is easy the best game I've ever played, Although I'm not the most hardcore reviewer in the world, It's an excellent game, and you should buy it if you don't have it already. You get an excellent RPG experience with an Open world environment and Hours apon Hours of content, and that's without the DLC or any Mods. Mods is what really makes this game shine. The Modding community on both Nexus and Steam Workshop are both excellent, and Bursting with content for you to enjoy. Like I said before, If you haven't already, Buy this game.

review: A open world game with a world that seems never ending. You will face strong Warriors, Mages, Armys, And of course the most deadly the dragon. with many dungeons to explore vanilla skyrim alone sets itself high above what I initially expected. Placed in a world where two factions clash against one another in wars. (If you choose to do them this game gives you immensive control over decisions) Want to be a mage? Ok. Want to be a Warrior in your armor with a giant sword? Ok. Lets delve farther into this idea of freedom though. Something new and exciting. Want to be a mage wearing heavy armor wielding a sword? Ok. But theres just so much customization you can make your own unique character and it doesn't stop there. If you choose so the skyrim nexus or steam workshop has a extensive library of mods to help you make that special person in your mind. Want a specific looking armor? Want something outragous like exploding arrows? Want a car? For whatever reason you would want one in this game... You can get it with mods! Ending this games rating I would highly recommend. Ive spent countless hours playing it since it first came out and it still brings me much enjoyment. Its honestly worth more then any game ive ever bought so much so that I had to buy the steam version so I could use mods and experiment more with it then the consoles allow. My rating for this game is 10/10 and I would definitely buy again if I had too.

This game makes me feel like I have unlimited options, i'd definetely recommend it! It starts with you as a prisoner but are saved by a dragon attack!!? You can later choose to be the rebels, Stormcloaks, or the Empire. Of course you can also stop the dragons, though. But as sad as it is, it took me hours to start the storyline!

review: I enjoy the open world feel. While usually I am not one for single player games this one actually keeps everything rather fresh and new offering all kinds of things to work on and fight. The quests though can be interesting to try and complete when you do not get detailed directions. I have had to look up some of the quests now and then because the directions given in game were not in depth enough. Regardless though it is a fun game.

review: Skyrim is an open world action/adventure game. You can climb the tallest mountains (to a certain point then you can't go any further up), swim across massive lakes, fight dragons, explore dungeons, kill anyone(some poeple just faint then get back up). Basically you are free to do whatever you want, but what you choose to do affects what will happen. Can you forge armor? Make weapons?? You bet you can! Personally I think it is one of the best games I've ever played! I highly recommend it to anyone and everyone!

review: Stole a sweetroll and everyone wanted to kill me. Tried again when i put a basket on everyone that could see me and nobody noticed anything 10/10 best stealth simulator would steal again Pros: *Lots of quests to do *Good amount of customization of your character *Lots of Skill trees to make your character unique in power *Lockpicking system is great *You can craft lots of different types or armor and weapons and you can sharpen certain weapons. *Vampire dlc adds a new skill tree and transformation *Dawnfire DLC allows you to build a house in a location(certain areas) and adopt children. *Too many pros to list Cons: *Odd glitches most are patched[got my body sent into space when i died by a sword]breaks immersion but usually makes you laugh *Dragons are random and can mess up your missions *Random stuff which dont really have a purpose for example the windmill and wood saw [i think correct me if im wrong] you dont get any items out of it, would have been more immersive and made it have a purpose. Great game overall. 9.5/10

review: Honestly, before I bought this game, I just went around saying it was a piece of junk. I then bought it a couple months ago, back in '13. Love it. It's a great game, perfect for a medieval setting like Mount and Blade: Warband, except it has more fantasy in it, such as magic and the dragons. Either way, I would recommend this. Especially when it's on sale.

review: Wander the open world of Skyrim as you, the Dragonborn, use your awesome magical gift of the ancient language to: Steal cabbages, steal horses, pick pockets, pick locks, and even rob shops at night!

Hunt through the ancient ruins of Nords and fight through armies of zombies just to get bored in the end and murder everyone in Windhelm just for the hell of it.

review: Probably my least favorite TES that I have played, though that doesn't mean its horrible, it has a lot of copy and pasted content (Castles, Crypts, Caves). For a 3D game it still focuses more on stats then skill which is a bit of a problem but mods like Duel or Ace can fix combat and the AI performance to make it a little more fun and bearable. There is a lot to do in this game though its a lot of the same thing over and over again, it has a few stand out quests/dungeons and has a fun and intriguing main storyline though the civil war campaign is garbage and most of the things in the game get very repetative. The puzzles in this game are incredibly easy (and the same over and over again much like the combat and stealth). - AI - The AI in the game aren't very good when it comes to combat (or common sense for that matter). A lot of the AI have cool personalities and some of them even have very unique backgrounds. As I said earlier mods like Duel, Ace can improve AI combat performance. - Stealth - The stealth system is almost completely stat based, it requires at low levels you will be detected fairly easily but after leveling up your stealth (perks or not) you become almost impossible to detect. - Combat - As I implied earlier the combat in this game is very generic and easy. Fighting as a warrior all you have to do is kite, attacking then running back over and over. Fighting as an archer (stealth or not) is just about draining as many arrows as you can in them before they get close to you. It is hard to miss as an archer because of the crosshair (which you can disable) (<-- I did) but at very distant ranges it can become a bit challenging. Mages in this game are bad and boring to put it simply, they don't do much damage until they are very high levels and even then you feel more like a glass rifle then a glass cannon. - Wrap-up - This game feels like it is just trying to make dumb people feel like badasses rather then challenging the players in any way (I feel Morrowind made players think and put effort forth to figure things out a majority of the time). The game is good for one vanilla playthrough since the stupid level up system they put in this game enables you to not have to choose a playstyle and stick with it (the game does that a lot in different ways giving you many chances to back out of a choice after you learned the consequences). The level up system makes replaying the game practically pointless (if you are looking to have different playthrough experiences) since there are almost no choices in the game that have any real impact on anything. 6/10 as a standalone game. 5/10 as a TES game. 1/10 required intelligence level (MOST OF THE THINGS I SAID THAT WERE WRONG WITH THIS GAME CAN BE IMPROVED WITH MODS THOUGH THAT SHOULD NOT BE AN EXCUSE TO SAY THE GAME IS GOOD. MY RATING IS BASED OFF OF THE VANILLA GAME EXPERIENCE.)

review: A superb game, with many hours of story, faction and miscellaneous quests. Lots of locations & landmarks to find and explore from ancient dwarven cities, caves outfitted by bandits to ritual sites inhabited by necromancers or simply the local wildlife. With skill trees that you can shape, and an array of weapons and/or spells to use, you can customize your character how you like. Single or dual weapon/magic wielding or even a combination of both further allow you to personalize the playing experience, as well as providing countless setups of hostile & allied NCP alike, All providing different experiences on consecutive playthroughs. The Dawnguard & Dragonborn DLCs are a must have addition to the game, adding new armor, weapons & clothes to the game [even if only to make your character look even more awesome] as well as new locations & enthralling story lines. The only thing I miss from the Oblivion days, is the ability to create my own spells, but as Skyrim as a nation generally dislike magic I can see why it was left out. But ... with the steam workshop this and anything else you just did quite like can be added, changed or removed. New cities, more crowded cities, new quests, greater detailed trees, or a simple as a re-skin for your favourite armor, its all in there, somewhere. But I would urge you to play through without mods at least once. A must get game that I am so glad to have played and even though I have at this point I will probably spent 100s more hours playing. 10/10

Well, with Skyrim you can, Skyrim is a typical Bethesda game, where you get to create your own character using the games many customization features, you'll then be able to play the game however you want in an almost limit less world filled with skeletons, zombies, wizards and other kinds of monsters. Once you've completed the main game you'll be able to add more quests, followers, houses, overhauls, pets, textures, weapons, armor and so much more via some of the many mods that the community creates. Skyrim is an amazing singleplayer RPG, with endless possiblitys because of the amout of mods created by the awesome community.

review: In my mind the game is a masterpiece, the game looks amazing, and is in my mind very well made, as for the storyline, I adore it. There are of course a few minor things in the game, for example the horses, they move very weird and they are quite slow compared to walking. The game itself is a fantastic experience with superb gameplay, beautiful graphics, and majestic music. The fun part is you can get mods installed easily on the game through the workshop on steam, its fun to mod the game with several mods and make it after your own liking. The game over all gets a 9.5 out of 10, as its a superb and amazing game with a fantastic storyline.

review: Skyrim is by far one of my most treasured and favourite games released out there! It's vast/open world gvies you an over-abundance of freedom to do what you please! Skyrim provides a great element of choice as you have the freedom to be who YOU want to be, and some of your choies may influence alternate paths to a story once foretold. You can choose to be the hero, or the villain. You have been bestoed a gift from the gods, in the dragons tounge "Dovakhiin" you have the power of your voice, and by destiny the dragonborn is the only mortal who can slay and rid the world from the awakining of the dragons. As Quoted - "The Empire of Tamriel is on the edge. The High King of Skyrim has been murdered. Alliances form as claims to the throne are made. In the midst of this conflict, a far more dangerous, ancient evil is awakened. Dragons, long lost to the passages of the Elder Scrolls, have returned to Tamriel. The future of Skyrim, even the Empire itself, hangs in the balance as they wait for the prophesized Dragonborn to come; a hero born with the power of The Voice, and the only one who can stand amongst the dragons" - Written by Bethesda Game Studios TracGod's Meta Score - 95/100

review: Skyrim just made Elder Scrolls gold. The game is unbelieveably amazing in every aspect especially when Bethesda made it. The Fallout Series (3, New Vegas) were the games that made the type of gameplay that they put off, hands-down my favorite. Combat in my eyes is very stratigized, Not having to rush to kill the enemy BEFORE your companion does, and not having Vats is great. Example: I had to run and jump off of things so that the enemy, which was way stronger than me, would fall back father behind me so that I can heal and gain some more magika. Also on PC, It blows the Skyrim expericence up to the roof, Its beautiful. Skyrim is where Its at if you want a new, open-world game. 110/100

review: A open world game with a world that seems never ending. You will face strong Warriors, Mages, Armys, And of course the most deadly the dragon. with many dungeons to explore vanilla skyrim alone sets itself high above what I initially expected. Placed in a world where two factions clash against one another in wars. (If you choose to do them this game gives you immensive control over decisions) Want to be a mage? Ok. Want to be a Warrior in your armor with a giant sword? Ok. Lets delve farther into this idea of freedom though. Something new and exciting. Want to be a mage wearing heavy armor wielding a sword? Ok. But theres just so much customization you can make your own unique character and it doesn't stop there. If you choose so the skyrim nexus or steam workshop has a extensive library of mods to help you make that special person in your mind. Want a specific looking armor? Want something outragous like exploding arrows? Want a car? For whatever reason you would want one in this game... You can get it with mods! Ending this games rating I would highly recommend. Ive spent countless hours playing it since it first came out and it still brings me much enjoyment. Its honestly worth more then any game ive ever bought so much so that I had to buy the steam version so I could use mods and experiment more with it then the consoles allow. My rating for this game is 10/10 and I would definitely buy again if I had too.

review: I highly recommend Skyrim. I have played the game for 102 hours now and I have still not completed all the achievments and I wish to play the game for a second time through, the story line is immersive and the scenery is picturesque.

review: Ehm so I have to write a report.. Errr, well done.. Whoever made this game? System and gameplay is so much in depth, more when you like something and suddenly you discover it has more "features" if you look deeper. I know it's blah blah blah but that how I found this system xD Storyline is one of the best! 50h isn't enough to finish the story.. Well, not for me specially when you give me RPG to play. Lel. Graphics.. Even though I'm running the game on Ultra with very nice and smooth fps, I had to downloaded the HighTextures and other graphics enhancment mods so I'd enjoy my moment in-game .. Jungle xD This game is sick! I couldn't drop it for a little so i'd finish Persona Q .. Which I just played the first 15min T.T Best of luck lol.

review: If you've played previous Elder Scrolls games, glitches and oddities don't come as a surprise. Nevertheless, Skyrim feature tighter combat, fewer bugs, improved graphics and so on. If there is anything to complain about in this game, it would be the user interface, inventory taking up A LOT of useless items, SOME bad acting, as you level up, the creatures you fight take FOREVER to kill by hitting them 30-40 times, and finally its replayability value. Creating characters is nice (even though it takes a very long time to get what you want done). Finding and completing quests is solid. I said all I disliked. The game succeeds in comparison to Elder Scrolls IV, and I am addicted to this game like a... person... playing games! Replayability value is hard to get back to though if you leave the game for a month or more. Anyways, great work on the game, this is more than I expected it to be with little to no struggle to get "used to". Postives: +Tons of content +Fun combat +Huge open world to explore +Modding tools +Deep character creation tools +A lot of side missions and long/endless gameplay +A lot of ways to improve graphics Negatives: Bug-free Horrible voice acting Poor character animations Overall: 9/10

review: This game is so excellent that I don't even feel worthy enough to review it. Suffice it to say that "the bar" in terms of Role Playing Games is just a plaything for Bethesda Game Studios. They can put it wherever they want and it will stay there until they come back for it again. Nobody else will even come close.

review: Honestly, this is one of the best games I have ever played, it's up there on my lst with the Legend of Zelda games like OoT and LttP. Enough with that, back to the acutal review. If you ever loved Medivaeavl Fantasy as a kid, or still do (like I do), you will love this game. You can do whatever you want in this game. The stories are not tight like many other games I've played. You can turn from a Mage to Warrior in a blink of an eye, and back agian. Also, my 300 hours of playing this game doesn't give this review much justice as I first played on my Xbox 360 when it came out, but eventually bought it on the PC for mods, and it is sooo much better, In the end, we won't see a game as good as this in awhile, at least untill Bethesda makes Fallout 4 and/or The Elder Scrolls VI. (Or if Valve makes Half Life 3..) Last thing I would like to say is that Famitsu, a highly revered review magizine gave Skyrim a perfect 40/40 score, it was the first western game to get the perfect score, Grand Theft Auto 5 being the second.

review: This is the game the never, ever ends. I picked this game up thinking I wouldn't like it having never played a previous TES game before. Sat in my Library untouched for about a month or two, and finally took the plunge. I was wrong. I was so very, very wrong. This is probably the best purchase I've ever made on steam. Add in the unlimited potential of modding, and it's an adventure that continues forever. I've probably restarted over a hundred times by now with a new character, and still only have beaten Alduin once. ONCE. There's still so much more do to and explore that I'm still discovering quests and areas and little hidden things. I still can't believe how much there is to do and I'm still finding more. At it stands I'll probably wake up one day having lost all touch with reality and actually start seeing the world as Skyrim with how much I've played. And I'm totally ok with that.

review: If I had to choose between this game, and my girlfriend. I'd pick this game. EDIT: I'm single now ON A MORE SERIOUS NOTE: This game is the best in its genre. In previous Bethesda games they made a sad balance in between Questing, and Exploration. Some having more quests and less places to go, and others having very few quests and more places to explore. But in Skyrim, there is no shortage of quests, and if you are like myself and just wander around aimlessly, you will stumble into places that just blow your mind. Every time I have replayed this game, I stumbled into something new. For more info i'd very much recommend mods, with mods such as texture packs, difficulty, quests, armor, and weapons, this games replay value is endless. Go through the game once with plain skyrim, then mod the hell out of it. Overall I'd rate this game an EASY 10/10. If you haven't already. Please buy it, give it a little, and I swear you will be hooked.

review: An epic game made all the more epic by the fact that it is so easy to mod and so well supported by the modding community. The Elder Scrolls series has a large following and often you will hear people argue over each new TES game comparing it to the last, but for me each TES game stands on its own merits, and Skyrim is no exception. The story is pretty good and there are plenty of side quests, but what makes Skyrim so great even when not modded is its large and open nature. This is a land you can just pick a direction and with no quest in mind and just explore. You will find danger and excitement on your journey ... and loot. Lots and lots of loot. But once you start modding this game, that is when you unlock the true value that is Skyrim. Potentially thousands more hours content (for free) in a game that can be improved ten thousand different ways from graphics, textures and sounds all the way to game mechanics and user interface changes. You can make the game exactly what you need it to be, and play it for so long you may still be playing when the next game in this series comes out.... and sometimes longer than even that. If you are interested in modding the PC version of the game, be sure to check out my guide for beginners:

review: I was stacking books on a shelf in my house in Whiterun, one of Skyrim's major cities, when I noticed a weapon rack right beside it. I set a sacrificial dagger in one slot, an Orcish mace in the other. They were on display for nobody but me and my computer-controlled housecarl, Lydia, who sat at a table patiently waiting for me to ask her to go questing. The chest upstairs was reserved for excess weapons and armor, the bedside table for smithing ingots and ores, the one next to the Alchemy table for ingredients. I'd meticulously organized my owned virtual property not because I had to, but because tending to the minutia of domestic life is a comforting break from dealing with screaming frost trolls, dragons, a civil war, and job assignments that never seem to go as planned. It's even a sensible thing to do; a seemingly natural component of every day existence in Skyrim, one of the most fully-realized, easily enjoyable, and utterly engrossing role-playing games ever made. Part of what makes it so enjoyable has to do with how legacy Elder Scrolls clutter has been condensed and in some cases eliminated. In Skyrim, there's no more moon-hopping between hilltops with a maxed out Acrobatics skill. That's gone, so is Athletics. The Elder Scrolls V pares down the amount of skills and cuts out attributes like Endurance and Intelligence altogether. There's no time wasted on the character creation screen agonizing over which skills to assign as major. You don't assign major and minor skills at all, but instead pick one of ten races, each with a specific bonus. High Elves can once a day regenerate magicka quickly, Orcs can enter a berserk rage for more effective close-range combat. These abilities are best paired with certain character builds  the High Elf regeneration is useful for a magic user  but don't represent a rigid class choice. Major decisions don't need to be made until you're already out in the world and can try out magic, sneaking and weapon combat, emphasizing first-hand experience over instruction manual study, letting you specialize only when you're ready. It contributes to the thrilling sense of freedom associated with life in Skyrim. Do a quest, kill a dragon, snatch torchbugs from the air, munch on butterfly wings or simply wander while listening to one of the best game soundtracks in recent memory. Despite the enormity of the world and the colossal amount of content contained within, little feels random and useless. Even chewing on a butterfly wing has purpose, as it reveals one of several alchemical parameters later useful in potion making at an alchemy table. Mined ore and scraps of metal from Dwemer ruins can be smelted into ingots and fashioned into armor sets, pelts lifted from slain wildlife can be turned into leather armor sets, and random books plucked from ancient ruins can trigger hidden quest lines that lead to valuable rewards. Skyrim's land mass is absolutely stuffed with content and curiosities, making every step you take, even if it's through what seems like total wilderness, an exciting one, as something unexpected often lies just over the next ridge. Many times the unexpected takes the form of a dragon. Sometimes they're purposefully placed to guard relics, sometimes they swoop over cities and attack at seemingly random times. In the middle of a fight against a camp of bandits a dragon might strike, screaming through the sky and searing foe and friendly alike with frost or flame. Momentarily all on the battlefield unite, directing arrows and magic blasts upward to knock down the creature, creating impromptu moments of camaraderie -- a surprising change from what may have been yet another by-the-numbers bandit camp sweep. Dragons show up often, their presence announced by an ominous flap of broad wings or an otherworldly scream from high above. The scale and startling detail built into each creature's appearance and animations as it circles, stops to attack, circles again and slams to the ground makes encounters thrilling, though their predictable attack patterns lessen the excitement after a few battles. In the long run they're far less irritating than the Oblivion gate equivalent from The Elder Scrolls IV, can be completed in a few minutes, and always offer a useful reward. Killing a dragon yields a soul, which powers Skyrim's new Shout system. These are magical abilities any character can use, you don't have to specialize in spell casting to slow time, throw your voice, change the weather, call in allies, blast out ice and fire, or knock back enemies with a rolling wave of pure force. Even if you favor sword, shield and heavy armor and ignore magic entirely, you'll still be able to take full advantage of these abilities provided you find the proper words  each Shout has three  hidden on Skyrim's high snowy peaks and in the depths of forgotten dungeons, serving as another reason to continue exploring long after you've exhausted the main quest story, joined with the Thieves Guild, fought alongside the Dark Brotherhood, or thrown your support behind one of the factions vying for control of Skyrim. Not only is this land under assault by dragons, long thought to be dead, it's also ripped in two by civil war. You can choose one side or the other, but so much of the allure of Skyrim is how, even outside of the confines of quest lines, the embattled state of the world is evident, and steeped in a rich fictional legacy. Lord of the Rings this is not, but with the release of every Elder Scrolls game, the fiction becomes denser, and the cross-referencing for long-time fans all the more rewarding. Skyrim's residents are all aware of current events. They'll comment on the civil war, some sympathizing with the rebels, others thinking the establishment sold its soul. The peasants complain about the Jarls who control each settlement, the Jarls complain about the rebels or foreign policy, the overprotective College librarian complains when I drop dragon scales all over his floor; many characters feel like whole, distinct personalities instead of vacuous nothings that hand out quests like a downtown greeter hands out flyers for discount jeans. Characters stereotype based on race, they double-cross at even the slightest hint it might be profitable, and they react to your evolving stature within the world. It makes a ridiculous realm, filled with computer-controlled cat people and humanoid reptiles, demon gods and dragons, feel authentic, like a world that existed long before you showed up and will continue to exist long after you leave.

review: The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is personally, my favorite story-based game. The many classes you can be enriches the game, and you can defeat the ultimate dragon in numerous ways according to your chosen warrior. Not only do you play the storyline, but you can choose to freely roam Skyrim at any point in the game, and obtain the best gear in the game. The huge variety of enemies and monsters to defeat in the game creates an endless fun experience. Getting the DLC for the game enhances the game in many ways. 11/10

review: 900 hours after a rude awakening in a rickety cart, a moment to reminisce on all that Life in Skyrim had to throw at you: * escape imminent death from beheading * escape imminent death from dragons, spiders, bears, wolves, trolls, vampires, elves, giants, dwarves * escape imminent death from soldiers, bandits, guards, vendors, bartenders, maids, bards, cooks, mages, farmers * escape imminent death from rockfalls, sinkholes, spikes, flamethrowers, waterfalls, slicers * escape imminent death from carrying too much, carrying too little, having everything but That One Thing(tm), having too many of That One Thing(tm), having the correct amount of That One Thing(tm) but at the wrong time, underdressing, overdressing, stepping on something, NOT stepping on something. shouting, not shouting, bribing, not bribing * escape imminent death from rushing, lingering, picking up books, being illiterate, pulling levers, ignoring levers All the while your wardrobe is a function of whatever you just looted off that last dead guy (or girl, or creature!) until in the midst of cheating death you discover you can actually learn to make your own stuff, if you manage to escape imminent death while hunting, gathering or mining. You start getting more confident as your wardrobe and your sharp or blunt implements grow in sophistication, only to discover there is also magic in this world, and imminent death can come out of shadows, or darkness, or distance, or other dimensions, in any combination of freezing, burning, electrifying, infecting, poisoning, or afflicting ways. So you learn to savour the sparse moments you can stop to replenish your strength, and experience the joys of numerous things to eat and drink that turn out to be imminent death in bite-sized portions. You discover that sleep, besides imminent death, also brings inter-dimensional travel. You stop and pick the flowers (mind the bees and firebugs), you take in the panoramic views from atop majestic mountains (mind your step), you woo the fair damsels (mind their temper and/or concealed dagger), you sing and drink and brawl (mind whose toes you step on). You travel and fight, talk and laugh with varying companions, sometimes human, sometimes not, sometimes they save you, sometimes you save them, sometimes they betray you, sometimes you betray them. You shout at people. You blow off steam with automatons. You talk with dogs. You dance with wolves. You trot with horses. You chat with bats. You roll with trolls. You parlor with dragons. You buy, and sell, but mostly you 'borrow'. You rent, or acquire, or build. You marry the wench of your dreams, and a dragon drops in, causing her to leave you at the altar. You adopt cute little orphans, to watch them spend hours every day honing their dagger skills while you desperately try not to fall asleep. Eventually, you realize you worked your way through many a death-defying career: * you were an adventurer (like me), and saved the world from a dragon. * you joined a group of liberal hippies that spend their life shouting at the skies * you negotiated a truce in a civil war * you took sides and massacred the others * you joined a group of assassins * you joined a group of thieves * you joined a group of mages * you joined a pack of werewolves * you joined a flock of vampires * you collected other-dimensional trophies * you did every quest * you killed every boss (some of them twice) * you visited every dungeon * you explored the length and breadth of the lands, the darkest reaches of the earth, the highest peaks, the deepest seas, the strangest planes of existence, and every single inn (because, we need to test the mead). In this one moment of self-congratulatory awe at the completeness of your own achievements, you hear a displaced voice whisper.... "Dude, you didn't even mod yet?". It is then you realize that these past 900 hours were really just the tutorial, the intro, the prelude, the awakening. You're never leaving this place. Ever. So speaketh The Voice. Unless of course, imminent death. (*) (*: Actually, death turns out to lead to singing and drinking mead and slaying dragons and then being sent back to keep doing some more imminent dying. Sorry. On the bright side, jiggling: it's real.)

review: Awesome game with nice graphics, the gameplay is amazing. Even though bethesda has got a reputation of releasing buggy and glitchy games, there are no real gamebreaking bugs. The two DLC's are amazing and the combat and magic system have seen a great improvement from The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion. And the leveling system is also very well thought out. There are only some complaints that aren't even worth mentioning, exept that the AI can be really bad sometimes. The heartfire DLC gives you the oppertunity to built a house and have childeren. While Dawnguard DLC and the Dragonborn DLC give you new locations and 2 brand new storylines with both amazing and fun quests. Worth the money and you will play this for hours of time. 10/10!

review: Skyrim. It's an Elder Scrolls game, which means you're going to have a huge world to explore again and that really is the main feature of the base game. The combat system, if you want to call it that, is unimpressive and magic feels more limited than it did in previous Elder Scrolls installments and the main storyline is acceptable but not great by any standards. However what Bethesda did do right is the creation of the world all this happens in. Dungeons and ruins are more varied compared to what they were like in Oblivion and the outside world is huge in its own right and allows for days worth of exploration. So despite its flaws I'd strongly recommend this game. There is however a lot of snow. You probably should be looking at an other title if you have a phobia for snow.

review: Skyrim is a game i would recommend to all players it has amazing graphics a good story and plenty of fun and dangerous quests to play through. The beggining is no different from most Elder Scrolls since once again the story starts with you being in prison or arrested. But past that Skyrim opens you to a new world full of caves,dungeons,cities,camps,and houses all throughout the world. But I also have problems with the game since th PC version is very glitchy. I sometimes take armor off a armor stand and put new armor on it then come back to see the old armor has duplicated replacing the armor I had put on there. You might think oh you now can give that armor to your followers or sell it! But this happens nearly everytime you leave your house and it is very frustrating. The game also glitches on quests causing me to go back to previous game files which is bad and is something that needs to be fixed. But in all Skyrim will always be one of the best games to ever be made. I have never seen any game like it and never will. 9/10

review: Must own for RPG fans, or dragon fans... or any fans... or anyone with a computer, Xbox360, or PlayStation 3... Update 3/1/2015: Just beat the Dragonborn DLC... This is the second (?) time you go to Solsteim (I didn't spell it right) off of Morrowind, as you also go there in TES 3: Morrowind as DLC. The characters were fleshed out, while maybe not emotional, but you could develop a slight bond with. The new island you can visit is awesome and the new Shout is bada$$. Worth $20.00.

review: Some tips if you buy this game: 1. Kill the horse and driver that's driving you with the console at the start of the game (restart after sitting there for about 10 minutes). 2. Spawn in 20 bandits on top of a cliff and shout at them. 3. Type in the console "player.placeatme 00064b33 1000" (don't actually do this... unless you want to). 4. NEVER type "caqs" in the console. Just don't. 5. Download mods. A lot of them. 6. I mean it when I say don't type in "caqs" in the console. 7. pls dont type it in. srsly. 8. I ran out of ideas. 9. Just play the game. Welcome to Skyrim on the PC. P.S. Type "caqs" in the console.

review: When I first entered the world of Skyrim, I was immersed in a fantasy setting where I was quickly thrust into a position of power and entrusted with the responsibility to save the world. This is where the fantasy stops. Similarly to any human suddenly gifted with immesurable power I proceeded disregard the responsibilities of my newfound abilities and proceeded to instead enact horrible deeds on the city's guards and townsfolk. It begins to become painfully clear that Skyrim is not as much of a fantasy game as it is a digital exression of the depravity of humans when given the means to enact their deep and twisted desires. An excellent existential simulator questioning the depth of vileness to which a human soul can delve into, Skyrim poses many deep philosophical points such as tyrrany, racism and the uselessness of having a %based pickpocket system if you have quicksave and quickload and reaching the ultimate conclusion of 'f*ck it, if you kill dragons you must be right'.

review: Skyrim oh glorius skyrim. This game could be my favorite of all time. I must have made 20+ characters playing this game because I was so curios as to the different options to choose from. Going in to it I had no idea the lore or universe of the scrolls franchise but immediatley delved in. The lore is intereting and makes sense. The universe of the game feels somewhat freindly as you step into the open wilds of the tundra but talk to npc's and as you complete quests you begin to notice really how many insane problems Skyrim has. The game invites you to be a strong nordic viking, a stealthy theiving cat, or an expert mage. In all honesty though it encourages you to mix and match and do whatever you want. For example like being an elf who wears heavy armor or a nord who slits throats with dual daggers. It dosent really have many boundraies unlike some of bethesdas other games like fallout which is also one of my favorites despite bugs or flaws. I dont have a counter but I've put a lot of hours into this game(if you look at steam playtime it might be realtivley small because I used to play on 360). There are a number of things you can do like: -Finish the main quest -Get the best weapons and armor through smithing(very tedious) -Complete the companions quest line and other spoilers that I will not say -Complete the mages guild quest line -Complete the theives guild quest line -Complete the dark brotherhood quest line or destroy it by talking to Commander Caius -Choose sides in the great war and complete the quests to restore order for your chosen faction -Investigate the forsworn consipacy -If you have Dawnguard, Dragonborn, or hearthfire dlcs defintley do all you can in them -Do quests for the many daedric lords -Fufill side quests for the trobuled people in skyrim -Get as many Thu'um shouts as you can and kill as many dragons as you can -If you can get mods GET THEM the modding community has very talented people in it -And most inportantly have fun in the world and FusRoDah any guard that says he took an arrow in the knee 10/10

review: This game NEVER ENDS. In most games, that wouldn't be a very complimentary feature, but in this game the gameplay is phenomenal, the graphics are great, the level system is smooth, and you can do almost whatever you want. It has hours upon hours of playability, with the main story line, the DLC story lines, the playermade DLCs on the workshop, and then on top of that, every playthrough can be different because of the vast collection of player made mods. Plus it was only $7.50 during the Christmas sale. I would recommend this game to anyone.

review: IMPORTANT: Do yourself a favor and buy the Legendary Version of Skyrim instead. There are a LOT of good mods that require all the DLC's and it would be a shame if you wouldn't be able to use it because you don't have the dlc's. The legendary edition is definitely worth it especially during sales. Alone without mods? It's one of those games that you pick up and enjoy, get tired of, and then never come back to. With mods? All of a sudden, this game has become an easy candidate for the best game of ALL TIME. You will be able to tweak whatever gameplay settings that bothered you from the original game. You can have new buildings/characters/weapons/quests from mods without having to buy DLC. You can change the entire landscape of Skyrim with graphical enhancements. Oblivion and Morrowind simply cannot compare to this game in the mods department. I used a lot of Lord of the Rings Weapons mods, as well as some star wars mods. If you have a good computer, there are lots of graphic overhauls.

review: Eu sei que vocs esperam que eu diga que Skyrim  o jogo que qualquer f de RPGs (como Ultima e The Legend of Zelda) idealizou nos ltimos anos, ou que o seu mundo  imenso e que as plancies geladas, as tempestades de neve e as criaturas detalhadssimas causam espanto por parecem to reais, mas a verdade  que o jogo  bastante complexo e necessita de horas e mais horas de dedicao pra fazer pequenos avanos, obrigando o jogador a dedicar um dia inteiro para conseguir mudanas relevantes que daro prosseguimento a aventura principal. Joguei pouco mais de 43 horas durante as minhas frias de Julho e 90% desse tempo foram dedicadas a sidequests. Meu conselho? Se voc tiver MUITO tempo livre, Skyrim  para voc. Do contrrio, no recomendo. Skyrim  para jogadores dedicados... e com BASTANTE TEMPO LIVRE. T cursando faculdade? Pai de famlia? Tem outros jogos pra se divertir? ENTO CAI FORA!! ^_^

review: Skyrim. It's an Elder Scrolls game, which means you're going to have a huge world to explore again and that really is the main feature of the base game. The combat system, if you want to call it that, is unimpressive and magic feels more limited than it did in previous Elder Scrolls installments and the main storyline is acceptable but not great by any standards. However what Bethesda did do right is the creation of the world all this happens in. Dungeons and ruins are more varied compared to what they were like in Oblivion and the outside world is huge in its own right and allows for days worth of exploration. So despite its flaws I'd strongly recommend this game. There is however a lot of snow. You probably should be looking at an other title if you have a phobia for snow.

review: 3 and a half years after its release, Skyrim is still more captivating than any RPG I've ever played. The modding community is dedicated, quirky, and practical. The game is very much tailored by personal experience and values, not only in the selection of guilds, but in the character development as well. You will find yourself debating whether or not to let a man live based upon the actions of his peers, be they bandits, Thalmor, Stormcloaks, Imperials, etc. The social dynamics of the game are often overlooked in favor of the graphic quality, questlines, and combat, but it is the dialogues and familial nature of Skyrim that has truly made this an excellent experience- one I'd say every game enthusiast ought to appreciate. 10/10.

review: The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is personally, my favorite story-based game. The many classes you can be enriches the game, and you can defeat the ultimate dragon in numerous ways according to your chosen warrior. Not only do you play the storyline, but you can choose to freely roam Skyrim at any point in the game, and obtain the best gear in the game. The huge variety of enemies and monsters to defeat in the game creates an endless fun experience. Getting the DLC for the game enhances the game in many ways. 11/10

review: Oh Skyrim, with your wondrous landscapes and your lovely wildlife and inhabitants. Skyrim is an excellent game with SO much to do. Become a thief, a warrior, anything you wanna be. You can do all the quests you want or go around each town and slaughter everyone. The possibilities are (relatively) endless. My only qualm about the game is the menu system in-game. It seems a little clunky at times and annoying having to scroll through heaps of items sometimes just to get one thing. Luckily there are mods out there for that, and I definitely recommend them should you feel the same way

review: Of all the games I play.. this is the one that always has a cozy fire and a hot cup of steaming chocolate ready to welcome me back. It's the game that welcomes me with a big friendly smile and open arms. Even when I keep playing away it says, 'come on home' and gives me a nice warm hug. It must surely be the best game of all time. I don't know if I will ever finish it - but then, I don't really want to. I have it both on PS3 and here on PC. I have restarted it several times playing different characters. It has not dated at all, in no small part due to a large modding community, many HD updates and a friendly community. There must be more mods for this game than there are devious politicians. If you don't already own it you need to correct the error of your ways immediately or expect to be disciplined! You know who you are and you know you want it. Should you get the legendary edition? Look into my eyes, what do you think. Just say "Yes Miss"

review: Bethesda is a game company that knows what the f*ck they are doing. In a time where game creators are scrambleing for the newest thing like new hit boxes, new guns, dlc's just to play the game, sh*tty dialoge, stupid plots. Bethesda comes out of the middle of butt f*uck no where and shows them all up. Its like Bethesda actually wants you to have fun in this game They want you to like the story. They want you to get involved with the world that they created. They want you to have fun, because god forebid that new games cant do that! And I am just sitting here with my mouth open in awe at what I am looking at. This game really shows what happens when game creators take time and hell even THOUGHT AND EFFORT into making there game. Ok, now that Ive kissed Bethesda a*s. Lets talk about the game. Skyrim is a game set back in....I dunno. And you start off as a prisoner who has been captured for following a cult who is agianst the system of Skyrim. You escape because a dragon is like," dont worry bro, I got you." and blows up the place right before you get almost get beheaded....I am still going to kill that dragon though. Then the rest is a journey that you decide. What I like about this game: 1.The action is amazing. Everything seems smooth and up to date even though this game came out in like 2012. 2. The story is rich and it just keeps on going and going. 3.There are plenty of missions and hours of gameplay. 4. The characthers sometimes are funny and the voice acting is fairly decent. 5. ITS ONLY 5 GB....HOLY S*IT!!!!!! F*ckin, sleeping dogs is 13 gb and they dont even have half as much of story as this does. 6. I can run it on my sh*tty computer...with the graphics down but whatever. 7. EVERYTHING! Now for the bad things: 1. It glitches from time to time but Bethesda does that with there xbox to computer games. And thats it for the bad. Just please god, if you havent played it. GET IT RIGHT NOW My Gaming Score: 10 SkyrimGasms/ 10. I still like Ride to Hell Retrubution better, though. (jking that game is )

Diffrent charactors introduce a diffrent style of gameplay which will make you want to try a diffrent style keeping the fun going. Overall a great game with few minor glitches/bugs.

review: It's a great game, I have dedicated many hours especially on Xbox i pc. It is a game which is to create your custom character i discovering landscapes in a colossal map, enemies, dungeons, in my opinion, the highlight are the missions. There are also political comflictos and battles, guilds of thieves, assassins, knights, and a big immensity of missions, I myself xbox 517 hours I could not finish. What I really like about this game is, the large number of objects that are i the freedom it gives you this role, I found no such thing in Assassins creed. The atmosphere of the streets, comversaciones on the market, this well heco. I there are beautiful landscapes, impressive i. Pity, i I consider an error of the game, is that there is online, but the story is very well cast. Another incomveniente are many physical errors, for example, sometimes a mammoth flying or is fallin from the sky. But overall it is a high quality game i being the 2011 is very well. Warning: can be very adictiovo. The fun is to play without cheats. This is my experience as a veteran i review Skyrim.

review: You will get tired of this game, and eventually forget about it for a while to play others, but you will always come back. There is always something you want to do and you can't help but play a little bit here and there. Complete quests you've done half a hundred times, just because you enjoyed them, run around in your favourite dungeons and get hungry by staring at the brightly coloured food you cooked. Then you'll shout Lydia off High Hrothgar again and quit for a while longer. But you know you'll come back. You'll always come back.

review: Rating: Tubular, Dude! This game summs up all together a game that I would most like to play. It's got the lush landscapes ranging from Snowy ice caps to heated boggs, It's got the emmense gameplay that keeps you hanging on wanting to see more, and it even has the traditional Elder scrolls lag after you've downloaded too many CBBE mods. I simply love this game, and can't wait to see what else Bethesda can crap all over us to make money. Although, I'd rather play Super Mario brothers 2.

review: This game is a unbelieveable adventure, even if you haven't played the older Elders Scrolls games it doesn't matter. There are some inside jokes, that you might not understand unless you have played the older ones (Mai'q I'm looking at you). With the addition of Steam Workshop you can mod this game very easily to increase the graphical fidelity, or add more quests, although the main quest, is already excellent and the sidequest are great. The graphics on their own are good, but not great. But remember we're looking at a 2 year old game so the graphics, aren't at 2013 level. With the addition of Dawnguard and Dragonborn you can add two whole new questlines which both you can affect like the main games quests. Pros: Quests are great. Even after completing the main quest line, you will have a lot of interesting side quests. The attention to detail is amazing. The world levels with you, after you break a certain level you will see new enemies. Cons: Voice acting isn't the strongest part of this game; the same voice actors are recycled from character to character. The graphics aren't the best, but remember, we're looking at a 2011 years game.

Some npcs are dumb , but others are really smart that makes the game equilibrated . Every choose can have different reactions . This is art in pixels , this is skyrim .

review: Beautilful, Unique, and Charming... Skyrim provides better experience of this RPG open-world series. Beside the main quest and radiant sidequest which can surprise you in different events. Pretty genuis scripts and storyline lead you to new places, new conflicts, and dragons as random encounter. The level system is not new, but it has improvement and design. Places are full of mysteries, activites, and NPCs, lifefull indeed. Smithing and enchanting are deep and impact to your combat as magics and shouts are balanced and provide new tactics. I could say I'm in love with this fifth series. Even some people may face with minor bugs (For me, it just minor graphic bugs now.) Inventory system is hard to track (Fix by using Skyrim UI Mod) and problem in AI direction. All I say it just common thing in this kind of game which cant interrupt you from amazing experience. Totally worthy in every dollar/baht you paid. Whatever you are fan of series or not. Try once in your owned. :)

review: One of my favorite games of all time. The modding community is great, but the game doesn't even need it. It is a very immersive game, that doesnt restrict you on what to do when to do it. If you dont want to do a quest, you can simple ignore it. You are Dovahkiin(Dragonborn), you find that out after you fight your first dragon. The story is rather short it makes up for it in the countless hours on shenanigans and lollygagging. Your character seems unrealisticly special throughout the game. What I mean by that is you become the top of every class and yet you are still just another adventurer. The game is beautiful, and just worth your time. This game was release 11-11-11 and it still is one of the best games of the decade. The game is a must buy, even if you don't like RPG's genre. I am sure you may come out of your shell and let your inter nerd come out and become all powerful! Youre going to try to sell me something. Well, I aint interested. Olda 10/10

review: Really fun game. I had it on ps3, but I couldn't get into it. The graphical quality was pretty bad, and I wasn't a fan of the controls. On PC, you can get the HD texture pack if you have a good graphics card, and turn the settings up. It looks great, and plays well. Also, there's console commands, so if you're in trouble, you can get yourself out of it. Controls in combat are a bit odd, because weapons are inverted for your mouse buttons, but i swapped them. Takes a bit of getting used to, but it's much better. You can explore and discover new places, and fight bandits in dungeons. You can create potions and armor, buy a house to store your stuff in, and take on many different quests. You can join different factions as well, even become a werewolf. Great game, would buy. If you don't have 30 bucks, wait up until it's on sale and grab legendary edition.

review: I had not played Pokemon games before--I was under the wrong impression that they were just for children and then there was a lot of media attention on Fire Red and Leaf Green--I was going on a long trip so I got Fire Red. It takes a lot of memorization skills to play Pokemon games WELL so adults can enjoy these games, in my opinion. For those who haven't played before, Pokemon are actually VERY intricate and there are different TYPES of Pokemon so you have to remember their abilities and what types can easily beat other types and you switch Pokemon in battle depending on their strengths and abilities. Of course the graphics on this game are very, very good. What I liked best was the ability to get ingame help and for some reason it just really tickles me to see the little hand pick up my Pokemon and move them to or from the storage boxes. I also like the fact that when I turn the game on it rehashes the last few things I did before stopping gameplay last time. This is really good for me because I don't get to play everyday and if too much time goes by, I do forget my last "moves". I also have Pokemon Crystal for GBC and, I think it is a little easier...so if you'd like to try Pokemon, maybe that is a better game to learn first...Both have been very fun and entertaining for this adult gamer. Gotta catch 'em all...

review: Everyone knows this is the best game ever made and if you think otherwise then you are wrong. This is an open world action RPG, It is my favourite game by far and only the next sequel can ever top it. You start off as a prisoner who's about to be beheaded, from there you create your character from a variety of different races (human or beast) There is endless customization with what you can create and how realistic you character will look if you use mods, you don't have to because without this will still be your favourite game experience ever, but i don't see why not because it's simple to download mods from the nexus with just a few clicks and if you don't want to do that then you can easily browse the workshop from your library and install mods with a click of a button, that's what has kept this game so fun for so long and it will never get boring or old. There's various factions throughout the game you can join and become leader of, you can even become a werewolf or a vampire, the characters are all unique and loveable and you can have followers and even get married to your favourite ones, You can craft armor and weapons, enchant them, upgrade them, you can create potions, you can have your own home in this game, you level up and gain skill points to build the type of character you want, you can make a perk legendary when it get's to 100 so you level endlessely, there's always a rewarding amount of loot in each cave or dungeon you clear, i could go on forever, even just standing in the town enjoying the view of the lake is enjoyable in this game! The possibilitys with this game because of mods are endless, there's no need in other games when this game has EVERYTHING you could think of Seriously you have to buy it, if you want a game you will never get bored of, be easy to go back to whenever you want, never 100% complete because there's to much to do, then buy Skyrim

review: If you have a console and think about getting this game on console...don't.The game on the console is the alpha version of the game,the game on pc is where it's all at. You have a ton of mods to chose from and your game will look 10 times better than it does on console...or it will looke like a completely new game,with changed climate,landscapes and whatever you want to do to the game.

review: I was stacking books on a shelf in my house in Whiterun, one of Skyrim's major cities, when I noticed a weapon rack right beside it. I set a sacrificial dagger in one slot, an Orcish mace in the other. They were on display for nobody but me and my computer-controlled housecarl, Lydia, who sat at a table patiently waiting for me to ask her to go questing. The chest upstairs was reserved for excess weapons and armor, the bedside table for smithing ingots and ores, the one next to the Alchemy table for ingredients. I'd meticulously organized my owned virtual property not because I had to, but because tending to the minutia of domestic life is a comforting break from dealing with screaming frost trolls, dragons, a civil war, and job assignments that never seem to go as planned. It's even a sensible thing to do; a seemingly natural component of every day existence in Skyrim, one of the most fully-realized, easily enjoyable, and utterly engrossing role-playing games ever made. Part of what makes it so enjoyable has to do with how legacy Elder Scrolls clutter has been condensed and in some cases eliminated. In Skyrim, there's no more moon-hopping between hilltops with a maxed out Acrobatics skill. That's gone, so is Athletics. The Elder Scrolls V pares down the amount of skills and cuts out attributes like Endurance and Intelligence altogether. There's no time wasted on the character creation screen agonizing over which skills to assign as major. You don't assign major and minor skills at all, but instead pick one of ten races, each with a specific bonus. High Elves can once a day regenerate magicka quickly, Orcs can enter a berserk rage for more effective close-range combat. These abilities are best paired with certain character builds  the High Elf regeneration is useful for a magic user  but don't represent a rigid class choice. Major decisions don't need to be made until you're already out in the world and can try out magic, sneaking and weapon combat, emphasizing first-hand experience over instruction manual study, letting you specialize only when you're ready. It contributes to the thrilling sense of freedom associated with life in Skyrim. Do a quest, kill a dragon, snatch torchbugs from the air, munch on butterfly wings or simply wander while listening to one of the best game soundtracks in recent memory. Despite the enormity of the world and the colossal amount of content contained within, little feels random and useless. Even chewing on a butterfly wing has purpose, as it reveals one of several alchemical parameters later useful in potion making at an alchemy table. Mined ore and scraps of metal from Dwemer ruins can be smelted into ingots and fashioned into armor sets, pelts lifted from slain wildlife can be turned into leather armor sets, and random books plucked from ancient ruins can trigger hidden quest lines that lead to valuable rewards. Skyrim's land mass is absolutely stuffed with content and curiosities, making every step you take, even if it's through what seems like total wilderness, an exciting one, as something unexpected often lies just over the next ridge. Many times the unexpected takes the form of a dragon. Sometimes they're purposefully placed to guard relics, sometimes they swoop over cities and attack at seemingly random times. In the middle of a fight against a camp of bandits a dragon might strike, screaming through the sky and searing foe and friendly alike with frost or flame. Momentarily all on the battlefield unite, directing arrows and magic blasts upward to knock down the creature, creating impromptu moments of camaraderie -- a surprising change from what may have been yet another by-the-numbers bandit camp sweep. Dragons show up often, their presence announced by an ominous flap of broad wings or an otherworldly scream from high above. The scale and startling detail built into each creature's appearance and animations as it circles, stops to attack, circles again and slams to the ground makes encounters thrilling, though their predictable attack patterns lessen the excitement after a few battles. In the long run they're far less irritating than the Oblivion gate equivalent from The Elder Scrolls IV, can be completed in a few minutes, and always offer a useful reward. Killing a dragon yields a soul, which powers Skyrim's new Shout system. These are magical abilities any character can use, you don't have to specialize in spell casting to slow time, throw your voice, change the weather, call in allies, blast out ice and fire, or knock back enemies with a rolling wave of pure force. Even if you favor sword, shield and heavy armor and ignore magic entirely, you'll still be able to take full advantage of these abilities provided you find the proper words  each Shout has three  hidden on Skyrim's high snowy peaks and in the depths of forgotten dungeons, serving as another reason to continue exploring long after you've exhausted the main quest story, joined with the Thieves Guild, fought alongside the Dark Brotherhood, or thrown your support behind one of the factions vying for control of Skyrim. Not only is this land under assault by dragons, long thought to be dead, it's also ripped in two by civil war. You can choose one side or the other, but so much of the allure of Skyrim is how, even outside of the confines of quest lines, the embattled state of the world is evident, and steeped in a rich fictional legacy. Lord of the Rings this is not, but with the release of every Elder Scrolls game, the fiction becomes denser, and the cross-referencing for long-time fans all the more rewarding. Skyrim's residents are all aware of current events. They'll comment on the civil war, some sympathizing with the rebels, others thinking the establishment sold its soul. The peasants complain about the Jarls who control each settlement, the Jarls complain about the rebels or foreign policy, the overprotective College librarian complains when I drop dragon scales all over his floor; many characters feel like whole, distinct personalities instead of vacuous nothings that hand out quests like a downtown greeter hands out flyers for discount jeans. Characters stereotype based on race, they double-cross at even the slightest hint it might be profitable, and they react to your evolving stature within the world. It makes a ridiculous realm, filled with computer-controlled cat people and humanoid reptiles, demon gods and dragons, feel authentic, like a world that existed long before you showed up and will continue to exist long after you leave. 10/10 frome me lads :)

It has a brilliant setup in the map layout, leveling system,a and much more! No two save files are alike. With about 10 different races to play as, there are many kinds of gameplay. And there's hundred's of side quests to do and an ENORMOUS map, It's so hard to get bored! So if you don't have this game GET IT, you're missing out.

review: So I started my latest game of Skyrim with the aim to try every single type of combat, try smithing, enchanting, alchemy and as many quests as I could find. I was going to absorb everything this game had to offer. Then my girlfriend got involved.... She decided she liked this game full of dragons, magic, swords and being a badass who could destroy it all. I was hopeful that I had finally found a game we could both play and talk about. NOPE. Her idea of playing has become sitting on the second computer chair, browsing facebook and ordering me to kill people at random. I can no longer enter any of the cities without being molestered by several angry guards and I'm pretty sure I have lost a lot of minor quest characters. This game no longer has any meaning to me. I will play again when I have rid myself of my real world companion... So that I may return in peace to my Skyrim ones

review: I've lost way too much of my life to this game. That said, I'd absolutely suggest that everyone else should do the same. Skyrim spent quite a while in production, and it shows. The world is absolutely beautiful, and the gameplay is just awesome. If you're hesitant to spend the money, I assure you that it's worth it; there are hours upon hours of content, and I'd say that it also has a good replay value.

review: Absolutely fantastic game - if it should even be refered to as a "game". A masterpiece in terms of graphic design, beautiful landscapes and carefully tinkered dungeons are just around the corner, no matter where you are. Above everything else, this game will take up so much of your time; not because of frustrating moments, but the sheer amount of gameplay that's been put into this game. Apart from the main questline, there's hundreds of other sidequests to take part in. The imersion of natrual beauty is incredible, however little can be said about NPC realism. NPCs aren't very quote "smart", as they tend to repeat the same lines continuously and grow to be quite annoying. That's just one of the few downsides about this game however, next to the glitches and awkward combat system. All in all, very great 3D RPG, to anyone who doesn't have it: get it NOW!

review: I love this game. Its simple beauty lies in the amount of control the player has over how they play. Skyrim is a different game for each person, whether you like to play as a mage, a warrior, or a thief. With seemingly never-ending quests and objectives, you'll never grow bored of this game, because even if you can't find anything more to do, creating a new character creates an entirely new game and a new series of adventures. Trust me when I say it's really hard to get tired of this game. To top it off, the graphics are amazing, and Bethesda's new engine is gentle even to some underpowered systems. I can't recommend this game enough.

You can level up and get armor for your Lydia and let it fight other people. You can also trade your Lydia for another follower with diffferent skills. Lydia herself has no skills except almost getting killed several times a quest making her a good distraction. Adopt a lydia today and she comes with a free set of gear tand ons of room to carry around the crap you want to keep but don't want to have in your inventory.

review: I can kill gods and demons that have lived for millenia with nothing more than a spoon that I stole from an elderly couple, but I can't kill the scantily-clad woman that works at the mill with the most powerful greatsword in existence. Though I must admit, no satisfaction is equal to the feeling of achievement when you lure a Draugr Death Overlord to the edge of a cliff and subsequently yell at them; causing the Death Overlord to be catapulted to their splattery death hundreds of meters below. Or perhaps when you sneak up behind a merchant, carefully reach into their back pocket and pull out the person's skull and heart, only to then sell said organs back to the merchant because they're a merchant. 10/10 best shouting simulator in Tamriel.

review: Skyrim does a very good job of giving you a huge world to explore, unfortunately the scale might be its greatest downside as well. It feels like not enough butter spread over too much bread. There are little to no memorable characters besides dragons and there are very few genuinely interesting quests to partake in. In my 81 hours spent wandering the lands of Skyrim, no particular moment truly stands out to me. I find this to be rather disappointing after playing Oblivion... I'll never forget my skooma escapades or my quests for the Madgod, but my memories of yelling at some wrinkly old men on top of a mountain are already fading.

review: This game is a unbelieveable adventure, even if you haven't played the older Elders Scrolls games it doesn't matter. There are some inside jokes, that you might not understand unless you have played the older ones (Mai'q I'm looking at you). With the addition of Steam Workshop you can mod this game very easily to increase the graphical fidelity, or add more quests, although the main quest, is already excellent and the sidequest are great. The graphics on their own are good, but not great. But remember we're looking at a 2 year old game so the graphics, aren't at 2013 level. With the addition of Dawnguard and Dragonborn you can add two whole new questlines which both you can affect like the main games quests. Pros: Quests are great. Even after completing the main quest line, you will have a lot of interesting side quests. The attention to detail is amazing. The world levels with you, after you break a certain level you will see new enemies. Cons: Voice acting isn't the strongest part of this game; the same voice actors are recycled from character to character. The graphics aren't the best, but remember, we're looking at a 2011 years game.

review: I first played this game on xbox 360 and completed the entire game and DLC. I then purchased it on my computer and have had an absolutely wonderful experience on my second play through. I have over 200 hours of game time into modding alone and still havent finished the main quest. The modding community has put the game into the beyond ps4 era if you have the hardware. I have nothing but good remarks and can honestly say this may be my favorite game of all time (Zelda is a close second). If your on the fence with this one, delve into Skyrim because you can make this game better than anything that will come out in the next five years if you have the patience and determination. Don't believe it, check out my screenshots.

review: Surely a game this massive in scale requires a review of similar proportion. Where do I begin? The graphics? The gameplay? The lore? I'll start at the beginning. First off, this game is nothing like Roller Coaster Tycoon. In fact, Skyrim and RCT are about as far away from each other on the spectrum of gaming as they can be. So if you're looking for a quality theme park building/management simulator (or any theme park building/management simulator), do not look to the Elder Scrolls series. You begin your quest as a lowly prisoner in the back of a wagon. The offense is border hopping, and the punishment is death by axe (sure beats a big ol' wall, huh U.S. government?). On the way to the execution you meet fellow prisoner Roggvir, a key member in a group of rebels called the Stormcloaks, who want to take back Skyrim from the Imperial Legion (the people who are executing you) and put the Nords back in command. When you arrive at the execution...place in Helgen, a guard asks you for your name. Now say what you want about the Imperial Legion, but these people have some patience. I sat there for 45 minutes thinking of a name and rearranging my race, face, and gender to my liking, and they just waited for me to finish. Finally I decided on Jikrel, a magician/juggler inspired by my hero, Penn Jillette. Properly named and pampered, I'm ready to get my head chopped off! Just before the axe comes down, however, a conveniently timed plot device* swoops down and proceeds to burn the city to the ground. It is at this point that the player can decide whether to escape with Roggvir, the handsome rebel with a cause, or someoneelseIforgothisname, a dirty Imperial pig. While the choice doesn't make a difference at this point in the game, it presents the player with the concept of choosing sides in a convoluted, almost entirely pointless side quest involving the great Civil War of Skyrim. Racist rebels or idiotic Imperials? The choice is yours to make (or not). Once you've escaped, you're free to go anywhere in the overworld you desire, do any side quests you want, tackle the main storyline, or just goof around and break the game's A.I. I opted for the latter. Don't get me wrong, there are a lot of things to do in Skyrim, it's just that most of them aren't fun or interesting. I tried to give the main quest a go, but around the seventeenth plot device* and ninth fetch quest or so, I just got sick of it and quit. I had to replace the stock plot device* fighthing music to a pitched-down rendition of Frank Zappa's "No Not Now" just to make it that far. I'm going to be honest here: the most fun I've had playing this game I've had roleplaying a psychopathic serial rap-ist/ene-ma bandit/murderer that slits people's throats, dry humps their still warm corpses and dumps them in the nearest river/crevice/humorous location he can find. What this says about myself, I don't know. But I do know what it says about the game's quests: they're not good. In fact, I found the game's quests were obstructing my overall goal of blindly murdering everything in my path. Ever since Oblivion, Bethesda has felt the need to make certain NPC's that are essential to the game's completion unkillable. I had to download a mod so that I could kill them and thus continue having fun. Oh, and don't get me started on the mods! Nude mods, "better female" mods, "sexy armor" mods, what is this a sick joke?! How horny are you people?! But I digress. To sum it up: Skyrim is worse than Oblivion because it is better than Oblivion. Bethesda don't seem to realize that their games are inherently goofy and are perfect that way. The more they try to make it "badass" or "epic" or the more bad face textures and A.I. bugs they fix the worse it gets. I don't even think the intended audience for these games takes them seriously considering the number of great dumb mods there are out there (Battletoad Rash!) All in all, I'd buy it because it's still a pretty enjoyable experience and I'm sure everybody can find something to do in this massively dumb role-playing action-adventure game. Oh, and the graphics are pretty good I guess. 7/10 *plot device=dragon

review: Ahhh, Skyrim. Returning to the continent of Tamriel after Oblivion, Skyrim is a huge, beautiful, entertaining game that has much of what made Oblivion grand, while changing, omiting or adding to that formula to make the game even more compelling. The crafting and enchanting of items, for example, gives a personal tocuh for those who want to forge their own destiny with their own hand-made tools. The vistas and terrain is nothing short of beautiful, with sprawling ruins, vast mountains, snowy peaks, grassy highlands, wooded areas and even a volcanic/hot springs type area. The main quest is . . . much like any Bethesda Main Quest. Servicable, but not specifically stunning. However, music, visuals, small, personal little legends in dungeons, and those little stories told in the severed outstretched arm reaching for a treasure box, the dungeon specific quests, the little errands that can turn into something sprawling the entire land, books whose information can lead you on a merry chase to adventure and treasure, and last but not least the dragons and the shouts (special powers you gain over time exploring and finding Words of Power-type walls) that are unlocked and empowered by dragon's souls all push this game up to one of my favorite games I've ever played. Nothing compares to the rush of a legendary dragon attacking a settlement, and you rushing to defend it. If you can swing the expansions, you can also build your own houses, sail to a strange and almost alien island, and contend with Skyrim's vampires as well. The house building is the next logical step for anyone who sees the game itself as little more than a reason to craft their own items because they are awesome. The Island of Solstheim is both strange and engaging for me in much the same way the alien realm of the Mad God was in Oblivion. And the Vampires are fun if for no other reason than they've gotten bold enough to attack settlements, leading again to a battle between vamps, you and the city inhabitants. For the uninitiated, though, games like this on the computer run very well with mods, and this is no exception. My favorites of those (I found them on Nexus Mods, I'm not sure how many are on the Steam Workshop as well) are Run For Your Lives (citizens will hide when a dragon attacks), When Vampires Attack (the same but for when vamps attack settlements), Glowing Ore 300 (because otherwise ore is very hard to pick out), WATER (Makes water prettier), Green Water Fix (fixes a problem of not being able to see anything underwater because patches are fun) and finally all the "Unoffical" Patches (because they make the game run smoother). The TL; DR version? For the massive adventure it is, Skyrim is a must have for any adventerous soul. Just note that both mods and the expansions do nothing but enhance the experience. ;)

review: One of the most enjoyable gaming experiences I have had. The base game is amazing enough, though the main quest is rather short and gets less exciting every time you start a new game. The DLC's add quite a bit of gameplay and new content, and don't forget about the tens of thousands of mods to choose from to further enhance the game. It removes many of the spells that were in Morrowind and Oblivion, but replaces them with new powers and "Shouts". There is no Acrobatics skill, so jumping height is very limited, but replaces it with a sprinting function. Many things are missing from previous title's character development, but there are mods to remedy this. After many hours of playing Skyrim, you'll learn that many of the game's wondrous encounters, NPC's, and environments (towns, cities, dungeons, etc.) start to taste a bit sour, and get repetitive and boring. But with mods in tow, you'll never have a bad experience while playing this game. Skyrim is an amazing game, but loses much of it's robust taste with every play-through, and soon becomes saccharine. But with the 30,000+ mods available to you, and the Official DLC's, this game will never get old, or lose any of it's grizzly wonderfulness that you experience the first time around. All-in-all, Skyrim (with lots of mods installed) is a must buy for any lover of this game style. Highly recommended, and worth every penny.

review: Without the lengthy paragraph, Skyrim is probably one of the best RPG's out there, the mods super-extend it's shelf life, and there are so many quests built into the game that it could taske 100's of hours to complete. The only complaint is no Co-op

review: The Elder Scrolss V: Skyrim......oh boy....This here ladies and gents, is the game you buy and play if you want to lock yourself up in a room for 267 hours worth of you life dedicated to doing all the crap in this fantasticly fantasmic world of Elves and Orcs and intelligent walking dinosaurs. Skyrim is big. REALLY...big. And that's not just accounting for the world map I'm talking about the quests, weapons, skills, MODS (very important btw. Once you use mods you can never go back to vanilla skyrim again.), and pretty much everything the game has to offer is downright amazing. But I do have a few nickpicks. Don't get me wrong though reader of my little review here, Skyrim is my favorite in the series of The Elder Scrolls, but that might be because it's the only ES I have ever played in my life O_o anyway, the game does suffer from some things here and there. The modloader is great in all, but the MAJOR problem I have with it is that it doesn't tell you what mods are conflicting or not, so you'll be playing the game and it just closes for no reason. If there's a setting that you can adjust so you can see the conflicting mods then plz send me a PM and regard my last statement as irrelevent. Skyrim also suffers from an extreme amount of what I like to call "Grey effect." What does this mean? It means Skyrim looks very bland and washed out. Nothing really stands out unless you use mods like Increased saturation boost or Increased contrast boost and other types of shader mods. Another thing I have a nick pick with is that fact that at the end of the game, the cool armor you once wore like Nightingale, Shroud armor, Thiefs guild, etc. become incredibly inferior to the dragon versions. IMHO I really don't like the look of the dragon armors. They give myself of a sense of character. It makes my interesting dragonborn not so interesting. The last topic I have to cover is mages. I...HATE....MAGES.......Pretty much one hit kills once you reach level 28 and above if you don't have like level 80 enchanting so you can have resistances. They are broken. And the player version of a mage is just not worth it. It's just not worth it. But it does add a bit of challenge fun here and there. That's my review! Hope you enjoyed it! I definitley recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of open world games and RPG's. Peace-

review: An all-around fantastic adventure game. While the Elder Scrolls is famous for its RPGs, Skyrim feels like more of a fantasy adventure with RPG elements, rather than a traditional RPG. The Elder Scrolls III and IV both give the player more of a traditional RPG feel, giving your character special skills and increasing individual attributes such as strength or dexterity, whereas Skyrim allows the character to only build up skills such as smithing, destruction magic, etc. Undoubtedly, the quests in Skyrim have been made much more simple since Oblivion and Morrowind, but the action and basic story (if there is one for that particular quest) make up for the challenges of finding the location of the treasure/bandit camp, etc. Like most Elder Scrolls games, one does not simply "finish" it. There are mountains of quests and events for the player to find and complete, and you can easily dump hundreds of hours into it. With a growing mod community on Steam and Nexus, players can immerse themselves in one of the greatest adventure RPGs in existance.

review: Love the game, its long story, and replayability make it very interesting, as well as not being even close to linear. My only problems were that its sandbox mechanic is severely lacking, but I'm sure mod makers will make up for it. As well as some seemingly unfinished questlines. ||SPOILER|| Like the College of Winterhold, you should actually be able to learn about the game's definition of magic, and its mechanic through this college. Instead, it may aswell be a small insignificant bunch of side-quests leading up to becoming arch-mage.

review: The way it is with all Bethseda Games: Beautiful world, great setting, short main storyline, interesting side story, many many sidequests, much to see and much to do - the other side of the coin? Bugs - bugs everywhere. Glitchin through objects and gettin stuck - NPC's glitchin around, quests not starting, some quests become stuck and can't be completed, random CTD's and so on - thanks to the Community, there are Unofficial Patches for the game and the DLC's and boy, they are needed - Bestheda, one question - What would you do, without the Community that loves your games? Let me answer that question for you - You would be out of business in 6 months. And for the enhanced game experience, go get yourself a lot of mods. But be careful of the random CTD's.

review: Utterly beautiful graphics, vastly more content than you can shake a hundred sticks at, visceral combat, awesome dragons and absolutely worth playing. However, it's not without some significant flaws. If you're familiar with the magic system from the previous Elder Scrolls games, prepare for disappointment. The range of effects is vastly reduced (there are only three types of Destruction, for instance), and there's no spellmaking. Although you have the awesome ability to cast two spells at once (one from either hand), they completely missed the opportunity to make spell combinations. It all feels generic, dumbed-down and consoley. Though there's a million and thirty side-quests, they're pretty much all identical: go to X dungeon and kill a bunch of identical undead. The thieves' guild quest doesn't actually require you to steal things. People treat you exactly the same when you're level 1 as they do when you're master of all the guilds and wearing a dead dragon on your shoulders. Definitely get it - but be prepared to get a little jaded faster than you might have imagined.

review: A wonderful game and a true testament to the Elder Scrolls Series. Not as big as my beloved Daggerfall or Arena, but complete immersion into the environment is still possible. An easy to use skill system (though I do miss the in-depth ones of old) and a great character generation system make the game easy to play your way. Above all I love the customizability of the game itself, leaving it to the end-user to shape the game as they see fit. A great and immersive set of stories to go through, with DLC expanding it to many hours of enjoyable fun. This is by far one of the greatest games that I have ever played, and continue to play!

review: Skyrim is one of those games you could play constantly for weeks, or even months and it's still fun. Then even after you get bored of it you can return months later, start a new adventure and have just as much fun as last time, if not more. Throw mods on top of it, the game just gets even better. The open world exploration is fantastic and there is always something new to discover, it's truly an adventure game and I recommend it for anyone who likes fantasy games and open world games.

review: I very first started with a barbaric Nord who weilded 2-handers and dawned heavy armor and completely smashed everything in sight. I next played a Redguard Conjuration Mage Thief who dual wielded conjured weapons. And now I'm an Orc Werewolf Archer who is really good at pick pocketing. There is really no end to the amount of customization this game gives you. The player has complete and full control of who and what they want their character to be. I've played through this game so many times (originally had it for 360) and I STILL find all new areas to explore. I've never had so much fun with a game. 10/10 for a game after 3 years since it's release and still holds my attention for long periods of time.

review: This game can be very..very..very..long if your OCD for sidequests like I am..(i dont even know if i have the main story in my quests) and worried about walking into the infinate looping sidequests. The game has a few bugs in but its nothing game breaking, its enjoyable to RPG fans and obviously to elder scrolls fans. The 1st dragon kill can be very satisifiying but after like 10 of them it just feels like a normal enemy since the random spawn is so common.

review: 3 and a half years after its release, Skyrim is still more captivating than any RPG I've ever played. The modding community is dedicated, quirky, and practical. The game is very much tailored by personal experience and values, not only in the selection of guilds, but in the character development as well. You will find yourself debating whether or not to let a man live based upon the actions of his peers, be they bandits, Thalmor, Stormcloaks, Imperials, etc. The social dynamics of the game are often overlooked in favor of the graphic quality, questlines, and combat, but it is the dialogues and familial nature of Skyrim that has truly made this an excellent experience- one I'd say every game enthusiast ought to appreciate. 10/10.

review: Skyrim is the open world RPG game. It is the fifth installment in The Elder Scrolls series developed by Bethseda Softworks. You play as the Dragonborn destined to save Skyrim as well as the world of Nirn from annihilation from an evil in the form of an ancient dragon named Alduin. You travel across the province of Skyrim progressing in power, engaging in side quests, joining guilds or picking a side in the civil war that rages the land. Your character is very customizable through the many classes and races. The main story is rather short but makes up for it through the myriad side quests. But most of the game, you spend exploring the unfathomably vast landscape. The combat system is rather stiff but weapons are very diverse due to enchantments. The skill tree is nice allowing you to customize your character in specific skills from the points you gain when leveling up. The graphics of the game are quite stunning for its time and Jeremy Soule has created a masterpiece to your ears which fits the tone of the game. The game has a realistic feel through the lore and the environment. Bethseda took the time and made books adding to the realism. Everything seems to fit and comprehendable lorewise. The replay value of the game is increase due to the fantastic community. You can add mod from the Steam Workshop as well as the Skyrim Nexus adding to the fun of the game. Bethseda has released 3 DLCs where can expand on the story through vampires and the first Dragonborn as well as making your own family. This game is simply breathtaking and one of the best if not the best RPG I have experienced. Rating: 98/100

I've fought the war twice and not one side is better. I'm the hero of Skyrim; everyone's in my debt - But if I kill a chicken, they'll all want me dead.

review: OH what a game!!! So many choices, so many things to do. Follow the quest, run off on sidequests, or just wander aimlessly to your heart's content... It's all in there. Focus on magic, be the best mage you can be: favor destroying stuff, become a Destructionist mage and burn, freeze, zap everything in your way. Like to protect yourself, specialize in the Alteration school. There are other schools as well; something for everyone. Or, just do a little bit of everything. Doesn't matter, you can tailor your playthrough to the way you want to play it. Fancy yourself a sneaky type? Focus on stealth, put everything in powerful daggers and level up backstabbing, and nothing will stand in your way. Want to snipe enemies from the shadows? Just start putting experience into bows and enchanting and take down targets' health, stamina, or magicka level from a distance so that one or two hits from your dagger or sword will make short work of them. Find or craft you a soul-trapping weapon and you can gather an infinite supply of souls to recharge your magical bows or melee weapons to keep doing massive amounts of damage. Burly warrior or wily agile fighter... you pick. The sky's the limit as you can basically do anything or be anything you want to be. Spend hours, days, months even, just exploring. Make a career out of hunting wild animals and gathering their pelts to sell for money so you can afford your own place, so you can even get married and adopt some kids. Just wander, if you want, as there are thousands of places (towns, villages, lone cottages, caves, mines, and mills) to enjoy, interact with, take on a job just about any place. I don't see how this game could get any better or do it better so that you can enjoy playing it your way... Oh wait, there are literally thousands of mods that do just that: from hundreds of new weapons, armor types, loot, potions, poisons, capes...it's just endless. And then there are all the mods for improving the low-quality objects found in the vanilla game, texture enhancements, gameplay enhancements, crafting overhauls, hundreds of new followers, creature types... it's just incredible what you can do. I don't see how anyone could NOT like this game. It's phenomenal.

review: Has to be one of my favorite RPG due to the fact its so open. Mods available nowadays are nice also. Runs pretty well on my old Core2 Duo 3Ghz and GTX 275 also. My friend gives me a hard time because I have finished so little of the main quest. But all the side quests and radiant quests feel like real game content instead of just filler material. There are endless things to do.

review: Skyrim Is probably the most Beautiful Elder Scrolls games ever, and one of the best games ever. The map is fun to explore with many different characters to fall in love with. Its one of the only games I enjoy levelling up my Miscellanious skills (Blacksmithing speech etc.) You Are not a gamer if you never played a tleast one of the Elder scrolls games , so If you haven't, Skyrim is the place to Start. Although, not even a year after buying the game I found that I was heavily relying on different mods and DLC. The story is basically the same no matter what and even though there are some small choices, there isn't a lot for an RPG. The choices all lead to the same out come (just some different dialogue).

review: This is hands down one of the greatest RPG's of all time..... The Elder Scrolls V has proven to still be one of the finest pieces of art Bethesda has published and is still proven to be a masterpeice nearly two years on. Whether you quest for weapons, armour or just seek adventure this game has it all. In terms of gameplay, while the combat may be seen in some eyes as 'crap', there are many mods available on the workshop to tweak your game to perfection. The PC edition runs much quicker than PS3/XBOX and is greatly obtimised. Loading times are minimal and even old computers can run this game fine which is incredible considering the sheer magnitude of the game. Sadly this game is only singleplayer but don't let that get to you. Talking about it with your friends is just as good :) You will never get bored with the simply hundereds of quests to complete. Perhaps you can make personal quests for finding mighty armour or slaying some annoying beasts. Maybe you just want to use a dragon shout to knock a giant off a cliff. Anything is possible. This game has proven to be in my top 3 favourite games ever made (which is saying something. I have A LOT of games). The game is cheaper than ever on steam and has such an amazing community helping out by making and testing mods, giving feedback ect. This game certainly is playable without mods (you are not obliged :D) however, there is something in the workshop for everyone. James Wood-Dedicated Nord with a big sword.

review: A masterpiece from the XX century: great graphics and music, huge map and variety of quests, interesting storyline and a big amount of weapons, armor, potions, enchantments, etc. Almost the same game style as Fallout 3 (being that it was made by the same company), but instead of guns, we have medieval weapons: swords, knifes, axes, bows, even a big amount of magic spells. The level up system works not just by killing people and creatures, but by performing different actions, such as sneak by, selling stuff, archery, different magic schools, theft, alchemy and more. Even though the game looks like a FPS, I think it's a fair game when it comes to battles and it has the posibility to change camera views. What it makes it unique from the other sequels is that the main enemies are dragons which you have to fight and defeat throughout the game. A fully recommended game which takes quite a lot hours to be beat and another amazing game from Bethesda Softworks.

review: The closest thing we have to a fully fledged duck simulator! Embark on the most vivid 300x300 reseloution treasure hunt you could ever imagine! Perfect for gamers who never want to lose , Skyrim offers a vast land of snow for you to have snowball fights with dragons and other foes! And for you sneaky fellows out there, Skyrim sneak realism is incredible, you will be able to live out all your dreams of being completley invisible! Boasts a gigantic cast of 3 voice actors, guiding you through this incredible tale of god versus the little lizards trying to end the world. Skyrim also takes the cake for the most snow in a video game ever! FIlled with rediculously fun quests and activities that make you say "What a terrefic game, it is not easy at all and very rewarding , also i think the sneak system is very balanced and realistic and not op, oh and the winged salamanders are challenging with fun mechanics" The vast arsenal of weapons and tools provided for the player is almost on par with bad rats, simply incredible. In conclusion IGN rated this game a 9.5/10, but i think they are wrong this game deserves a solid 10/10 and should be in every household, it has achevied classic status nearly instantly with its griping sneak mechanics , incredible stealth and flawless sneak mechanics making it the game of the year for every year. P.S The best part about the game is the fact that the blonde haired blue eyed people are incredibly racist, and sneak

review: The Zelda Chronicles V: Skyman is a pretty decent game. Link finally trades in that dopey green hat and "master" sword for some sweet armor and a horse that totally doesn't need a million carrots to run. Zelda has gotten herself trapped inside some mythical Triforce dragon called "Al'duin" who has summoned his wyvern army with the help of Gannon to take over the mythical land of Skyman. Things of note missing from this latest Zelda game are: 1) The iconic chest opening noise 2) Fairy jars and 3) Rupee coinpurse purchases The balancing issues with eliminating the need for buying a bigger coinpurse presented much more of a challenge than the developers could handle. I could purchase the bow relatively quickly in my first playthrough; during the second, through a glitch of some sort, I was able to pick one up from a defeated enemy. Come on Zelda, have you ever worked like that? I didn't understand why this game was called Skyman until I encountered the Giant enemy. Upon my defeat he launched me 1,000,000 into the air. I guess that's why they call it Skyman. 8/10 best Zelda since the one with the Windy Time Fish and the Dreamlands of Not-Zelda.

review: This is the best game that I've played yet. It takes you back to medieval times, when people fight using swords and not guns. The main story is about dragons who got resurrected and they want to conquer Skyrim. Many people asked "Can you beat this game?" You can't. Only the main story takes 1-2 weeks to complete, and there're TONS of side quests available. This game too can be dangerously addictive. The soundtrack is amazing, the graphics are great and even low end PC's can play the game. If you're bored, try installing mods. It will cure your boredom and there are plenty of awesome & crazy mods out there. I would really recommend it, 10/10!

Once you complete most of the game, you can literally download an entirely new game for free on the Workshop. This is a fantastic deal for an awesome game.

Skyrim still has over 50k different players a day on steam. That is probably highest number of singleplayer game played at this very moment. Unbeaten for 2 years straight no other single player game from 2006+ can compare, noone will prove me wrong, especially not Bio-Finished it in 10 hours and uninstalled-shock Infinite which couldn't even beat Skyrim on release day.

review: Hi everyone! Please check out my profile for more reviews! This was clearly a massive breakthrough for Bethesda and the begginings for the Elder Scrolls series. This is the RPG that finally took open world fun over the top. Clearly, I am very happy with this game, which is quite rare for me. The first person gameplay again freakin' dragons really make the gameplay intense. The graphics are fantastic. Also, there is a free DLC available for better graphics and textures. It truly sets a great speed for the memory it takes up. Really, that is one of the only things I have to say about this game that I dislike. The memory space for it, especially if you download the DLC's, is kind of nasty. But if you have a computer that's built for gaming (like mine) then I'm sure we can handle a couple seconds of bad RAM. Refering to the earlier comments on the DLC, they have four of them (including the free bit). The majority of the DLC's only affect the gameplay, enemies, and spells that you can use. It's very suprising that this game is twenty bucks. I received it on a sale for five dollars! My brother had been showing me the gameplay on his Xbox (the first Xbox game I played) and got me hooked onto the serious in which I played the second and fourth (and obviously fifth) games of the Elder Scrolls series. I was super excited when I played it for the first time. Note, please, that I was young at the time, and never really had any magnificent experiences on video games. At the time, the only really big systems were the Gamecube, Wii, and DS (Was I a big fan of Nintendo? Yes). So you couldn't imagine my excitement when I purchased it for such a low price. Be thankful that this game is sometimes lower than five bucks, and they have sales for it quite often. The Workshop is quite fun. You have alot of crap you can do and some overpowered deeds you can commit to. Of course, as we all know, when you play a game, the last thing you want to do is die quickly. In this case, at the beggining, you have collected some stuff that you can use to your advantage from the original Elder Scrolls, like the destruction, healing, and other useful things. The spawns amoung the forests and mountains are very well done.

review: One of the best role-playing games I have ever played. Following the footsteps of the previous Elder Scrolls and improving in most aspects of the series, Skyrim has everything you want on a role-playing game. From exploring the world and killing dragons to creating your own house and cooking, the game rarely gets boring as you have a lot to do. Ridiculous amount of quests, gear, cities, landmarks, character builds make the game very enjoyable to play more than once.

review: One of the rare sequels that manages to live up to its title and it goes way beyond that. You have to see it in order to believe it: massive open world, tons of things to do, magic, politics, bandits, monsters, dragons you name it. On the other hand you have the Creation Kit and a friendly modding community. There is no doubt in my mind that The Elder Scrolls Skyrim is one of the best games ever created.

review: This game redefines masterpiece. I keep typing and backspacing because I am at a loss for words, because trying to describe this game makes me think about how amazing this game is, and I can't think of what to say. Yep. It's the game of my dreams. The ultimate roleplay experience. Pretty much everything I could wish for in a game. Never a roleplaying game so very long-lasting. Whether you play as a badass, or a simple person existing in the world... you'll still feel awesome. Replayability value is extreeeeeeeemely high. Never a game so beautiful and IMMERSIVE in every way possible too. I always turn the volume way up. I cried even on the main menu because it was so amazing and the music and the awesome. There is not a more amazing game series than the Elder Scrolls. I have played the first four TES games, and this game just sent my fanboy heart and turned it into a Viking.

review: Well I have only spent a few hours on the game ok ok a little over 200 hours ! I really should not have to say anything more than that but this such a fanastic game I have to share. This game is all about role playing if you enjoy being immersed within a game you will love this game. Once you play the core story line hell there is many core storylines to the game but once you have got into them your can use the workshop to add even more. Not that it is needed but I believe this is a fantastic way to build a game just for you. In the game you can do the following : Adopt Children Get Married Ride Horses Ride Dragons change the way look throughout the game. Change gender Go on quest Indulge your OCD (There is even homes that are mods perfect for this) Make potions Make armour Enchant Items ......Well to be honest I could be here all day telling you what is available for 10 which you can buy it for less in the sale I have had way ove 300 hours play time since I also played it on another account before this one. Where can you get value for money like that elsewhere. And not only that the workshop then provides you with so much more free just download it and that is so easy to do. Find a mod you like subscribe to it in the workshop and then just make sure it loads before you hit play for the 2nd time. I can't make you buy the game I just know once you have you will not be sorry on doing so. Before buying this game I played World of Warcraft for some 3 years plus since getting this I have let my subscription slide not needing it, So what it would cost me for one months play I have had many months of play and really enjoyed myself doing so. If after all my ranting you are still on the fence if you want this game wait till the sales cheapskate ...... lol For 10 you really will not get so much within a game that you do with skyrim in fact I waited for the sales and got all the DLC also for very little too although with all the mods out you can add new DLC free every week some mods do however require you to have already got the official content also to work within your game so always read the information given with each mod. Happy Gaming in Skyrim Just a note I thought about after you can also wait for DLC to be on sale think I got both for about 6 or even less so even that is worth it for an extra 30 or so hours of play or more to be honest if you want to do all quest in that area. Again Happy Gaming x

review: Like any other game that allows you to put in cheats, an mods. It's a great game for the sole reason of that. I'd recommend buying it. Though recommendations for games like these "Mainstream" Aren't very neccesarily due to the wide variety of gameplay videos created on youtube.

Leveling and combat system for example is fix to many players comfort. Graphics are beautiful and have no limits if you have it on pc. To sum it all up, I highly recommend this piece of art.

review: One of the best RPG's i've played. Even though I owned this game on my xbox I brought it again on Steam and can happily say it was a good decision. I own the Hearthfire and Dragonborn DLC at the moment and have over 200 hours in this game after completing it on xbox as well. If you're willing to mod you can add so much more to the game which is especially useful if you're looking to add more hours of gameplay in if you get bored after a while. Great game overall.

review: After escaping Helgen, I could've just walked straigh to riverden or whatever the hell it's called. Instead, I turned left and took the long way around. I killed 3 bandits, met a fairly attractive woman and talked with her about her ways of life, walked over a mountain, killed some wolves, killed and raided a bunch of bandits guarding a fort, met some of my fellow cat-people, had some good talks with the guards of whtierun, rode a horse back over a mountain, saw a Beowulf reference, killed my horse unintentionally (damned cliffs) and met some traders at that river-place. I'd give it a 12/10. P.S. I my character name is Master Shifu since he bears a great resemblence to him.

review: Although I have few hours on my PC, I have well over 1,200 hours on my PS3 playing this game and I can tell you, PC is better in every aspect. This game never ends, as soon as you think "I wonder if there's a mod for..." There is. You can go install mods that add new followers to ones that allow you to open your own market stall, to be tended by said followers. You can slay dragons, conquer dungeons, and best of all, get smashed. If you're on the borderline about getting this game, get the Legendary Edition. Hearthfire really allows you to immerse yourself in the game, while Dawnguard and Dragonborn provide more challenges than the average missions. 10/10

review: Totally blew away my initial expectations, and has everything Oblivion had and more. The story of this game definitely lives up to the Elder Scrolls series, throwing you into the middle of a country on the brink of war between the empire loyalists and the stormcloaks. While this is going on, an ancient prophecy begins to unfold as well, marking the return of dragons in Skyrim. I have to say this storyline was incredibly engaging and satisfying to me, especially since you have the ability to choose a side in the war and follow that path through to the end. The soundtrack of this game is still very good, although I still prefer the music from Oblivion more. As far as things to do, there is so much to do in this game it is insane. There are hundreds of hours of gameplay to be found in activities and questlines in a single playthrough alone, and the game even warrents multiple playthroughs due to the heavy level of customization present in character creation and skill trees. I myself had more than one playthrough of this game doing different types of characters, some more satisfying than others. This is easily one of the greatest RPG's of the year, if not of all time to date.

review: People tell me to enjoy life you have to stop and smell the flowers. Well, people, its kind of hard to do that when even the flowers are spurting consumerism all over your face in a strangely suggestive manner. The hype surrounding the release of Skyrim was the truest example of this and I dont think Ive ever seen so many nerds swoon at one time. The game will see you as a prisoner again (these guards really have to stop arresting the worlds greatest heroes) when youre freed by a reptilian anger management escapee; a story for the ages for sure. Finally, after choosing to follow your death penalty chum or the man that nearly turned you into the next Eugene Armstrong, you are let loose upon the unsuspecting land of Skyrim. At this point youre left to your own devices and by all means you can follow the ever present arrow to the following plot point or you can jog off, find a shop, put a cooking pot on the shopkeepers head and steal all his goods assuming you play the PC version, if not you can suck on my dragon bone. However, there are situations the game randomly drops you in. I fondly look upon the time I killed a blacksmith and received money from her will even though that was the first time I met her. Of course then her boyfriend caught on and hired mercenaries to kill me, but ended up killing an innocent bystander, who I then also received money from, suckers! I bet youre expecting an ending statement here, but Im afraid the reptile had an aneurism and burned it up. By the way, I know you'll get the nude and killable children mods.

review: Probably my least favorite TES that I have played, though that doesn't mean its horrible, it has a lot of copy and pasted content (Castles, Crypts, Caves). For a 3D game it still focuses more on stats then skill which is a bit of a problem but mods like Duel or Ace can fix combat and the AI performance to make it a little more fun and bearable. There is a lot to do in this game though its a lot of the same thing over and over again, it has a few stand out quests/dungeons and has a fun and intriguing main storyline though the civil war campaign is garbage and most of the things in the game get very repetative. The puzzles in this game are incredibly easy (and the same over and over again much like the combat and stealth). - AI - The AI in the game aren't very good when it comes to combat (or common sense for that matter). A lot of the AI have cool personalities and some of them even have very unique backgrounds. As I said earlier mods like Duel, Ace can improve AI combat performance. - Stealth - The stealth system is almost completely stat based, it requires at low levels you will be detected fairly easily but after leveling up your stealth (perks or not) you become almost impossible to detect. - Combat - As I implied earlier the combat in this game is very generic and easy. Fighting as a warrior all you have to do is kite, attacking then running back over and over. Fighting as an archer (stealth or not) is just about draining as many arrows as you can in them before they get close to you. It is hard to miss as an archer because of the crosshair (which you can disable) (<-- I did) but at very distant ranges it can become a bit challenging. Mages in this game are bad and boring to put it simply, they don't do much damage until they are very high levels and even then you feel more like a glass rifle then a glass cannon. - Wrap-up - This game feels like it is just trying to make dumb people feel like badasses rather then challenging the players in any way (I feel Morrowind made players think and put effort forth to figure things out a majority of the time). The game is good for one vanilla playthrough since the stupid level up system they put in this game enables you to not have to choose a playstyle and stick with it (the game does that a lot in different ways giving you many chances to back out of a choice after you learned the consequences). The level up system makes replaying the game practically pointless (if you are looking to have different playthrough experiences) since there are almost no choices in the game that have any real impact on anything. 6/10 as a standalone game. 5/10 as a TES game. 1/10 required intelligence level (MOST OF THE THINGS I SAID THAT WERE WRONG WITH THIS GAME CAN BE IMPROVED WITH MODS THOUGH THAT SHOULD NOT BE AN EXCUSE TO SAY THE GAME IS GOOD. MY RATING IS BASED OFF OF THE VANILLA GAME EXPERIENCE.)

(Even though i advise you to play without mods first and then mod the **** out of it) New armours, weapons, awesome questlines made by awesome people, even if you play Vanilla, if you didn't play it before, BUY IT! What are you waiting for! i bought it on sales and it was the best decision i've ever made after dipping fries in ice cream. Great replayablity , Beautiful Graphics (That can be even more beautiful with mods (a bit like makeup! ) ), Amazing Gameplay and storyline.

review: Really nice open world RPG with gorgeous nordic landscapes. The biggest downside is that quests and the charracters are a bit "flat". I wish I would care when I kill some random farmer in the world, so I guess the immersion is lacking here. But you get distracted enough by other things that you kind of forget it. If you've played past Elder Scrolls game, expect the same experience, for some people it's good, for other it isn't. Most important thing : Mod it, mod it, mod it. This game is day and night with mods and it fixes a ton of issues Bethesda did not care to fix.

Got legendary on pc, testing the limits of modding and console commands is really making this more exciting than the last 2 play-throughs. Especially finding the room that has 1 of everything that you can console command coc to, I've done all these f'n quests before, it's great to be able to just go grab all the game's keys and super special items so you can just enjoy your play-through without trivial bs. Also, thomas the truck.  yeah. Oh, one more thing, it looked good on 360. it looked great on ps3. It loads a billion times faster and plays WAY smoother on PC. Got my ps3 controller wirelessly hooked up with motionjoy and this is the best skyrim experience I've ever had.

review: Skyrim is one of those games that have a very poor storyline the truth is that it takes only about an hours to finish skyrim main storyline. And if you play for good storyline dont buy skyrim get a different game. Skyrim is that kind of game where every dungeon will look the same each side quest will be generic and similar, however what makes skyrim a game I will recommend to others is the ability to do what you want as a player. Skyrim allows you to freeroam in a huge open world, as well as ability to mod the game. Modding this game is what it means to play skyrim download 30+ mods and explore endless possibilities. If you like to mess around with games and you wouldnt mind to spend few minutes to understand how to add mods to your game then pick skyrim because I could play this game for days with no sleep as long as I find a good pack of mods. However without the mods this game can only keep one interested for 10hours or so.

review: Skyrim is no doubt one of the best games I have ever played. I got hooked once I got into the game. It'll take you up to a dozen hours just to fully explore and get to know the world of Skyrim. Despite the few bug and glitches, I have spent up to 100 hours on this game and absoutley loved it. The graphics are absoutely stunning and the vast amount of variety in this game is amazing. Combat and character progression are just one side of the game. Traveling the world and completing quests is the other, and this is the heart and soul of Skyrim. The world is a snow-covered land full of mountains, rivers, waterfalls, tiny villages, deep caves, and huge cities. While there might not be a lot of diversity in the look of outdoor areas, the environments and views are still breathtaking. Players could spend hours just wandering around the vast terrain and still not find everything, as there are lot of hidden locations and treasures. Simply veering off the beaten path to explore some mysterious ruins might open up a whole new quest line. Thankfully, it is easy to get around in Skyrim, as fast-travel is still available along with horses to ride and carriages that move between all of the major cities in the game. The main quest of Skyrim is woven so seamlessly into the overall world that it is almost indistinguishable. Players take on the role of a Dragonborn, one prophesied to return to the land at a time when dragons are returning in order to stand against them. While there are not a lot of gut-wrenching, role-playing decisions to be made, the experience of simply visiting all the locations and meeting those who live within it is more than adequate. Regardless of the choices that are made, NPCs rarely respond to the main character any differently, so unless players go on a killing spree, no one takes notice. The atmosphere and setting of Skyrim is fantastic. The graphical process at work here is impressive, but the new game engine's impact mostly shows in the world at large, as its characters are still fairly expressionless. That aside, the graphical detail for even those dead-faced characters looks considerably better than any prior Bethesda offering and is all the better for it. Despite taking place in a rugged snowy area, locations are highly detailed and do an amazing job of really shaping the world into what one would expect from an area like this. The game's soundtrack further adds to this atmosphere, as music fades in and out to complement the presence or absence of dramatic moments. The visuals, music, and high-quality voice acting all add up to a very immersive experience. Side note : HAGRAVENS SCARE THE S H I T OUTTA ME .

review: First, let me start off by saying that I have 750+ hours on this game. I started on my Xbox 360 long ago, bought it on steam once I joined the glorious PC master race, and migrated my saves with a flash drive. And then I said, "Screw that", and started all over again. Anyway, let's get into this incredible game I wasted so many hours of my life on. GRAPHICS: It all depends on your specs, and if you mod it. -Low Resolution, no mods: It's essentially a large N64 game, polygons EVERYWHERE. -Med Resolution, no mods: Looks very good, water and shadows are rought, and large models may repeat patterns, but still looks great. -High Resolution, no mods: Probably the most beautiful game you'll ever see, if you have the capabilities to run it. Everything looks great, the water, shadows, trees, even that angry Nord hitting you in the face with a battleaxe. -High Resolution, with mods: Naked people,  arrows, and bondage slaves everywhere. Be careful with skyrim mods, with resolution packs, the game looks incredibly lifelike, but theres some... strange ones out there (MLP: Friendship is Murder Mod Pack) -Graphics: 10/10 (It all depends on your specs) Story: The great thing about Skyrim is that, while the main quest is short, and fairly easy to complete, theres an INSANE amount of quests and alternate storylines! It goes from delivering a sword literally 100 feet away from where you're standing, to stopping a midget symbolic representation from getting beaten up by a normal sized symbolic representation, to waking up after getting black-out drunk with a god and fondling a religious statue, to SO MUCH MORE. And with all the radiant quests and random encounters, you'll never finish it all. Storyline/Quests: 9/10 (A lot of them repeat) AI/NPCs: Whoo, boy. This is where Skyrim (And really almost all Bethesda/Zenimax games) meet some kind of downfall. Updates have fixed them a lot since the release, but many, MANY times has a follower died because they walked straight into my own spell/sword swing, or repeated the same line over and over, or got stuck. Recently, it's been much better, but its still not very good. The characters themselves, however, are all very good. They all have backstories, and motives, and are all unique. AI/NPCS: 7.5/10 Lore: Theres hundreds of books, and character dialogue, and quests all to tell you the story of Tamriel and individual characters. The tiniest things have their own mention. Even if you've never played a single Elder Scrolls game before this, you'll pick it up easily. But, that being said, it can be overwhelming when you first start, and everything revolves around past lore. Lore: 9/10 Overview: Pros: -Great graphics -Good combat system -Skill trees let you become whatever you want -Story is incredible -Nearly no end to the amount of quests -Easy to mod, and a massive modding community -Hail Sithis Cons: -ING AI -High specs needed to run at full potential -Mods and DLC can be wonky with existing saves -No lollygaggin' Overview: 9/10 What, did someone steal your sweetroll?

review: One of the best modern rpgs. You can really lose yourself in this type of game. Hundreds upon hundreds of hours can be poured into this game. The game is molded to how ever you want to play it. Your skills and weapons are your choice. To reach the maximum flexibility and fun of the game I recommend to pick up the Legendary edition and get modding! You can add quests, new lands, Armour, weapons, creatures, textures and even make yourself a regular joe in skyrim. 10/10

review: Let me just say, BEST dragon, knight, whatever you call this game I have ever played in my life. You start out with awesome graphics, awesome story layout, and just an awesome game experience you have ever played, if you dont like this game, your just a total loser. I'm sorry but this game is currently the best dragon times game I have ever experienced on PC. I suggest this game to people that like dragons,knights, that kind of stuff. Nothing bad about this game, everything is running fine, no bugs or glitches I have had yet.. just an awesome game

review: One of the best Elder scrolls game out, The base game has a great main quest line and if you get bored of that you have 100s+ side quests to do, or you could go around finding little hiddle spots around the map. The dawnguard DLC is fun and gives you alot more side quests with a good main quest line. But the best DLC so far has to be the Dragonborn DLC im still going through doing the black books i mean theres alot of stuff to do so you wont get bored with the plot and say "Omg this sucks why did i even buy it" because i love it. Overall the game is great, plus all the mods you can download really gives the game alot of life and stuff to do. I give this game a perfect 10/10 an amazing game please do buy.

review: Skyrim is an AMAZING game. I've put 109 hours into this masterpiece and do not regret it. The story is a bit short IMO but the side missions and the open world bring you a whole lot of stuff to do. Run up mountains. Enter dungeons / Caves. Ride a horse. Kill a dragon. Buy a house. Get married. etc. And btw, 10/10 for using consolecommands and changing my name into Jesus and flying up to the skies. EDIT: Played a bit of Skyrim last night, went on a horse. And had the power to fly...Incredible 11/10

review: Played through on 360, beat regular skyrim. Playthrough 2 on ps3, dabbled in legendary, long way to go before complete. Got legendary on pc, testing the limits of modding and console commands is really making this more exciting than the last 2 play-throughs. Especially finding the room that has 1 of everything that you can console command coc to, I've done all these f'n quests before, it's great to be able to just go grab all the game's keys and super special items so you can just enjoy your play-through without trivial bs. Also, thomas the truck.  yeah. Oh, one more thing, it looked good on 360. it looked great on ps3. It loads a billion times faster and plays WAY smoother on PC. Got my ps3 controller wirelessly hooked up with motionjoy and this is the best skyrim experience I've ever had.

review: An amazing Medieval adventure/RPG. I have never played an Elder Scrolls game before this one but I had played Fallout so I made assumptions they were similar. To an extent they are but there are some major differences (Other than the technology difference). I loved fallout and I love this game too. It involves adventure over a massive world exploring towns, killing dragons, stealling from people, assassinating people - It's got everything! The game is similar to fallout in the way they are both Published by Bethesda and are both RPGs. Skyrim is pretty much your typical RPG with one extremely important difference (IMO), The level system. Enemies don't have levels, nor do quests so you don't have to grind for 8 hours trying to reach level 16 so you can do this quest which gives you a reward that is for level 14s and useless to you. Skyrim and fallout both have a system in which levels give you better perks but don't matter in terms of progression, which IMO is what makes these games the best RPGs. I could go on for ages but if you're too lazy to read that at least read this... Goog game, great RPG/Adventure, you can kill a dragon... 9/10

review: This game ruined every other fantasy rpg game for me. It has done every single thing so right (with mods even more so) that every other rpg game feels boring or badly done (Though not including mmorpgs, it's a whole different story).

review: Definately one of the most fantastic games i have ever played, I put off buying the PC version for over a year, instead playing the Xbox 360 version every once in a while, i must say, the PC version far surpasses that of the console, what with the upped graphics and mod support, this is a must have for ANY PC gamer. The game in itself is truly amazing, you could play for days and still stumble upon some old crypt that, before then, you had no idea existed. The game is huge, and the vast ammount of user created content availlable is, beyond awe inspiring. Skyrim is a must have - the storyline, world, lore, and everything to do with it is beyond anything seen in any other game ever.

review: Skyrim is the best game I've ever played and anyone who hasn't played it is missing out. There is so much to do and many different approaches you can take in the game. The questlines and individual quests are all fun in different ways, they are hugely varied. There are so many places to explore and the graphics are excellent, not to mention the fantastic music and voice acting. The DLCs are all of a very high standard, providing many more quests, lots more places to explore (even a separarte island), and different items to use, as well as powers. Anyone who likes to roam free in a game and take whatever approach they want in an incredible world should definitely get this game.

review: People tell me to enjoy life you have to stop and smell the flowers. Well, people, its kind of hard to do that when even the flowers are spurting consumerism all over your face in a strangely suggestive manner. The hype surrounding the release of Skyrim was the truest example of this and I dont think Ive ever seen so many nerds swoon at one time. The game will see you as a prisoner again (these guards really have to stop arresting the worlds greatest heroes) when youre freed by a reptilian anger management escapee; a story for the ages for sure. Finally, after choosing to follow your death penalty chum or the man that nearly turned you into the next Eugene Armstrong, you are let loose upon the unsuspecting land of Skyrim. At this point youre left to your own devices and by all means you can follow the ever present arrow to the following plot point or you can jog off, find a shop, put a cooking pot on the shopkeepers head and steal all his goods assuming you play the PC version, if not you can suck on my dragon bone. However, there are situations the game randomly drops you in. I fondly look upon the time I killed a blacksmith and received money from her will even though that was the first time I met her. Of course then her boyfriend caught on and hired mercenaries to kill me, but ended up killing an innocent bystander, who I then also received money from, suckers! I bet youre expecting an ending statement here, but Im afraid the reptile had an aneurism and burned it up. By the way, I know you'll get the nude and killable children mods.

review: I've been playing for over a month now and the game never ceases to amaze me. You can lose yourself in the world and become a part of it. There's not just one story, there are hundreds. Sure there's one driving story, but all stories together make for fantastic adventures. I'm around 90 hours in and I think I've only just grazed the surface of this epic tale. There are times where I just sat back at looked at a vista and how the sun cast shadows. If you have heart, you'll want this game. If you don't, don't worry. The game has more than enough heart for you.

review: Perhaps one of the most amazing games I've ever played in my life. As a lover of the sword n' shield era, I always find myself jumping head-first into Bethseda's Elder Scrolls series. The story is immense but it doesn't rush you; This game demands that you explore every crevice it has to offer. The creation-workshop mechanic is very well made, you could literally be anything, fight anything and nearly have no limits; But challenging as it should be. An extrordinary piece of work that you should not miss out on!

Just like in Oblvion or even Fallout 3/New Vegas. Perfect game! I always enjoy this game and it is so hard to find things that is bad about this game! There are a few bugs, of course, what game doesn't have bugs. The Legendary Edition contains all of the DLC that is totally worth it! None of the DLC is bad at all! Good job Bethesda :)

review: Set approximately 200 years after events which transpired in Oblivion, Skyrim invites you into a journey filled with adventure, battle, and destiny. Continuing to build upon the expansive lore and history etched by the saga, and the "open world" sandbox premise of the previous games, right away you are struck with the huge realization that you can do what you want, when you want, and how you want! Fancy being a mighty sword wielding warrior, a deadly, stealthy assassin, a mage who has mastered the arcane arts, or a combination of all? Skyrim makes this possible. Though not without flaws (bugs), the depth and scale of this game coupled with the interactive gameplay, compelling stories and quests create an enjoyable gaming experience. With beautiful graphics, stunning soundtrack, and immersive feel, Skyrim is definitely a gaming journey of epic proportions!

review: In my opinion this is the best game of all time. Amazing graphics, amazing story, amazing sountrack, amazing everything. I have around 800 hours on the xbox 360 version and I still want to invest time into the pc version since there is now awesome mods that increase graphics, gameplay and even the story. The open world is fun to explore but after a while it does tend to feel a little tiresome when walking for a long period of time. But thankfully there is a fast travel system that speeds up the process. You also stumble apon unscipted avents when roaming the open world such as dragon attacks and bandits. There is also AI that you meet when traveling the roads of skyrim like guard patrols and traders. This is a game you must play.

review: This is the game the never, ever ends. I picked this game up thinking I wouldn't like it having never played a previous TES game before. Sat in my Library untouched for about a month or two, and finally took the plunge. I was wrong. I was so very, very wrong. This is probably the best purchase I've ever made on steam. Add in the unlimited potential of modding, and it's an adventure that continues forever. I've probably restarted over a hundred times by now with a new character, and still only have beaten Alduin once. ONCE. There's still so much more do to and explore that I'm still discovering quests and areas and little hidden things. I still can't believe how much there is to do and I'm still finding more. At it stands I'll probably wake up one day having lost all touch with reality and actually start seeing the world as Skyrim with how much I've played. And I'm totally ok with that.

review: If I had to choose between this game, and my girlfriend. I'd pick this game. EDIT: I'm single now ON A MORE SERIOUS NOTE: This game is the best in its genre. In previous Bethesda games they made a sad balance in between Questing, and Exploration. Some having more quests and less places to go, and others having very few quests and more places to explore. But in Skyrim, there is no shortage of quests, and if you are like myself and just wander around aimlessly, you will stumble into places that just blow your mind. Every time I have replayed this game, I stumbled into something new. For more info i'd very much recommend mods, with mods such as texture packs, difficulty, quests, armor, and weapons, this games replay value is endless. Go through the game once with plain skyrim, then mod the hell out of it. Overall I'd rate this game an EASY 10/10. If you haven't already. Please buy it, give it a little, and I swear you will be hooked.

review: An epic game made all the more epic by the fact that it is so easy to mod and so well supported by the modding community. The Elder Scrolls series has a large following and often you will hear people argue over each new TES game comparing it to the last, but for me each TES game stands on its own merits, and Skyrim is no exception. The story is pretty good and there are plenty of side quests, but what makes Skyrim so great even when not modded is its large and open nature. This is a land you can just pick a direction and with no quest in mind and just explore. You will find danger and excitement on your journey ... and loot. Lots and lots of loot. But once you start modding this game, that is when you unlock the true value that is Skyrim. Potentially thousands more hours content (for free) in a game that can be improved ten thousand different ways from graphics, textures and sounds all the way to game mechanics and user interface changes. You can make the game exactly what you need it to be, and play it for so long you may still be playing when the next game in this series comes out.... and sometimes longer than even that. If you are interested in modding the PC version of the game, be sure to check out my guide for beginners:

review: I was stacking books on a shelf in my house in Whiterun, one of Skyrim's major cities, when I noticed a weapon rack right beside it. I set a sacrificial dagger in one slot, an Orcish mace in the other. They were on display for nobody but me and my computer-controlled housecarl, Lydia, who sat at a table patiently waiting for me to ask her to go questing. The chest upstairs was reserved for excess weapons and armor, the bedside table for smithing ingots and ores, the one next to the Alchemy table for ingredients. I'd meticulously organized my owned virtual property not because I had to, but because tending to the minutia of domestic life is a comforting break from dealing with screaming frost trolls, dragons, a civil war, and job assignments that never seem to go as planned. It's even a sensible thing to do; a seemingly natural component of every day existence in Skyrim, one of the most fully-realized, easily enjoyable, and utterly engrossing role-playing games ever made. Part of what makes it so enjoyable has to do with how legacy Elder Scrolls clutter has been condensed and in some cases eliminated. In Skyrim, there's no more moon-hopping between hilltops with a maxed out Acrobatics skill. That's gone, so is Athletics. The Elder Scrolls V pares down the amount of skills and cuts out attributes like Endurance and Intelligence altogether. There's no time wasted on the character creation screen agonizing over which skills to assign as major. You don't assign major and minor skills at all, but instead pick one of ten races, each with a specific bonus. High Elves can once a day regenerate magicka quickly, Orcs can enter a berserk rage for more effective close-range combat. These abilities are best paired with certain character builds  the High Elf regeneration is useful for a magic user  but don't represent a rigid class choice. Major decisions don't need to be made until you're already out in the world and can try out magic, sneaking and weapon combat, emphasizing first-hand experience over instruction manual study, letting you specialize only when you're ready. It contributes to the thrilling sense of freedom associated with life in Skyrim. Do a quest, kill a dragon, snatch torchbugs from the air, munch on butterfly wings or simply wander while listening to one of the best game soundtracks in recent memory. Despite the enormity of the world and the colossal amount of content contained within, little feels random and useless. Even chewing on a butterfly wing has purpose, as it reveals one of several alchemical parameters later useful in potion making at an alchemy table. Mined ore and scraps of metal from Dwemer ruins can be smelted into ingots and fashioned into armor sets, pelts lifted from slain wildlife can be turned into leather armor sets, and random books plucked from ancient ruins can trigger hidden quest lines that lead to valuable rewards. Skyrim's land mass is absolutely stuffed with content and curiosities, making every step you take, even if it's through what seems like total wilderness, an exciting one, as something unexpected often lies just over the next ridge. Many times the unexpected takes the form of a dragon. Sometimes they're purposefully placed to guard relics, sometimes they swoop over cities and attack at seemingly random times. In the middle of a fight against a camp of bandits a dragon might strike, screaming through the sky and searing foe and friendly alike with frost or flame. Momentarily all on the battlefield unite, directing arrows and magic blasts upward to knock down the creature, creating impromptu moments of camaraderie -- a surprising change from what may have been yet another by-the-numbers bandit camp sweep. Dragons show up often, their presence announced by an ominous flap of broad wings or an otherworldly scream from high above. The scale and startling detail built into each creature's appearance and animations as it circles, stops to attack, circles again and slams to the ground makes encounters thrilling, though their predictable attack patterns lessen the excitement after a few battles. In the long run they're far less irritating than the Oblivion gate equivalent from The Elder Scrolls IV, can be completed in a few minutes, and always offer a useful reward. Killing a dragon yields a soul, which powers Skyrim's new Shout system. These are magical abilities any character can use, you don't have to specialize in spell casting to slow time, throw your voice, change the weather, call in allies, blast out ice and fire, or knock back enemies with a rolling wave of pure force. Even if you favor sword, shield and heavy armor and ignore magic entirely, you'll still be able to take full advantage of these abilities provided you find the proper words  each Shout has three  hidden on Skyrim's high snowy peaks and in the depths of forgotten dungeons, serving as another reason to continue exploring long after you've exhausted the main quest story, joined with the Thieves Guild, fought alongside the Dark Brotherhood, or thrown your support behind one of the factions vying for control of Skyrim. Not only is this land under assault by dragons, long thought to be dead, it's also ripped in two by civil war. You can choose one side or the other, but so much of the allure of Skyrim is how, even outside of the confines of quest lines, the embattled state of the world is evident, and steeped in a rich fictional legacy. Lord of the Rings this is not, but with the release of every Elder Scrolls game, the fiction becomes denser, and the cross-referencing for long-time fans all the more rewarding. Skyrim's residents are all aware of current events. They'll comment on the civil war, some sympathizing with the rebels, others thinking the establishment sold its soul. The peasants complain about the Jarls who control each settlement, the Jarls complain about the rebels or foreign policy, the overprotective College librarian complains when I drop dragon scales all over his floor; many characters feel like whole, distinct personalities instead of vacuous nothings that hand out quests like a downtown greeter hands out flyers for discount jeans. Characters stereotype based on race, they double-cross at even the slightest hint it might be profitable, and they react to your evolving stature within the world. It makes a ridiculous realm, filled with computer-controlled cat people and humanoid reptiles, demon gods and dragons, feel authentic, like a world that existed long before you showed up and will continue to exist long after you leave.

review: great game. 200 hours in and I have finished the theives guild questline, dark brotherhood questline, and the college of winterhold questline, and have close to 50,000 gold. along with the quests, the DLCs are also worth the money. words of wisdom: Dragonborn DLC is not a good idea to purchase before level 40-50. I tried at level 5, kept on dying, tried again at 20, also kept on dying, and once again at level 45 and let me tell you, even then it is still pretty hard. The hearthfire DLC is pretty cool, you get to build a house, adopt kids, move in with your wife etc. The only problem is; be prepared to spend a lot of gold and collect a lot of recources, because you have to build EVERYTHING in your house. I mean EVERYTHING. Unless you want to spend 10,000 gold to have your housecarl (you can move people like lydia into your house) and have them decorate for you. overall, the game is very time consuming, fun, and well put together. 10/10

review: Some tips if you buy this game: 1. Kill the horse and driver that's driving you with the console at the start of the game (restart after sitting there for about 10 minutes). 2. Spawn in 20 bandits on top of a cliff and shout at them. 3. Type in the console "player.placeatme 00064b33 1000" (don't actually do this... unless you want to). 4. NEVER type "caqs" in the console. Just don't. 5. Download mods. A lot of them. 6. I mean it when I say don't type in "caqs" in the console. 7. pls dont type it in. srsly. 8. I ran out of ideas. 9. Just play the game. Welcome to Skyrim on the PC. P.S. Type "caqs" in the console.

review: IMPORTANT: Do yourself a favor and buy the Legendary Version of Skyrim instead. There are a LOT of good mods that require all the DLC's and it would be a shame if you wouldn't be able to use it because you don't have the dlc's. The legendary edition is definitely worth it especially during sales. Alone without mods? It's one of those games that you pick up and enjoy, get tired of, and then never come back to. With mods? All of a sudden, this game has become an easy candidate for the best game of ALL TIME. You will be able to tweak whatever gameplay settings that bothered you from the original game. You can have new buildings/characters/weapons/quests from mods without having to buy DLC. You can change the entire landscape of Skyrim with graphical enhancements. Oblivion and Morrowind simply cannot compare to this game in the mods department. I used a lot of Lord of the Rings Weapons mods, as well as some star wars mods. If you have a good computer, there are lots of graphic overhauls.

review: Stole a sweetroll and everyone wanted to kill me. Tried again when i put a basket on everyone that could see me and nobody noticed anything 10/10 best stealth simulator would steal again Pros: *Lots of quests to do *Good amount of customization of your character *Lots of Skill trees to make your character unique in power *Lockpicking system is great *You can craft lots of different types or armor and weapons and you can sharpen certain weapons. *Vampire dlc adds a new skill tree and transformation *Dawnfire DLC allows you to build a house in a location(certain areas) and adopt children. *Too many pros to list Cons: *Odd glitches most are patched[got my body sent into space when i died by a sword]breaks immersion but usually makes you laugh *Dragons are random and can mess up your missions *Random stuff which dont really have a purpose for example the windmill and wood saw [i think correct me if im wrong] you dont get any items out of it, would have been more immersive and made it have a purpose. Great game overall. 9.5/10

review: Honestly, before I bought this game, I just went around saying it was a piece of junk. I then bought it a couple months ago, back in '13. Love it. It's a great game, perfect for a medieval setting like Mount and Blade: Warband, except it has more fantasy in it, such as magic and the dragons. Either way, I would recommend this. Especially when it's on sale.

Hunt through the ancient ruins of Nords and fight through armies of zombies just to get bored in the end and murder everyone in Windhelm just for the hell of it.

review: It seems long ago now, looking back, when this game was first released. I had played Morrowind, I have played Oblivion, loved both, and I was left eagerly awaiting Skyrim. And I was not disappointed. Bethesda again reminds me of what true quality is. In short, this game is amazing. But more that that, it gives everyone who would give it a chance, everyone that would allow themselves to gently fall into it's landscape, a fantastical escape from the occasional blandness of life. We all need escapes, time away from the coffee and the concrete, and Skyrim provides a window. It's not a replacement for anything, it's merely an avenue to get lost in your own imagination. Those who can't let go, can't dream of fantasy, should avoid Skyrim. For everyone else, I high recommend you give this game a try and give yourself a chance to get lost in its wonder.

It is another world to get lost in and never come out. I have to stop and just take in the sites sometimes. Yes, it has some small problems,,,but I don't even feel like going into them because the game as a whole is so good. If these guys screw around and focus on the money pit the TES online will end up being and ignore thier real cash cow and fan base it will be ashame. Time to come out with TES VI ....don't let the real TES single player fans down!

review: Four years ago, Bethesda made this game and I had never been more hyped for a game ever. Back when I actually enjoyed the majority of the games I played was a time when life was fun. These days I remember Skyrim for all the times I've been screwed over by bugs and glitches that would hinder me in completing quests. But those 200+ hours were not completely wasted, partially but not completely. Also don't buy the dlc unless they are on 99 % sale or something... Considering they cost more than the base game and add maybe 5 hours extra content and a few useless items for gear that is not even better than the crap you farmed for a hundred hours in the vanilla game!!!!!!!"#!#!" 8/10 - Oblivion was better (don't kill chickens)

Best RPG, best open-world, best stealh, best hunting simulator, best waifu simulator, best mod support (Nexus+Mod Organizer) and mod offering (thousands), good graphics, fine controls, big world, never ending quest supply and endless replayability. Skyrim is pretty much what you want it to be. First person? Do it! Third person? Do it! Mouse and keyboard? Go ahead! Controller? Oh yes! Vampire simulator? Live the life of an medieval alchemist? Be an Orc bandit? A rogue Mage? Check! Check! Check and check.. The base game alone provides countless ways of playing and thus earns the rare right to be called an open world and sandbox RPG, with thousands of mods to create a unique experience. Skyrim has no direct competition on the market and that's a sad fact for us gamers. 97/100

review: [warning, this review was originally posted on 12 Aug, 2012 and when done none of the existing DLCs were out, nore most of the mods available for this game atm] Ok so after i think i've done absolutely everything there was to do in teh original game (cos ofc there are a bazillion mods out there). I managed to do every single non radiant quest there is in uesp's Skyrim list, and tried most radiants i could do before getting bored of them. Checked all skills, others maxed by natual game play (Archery) others by cheating (Alchemy omfg). Achievements all done (hellz yeah) And after a really really long time have passed since my last review. There's so much to say about Skyrim and still this feels like a very tinny opinion analysis to what i would feel like writing hehe The time came and I think it's time to say a few words for this game.. Oh and... pardon my crazy grammar.. u gonna have your eyes poped [warning given] :p The following does not include information about specific mods, neither DLC. OK...so... Skyrim; The fifth game in the Elder Scrolls series. A game taking place 200 years after "The Great Anguish" (the war between Daedra and the people of Tamriel). Lets take this in parts as i often love to do in my reviews. Graphics Bethesda did quite a good job with the graphics. The difference is noticable moving from Oblivion to Skyrim. But some times it feels like it's not good enough. My rig is not a really strong one. Core2Duo at 2.13 and a GTS250 the strongest i could find from all the series at that time. I was pretty happy to see that Skyrim was actually runable in pretty high specs. not ultra. But the frame rate was still hanging there after spawning 200 guards and 4 dragons over a vilage letting me sit back and watch the show. So after my experiece and after watching reviews on youtube with tests with a lot better GPUs out there, i have to admit that Bethesda could have done better. It took a noticable number of mods on order to make Skyrim run in HD textures, better lighting and shading, better fire and magic effects, better mapping, better geometries etc. And most of them out right a couple of months after the game was released. Why? Why is a game that comes out near the end of 2011 needs so many mods to have it's graphics perform better just a few months after release while teh game itself took so long to come out? And why is peoples' and animals' hair and fur so.. sticky and not-so-well rendered? Don't get me wrong there. My whinning entrance shall not deceive you about the graphics of the game. The engine is still brilliant. Offers unlimited possibilities. Super vast enironment, very well designed nature and animals. The nature.... God the natire is godlike. I felt like walking through the entire map than fasttraveling. I could stare at the trees, the flowers, the desert, the rivers and the waterfalls. I felt like i could fall in love with the scandinavian culture and the history of teh vikings. I literaly spent hours just staring views and details from all over the places. Also the characters are fascinating. Very realistic face designs. Great animation. The job done is amazing. But just not that perfect. When Morrowind came, graphics seemed centuries ahead from Daggerfall. When Oblivion came, graphics seemed centuries ahead from Morrowind. When Skyrim came.... graphics seemed like 6 years ahead from Oblivion.... just like how it literally was (maybe got too subjective there) Scripting and AI The AI is very good. Some enemies can find cheaky ways to hurt you like using spells from large distances with hit and run tactics. The dialogues are very good, the impact of your decisions won't bring great changes in teh world, but they will influence the average way your character acts and reacts during dialogue and also how people like you and stuff or even how characters from around the map will react at your presence. Can't say there was something really extraordinary. Most things were as expected. Companions are always fun (and even mroe fun with mods). Marriege system was a good idea (but also took some moding to get to be more interesting). Also a word about characters. All NPCs have very natural and realistic actions and reactions furing quests and/or interractions. Also great to see their daily occupations. Each NPC has a routine. Wether if it's a guard or a hunter, a shopkeeper or a fisherman. There's some really great effort put there. Scripting issues will become a matter of daily routine once of start checking out mods. Collisions are some times imminent even while using special tools like Wrye Bash. Quests A bunch of quests. Radiant and non-radiant quests. Stories. Guilds (most of what we've already seen from Oblivion). Chances to help or kill people. Choosing your way through. Gaining special items. Finding rare kickass gear. Getting and house. Doing "jobs". (also completing some nice achievements). Training. Tons of stuff to do. And of cource, a super cool main story to follow. HOWEVER. Quest lines are in average short. You can be easily done with most guilds in a matter of few hours (except the thieves guild if you want that achievement). Where did all the storytelling go? Yes, everything is cool and fine, but sometimes it literally takes half the time to complete a guild's quest line that what it took you to do the same guild's questline in Oblivion. For example, Oblivion's mages guild had me doing quests for days while in Skyrim the mages guild was a matter of a few hours. Even if my memory is bad on this, the feeling of short storylines is strong. the whole feeling about guild quests; Very enjoyable. But kinda short. Bugs Bugs in games. Can't do with them. Can't do without them... Skyrim has enough bug reports from around the communities. But i for once can across a very very few of them during the original game. In particular only 2, during 2 different questlines which i had to overcome by using the console to move the next quest stage after verifying the nature of the bug. I've seen funny stuff about bugs through the net. I guess I was a damn lucky bstd i gotta admit that Music Still missing the awesomeness of some tracks from Morrowing, maybe a few from Oblivion. Skyrim stands alone with its own character. Sure the elder scrolls nature is noticable in most themes. You know, the usual epic music, orchestra styled tunes, some calm nature backround noice. However still Skyrim's tunes is a bit unique. It doesn't connect with TESIII and TESIV. There is this whole viking and gothic(no, not the modern goth thing, im talkign about the ancient middle northern european goth war cultur and nature of things) nothern feeling in everything around the music. A stronger epicness, a war rythm, a sound with a serious and raw character in it. I actually kinda liked that a LOT. Gameplay Absolutely awesome. Little things to say. You just have to play teh game to see for yourself. Dual dual wield in weapons and magic. Some awesome and epic slow motion or cut scenes in battles. Interacting it absolutelly ing e-v-e-r-y-t-h-i-n-g around you. Gazillion of items to use and interact with. From weapons and armor, to flowers and butterflies and bugs (yes, you can even catch and collect butterflies!) Value through time Bethesda may not have given their best for this game, but they know what they are doing. Mods will add years in the game. Skyrim is still an awesome piece of The Elder Scrolls series. However i fear it won't last as long as Oblivion did. A percentage of the fanbase did compain a lot. And you can see that their studios could have put more work on the game while they didn't (maybe because they wanted to work on the future MMORPG title[?]) I personaly fear that the game will be left without many additions. The Elder Scrolls had shaped a "culture" of bringing tones of awesome things v

review: Ive played every single game of the Elder Scrolls Franchise for many hundred hours and Skyrim is no exception here. Although I loved especially Morrowind too, I can honestly say that this is my favourite RPG so far and i can hardly imagine that even an Elder Scrolls VI can kick this from my throne. Skyrim, the part of Tamriel this game is about, is wonderful desined, very large and filled with hundreds of locations and thousands of quests. I have dozens of characters ranging from level 20 to over level 1000, have explored every location and cleared most of the quests many times, but however even after that amount of hours played, when i just stumble through the beautiful wilderness I often find some secret, amazing place, easter egg or just an interesting NPC i`ve never seen before. That gives an example of the amount of passion the developers had when designing this game. While the vanilla game itself will enjoy you for hundreds of hours, the thing that differences Skyrim from the large amount of other good RPGs is the modifiability. There are hundreds of thousands mods out there, nearly every sword and armor ever used in a video game or movie is available here. But then there are greater things like mods that add entire towns with dozens of new quests and stuff to explore. And then there are giant mod projects, like "Skywind", which adds the entire gameworld from "The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind" with all quests, towns, dungeons and NPCs to your Skyrim game. You can also change the entire game concept to what you like to play, I really enjoyed modding skyrim to a Fantasy-Survival-RPG with hunger, thirst, temperature status you must take care of and permadeath on legendary difficulty. The Goal? Simply look how long you`re able to survive and which level you can reach. Very enjoyale! To come to an end here, I can highly recommend this amazing game without any doubt.

review: I would not have recommended this game three years ago. However the mod community, lowered price and *excellent* expansion pack content make Skyrim a must-own, and not for the vanilla experience. I will stand by my opinion that Oblivion was better, especilly in the uniqueness of the quests it offered as opposed to "find x in cave full of draugr", and don't get me started on the BS "but the combat is better in Skyrim" argument since the same bad combat system is just hid behind fancy execution moves. But the expansion pack content is genuinely interesting and through modding I've made my game a hardcore and fast-paced experience that feels not unlike Diablo, (to clarify that's in pure intensity and not literally like a dungeon-crawler). It's disappointing to have to merely say "the mods make this game" but that's the harsh reality in this case. The expansion content however, as I've stated twice already, is high-quality and only emphasises how mediocre the vanilla game is. Edit: Also I would highly recommend playing this game with a controller. The character feels more weighty to me that way, although that could be personal preference - you WILL have trouble playing an archer that way.

The Elder Scroll Skyrim is easy the best game I've ever played, Although I'm not the most hardcore reviewer in the world, It's an excellent game, and you should buy it if you don't have it already. You get an excellent RPG experience with an Open world environment and Hours apon Hours of content, and that's without the DLC or any Mods. Mods is what really makes this game shine. The Modding community on both Nexus and Steam Workshop are both excellent, and Bursting with content for you to enjoy. Like I said before, If you haven't already, Buy this game.

review: A open world game with a world that seems never ending. You will face strong Warriors, Mages, Armys, And of course the most deadly the dragon. with many dungeons to explore vanilla skyrim alone sets itself high above what I initially expected. Placed in a world where two factions clash against one another in wars. (If you choose to do them this game gives you immensive control over decisions) Want to be a mage? Ok. Want to be a Warrior in your armor with a giant sword? Ok. Lets delve farther into this idea of freedom though. Something new and exciting. Want to be a mage wearing heavy armor wielding a sword? Ok. But theres just so much customization you can make your own unique character and it doesn't stop there. If you choose so the skyrim nexus or steam workshop has a extensive library of mods to help you make that special person in your mind. Want a specific looking armor? Want something outragous like exploding arrows? Want a car? For whatever reason you would want one in this game... You can get it with mods! Ending this games rating I would highly recommend. Ive spent countless hours playing it since it first came out and it still brings me much enjoyment. Its honestly worth more then any game ive ever bought so much so that I had to buy the steam version so I could use mods and experiment more with it then the consoles allow. My rating for this game is 10/10 and I would definitely buy again if I had too.

review: Wow, this game took me hours just to finally take seriously. I spent days messing around in the villages of skyrim, killing and stealing. This game makes me feel like I have unlimited options, i'd definetely recommend it! It starts with you as a prisoner but are saved by a dragon attack!!? You can later choose to be the rebels, Stormcloaks, or the Empire. Of course you can also stop the dragons, though. But as sad as it is, it took me hours to start the storyline!

review: I enjoy the open world feel. While usually I am not one for single player games this one actually keeps everything rather fresh and new offering all kinds of things to work on and fight. The quests though can be interesting to try and complete when you do not get detailed directions. I have had to look up some of the quests now and then because the directions given in game were not in depth enough. Regardless though it is a fun game.

review: Skyrim is an open world action/adventure game. You can climb the tallest mountains (to a certain point then you can't go any further up), swim across massive lakes, fight dragons, explore dungeons, kill anyone(some poeple just faint then get back up). Basically you are free to do whatever you want, but what you choose to do affects what will happen. Can you forge armor? Make weapons?? You bet you can! Personally I think it is one of the best games I've ever played! I highly recommend it to anyone and everyone!

review: Stole a sweetroll and everyone wanted to kill me. Tried again when i put a basket on everyone that could see me and nobody noticed anything 10/10 best stealth simulator would steal again Pros: *Lots of quests to do *Good amount of customization of your character *Lots of Skill trees to make your character unique in power *Lockpicking system is great *You can craft lots of different types or armor and weapons and you can sharpen certain weapons. *Vampire dlc adds a new skill tree and transformation *Dawnfire DLC allows you to build a house in a location(certain areas) and adopt children. *Too many pros to list Cons: *Odd glitches most are patched[got my body sent into space when i died by a sword]breaks immersion but usually makes you laugh *Dragons are random and can mess up your missions *Random stuff which dont really have a purpose for example the windmill and wood saw [i think correct me if im wrong] you dont get any items out of it, would have been more immersive and made it have a purpose. Great game overall. 9.5/10

review: Honestly, before I bought this game, I just went around saying it was a piece of junk. I then bought it a couple months ago, back in '13. Love it. It's a great game, perfect for a medieval setting like Mount and Blade: Warband, except it has more fantasy in it, such as magic and the dragons. Either way, I would recommend this. Especially when it's on sale.

review: Wander the open world of Skyrim as you, the Dragonborn, use your awesome magical gift of the ancient language to: Steal cabbages, steal horses, pick pockets, pick locks, and even rob shops at night! Still be the hero as you kill off an entire empire such as the Stormcloaks or the Imperials. Hunt through the ancient ruins of Nords and fight through armies of zombies just to get bored in the end and murder everyone in Windhelm just for the hell of it.

review: Probably my least favorite TES that I have played, though that doesn't mean its horrible, it has a lot of copy and pasted content (Castles, Crypts, Caves). For a 3D game it still focuses more on stats then skill which is a bit of a problem but mods like Duel or Ace can fix combat and the AI performance to make it a little more fun and bearable. There is a lot to do in this game though its a lot of the same thing over and over again, it has a few stand out quests/dungeons and has a fun and intriguing main storyline though the civil war campaign is garbage and most of the things in the game get very repetative. The puzzles in this game are incredibly easy (and the same over and over again much like the combat and stealth). - AI - The AI in the game aren't very good when it comes to combat (or common sense for that matter). A lot of the AI have cool personalities and some of them even have very unique backgrounds. As I said earlier mods like Duel, Ace can improve AI combat performance. - Stealth - The stealth system is almost completely stat based, it requires at low levels you will be detected fairly easily but after leveling up your stealth (perks or not) you become almost impossible to detect. - Combat - As I implied earlier the combat in this game is very generic and easy. Fighting as a warrior all you have to do is kite, attacking then running back over and over. Fighting as an archer (stealth or not) is just about draining as many arrows as you can in them before they get close to you. It is hard to miss as an archer because of the crosshair (which you can disable) (<-- I did) but at very distant ranges it can become a bit challenging. Mages in this game are bad and boring to put it simply, they don't do much damage until they are very high levels and even then you feel more like a glass rifle then a glass cannon. - Wrap-up - This game feels like it is just trying to make dumb people feel like badasses rather then challenging the players in any way (I feel Morrowind made players think and put effort forth to figure things out a majority of the time). The game is good for one vanilla playthrough since the stupid level up system they put in this game enables you to not have to choose a playstyle and stick with it (the game does that a lot in different ways giving you many chances to back out of a choice after you learned the consequences). The level up system makes replaying the game practically pointless (if you are looking to have different playthrough experiences) since there are almost no choices in the game that have any real impact on anything. 6/10 as a standalone game. 5/10 as a TES game. 1/10 required intelligence level (MOST OF THE THINGS I SAID THAT WERE WRONG WITH THIS GAME CAN BE IMPROVED WITH MODS THOUGH THAT SHOULD NOT BE AN EXCUSE TO SAY THE GAME IS GOOD. MY RATING IS BASED OFF OF THE VANILLA GAME EXPERIENCE.)

review: A superb game, with many hours of story, faction and miscellaneous quests. Lots of locations & landmarks to find and explore from ancient dwarven cities, caves outfitted by bandits to ritual sites inhabited by necromancers or simply the local wildlife. With skill trees that you can shape, and an array of weapons and/or spells to use, you can customize your character how you like. Single or dual weapon/magic wielding or even a combination of both further allow you to personalize the playing experience, as well as providing countless setups of hostile & allied NCP alike, All providing different experiences on consecutive playthroughs. The Dawnguard & Dragonborn DLCs are a must have addition to the game, adding new armor, weapons & clothes to the game [even if only to make your character look even more awesome] as well as new locations & enthralling story lines. The only thing I miss from the Oblivion days, is the ability to create my own spells, but as Skyrim as a nation generally dislike magic I can see why it was left out. But ... with the steam workshop this and anything else you just did quite like can be added, changed or removed. New cities, more crowded cities, new quests, greater detailed trees, or a simple as a re-skin for your favourite armor, its all in there, somewhere. But I would urge you to play through without mods at least once. A must get game that I am so glad to have played and even though I have at this point I will probably spent 100s more hours playing. 10/10

Well, with Skyrim you can, Skyrim is a typical Bethesda game, where you get to create your own character using the games many customization features, you'll then be able to play the game however you want in an almost limit less world filled with skeletons, zombies, wizards and other kinds of monsters. Once you've completed the main game you'll be able to add more quests, followers, houses, overhauls, pets, textures, weapons, armor and so much more via some of the many mods that the community creates. Skyrim is an amazing singleplayer RPG, with endless possiblitys because of the amout of mods created by the awesome community.

review: In my mind the game is a masterpiece, the game looks amazing, and is in my mind very well made, as for the storyline, I adore it. There are of course a few minor things in the game, for example the horses, they move very weird and they are quite slow compared to walking. The game itself is a fantastic experience with superb gameplay, beautiful graphics, and majestic music. The fun part is you can get mods installed easily on the game through the workshop on steam, its fun to mod the game with several mods and make it after your own liking. The game over all gets a 9.5 out of 10, as its a superb and amazing game with a fantastic storyline.

review: Skyrim is by far one of my most treasured and favourite games released out there! It's vast/open world gvies you an over-abundance of freedom to do what you please! Skyrim provides a great element of choice as you have the freedom to be who YOU want to be, and some of your choies may influence alternate paths to a story once foretold. You can choose to be the hero, or the villain. You have been bestoed a gift from the gods, in the dragons tounge "Dovakhiin" you have the power of your voice, and by destiny the dragonborn is the only mortal who can slay and rid the world from the awakining of the dragons. As Quoted - "The Empire of Tamriel is on the edge. The High King of Skyrim has been murdered. Alliances form as claims to the throne are made. In the midst of this conflict, a far more dangerous, ancient evil is awakened. Dragons, long lost to the passages of the Elder Scrolls, have returned to Tamriel. The future of Skyrim, even the Empire itself, hangs in the balance as they wait for the prophesized Dragonborn to come; a hero born with the power of The Voice, and the only one who can stand amongst the dragons" - Written by Bethesda Game Studios TracGod's Meta Score - 95/100

review: Skyrim just made Elder Scrolls gold. The game is unbelieveably amazing in every aspect especially when Bethesda made it. The Fallout Series (3, New Vegas) were the games that made the type of gameplay that they put off, hands-down my favorite. Combat in my eyes is very stratigized, Not having to rush to kill the enemy BEFORE your companion does, and not having Vats is great. Example: I had to run and jump off of things so that the enemy, which was way stronger than me, would fall back father behind me so that I can heal and gain some more magika. Also on PC, It blows the Skyrim expericence up to the roof, Its beautiful. Skyrim is where Its at if you want a new, open-world game. 110/100

review: I highly recommend Skyrim. I have played the game for 102 hours now and I have still not completed all the achievments and I wish to play the game for a second time through, the story line is immersive and the scenery is picturesque. The game limitations are endless due to mods, making the game theoritcally impossible to complete. This game was revolutionary and unique, I mean in what other game can you kill a childs parents and then adopt that same child?

review: Ehm so I have to write a report.. Errr, well done.. Whoever made this game? System and gameplay is so much in depth, more when you like something and suddenly you discover it has more "features" if you look deeper. I know it's blah blah blah but that how I found this system xD Storyline is one of the best! 50h isn't enough to finish the story.. Well, not for me specially when you give me RPG to play. Lel. Graphics.. Even though I'm running the game on Ultra with very nice and smooth fps, I had to downloaded the HighTextures and other graphics enhancment mods so I'd enjoy my moment in-game .. Jungle xD This game is sick! I couldn't drop it for a little so i'd finish Persona Q .. Which I just played the first 15min T.T Best of luck lol.

review: If you've played previous Elder Scrolls games, glitches and oddities don't come as a surprise. Nevertheless, Skyrim feature tighter combat, fewer bugs, improved graphics and so on. If there is anything to complain about in this game, it would be the user interface, inventory taking up A LOT of useless items, SOME bad acting, as you level up, the creatures you fight take FOREVER to kill by hitting them 30-40 times, and finally its replayability value. Creating characters is nice (even though it takes a very long time to get what you want done). Finding and completing quests is solid. I said all I disliked. The game succeeds in comparison to Elder Scrolls IV, and I am addicted to this game like a... person... playing games! Replayability value is hard to get back to though if you leave the game for a month or more. Anyways, great work on the game, this is more than I expected it to be with little to no struggle to get "used to". Postives: +Tons of content +Fun combat +Huge open world to explore +Modding tools +Deep character creation tools +A lot of side missions and long/endless gameplay +A lot of ways to improve graphics Negatives: Bug-free Horrible voice acting Poor character animations Overall: 9/10

review: This game is so excellent that I don't even feel worthy enough to review it. Suffice it to say that "the bar" in terms of Role Playing Games is just a plaything for Bethesda Game Studios. They can put it wherever they want and it will stay there until they come back for it again. Nobody else will even come close.

review: Honestly, this is one of the best games I have ever played, it's up there on my lst with the Legend of Zelda games like OoT and LttP. Enough with that, back to the acutal review. If you ever loved Medivaeavl Fantasy as a kid, or still do (like I do), you will love this game. You can do whatever you want in this game. The stories are not tight like many other games I've played. You can turn from a Mage to Warrior in a blink of an eye, and back agian. Also, my 300 hours of playing this game doesn't give this review much justice as I first played on my Xbox 360 when it came out, but eventually bought it on the PC for mods, and it is sooo much better, In the end, we won't see a game as good as this in awhile, at least untill Bethesda makes Fallout 4 and/or The Elder Scrolls VI. (Or if Valve makes Half Life 3..) Last thing I would like to say is that Famitsu, a highly revered review magizine gave Skyrim a perfect 40/40 score, it was the first western game to get the perfect score, Grand Theft Auto 5 being the second.

review: This is the game the never, ever ends. I picked this game up thinking I wouldn't like it having never played a previous TES game before. Sat in my Library untouched for about a month or two, and finally took the plunge. I was wrong. I was so very, very wrong. This is probably the best purchase I've ever made on steam. Add in the unlimited potential of modding, and it's an adventure that continues forever. I've probably restarted over a hundred times by now with a new character, and still only have beaten Alduin once. ONCE. There's still so much more do to and explore that I'm still discovering quests and areas and little hidden things. I still can't believe how much there is to do and I'm still finding more. At it stands I'll probably wake up one day having lost all touch with reality and actually start seeing the world as Skyrim with how much I've played. And I'm totally ok with that.

review: If I had to choose between this game, and my girlfriend. I'd pick this game. EDIT: I'm single now ON A MORE SERIOUS NOTE: This game is the best in its genre. In previous Bethesda games they made a sad balance in between Questing, and Exploration. Some having more quests and less places to go, and others having very few quests and more places to explore. But in Skyrim, there is no shortage of quests, and if you are like myself and just wander around aimlessly, you will stumble into places that just blow your mind. Every time I have replayed this game, I stumbled into something new. For more info i'd very much recommend mods, with mods such as texture packs, difficulty, quests, armor, and weapons, this games replay value is endless. Go through the game once with plain skyrim, then mod the hell out of it. Overall I'd rate this game an EASY 10/10. If you haven't already. Please buy it, give it a little, and I swear you will be hooked.

review: An epic game made all the more epic by the fact that it is so easy to mod and so well supported by the modding community. The Elder Scrolls series has a large following and often you will hear people argue over each new TES game comparing it to the last, but for me each TES game stands on its own merits, and Skyrim is no exception. The story is pretty good and there are plenty of side quests, but what makes Skyrim so great even when not modded is its large and open nature. This is a land you can just pick a direction and with no quest in mind and just explore. You will find danger and excitement on your journey ... and loot. Lots and lots of loot. But once you start modding this game, that is when you unlock the true value that is Skyrim. Potentially thousands more hours content (for free) in a game that can be improved ten thousand different ways from graphics, textures and sounds all the way to game mechanics and user interface changes. You can make the game exactly what you need it to be, and play it for so long you may still be playing when the next game in this series comes out.... and sometimes longer than even that. If you are interested in modding the PC version of the game, be sure to check out my guide for beginners:

review: I was stacking books on a shelf in my house in Whiterun, one of Skyrim's major cities, when I noticed a weapon rack right beside it. I set a sacrificial dagger in one slot, an Orcish mace in the other. They were on display for nobody but me and my computer-controlled housecarl, Lydia, who sat at a table patiently waiting for me to ask her to go questing. The chest upstairs was reserved for excess weapons and armor, the bedside table for smithing ingots and ores, the one next to the Alchemy table for ingredients. I'd meticulously organized my owned virtual property not because I had to, but because tending to the minutia of domestic life is a comforting break from dealing with screaming frost trolls, dragons, a civil war, and job assignments that never seem to go as planned. It's even a sensible thing to do; a seemingly natural component of every day existence in Skyrim, one of the most fully-realized, easily enjoyable, and utterly engrossing role-playing games ever made. Part of what makes it so enjoyable has to do with how legacy Elder Scrolls clutter has been condensed and in some cases eliminated. In Skyrim, there's no more moon-hopping between hilltops with a maxed out Acrobatics skill. That's gone, so is Athletics. The Elder Scrolls V pares down the amount of skills and cuts out attributes like Endurance and Intelligence altogether. There's no time wasted on the character creation screen agonizing over which skills to assign as major. You don't assign major and minor skills at all, but instead pick one of ten races, each with a specific bonus. High Elves can once a day regenerate magicka quickly, Orcs can enter a berserk rage for more effective close-range combat. These abilities are best paired with certain character builds  the High Elf regeneration is useful for a magic user  but don't represent a rigid class choice. Major decisions don't need to be made until you're already out in the world and can try out magic, sneaking and weapon combat, emphasizing first-hand experience over instruction manual study, letting you specialize only when you're ready. It contributes to the thrilling sense of freedom associated with life in Skyrim. Do a quest, kill a dragon, snatch torchbugs from the air, munch on butterfly wings or simply wander while listening to one of the best game soundtracks in recent memory. Despite the enormity of the world and the colossal amount of content contained within, little feels random and useless. Even chewing on a butterfly wing has purpose, as it reveals one of several alchemical parameters later useful in potion making at an alchemy table. Mined ore and scraps of metal from Dwemer ruins can be smelted into ingots and fashioned into armor sets, pelts lifted from slain wildlife can be turned into leather armor sets, and random books plucked from ancient ruins can trigger hidden quest lines that lead to valuable rewards. Skyrim's land mass is absolutely stuffed with content and curiosities, making every step you take, even if it's through what seems like total wilderness, an exciting one, as something unexpected often lies just over the next ridge. Many times the unexpected takes the form of a dragon. Sometimes they're purposefully placed to guard relics, sometimes they swoop over cities and attack at seemingly random times. In the middle of a fight against a camp of bandits a dragon might strike, screaming through the sky and searing foe and friendly alike with frost or flame. Momentarily all on the battlefield unite, directing arrows and magic blasts upward to knock down the creature, creating impromptu moments of camaraderie -- a surprising change from what may have been yet another by-the-numbers bandit camp sweep. Dragons show up often, their presence announced by an ominous flap of broad wings or an otherworldly scream from high above. The scale and startling detail built into each creature's appearance and animations as it circles, stops to attack, circles again and slams to the ground makes encounters thrilling, though their predictable attack patterns lessen the excitement after a few battles. In the long run they're far less irritating than the Oblivion gate equivalent from The Elder Scrolls IV, can be completed in a few minutes, and always offer a useful reward. Killing a dragon yields a soul, which powers Skyrim's new Shout system. These are magical abilities any character can use, you don't have to specialize in spell casting to slow time, throw your voice, change the weather, call in allies, blast out ice and fire, or knock back enemies with a rolling wave of pure force. Even if you favor sword, shield and heavy armor and ignore magic entirely, you'll still be able to take full advantage of these abilities provided you find the proper words  each Shout has three  hidden on Skyrim's high snowy peaks and in the depths of forgotten dungeons, serving as another reason to continue exploring long after you've exhausted the main quest story, joined with the Thieves Guild, fought alongside the Dark Brotherhood, or thrown your support behind one of the factions vying for control of Skyrim. Not only is this land under assault by dragons, long thought to be dead, it's also ripped in two by civil war. You can choose one side or the other, but so much of the allure of Skyrim is how, even outside of the confines of quest lines, the embattled state of the world is evident, and steeped in a rich fictional legacy. Lord of the Rings this is not, but with the release of every Elder Scrolls game, the fiction becomes denser, and the cross-referencing for long-time fans all the more rewarding. Skyrim's residents are all aware of current events. They'll comment on the civil war, some sympathizing with the rebels, others thinking the establishment sold its soul. The peasants complain about the Jarls who control each settlement, the Jarls complain about the rebels or foreign policy, the overprotective College librarian complains when I drop dragon scales all over his floor; many characters feel like whole, distinct personalities instead of vacuous nothings that hand out quests like a downtown greeter hands out flyers for discount jeans. Characters stereotype based on race, they double-cross at even the slightest hint it might be profitable, and they react to your evolving stature within the world. It makes a ridiculous realm, filled with computer-controlled cat people and humanoid reptiles, demon gods and dragons, feel authentic, like a world that existed long before you showed up and will continue to exist long after you leave.

review: The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is personally, my favorite story-based game. The many classes you can be enriches the game, and you can defeat the ultimate dragon in numerous ways according to your chosen warrior. Not only do you play the storyline, but you can choose to freely roam Skyrim at any point in the game, and obtain the best gear in the game. The huge variety of enemies and monsters to defeat in the game creates an endless fun experience. Getting the DLC for the game enhances the game in many ways. 11/10

Skyrim is so addictingly fun and extravagantly beautiful it ceases to amaze me. The modding community makes it all the better allowing you to expand the game to what it always felt like it wanted to be, but Bethesda couldn't manage to achieve. Skyrim is always going to be my favorite game of all time.

review: 900 hours after a rude awakening in a rickety cart, a moment to reminisce on all that Life in Skyrim had to throw at you: * escape imminent death from beheading * escape imminent death from dragons, spiders, bears, wolves, trolls, vampires, elves, giants, dwarves * escape imminent death from soldiers, bandits, guards, vendors, bartenders, maids, bards, cooks, mages, farmers * escape imminent death from rockfalls, sinkholes, spikes, flamethrowers, waterfalls, slicers * escape imminent death from carrying too much, carrying too little, having everything but That One Thing(tm), having too many of That One Thing(tm), having the correct amount of That One Thing(tm) but at the wrong time, underdressing, overdressing, stepping on something, NOT stepping on something. shouting, not shouting, bribing, not bribing * escape imminent death from rushing, lingering, picking up books, being illiterate, pulling levers, ignoring levers All the while your wardrobe is a function of whatever you just looted off that last dead guy (or girl, or creature!) until in the midst of cheating death you discover you can actually learn to make your own stuff, if you manage to escape imminent death while hunting, gathering or mining. You start getting more confident as your wardrobe and your sharp or blunt implements grow in sophistication, only to discover there is also magic in this world, and imminent death can come out of shadows, or darkness, or distance, or other dimensions, in any combination of freezing, burning, electrifying, infecting, poisoning, or afflicting ways. So you learn to savour the sparse moments you can stop to replenish your strength, and experience the joys of numerous things to eat and drink that turn out to be imminent death in bite-sized portions. You discover that sleep, besides imminent death, also brings inter-dimensional travel. You stop and pick the flowers (mind the bees and firebugs), you take in the panoramic views from atop majestic mountains (mind your step), you woo the fair damsels (mind their temper and/or concealed dagger), you sing and drink and brawl (mind whose toes you step on). You travel and fight, talk and laugh with varying companions, sometimes human, sometimes not, sometimes they save you, sometimes you save them, sometimes they betray you, sometimes you betray them. You shout at people. You blow off steam with automatons. You talk with dogs. You dance with wolves. You trot with horses. You chat with bats. You roll with trolls. You parlor with dragons. You buy, and sell, but mostly you 'borrow'. You rent, or acquire, or build. You marry the wench of your dreams, and a dragon drops in, causing her to leave you at the altar. You adopt cute little orphans, to watch them spend hours every day honing their dagger skills while you desperately try not to fall asleep. Eventually, you realize you worked your way through many a death-defying career: * you were an adventurer (like me), and saved the world from a dragon. * you joined a group of liberal hippies that spend their life shouting at the skies * you negotiated a truce in a civil war * you took sides and massacred the others * you joined a group of assassins * you joined a group of thieves * you joined a group of mages * you joined a pack of werewolves * you joined a flock of vampires * you collected other-dimensional trophies * you did every quest * you killed every boss (some of them twice) * you visited every dungeon * you explored the length and breadth of the lands, the darkest reaches of the earth, the highest peaks, the deepest seas, the strangest planes of existence, and every single inn (because, we need to test the mead). In this one moment of self-congratulatory awe at the completeness of your own achievements, you hear a displaced voice whisper.... "Dude, you didn't even mod yet?". It is then you realize that these past 900 hours were really just the tutorial, the intro, the prelude, the awakening. You're never leaving this place. Ever. So speaketh The Voice. Unless of course, imminent death. (*) (*: Actually, death turns out to lead to singing and drinking mead and slaying dragons and then being sent back to keep doing some more imminent dying. Sorry. On the bright side, jiggling: it's real.)

The two DLC's are amazing and the combat and magic system have seen a great improvement from The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion. And the leveling system is also very well thought out. There are only some complaints that aren't even worth mentioning, exept that the AI can be really bad sometimes. The heartfire DLC gives you the oppertunity to built a house and have childeren. While Dawnguard DLC and the Dragonborn DLC give you new locations and 2 brand new storylines with both amazing and fun quests. Worth the money and you will play this for hours of time. 10/10!

review: Skyrim. It's an Elder Scrolls game, which means you're going to have a huge world to explore again and that really is the main feature of the base game. The combat system, if you want to call it that, is unimpressive and magic feels more limited than it did in previous Elder Scrolls installments and the main storyline is acceptable but not great by any standards. However what Bethesda did do right is the creation of the world all this happens in. Dungeons and ruins are more varied compared to what they were like in Oblivion and the outside world is huge in its own right and allows for days worth of exploration. So despite its flaws I'd strongly recommend this game. There is however a lot of snow. You probably should be looking at an other title if you have a phobia for snow.

review: Skyrim is a game i would recommend to all players it has amazing graphics a good story and plenty of fun and dangerous quests to play through. The beggining is no different from most Elder Scrolls since once again the story starts with you being in prison or arrested. But past that Skyrim opens you to a new world full of caves,dungeons,cities,camps,and houses all throughout the world. But I also have problems with the game since th PC version is very glitchy. I sometimes take armor off a armor stand and put new armor on it then come back to see the old armor has duplicated replacing the armor I had put on there. You might think oh you now can give that armor to your followers or sell it! But this happens nearly everytime you leave your house and it is very frustrating. The game also glitches on quests causing me to go back to previous game files which is bad and is something that needs to be fixed. But in all Skyrim will always be one of the best games to ever be made. I have never seen any game like it and never will. 9/10

Spawn in 20 bandits on top of a cliff and shout at them. 3. Type in the console "player.placeatme 00064b33 1000" (don't actually do this... unless you want to). 4. NEVER type "caqs" in the console. Just don't. 5. Download mods. A lot of them. 6. I mean it when I say don't type in "caqs" in the console. 7. pls dont type it in. srsly. 8. I ran out of ideas. 9. Just play the game. Welcome to Skyrim on the PC. P.S. Type "caqs" in the console.

review: An epic RPG and the latest addition to The Elder Scrolls, Skyrim is one good game! All I can possibly say to explain it's awesomeness is: (in the words of taketherisk) "You're a fool if you don't have this" Seriously though, get this game.

review: When I first entered the world of Skyrim, I was immersed in a fantasy setting where I was quickly thrust into a position of power and entrusted with the responsibility to save the world. This is where the fantasy stops. Similarly to any human suddenly gifted with immesurable power I proceeded disregard the responsibilities of my newfound abilities and proceeded to instead enact horrible deeds on the city's guards and townsfolk. It begins to become painfully clear that Skyrim is not as much of a fantasy game as it is a digital exression of the depravity of humans when given the means to enact their deep and twisted desires. An excellent existential simulator questioning the depth of vileness to which a human soul can delve into, Skyrim poses many deep philosophical points such as tyrrany, racism and the uselessness of having a %based pickpocket system if you have quicksave and quickload and reaching the ultimate conclusion of 'f*ck it, if you kill dragons you must be right'.

review: Skyrim oh glorius skyrim. This game could be my favorite of all time. I must have made 20+ characters playing this game because I was so curios as to the different options to choose from. Going in to it I had no idea the lore or universe of the scrolls franchise but immediatley delved in. The lore is intereting and makes sense. The universe of the game feels somewhat freindly as you step into the open wilds of the tundra but talk to npc's and as you complete quests you begin to notice really how many insane problems Skyrim has. The game invites you to be a strong nordic viking, a stealthy theiving cat, or an expert mage. In all honesty though it encourages you to mix and match and do whatever you want. For example like being an elf who wears heavy armor or a nord who slits throats with dual daggers. It dosent really have many boundraies unlike some of bethesdas other games like fallout which is also one of my favorites despite bugs or flaws. I dont have a counter but I've put a lot of hours into this game(if you look at steam playtime it might be realtivley small because I used to play on 360). There are a number of things you can do like: -Finish the main quest -Get the best weapons and armor through smithing(very tedious) -Complete the companions quest line and other spoilers that I will not say -Complete the mages guild quest line -Complete the theives guild quest line -Complete the dark brotherhood quest line or destroy it by talking to Commander Caius -Choose sides in the great war and complete the quests to restore order for your chosen faction -Investigate the forsworn consipacy -If you have Dawnguard, Dragonborn, or hearthfire dlcs defintley do all you can in them -Do quests for the many daedric lords -Fufill side quests for the trobuled people in skyrim -Get as many Thu'um shouts as you can and kill as many dragons as you can -If you can get mods GET THEM the modding community has very talented people in it -And most inportantly have fun in the world and FusRoDah any guard that says he took an arrow in the knee 10/10

review: This game NEVER ENDS. In most games, that wouldn't be a very complimentary feature, but in this game the gameplay is phenomenal, the graphics are great, the level system is smooth, and you can do almost whatever you want. It has hours upon hours of playability, with the main story line, the DLC story lines, the playermade DLCs on the workshop, and then on top of that, every playthrough can be different because of the vast collection of player made mods. Plus it was only $7.50 during the Christmas sale. I would recommend this game to anyone.

review: IMPORTANT: Do yourself a favor and buy the Legendary Version of Skyrim instead. There are a LOT of good mods that require all the DLC's and it would be a shame if you wouldn't be able to use it because you don't have the dlc's. The legendary edition is definitely worth it especially during sales. Alone without mods? It's one of those games that you pick up and enjoy, get tired of, and then never come back to. With mods? All of a sudden, this game has become an easy candidate for the best game of ALL TIME. You will be able to tweak whatever gameplay settings that bothered you from the original game. You can have new buildings/characters/weapons/quests from mods without having to buy DLC. You can change the entire landscape of Skyrim with graphical enhancements. Oblivion and Morrowind simply cannot compare to this game in the mods department. I used a lot of Lord of the Rings Weapons mods, as well as some star wars mods. If you have a good computer, there are lots of graphic overhauls.

review: Eu sei que vocs esperam que eu diga que Skyrim  o jogo que qualquer f de RPGs (como Ultima e The Legend of Zelda) idealizou nos ltimos anos, ou que o seu mundo  imenso e que as plancies geladas, as tempestades de neve e as criaturas detalhadssimas causam espanto por parecem to reais, mas a verdade  que o jogo  bastante complexo e necessita de horas e mais horas de dedicao pra fazer pequenos avanos, obrigando o jogador a dedicar um dia inteiro para conseguir mudanas relevantes que daro prosseguimento a aventura principal. Joguei pouco mais de 43 horas durante as minhas frias de Julho e 90% desse tempo foram dedicadas a sidequests. Meu conselho? Se voc tiver MUITO tempo livre, Skyrim  para voc. Do contrrio, no recomendo. Skyrim  para jogadores dedicados... e com BASTANTE TEMPO LIVRE. T cursando faculdade? Pai de famlia? Tem outros jogos pra se divertir? ENTO CAI FORA!! ^_^

review: Skyrim. It's an Elder Scrolls game, which means you're going to have a huge world to explore again and that really is the main feature of the base game. The combat system, if you want to call it that, is unimpressive and magic feels more limited than it did in previous Elder Scrolls installments and the main storyline is acceptable but not great by any standards. However what Bethesda did do right is the creation of the world all this happens in. Dungeons and ruins are more varied compared to what they were like in Oblivion and the outside world is huge in its own right and allows for days worth of exploration. So despite its flaws I'd strongly recommend this game. There is however a lot of snow. You probably should be looking at an other title if you have a phobia for snow.

review: 3 and a half years after its release, Skyrim is still more captivating than any RPG I've ever played. The modding community is dedicated, quirky, and practical. The game is very much tailored by personal experience and values, not only in the selection of guilds, but in the character development as well. You will find yourself debating whether or not to let a man live based upon the actions of his peers, be they bandits, Thalmor, Stormcloaks, Imperials, etc. The social dynamics of the game are often overlooked in favor of the graphic quality, questlines, and combat, but it is the dialogues and familial nature of Skyrim that has truly made this an excellent experience- one I'd say every game enthusiast ought to appreciate. 10/10.

review: The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is personally, my favorite story-based game. The many classes you can be enriches the game, and you can defeat the ultimate dragon in numerous ways according to your chosen warrior. Not only do you play the storyline, but you can choose to freely roam Skyrim at any point in the game, and obtain the best gear in the game. The huge variety of enemies and monsters to defeat in the game creates an endless fun experience. Getting the DLC for the game enhances the game in many ways. 11/10

review: This is a great, well-built game. Danger lurks round every corner and there is so much to do! I can personally reccomend getting mods, there is something about getting killed by Thomas the Tank-Engine which you do not find in vanilla Skyrim! My only criticisms are that the map is quite plain; snow and mountains, as well as the fact that this huge map is sometimes a chore to travel, it takes up half of your day, only to be killed by a sabre-tooth tiger as you get there! 8/10 recommend
