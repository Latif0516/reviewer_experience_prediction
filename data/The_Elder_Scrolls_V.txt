review: This is the game the never, ever ends. I picked this game up thinking I wouldn't like it having never played a previous TES game before. Sat in my Library untouched for about a month or two, and finally took the plunge. I was wrong. I was so very, very wrong. This is probably the best purchase I've ever made on steam. Add in the unlimited potential of modding, and it's an adventure that continues forever. I've probably restarted over a hundred times by now with a new character, and still only have beaten Alduin once. ONCE. There's still so much more do to and explore that I'm still discovering quests and areas and little hidden things. I still can't believe how much there is to do and I'm still finding more. At it stands I'll probably wake up one day having lost all touch with reality and actually start seeing the world as Skyrim with how much I've played. And I'm totally ok with that.

review: If I had to choose between this game, and my girlfriend. I'd pick this game. EDIT: I'm single now ON A MORE SERIOUS NOTE: This game is the best in its genre. In previous Bethesda games they made a sad balance in between Questing, and Exploration. Some having more quests and less places to go, and others having very few quests and more places to explore. But in Skyrim, there is no shortage of quests, and if you are like myself and just wander around aimlessly, you will stumble into places that just blow your mind. Every time I have replayed this game, I stumbled into something new. For more info i'd very much recommend mods, with mods such as texture packs, difficulty, quests, armor, and weapons, this games replay value is endless. Go through the game once with plain skyrim, then mod the hell out of it. Overall I'd rate this game an EASY 10/10. If you haven't already. Please buy it, give it a little, and I swear you will be hooked.

review: An epic game made all the more epic by the fact that it is so easy to mod and so well supported by the modding community. The Elder Scrolls series has a large following and often you will hear people argue over each new TES game comparing it to the last, but for me each TES game stands on its own merits, and Skyrim is no exception. The story is pretty good and there are plenty of side quests, but what makes Skyrim so great even when not modded is its large and open nature. This is a land you can just pick a direction and with no quest in mind and just explore. You will find danger and excitement on your journey ... and loot. Lots and lots of loot. But once you start modding this game, that is when you unlock the true value that is Skyrim. Potentially thousands more hours content (for free) in a game that can be improved ten thousand different ways from graphics, textures and sounds all the way to game mechanics and user interface changes. You can make the game exactly what you need it to be, and play it for so long you may still be playing when the next game in this series comes out.... and sometimes longer than even that. If you are interested in modding the PC version of the game, be sure to check out my guide for beginners:

review: I was stacking books on a shelf in my house in Whiterun, one of Skyrim's major cities, when I noticed a weapon rack right beside it. I set a sacrificial dagger in one slot, an Orcish mace in the other. They were on display for nobody but me and my computer-controlled housecarl, Lydia, who sat at a table patiently waiting for me to ask her to go questing. The chest upstairs was reserved for excess weapons and armor, the bedside table for smithing ingots and ores, the one next to the Alchemy table for ingredients. I'd meticulously organized my owned virtual property not because I had to, but because tending to the minutia of domestic life is a comforting break from dealing with screaming frost trolls, dragons, a civil war, and job assignments that never seem to go as planned. It's even a sensible thing to do; a seemingly natural component of every day existence in Skyrim, one of the most fully-realized, easily enjoyable, and utterly engrossing role-playing games ever made. Part of what makes it so enjoyable has to do with how legacy Elder Scrolls clutter has been condensed and in some cases eliminated. In Skyrim, there's no more moon-hopping between hilltops with a maxed out Acrobatics skill. That's gone, so is Athletics. The Elder Scrolls V pares down the amount of skills and cuts out attributes like Endurance and Intelligence altogether. There's no time wasted on the character creation screen agonizing over which skills to assign as major. You don't assign major and minor skills at all, but instead pick one of ten races, each with a specific bonus. High Elves can once a day regenerate magicka quickly, Orcs can enter a berserk rage for more effective close-range combat. These abilities are best paired with certain character builds  the High Elf regeneration is useful for a magic user  but don't represent a rigid class choice. Major decisions don't need to be made until you're already out in the world and can try out magic, sneaking and weapon combat, emphasizing first-hand experience over instruction manual study, letting you specialize only when you're ready. It contributes to the thrilling sense of freedom associated with life in Skyrim. Do a quest, kill a dragon, snatch torchbugs from the air, munch on butterfly wings or simply wander while listening to one of the best game soundtracks in recent memory. Despite the enormity of the world and the colossal amount of content contained within, little feels random and useless. Even chewing on a butterfly wing has purpose, as it reveals one of several alchemical parameters later useful in potion making at an alchemy table. Mined ore and scraps of metal from Dwemer ruins can be smelted into ingots and fashioned into armor sets, pelts lifted from slain wildlife can be turned into leather armor sets, and random books plucked from ancient ruins can trigger hidden quest lines that lead to valuable rewards. Skyrim's land mass is absolutely stuffed with content and curiosities, making every step you take, even if it's through what seems like total wilderness, an exciting one, as something unexpected often lies just over the next ridge. Many times the unexpected takes the form of a dragon. Sometimes they're purposefully placed to guard relics, sometimes they swoop over cities and attack at seemingly random times. In the middle of a fight against a camp of bandits a dragon might strike, screaming through the sky and searing foe and friendly alike with frost or flame. Momentarily all on the battlefield unite, directing arrows and magic blasts upward to knock down the creature, creating impromptu moments of camaraderie -- a surprising change from what may have been yet another by-the-numbers bandit camp sweep. Dragons show up often, their presence announced by an ominous flap of broad wings or an otherworldly scream from high above. The scale and startling detail built into each creature's appearance and animations as it circles, stops to attack, circles again and slams to the ground makes encounters thrilling, though their predictable attack patterns lessen the excitement after a few battles. In the long run they're far less irritating than the Oblivion gate equivalent from The Elder Scrolls IV, can be completed in a few minutes, and always offer a useful reward. Killing a dragon yields a soul, which powers Skyrim's new Shout system. These are magical abilities any character can use, you don't have to specialize in spell casting to slow time, throw your voice, change the weather, call in allies, blast out ice and fire, or knock back enemies with a rolling wave of pure force. Even if you favor sword, shield and heavy armor and ignore magic entirely, you'll still be able to take full advantage of these abilities provided you find the proper words  each Shout has three  hidden on Skyrim's high snowy peaks and in the depths of forgotten dungeons, serving as another reason to continue exploring long after you've exhausted the main quest story, joined with the Thieves Guild, fought alongside the Dark Brotherhood, or thrown your support behind one of the factions vying for control of Skyrim. Not only is this land under assault by dragons, long thought to be dead, it's also ripped in two by civil war. You can choose one side or the other, but so much of the allure of Skyrim is how, even outside of the confines of quest lines, the embattled state of the world is evident, and steeped in a rich fictional legacy. Lord of the Rings this is not, but with the release of every Elder Scrolls game, the fiction becomes denser, and the cross-referencing for long-time fans all the more rewarding. Skyrim's residents are all aware of current events. They'll comment on the civil war, some sympathizing with the rebels, others thinking the establishment sold its soul. The peasants complain about the Jarls who control each settlement, the Jarls complain about the rebels or foreign policy, the overprotective College librarian complains when I drop dragon scales all over his floor; many characters feel like whole, distinct personalities instead of vacuous nothings that hand out quests like a downtown greeter hands out flyers for discount jeans. Characters stereotype based on race, they double-cross at even the slightest hint it might be profitable, and they react to your evolving stature within the world. It makes a ridiculous realm, filled with computer-controlled cat people and humanoid reptiles, demon gods and dragons, feel authentic, like a world that existed long before you showed up and will continue to exist long after you leave.

review: Okay, where do I start? General: This game is able to shock you and make you laugh time and time again, even when playing it for the 3'rd time. It takes about 130 - 200 hours of playtime to finish all of the quests, and I guarantee that in the time you will not discover everything there is to discover. If you do not feel like questing, take some time mining, scaring people with magic and shouts, undressing them, stealing, stealthing, killing dragons or giants, throwing cabbages around or simply reading 1 of about 250 integrated ingame books and stories. Graphics: This game has pulled off something I have thought to be impossible and pushed the whole gaming industry to the new levels. It has successfully integrated superb graphics into a lot of content. World is beautiful, vast and full of variety and although a bit dark by default this can very easily be changed by just picking one mod from the workshop. Workshop: Why does this deserve a special tab? Because thanks to workshop, earlier mentioned 200 hours of gameplay easily turn into thousands of hours of gameplay. Don't like any part of the game? Change it! Modify it! Add to it! A huge amount of mods are being made every day, and whether they spawn an extra cupcake in your house or add new cities with their own storylines they will all change your experience and prolong the fun. Name what you want to do, it exists. ALL OF IT. Cons: - Few possible glitches, but all have their fix, just need to be googled out. - A bit too confusing and overwhelming at the start. A lot of unanswered questions may put you off the game. This happened to me on the first two attempts to play the game. I ended up going to the first town, becoming a woodcutter, killing a chicken and getting chased by the guards. But once you push on, you will be nothing but glad you did. Who am I even writing this for? Is there any poor soul out there who has not yet played this game? BUY IT. NOW. Please?

review: The province of Skyrim might be frigid, but the role-playing game that takes place within it burns with a fire few games possess. Yes, Skyrim is another enormous fantasy RPG from a developer that specializes in them, and it could suck up hundreds of hours of your time as you inspect each nook and crevasse for the secrets to be found within. The game returns you to the continent of Tamriel, where you explore the northern realm called Skyrim, home to the Nord race. In these northern regions, snow flurries cloud your view, and platforms of ice float on the chilled waters. Nighttime often brings Tamriel's version of the aurora borealis, with its gorgeous blue and green ribbons stretching across the heavens. Skyrim's predecessor, Oblivion, featured prototypical fantasy environments-pretty but not quite evocative of the lore's darker undercurrents. Skyrim embraces its darker elements. You might feel an eerie chill as you glimpse a half-sunken ship through the mist, or watch as a dragon comes to life before your very eyes under the swirling firmament. Closer inspection reveals hard edges, plain painted-on textures, and other visual flaws that are conspicuous should you seek them out. But like many enormous games, Skyrim makes a fantastic impression not because its individual elements are sharply honed, but because they contribute to a grander whole. There's so much to do that your quest log becomes an embarrassment of pleasures, offering dozens of choices at any given time, each one as enticing as the next.It's impressive enough that there's so much to do; it's even more impressive that most of it is wonderful. Not every dungeon is a joy to explore. Stone-turning puzzles occasionally bring the fun to a halt, and a few repeated cave designs could dampen your spirits. But overall, every task has an excellent sense of context, and surprises lurk around many a turn. Skyrim also uses scattered books and references to enthrall you. You may not be a big fan of reading books in role-playing games, but even so, you should make an effort here.The combat in Skyrim is the tightest Elder Scrolls combat yet, the visual and audio cues normally providing proper feedback with your blows and zaps.Some death blows result in Fallout 3-style slow-motion kills, which retain their power because they're not overly frequent. Movement, too, has seen improvement: you can now play from a third-person view and feel like you're moving across the land instead of floating above it. All in all, Skyrim has some minor issues but as a whole is a brilliant RPG.

The game has one of the largest active modding communities of any game. This helps to spice up gameplay and graphics. With new residents, new weapons and armor, incredible house mods adding giant castles, and visual mods. You can spend hours upon hours finding mods that suit your needs in the nordic lands of Skyrim. It is worth to note that you should know the game to an extent before modding, as it can corrupt save files if not done properly. If I'd have to rate it, it would be a 10/10.

review: This is one of the best adventures you can play: long and storyrich main quest with huge amount of sidequests to venture through! With the official Dragonborn, Dawnguard and Heartfire dlcs there's tons of places to see and enormous amount of quests to complete. If you somehow run out of stuff to find then there's the modding possibility. SO MANY mods are out there (Steam Workshop, Skyrim Nexus...) to give you more quests, items and whatever. With all the mods it's pretty much endless adventure waiting for you as Dragonborn. The best ability of course is shouting at everything you see. It's pretty funny to make people fly away when you feel upset about someone stealing your sweetroll... Some caves and especially Dwarven ruins tend to be pretty boring to go to after some time since they are pretty long (Dwarven ruins) and linear (just killing tons of same enemies to find something/somebody or to get somewhere) but other than that it's a beautiful and rich game in so many ways that there is no reason why you shouldn't give it a try! Btw never attack chickens... those s seem to be pretty valuable in Skyrim since everyone is willing to kill you if you harm them.

review: A game that is complicated to critique. For the first 30-50 hours, you will be completely absorbed in the beautiful and vast world, with seemingly endless opportunities for exploration and questing. As you continue to play, the cracks start to show. The gameplay systems are incredibly shallow, the characters wooden, the world still beautiful but the dungeons copy/pasted 120 times over with the same enemies, the same meaningless loot. The complication arises when you realize that while you are slowly starting to loathe the game, you've had 30+ hours of fun before hitting that point. So the question is, was it worth it?

The game will just suck you in. It has LOADS of contents that will keep you busy for 100+ hours for sure. And mods are just icing on the cake; if you're a graphics-hungry person, mods can make this game look better than most "next-gen" games out there, if modded correctly. And the sceneries, oh the sceneries, I just feel like sitting on my chair and just keep staring at those vast fields of beautiufl grasslands. Totally recommend this game. 15/10. BUT, but, one and only con that I found is of the fighting mechanics; it is just so bland. Nothing else I dislike about this game.

With mods installed prepare to stay up until 3:00 am in the morning while playing this game oh and i mean from 7:00 am to 3:00 by the way, you will literally lose hours just by having fun with the fantastic and active modding community for this game. Now for everything else, The landscape of Skyrim is extremely beautiful, you will get lost in hours and hours of content. More so with the vast dungeons dotting the land. While Elder Scrolls Oblivion had this fantasy artistic style going on with the landscape which is breathtaking within it's own right. Skyrim has this hostile, cold and harsh environment going on. Exatcly how it is described. The quests in this game are extremely well done, more so with quests that don't really start right off the bat until you read a book or hear a rumor, which will keep the player more invested within the game. Also with the AI system implemented in this game, your actions changes how the world views your character with every good deed you do to every bad deed you do. Quest mods also make it more fun and more investing. The skills system aren't exactly as perfect as Elder Scrolls Oblivion. Within that game, whatever class you pick, it will either make the investment into that class fun or not, but either way you will lose hours just getting your characters skills up as you go along within that game. In Skyrim, the skills system are dotted out into three sections, Mage, Warrior, and Rogue, whatever skills you pick it will either help combat scenarios easier or not. Even more so if you choose to go with a thief build. The mage system in this game is pretty badass but not as more through like in Oblivon. But with mods installed it will make these three aspects much more fun to play and make the skill system much more tedious rather than a clean sweep. The Combat system in this game is clunky, it's your typical Elder Scrolls game. If an enemy lungs at you, you block, if you want to gain the advantage against a large stack of bandits or whatever, use a bow. If you want a 'clean sweep' use magic. Here is where modding comes into play once again. Thanks to these overhaul mods the combat system feels more alive and more challenging, with every minute maybe your last. The NPCs in this game while that voice reptition is there, the NPCs of this vast world stand out more than the Oblivion counterparts, each one has a selective schedule and "job" they also have their own "situation" to make these characters either more interesting or more annoying depending upon your point of view. The muscical score makes you want to just to sit back and listen to it. While some people will say "it's recycled music over and over again" There are mods to make the muscial score more diverse and interesting with every combat situation and with every town and city, and dungeon you explore. The DLC are also great in there own right, With Dawnguard, it's your typical light and darkness story. But here you will not only lose more hours into this game, but you will gain new shouts, equipment and companions, and also player homes. With hearthfire it's an add-on, it will just add housecarls and three new houses to the world. If you like that sort of thing. Lastly with Dragonborn, you will explore a very familiar place with a "good" storyline, like with Dawnguard, new quests, new equipment, and new player homes, and new companions. basically Dawnguard and Dragonborn you will get "new" I highly recommend modding this game. In it's original state, again it feels lifeless and dull, even if you lose 1000+ hours into Skyrim. With mods enabled you will enjoy replaying the game over and over again. I seriously recommend this game.

review: I love it, it gave me 2 years of fun, I played every playstyle, every race, every way, every DLC. I been from a straight up heavy armor warrior with a huge battleaxe that can turn into a werewolf, and could stand still taking every hit from a dragon without losing almost any health. To a master thief who isn't very strong but can sneak through a entire bandit camp without being seen once.. All the way to guy who never killed a soul, worked hard for his money chopping wood. Managing to build his own house and have a family. The main story with all the guilds you can join and areas to explore, you won't be bored for a long time. So don't just rush the main story and assume you seen it all. Out of the DLC's, the best would be Dragonborn. It offers a large new world, enemies, quests, armors and weapons. While the Dawnguard only offers a bit and a vampire lord form, and Hearthfire just lets you adopt kids and build homes. The worst thing about it, is there will be bugs, which can easily be fixed by console commands. But only use if needed, like after 5 retrys a quest won't finish or continue. 8/10 Only because it can get far too easy, and the bugs. You get stronger than all the enemies too quickly. So I say when you learn the game better, go on Master or Legendary difficulty for a challenge.

review: Skyrim is undoubtedly the best purchase I have made in the past year. It's worth every $ that it's listed at especially when considering the insane amount of content you are given. I have only spent about 100 hours in the game (this is short in comparison to a lot of people on my friends list) but I can assure you that those hours were all packed with immersive content. Here are some key features that hooked me into the game.. 1. Dungeon Complexity - When I say complexity, I mean that the design for the game's dungeons vary greatly from simple to complex. You just have to keep exploring and you'll eventually run into the intricately designed areas that get you to pause for a moment and think before being able to progress. At times.. I ALMOST felt as if I were playing the latest Tomb Raider once again. I also found it quite neat that you could use your shouts to bypass/solve a few of the puzzles. 2. Playstyle Freedom - I'm sure tht a lot of people take similar routes but the game does offer a great deal of freedom with its perk system. It's definitely a step up compared to games like Kingdoms of Amalur. Do you enjoy melee combat? How about magic? How about a balance of both? There's a lot of possibilities. 3. Expansive Lore - As I've mentioned, the game has a ton of content. Playing through everything (especially if you are aiming for complete achievements), gives you perspective on the whole story and it really is interesting when some quest's lore ties into another - maybe even forming a bigger picture. Skyrim definitely has a lot more charming qualities but these are the features that I really wanted to highlight. They stood out for me and it was for these reasons that I ended up buying the game last year (only to play it now - 2014) during the summer sale. With that said, I paid $30 for the legendary edition. Wouldn't you agree that for all this content, it was pretty much a steal? How many games can you list down that provide hundreds, nearly thousands of hours worth of content (especially if you count the mods) for that kind of price. Just remember, multiplayer games don't count! 10/10. Buy it when it goes on sale during this upcoming summer sale event.

review: Skyrim is one of my favorite games of all time, this game is pure art, the role play is great if you are a nerd like me, however if you don't plan on role playing and you just want to play an amazing game then you can unlike other titles like fallout this game does not punish you and it is not a very hard game, i played it in master for most of my stay in the land of skyrim. This game is the kind of type game where it is not about the end its all about the journey. I have played a lot of rpgs in my day, and in most the quests have been bland and the main idea was to explore however this game can be both the quests are great, the story is great the map is amazing, Yeah there may not be as many random encounters like fallout, however when exploring you will allways find something new, and as we are pc master race we also get the privlage of mods that add alot more to the game which is amazing, i mainly enjoyed some of the modded quests, and horror quests. If you dont have this game by now f*cking buy it jez 10/10

review: This game truly deserves the title of "near perfection", being one of those rare milestones that comes every so often in years of gaming. Skyrim itself, is probably the best release from Bethesda's Elder Scrolls series. Story wise, this is one of the most developed storyline from the series, giving much enjoyment overall. In all honesty, we can say that the community is one of the most desirable aspect of Skyrim, due to their dedication in further releases of modifications - improving much of the overall gameplay (it never hurts to crank up those graphics). It would be a pity to not try Skyrim in the course of your lifetime, so it's advisable to go ahead and try it!

review: Skyrim? Yeah I played Skyrim. Picked it up when it launched on the Xbox 360 in fact. I must've put about 30 hours into it before deciding that I've seen it all. Let me break it down a bit. When I played Skyrim I did the following: I left my house, found a dungeon, grabbed the loot, sold it to the same handful of merchants (including my husband), and...that was it. Morrowind was surreal, wonderful, and just obtuse enough to be charming. With Skyrim, I felt like some cog in a Dwemer machine, trapped in an endless cycle of middling upgrades and a total lack of surprising events. I mean, for crying out loud, more dragons?! These jerks are worse than cliff racers. At the time I figured that I might as well play an MMO, at least then I could get some rare drops. So what happened? What's so different about the PC version that I would put 600+ hours into it? Do you really have to ask? Modding Skyrim is the equivalent of Alice in Wonderland. You don't get to walk up to the rabbit hole and peer over the edge. You certainly can't climb down, take what catches your interest, and climb out. No, you will fall in that hole. The only light you'll be seeing is through the dozens of mods that make up your sunny days in Skyrim. In the beginning you might pick through the mods available on the Steam workshop. A weapon here, a new set of armor, something that makes cows explode or sends people flying into space, you get the idea. But then you look at what other people are doing with their Skyrim. They've got the 4K textures, the dramatic ENBs, the glamour models with their noses just right. Now you may be thinking that you don't need all that garbage, and you probably don't. But you do. Next thing you know you're on the Nexus. It's been 10 hours and you haven't even started the game yet. Stability is the last word I'd associate with Elder Scrolls, and that's without piling on the mods. Getting your modded game to function is more engrossing than Skyrim itself. You've started the game, you're wandering around, and then...Crash To Desktop. What caused it? How do you fix it? Is there a way around it? Are you going to lose your saves? After a long enough period of time you eventually stop caring. My Skyrim is held together by old tape and chewing gum, and that's fine. Eventually you learn to stop caring about those precious game-saves. I'm going to spoil Skyrim: You are the most awesome. Everything you do is right and nobody dares to question you. Nobody will even do anything unless you're somehow involved. Sometimes being the most awesome is fun. It's escapism at its purest. A lot of other videogames tend to punish you with death. At worst, Skyrim inconveniences you. This game doesn't say "YOU DIED." or "HEY POOR PLAYER!" It just assumes you goofed up somewhere and loads your last save. There's something to be said about player-imposed difficulty, but it's hard work trying to be the least awesome. There's a phrase I like to throw around when discussing videogames: "Making the game yours." Usually this refers to playing games in a particular way, like a knife-only run in Resident Evil, or beating Megaman without any power-ups. It's not always about player-imposed difficulty either, it can be about creating an identity through playing. I remember reading about a Morrowind player who spent all of their time in the Ashlands. They'd camp out in a Chitin hut and hunt whatever beasts they happened to find. They made just enough from selling the carcasses to eke out a miserable existence while dealing with the constant ash storms. This doesn't sound appealing, but I have to respect the hustle. That person totally owns their game of Morrowind. When all of the rumors are true, and the player is always the most awesome, there's not a lot one can do to create their identity. This is especially apparent when every single guard you pass mentions something you could be doing (or have already done). Your alteration level could be so low that it couldn't levitate an earthworm, but that won't stop you from becoming an Archmage not long after stepping foot in the Winterhold College. I remember when being an Archmage was such hot  in The Bard's Tale, now it's just a title any Dragonbum can get. When everything in a game takes zero effort and the results are meaningless, why not just make the game in your image through modding? If anything this will lead to new challenges, more possibilities, and *gasp* unpredictability. When I play Skyrim, I play with the intent to fill it with as much crap as I can find, see if/when/how it breaks, and attempt to undo the damage with minimal losses. It's disturbingly compelling, and that's without discussing the mods themselves. I don't settle for being the most awesome, I want to become omnipotent. Only after I've constructed this world, filled it with all of the neatest toys, and prettied it up as much as my mediocre videocard will allow, do I actually play it. At this point I'm fine with being the most awesome, because I feel like I earned that right. This is the time I put some Genesis on, and zone out while exploring, decapitating, and working on that perpetually imperfect nose. Perhaps my comparison to Alice in Wonderland is a bit off. The way I remember it, Alice falls in the hole and arrives in Wonderland. With modded Skyrim; Wonderland is a neverending hole. Inevitably you'll get bored of tearing your game to pieces and putting it back together. You want to see where your curiousity will take you. You might go digging through hundreds of foreign websites to find that anime fighting-style, or ten gigabtyes of hair-styles. You could even find yourself in a lab. What it all comes down to is that Skyrim is what you make of it. The game is fine on its own. It's certainly not lacking for content, and even without thousands of visual-enhancing mods it looks decent. However, Skyrim becomes so much more simply through the act of modding. To me, this is the ultimate sandbox game, and will likely only be bested by Bethesda's next single-player RPG.

review: There are many reasons why we play games. Some play games to experience a story, some play to compete with others and some play to have experiences they have never had otherwise in real life. Alot play games to escape into another world, and live completely different lives, and this is what drives Bethesdas Elder Scrolls series, a series that has excelled in creating complete virtual worlds, inviting the player to live parallel lives. Skyrim is the latest world offered by Bethesda to live in, and it seems like its Bethesdas finest accomplishment yet. Similarly to the two Elder Scrolls games before it, you start off as a prisoner, and this case you are on your way to be executed. Just before the axe greets your neck, a dragon appears and the entire army base you were in goes into disarray. You are set free after the incident, and it is up to you to find out why are the dragons appearing, and what is your role in the whole ordeal (hint: it rhymes with Shmagonborn). Bethesda displays such dedication to concept of open world that makes other open world games pale in comparison. Skyrim isnt just a series of buildings, environments and NPCs, it is the closest there is to virtual living world in a game. The sense of freedom found in Elder Scrolls is unparalleled, and Skyrim is the best implementation of this yet. The main quest is a minimal part of the game, and most of the fun comes from exploring the world built for you. As you go exploring dungeons, assisting NPCs with their problems, joining factions and reading ingame books, you realize what a dense world Skyrim is. It is compelling to learn more about Skyrim, about its citizens and about its politics, and the more you learn about, the more you are invested in the well being of the world. Through all the running around and exploring, you come across a wide range of missions to complete. The main mission is, as usual, the most interesting one, but the rest of the missions can be worthy, and they are necessary to help you know more about the world. You can complete missions for The Companions (Skyrims equivalent of the Fighters Guild) to understand how ingrained the warrior culture is in Skyrim, or join the Mages College and be looked down upon by Nords who believe that magic is for sissies. Even miscellaneous missions, such as simply standing up for a Dark Elf against a bunch of racist Nords can be satisfying. Standard fetch quests are to be found here and there, but there are far from being the norm. The games graphics have been talked about endlessly. Now, Skyrims graphics are great, with detailed textures and wonderful environments. Yet it terms of detail, they dont hold a candle to games like Rage and Battlefield 3. Yet Skyrim is nicer to look at than the aforementioned games, and that is because of Skyrims aesthetics. Bethesda knows that when it comes to graphics, art direction trumps fidelity, and in Skryim, the beauty of the world comes from its style. Part of the reason Morrowind is generally viewed as a much better game than Oblivion is because of its fantastical designs; while Oblivion came off as a standard European fantasy setting, Morrowind was a truly outlandish and exotic location that had its own unique identity. Skyrim returns with the art direction that made Morrowind so unique. While the location might not be as exotic as Morrowind, Skyrim it is exactly the blistering norse region that you would think is occupied by burly, war-faring people. The buidlings, the environments, the apparel, the weapons, the creatures, and even the music all give Skyrim its unique identity, an identity that is inspired by real-life Scandinavia, but is in no way identical to it. ~~~~~~~~~~~~ The combat, which is one of the weaker aspects in previous Elder Scrolls, is drastically improved here. While there is still the feeling that you are hacking away at empty spaces instead of making a real impact on your enemy, but its not as bad as it was in previous games. The biggest addition to the combat system is the double wielding, and it works great. You can go for a sword in each hand, a sword and spell, or two spells, one in each hand. I personally went sword and staff, Gandalf style. There is also a favorite menu for items, a feature that pauses makes it easier to equip items in game. This is designed to save you the hassle of going to the main item screen during the game, but it also gives a tactical quality to the combat, since the menu pauses the game and allows for quick equipment changes, which is helpful especially when fighting dragons. Dragons appear as random encounters throughout the game, and they are just as imposing as one would imagine dragons to be. You will die alot fighting them, and you would have to rely on myriad of tactics to fight them. A few hacks there, retreat to heal yourself, attack with destruction magic while the dragon is airborne, retreat again, and so on. Killing a dragon is immensely satisfying, and through killing dragons do you acquire new shouts. Shouts are another new combat feature; they are words in the dragon language which, when you say them, unleashes different attacks on your enemies, or gives you new powers. Shouts are a welcome addition to the games combat system, and further adds to the combats tactical quality. Now this is a Bethesda game, which means that bugs are abound. I have experienced a few unresponsive actions from NPCs, same crashes, and an axe suspended in midair. However, this is an area I cant criticize Bethesda much about. In a game of this size and scope, it is virtually impossible to spot all the bugs before release. To their credit, Bethesda is quick to releases patches that fix whatever issues gamers may have. We can also count on the mod community to tweek all the inconveniences out of the game. Bugs are abundant in the game, and players will experience at least one in every playthrough, yet for the most part, these bugs are miniscule and far from game breaking. Skyrim is like a music album that has a few tracks that you arent particularly fond of, but rest of the music is pure aural blliss that you cant help but think of the album as close to perfection as possible. I cant point to a single part of the game and say that is the best part; the entire game is an experience. It stays firmly rooted in Elder Scrolls gameplay, yet with enough improvements and additions (and subtractions) to make Skyrim stand on its own. After experiencing the vast, dense and incredibly detailed world of Skyrim, you cant help but snicker whenever another game is referred to as open world. Good: Vast yet incredibly detailed world, Incredible Depth, Interesting Story, Improved Combat System, Gorgeous Graphics and wonderful style Bad: Buggy, some standard 'fetch' missions Price: AED 9.5/10

My life is extremely busy and video games have always been my number one activity to leave the standard world. The Elder Scrolls series of games has been one of the best sources of fun I have found and Skyrim is simply the best one of the series by far! Do download the DLC (Downloadable contents) right away as the latest DLC (Dragonborn) includes very potent aspects to the game as the ability to receive TWO perk points when reading ability books! BUT! Yes, there's a but. The game is so vast that there are some bugs... You need to play this with the Elder Scrolls Wiki

review: opened in a browser (ideally in a separate monitor) when playing to see the various issues with each quests or dungeons (like how not to completely mess up the "Blood on the Ice" quest so you can get to finally buy the somptuous Hjerim house in Windhelm). BUT number 2. Yes, there is another issue. You may SERIOUSLY consider adding a few "mods" to your game since they may fix some of the "bugs" mentioned. For exemple : adding the Dawnguard DLC will make Vampires appear and KILL potentially VITAL characters depending on the sort of build your are trying to achieve for your character! Geeez. You would think they would have thought of a way to hold these attacks until you start the quest? NO they didn't! But.... There's a "mod" that actually does this for you : preventing ALL vampire attacks (which may KILL city vendors and other characters) until you actually start the quest! Yep, this means, sorry lad, but you REALLY should take a stroll around the modding area, easily accessible in Steam by clicking the Workshop button under your PLAY button in the Games Library (once you've selected Skyrim). There are a few really cool mods I like apart from this one. One is called Run for your lives! And also makes all villagers run inside when there's a DRAGON attack. Again, preventing important characters from simply being wiped out before you get a chance to kill them yourself! :p Apart from that, the game is just insanely good... I have played it from beginning to end many times and still discover new things. :)

review: can steal from a merchant, then sell it back to him. 10/10 now on a serious note. skyrim is best value of your money that you will get in any game EVER. reasons is are mods. quest mods, graphic mods, weapons, npc, new spells, voice, animation, you name it theres a mod for it and will add to the game. there are several, hundreds of quest mods that add hours of extra gameplay and even new areas and dungeons. combat in this game is great. amazing if so. you will never find a fps game with sword, magic or bow as great as this. if first person isnt your style you can easily go to third person. ENB and graphic mods change the game completely to make it look like an entire different game that make it look like its a brand new game. i highly recomend this game with the dlc as they add new variety of items and new mechanics that the game can do. though for PC i highly HIGHLY recomend to get SKSE (skyrim script extender) and SKYUI for a PC friendly UI if youre not going to use a controller.

review: Skyrim is not the game people revere it to be. In order to review it, you'd need to point out several factors that weigh in Skyrim's favour. First factor being that you can mod it... VERY IMPORTANT FACTOR! Without mods Skyrim is a buggy mess with no depth to the combat nor much depth with the main story and characters. If you're not going to be modding the game, just playing it vanilla, then I recommend just playing through the different side quests and guilds/groups the game offers. They are much more fun than the main questline and have some nice rewards. Another factor in Skyrim's favour is that it's the only one of its kind. (Discounting the previous TES games, which are outdated. I'm talking strictly games that are popular today.) There is no other open world RPG game that offers as much as Skyrim with as good visuals, voice acting and functionality. (Although Skyrim is INSANELY buggy without mods.) You might be asking yourself why I recommend this game if I'm not stroking it's ego telling it that it's a big boy, and instead bad mouthing it. Well, it has a great modding community (bar the big floppy private parts mods) and an ever growing modding community too. It's a few years old now, yet still manages to pump out awesome mods at Skyrim mod nexus and on the Workshop. I love modding and playing this game, and personally think you'd be crazy to experience Skyrim without mods. TLDR: Skyrim isn't that great without mods, I like this game with mods. You might think differently, just my humble opinion.

review: For the people who: 1) Want DEPTH - A huge story behind every SINGLE quest. 2) Think the NPCs are 'garbage' because they don't react the way the 'should' when the Dragonborn does THIS or THAT. 3) Look for amazing & different ways of combat in order to kill your enemies. 4) Think it's too "repetitieve, shallow, bland dungeon crawler." 5) Want to add THOUSANDS of mods, not reading how to install them & then complain the game is trash because it CRASHES. This game is NOT for you. I enjoy this game very much & I think it's a REALLY GOOD game. It all depends on what kind of games you like & if you're too picky. Sure, this game is not perfect & has bugs, glitches, etc. But I'd like to see YOU developing a game like this or even BETTER. I'm sure people who don't have HIGH expectations will love the game as much as I do. Take your TIME exploring the places, doing the quests. Just add some mods if you need more action, be careful they don't conflict with each other & you're ready to go! (: 8/10

review: What can you say about Elder Scrolls series ? It's more popular than a picture of Jesus holding a pug with a bowtie, and rightfully so. Most of the series issues are countered by the fact that talented, sometimes downright disturbingly obsessive modding community probably modded them out and Skyrim is no exception. Even if you sink more than hundered hours in vanilla version, you can still find something you haven't done and want to do. Want to spend all your time force-pushing chickens around town ? Sure ! Wanna put buckets over NPCs faces while they're delivering important pieces of exposition ? You got it ! While I'm usually opposed to "make your own fun" kind of games, doing your own thing is bread and butter of Skyrim, and that's what makes it so popular. Yeah, it may be a bit more simplified (for the sake of accessibility) than older TES games and maybe enviroments and combat get a bit boring and repetitive after a while, but it all falls flat when you can summon 5000 wheels of cheese and roll them down the mountain on unsuspecting goats.

review: I wouldn't call this the ultimate game, but I would call it the ultimate timewaster. Skyrim was my companion through a couple of days with no internet. It was also one of the only games I had installed. One thing leads to another, you start to see achievements piling on achievements, and you get the idea, "Yeah, I can do this." What a fool I was.

review: (This review is a very long one. It actually is kind of an article between, a gameplay review, a "role-playing" guide, a mods compilation, and story of a character. If you are not intrested, I suggest you to pass it right away.) (Content is written all by me. Please do not distribute without permission.) The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, is undoubtedly one of the greatest PC games ever made, personally the single best RPG and open-world game I've seen. It is an unlimited digital source of pleasure for a lifetime FRP lover like myself. There really aren't many words to describe such perfection. First of all, best thing about Skyrim is the fact that, things you can do is literally endless. Content is literally endless. I am at around +2.000 hours of Skyrim gameplay (Also played it a lot before my Steam copy.), and everyday, I still keep discovering some totally new things. Vanillia game with DLC's, has at least over 2.000-2.500 hours of gameplay (Around 1.500 hours without any DLC's, maybe?), if you do nothing but quests. Endless number of mods you can apply, will make gameplay way, way longer. And again, this is only possible if you do nothing but quests; no sightseeing, fast traveling all the way, skipping lore, and forgetting about the identity of your character. Still, it's your choice to play Skyrim in the way you want. I have 3 characters, and I'll talk about one of them, whom I mainly play. (Vanillia content is more than enough to play 3 unique paths (except main storyline) for 3 seperate characters. You also can alter main storyline to a degree.). But first, I'd like to talk about mods which I actively use in all my characters (Plus, there are some particular ones for each character.)(No visual mods included.) - First of all, most indispensable mod for me, is probably the "Disable Fast Travel". I think that fast traveling absolutely ruins the game. I never fast traveled before (Neither in Skyrim, nor Oblivion. Morrowind didn't had it anyways. Damn, I love Morrowind.), never will, and I hate people who fast travels. Fast travel system is necessary as a result of overall demand to Skyrim, but when it's being used, that's half of the games beauty gone. Some people play it just for the other half anyways. - I very much like the "iNeed" mod, which adds a streamlined approach to needs. You need to eat, drink, and sleep once in a while, for full effectiveness of your character. It has some nice details, like for example, you can carry a flask, drink your water from it when you are thirsty, and fill it from any water source when depleted (Even from rain!). - Static Mesh Improvement, an amazing mod which replaces some plain textures with idea of adding a feel of third dimension, with actual 3D meshes. It adds a whole new level to details all around Tamriel. - SkyUI, a must-have interface overhaul - Cloaks of Skyrim - SkyrimSpeeds, speed adjustments - Improved Dragon Shouts - Command Dragon, for manual control - Alternative Crafting System, helps role-playing without abandoning your gear potential - ImmersiveFP, for first-person dragon & horse riding - A quality world map with all roads - Touring Carriages - FNIS, custom animations engine - And, Falskaar! It's an amazing mod, which adds a new quest line, a huge new map, and a very solid lore. Very professionally done, almost like an official DLC. The character I want to talk about, is my female dragonborn assassin, last member of the Dark Brotherhood, and guildmaster of Thieves Guild. She's the character that I played the most, although she's not the character I first created, or beat the main storyline. I beat the main storyline with my mage for the first time, and I wanted continue as an assassin, created her. After completing the Unbound quest (Which is the very first quest.), I literally quit the main storyline, and completed The Dark Brotherhood and Thieves Guild storylines (Yea, you can do that. You literally can complete almost every side quest in Tamriel without touching the main story.). By the time I return to the main storyline, I already was a master assassin, (Skyrim has an NPC progress system; it doesn't let you level up more than usual before story, and one-shot every NPC. You'll still have an adventage tho.), so I progressed through it at ease (Except the dragon parts, where I needed to go head-on.), and I completed it, as she completed her personality. She's not a type of assassin without honour, she's not like killing random people just for money/fun, or she's not using her dragonborn powers for personal gain (Spidey-philosophy), instead, she actually delivers justice, and avenges the downtrodden. She's more like Batman, The Dark Knight, except the killing part. And all that Thieves Guild, 'stealing' part, is also like the phiolosophy of Robin Hood, or at least the Cat Woman. In the end, she's a very righteous character, in her own way. I completed a billion small quests, and some big ones like Civil War and The Companions storyline (Actually, all the big ones as far as I know.), and married with Aela (Yep, Aela is a female. Yep, I'm a female. Yep.) before heading to Dawnguard DLC. I've completed Dawnguard as a vampire. I got cured afterwards, but I'm still not sure about being a vampire, since it actually fits the concept of her being a master assassin hiding in shadows, but there are too many downsides; I won't ever be using the Vampire Lord form, since it's totally irellevant with my character, and I don't like its benefits/aesthetics anyways. After that, Dragonborn came out, and I also finished it, which actually fits perfectly to her personality, since the purpose is (kind of) assassinating a corrupt leader as the only assassin (because of being a dragonborn) who can do it, and became a complete Dragonborn. Since then, I'm traveling short distances with Shadowmere, and long distances on a dragon (Not dragon fast-travelling, I'm navigating manually.). I do some unusual things in my spare time in Skyrim, which many can find weird, but I enjoy a lot. For example, I have some favorite places (Which I won't be sharing. Be assured, finding your own places would be much more satisfying.), I sometimes toggle off the running mode, and randomly walk at these places again and again, for hours, never getting bored. I also find books in Skyrim very exciting (There are countless in-game books which you can read. Each one of them are written exclusively, with its unique content.), I have a great intrest in collecting and reading them, and I actually find some of them way more intriguing than many 'popular' real books. Some of which I can recommend: Rising Threat (4 volumes), The Wolf Queen (8 volumes), Kolb and the Dragon (That's probably my favorite book in the game. Not in terms of its story, but it is actually a "choose-your-own-adventure" type of book.), The Black Arrow (2 volumes), A Dance in Fire (7 volumes). As a side note, in my honest opinion, books in Oblivion were better... Before finishing, here are some mods that I use especially for my assassin: - The Dance of Death, a kill-move mod - Higher Jump - Martial Arts - Realistic Crime Radius - Throwing Weapons Redux - Faction Crossbows - Stealth Immersion And, I suppose, that's all. In terms of characters, as you can see, making a character totally unique is pretty simple, it's just a matter of will. Skyrim, or any game for that matter, can only provide you the visualization and tools of role-playing; you have to use your imagination for an advanced FRP experience. And in terms of gaming perspective, you now should have an idea about how I feel about Skyrim, and you probably figured out how different you can approach to the game. In the end, conclusion is actually pretty short, and simple: Skyrim is a must, must, must, MUST have game, and a masterpiece to experience, just like a Mozart concerto, a Shakespeare play, or a trip to one of 7 Great Wonders of the World.

review: Skyrim is the best Elder Scrolls game so far, with the expansions it has gotten even better. I felt that ESIII: Morrowind brought more to the table for its time than ESIV: Oblivion but believe this game has done even more. I have enjoyed it on console, on PC and gone through the DLC which is worth the extra cash. The only thing missing is co-op/multi player but Elder Scrolls Online is running now, although I wish they would have done things a little differently on that game.. Even if your not an Elder Scrolls fan or follower the game is a nice play as it allows you to customize yourself and play in many styles to allow a change up. I did have a few technical issues following the main quest line but just shifted to side quests and other things until I found out how to fix my save. They could have done a litle better on updating to debug some of the common issues or allowed a form of abandoning quests to reset them. Overall I'd say 9.5/10 for what it is as I can't complain about missing features that just weren't supposed to be in the game although I think they coulda just put out a co-op patch/expansion to allow us to play with 1 friend or something which would have enhanced the gameplay alot and expanded the games popularity.

review: The Elder Scrolls V:Skyrim is for me one the best RPG games that I've played. This game is briliant in many ways, the graphics are pretty decent on the year, when the game was released (ofcourse there are many retexture mods that can improve the looks of the game). Combat is pretty sweet too, You can choose which class You want to play and You can combine them in the way You want it. This game with beautiful open-world, many quests, many adventures, and a lot of more great content can give You the best role-playing game experience..

review: The way I see Elder Scrolls series: it's not about beating the game, it's about travel. My first one was Morrowind. I've played Oblivion, but didn't really pay attention to it and I bough Skyrim pretty cheap. So far, eight hours in the game, this is the biggest, most complete, wonderful ES game for true adventurers. You don't play to win, you play to travel, you play to read books, you play to enjoy it through and through. A RPG game like no other, if you didn't play ES games before, get Skyrim and forget about this ugly world we live in...

review: Skyrim (Base Game) - REVIEW What is there to say about this game? Where do I even begin to tackle this monstrosity that has taken me on my 1st playthrough 141 hours just to finish the Skyrim base-game? We're not enough counting the DLC's here...yet! The Elder Scrolls (TES) is 1 of those series that are loaded w/ tons + tons of content, offering up an insane amount of value + "bang for your buck". To experience all of it at once - IMHO, at least for me, that's probably not the wisest ideas. This game has so many different storylines, quests, areas to explore, factions, things to do (i.e. get married) - it's a game you play for numerous hours until you've hit that wall (i.e. "I need a break for a while"); just go away from for a bit; & then it calls you back for more. Very few games do this to me - Test Drive Unlimited 2; Far Cry 3; + Skyrim all come to my mind here. Class systems are gone here in Skyrim. Just practice the attributes you want to want to improve (i.e. sneak around, improve that skilll; swing a 1-handed sworded and hit someone, that improves; cast a spell from a certain school, that improves, etc); + select new abilities from those attributes to learn at level-up time. Since you're constantly improving your attributes + leveling-up like there's no tomorrow, this can be addictive - think like that Diablo-like kind of addictive. Skyrim has improved in numerous ways over its predecessor. Graphically, on the technical side, the game is much better than Oblivion. Girls actually do look more so like girls (in the face, namely), this time around - thanks for finally getting this right, Bethesda; it took you long enough! While many of the game areas are nowhere as crazy + interesting as Oblivion's Shivering Isles expansion (my favorite area in any TES game since starting in the series w/ Morrowind). These lands have a Nordic influence on them + most of them truly do look fantastic. Likely, if you see an area way out in the distance, there's a great chance - you can go there + explore it completely, which is fantastic. Combat here has improved & is a bit more visceral than Oblivion - but, when compared to others, it certainly is still a little bit clunky (like most TES games) + does not rival the combat of other games like Kingdom of Amalur: Reckoning + Dark Souls (those games certainly do specialize in combat) - it's still pretty good here in Skyrim. One thing that's new - you can now dual-wield weapons; can even wield magic in one hand, a weapon in another; dual-wield different magic spells in each hands; and/or even dual-wield the same magic spell (for double the power). Simply put - these are great additions to this game's combat system. NPC's in the game-world actually have taken a page right out of the Gothic play-book, as you will see NPC's doing things to immerse you into the world - i.e. blacksmith sharpening blades with equipment; NPC's acting on schedules + doing things together on their own; + things of that natures. As usual, there's even more books added to read, for those who want to dwelve into the ever-expanded + ridiculously-sized Lore of the series. The main story here is this - dragons have returned to Skyrim, you're to meet a certain group of people to fulfill your destiny as the Dragonborn (a human that can learn dragon skills), learn Dragon-style shouts, & take the Dragons out once + for all - which is typical fantasy stuff. While the main quest is decent enough + is solid, it really feels like it's just another quest in the game - like many of the main quests in Elder Scrolls base-games since Morrowind. While Bethesda is no BioWare + no Obsidian when it comes to generating fantastic narrative, prose + dialogue - where Bethesda succeeds over just about every other of the game companies is creating insanely huge playgrounds that have a good deal normally going on w/ tons to accomplish, if you like what you're doing. Trust me - this is another addictive sandbox from Bethesda, in which you won't know how to let go of for a while or after being away for a while, it will eventually get you coming back for more. While not everything here is a home-run, there are also many good-to-great plots + storyline strings here - such as the Thieves Guild's quest-line + especially Dark Brotherhood quest-lines, that I don't even know where to begin. Skyrim will generate some random quests on its own, which often do wind-up in the Misc section - which could keep you going for a long time. As if the base-game couldn't do that enough already, making this game such a time-sink - throw in also that the game ships w/ the Toolkit these days & the ridiculous amount of mods out there b/c this series has an extremely heavy modding community + fanbase - you could live for 100's of hours in Skyrim, even long well after it takes finishing the insane amount of content that Bethesda has already provided. If there's something about Skyrim you don't like - i.e. the UI isn't that great, again; even though it's improved immensely over Oblivion - trust me, there's a mod out there to fix your issue w/ the game. For example - SkyUI Mod vastly improves + fixes Bethesda's UI-system immesely. By offering up a huge sandbox & an insane amount of things to do (from questing to exploring) here, Skyrim succeeds in proving again why Bethesda + their Elder Scrolls is 1 of the best - if not, the best - at providing addictive time-sink RPG's. Bethesda yet again offers up the kitchen sink here; I'll certainly drink to that + from that. RPG fans looking to get lost for 100's of hours, it's almost impossible to rival what Bethesda does in their games - & that's especially true here in Skyrim. Simply put - another RPG masterpiece from Bethesda. Final Grade = A+

review: 10/10 Would Mod again One of the best experiences I have had during my many gaming experiences,  the game was so amazing on console I was forced to buy it again on pc, and thats saying somthing due to the fact that half the fun in this game is to see how much you can mod the  out of it until it crashes your poor little pc. Do yourself a favor if you have not tried this game out go an buy it and hopefully have as much fun with it as I have.

review: Skyrim is easily one of the best games of this generation. Its one of the games that you get as much out of as you put in. Its also one of the games you play exactly how you want to play. You can choose to ignore the main story immediately after beginning or play through the quests like a linear action adventure game. Speaking of quests, theres an awful lot of them. The main story is centred on the return of dragons to the world. Pretty soon, you find out you are the legendary Dragonborn, a man or woman with the ability to consume dragon souls. Its your job to find out why the reptiles have returned and try and protect the world from this new menace. two thumbs from me! because the game deserves it.

review: This game is honestly the best game I've played. I've sat down and played countless hours on the elder scrolls games but this tops it off. A great follow up and so much better than elder scrolls online that was recently released as the next in the series. If you are skeptical of this game still I'm not done yet. There are thousands of hours of modding put in by a dedicated modding community that adds around 1000+ hours of new content just by using the mods from the workshop, if youve looked at the workshop and it doesnt look big with only 10,000 mods, you have the nexus with over 30,000 that adds so much to your game and if you have complaints there is a mod for it that changes it and makes your experience amazing and fully immersive. The game challenges you to patience and choosing the right moment to do things and it really adds in an immersive way of living in the elder scrolls with full ability to extend your abilites in the largest scale open world map ever made. You can slaughter a city of the rebels - the stormcloaks, or delve deep into dungeons recovering powerful artifacts that can help you on your way to the top of the chain. As your progress your story the way the people of skyrim treat you differentiates, you can slay a dragon and they start to say "Youve slain a few dragons in your time" Or when you become the whisperer of the dark brotherhood you find npcs every so often that use the dark brotherhood greeting "hail sithis". There is a whole new experience to everything you have ever experienced in a game. Buy the game.

review: The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is an epic fantasy RPG games where you can countless of hours in-game. You want to be an Archer? Grab a bow + heaps of arrows and start shooting people like a boss! You want to be a Swordsman? Wield or dual wield the countless amount of weapons in Skyrim and start slashing peoples! You want to be a Sneaky Basterd? Level up your One-handed, Sneaking, Speech, Lockpicking & Pickpocketing and you can be silent as f*ck killing people and grab their $$$ or talk your way through to get things go down your way! In this game, you imagine what you cannot achieve in real life. The world is massive, the mechanism is flawless and there's infinite amount of quest that you can do in this game. Of course there's bug here and there but in its way, this game is fun to play. Don't forget the amount of mods already available today. After 3 years of its release, this game is still living and mod is one of many reasons Skyrim still one of the most played game. I myself play this game with using mods that increase immersive such as RnD and I imagine being a Solo-Player like Kirito with Elucidator & Dark Repulser. Do what you want, be what you want. Welkommen to Skyrim!

review: I don't care what anyone says, Skyrim is one of the greatest games I have EVER played, I have dedicated SOOO much time into it, (Yes i know on my profile it says I haven't played it for all THAT long but I never really played it while connected to the internet so yeah) There was a time when I would play skyrim for close to 12 hours a day (yep sure did take my life away from me) It was actually my very first steam game. After dedicating even more time in TES IV Oblivion, I eventually got Skyrim in 2012 and I will admit that after creating all kinds of characters I did eventually get tired of it, that was until I discovered MMOxReview on Youtube (Great guy, check him out :)) I then started modding my skyrim game, and a once Great game turned into something legendary... Now to be honest I wasn't all THAT fond of the Main quest, BUT the thieves guild and Dark brotherhood in these games has always really inspired me, I just wish they could have made them both longer :( Unfortuantly I have never played the expansions for Skyrim seeing as though I can't afford it :( Yeah i know, sad isn't it, But that hasn't stopped me from playing Skyrim over and OVER again... TES Online... let's just say I probs will never play it because I just don't really like the looks of it. And I am VERY keen for TES VI (I think it is going to be set in Hammerfell) Please tell me if you would like me to write a guide for this game, I am quite happy to and I promise I won't use any of that noob language if i do. I highly recommend this game, I give it a score of 9.5/10 Have a nice day ;)

review: The anticipations were Very high for this game months before it's release, maybe even months before this game even had it's first piece of gameplay shown. Reason being it's successful predecessor The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion. A game that soley revolutionized the western RPG scene completely, with true next generation graphics and depths. Going even further back we have yet another giant and just an astonishly beautiful and incredible game - The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind. I can not begin to explain The Elder Scrolls to someone who never heard about it. The last 3 games have all recieved Game of the Year's and been just hands-down, non-negotiable, best selling and mind-blowing epic games. It is hard to talk about any individual Elder Scrolls game without mentioning any of the other games and the bigger picture. All the latest Elder Scrolls games are in the top 5 of my favorite games of all time, ALL THREE OF THEM. Hell, The Elder Scrolls series is better than the Half-Life series... Have you any idea what that means? How much confusion this causes to my beloved Half-Life? No you don't. These games are better than the best. One more paragraph of how awesome Elder Scrolls are before getting to Skyrim. These games keep my up at night, I dream of them by day, they make me smie, they make me cry, I love them, I hate them, they change me, they leave me, I conquer them, I resign to them, they are my soul, they are my heart, We are one. Oh Tamriel, why are you a fictional world? Why are you not real, I long for you, I live inside of you, from Vvardenfell to Summerset Isle, from the great glaciers of Skyrim to the cursed realm of Oblivion, from Fargoth the Bosmer to the Adoring Fan. If I ever truly worship something, it got to be The Elder Scrolls. You are my drug. Skyrim is the weakest of them. It's Morrowinds and Oblivions little sister. Yet it is the most popular one, how is that possible? Well there's just something about dragons, isn't there? An RPG with dragons is always an RPG with DRAGONS! Flying immortal beasts that breathe fire and are legends with the Gods themselves. Skyrim got very successful thanks to that console generations drought and the lack of good games to play, also because all Elder Scrolls games are being successful surprises. With at least 5 years in between each game the fan base have had a good long while to linger in their despair and demands, giving growth to something called Hype (Good example: Half-Life 3). I will never get to the actual game itself, will I? It's a western RPG! What else is there to say, expect role-playing with normal sized swords and not some Japanese bananza. You are set in the province of Skyrim, which is not the most northern one, but it sure as hell feels like it. Skyrim is like the opposite of a really good book, instead of giving you a story and the rest is up to your imagination - like books do. Skyrim gives you the imagination and you ARE the story, you play the Dragonborn, a son of Dragons, of Septim. The rest is up to you. Skyrim does not feel like home, oh no, you are in a hostile world where you constantly feel threatened. The key thing in Skyrim is the atmosphere, there is nothing quite like it. Same goes for all Elder Scrolls - again. So much visually appealing flora and architecture, a living world with animals and creatures roaming about. Then there is the Extremely in depth story that only the true fans will explore. Who were the Akaviri? What lies beyond Tamriel? what happened to the Dwemers? Nerevarine? Is Kvatch rebuilt? Is the Adoring Fan finally dead? Is Azura the best Godess Ever? etc. Questions that will live on through all games to come, questions that never can be truly answered because that would break the rules. You, whomever you choose to be, will slowly get used to this hostile world as you expore the story and build your own. Kill stuff, get loot and level up. Focus on Health, Stamina or Mana - depending on your class build; Brute force, Striking Speed or Cunning Magic. As you choose your path, you will encounter people to lead you and people to stop you, join the appropriate guild and do side quests. Take sides, fight battles, even fall in love and get married, buy or build (Hearthfire) a house, adopt a child. Encounter the most mythical of creatures - Spriggans, Werewolves, Giants, Vampires (Dawnguard). Use Shouts to cause only the havok Dragons can, or spend your time stealing from the rich and give to... yourself? In the end, you will stand all mighty and look upon yourself, like an author looks upon his work. You will look back on the days of struggle, on the days of joy - and you will realize that it's far from over. You will spend hundreds of hours in Skyrim, because that's what you are meant to do. Hopefully you will have more questions than ever when you leave the game aside. You will use this hunger to explore other worlds and look upon your real life and use the fictional beauty to define... What the  am I talking about?

review: Wow! I spent almost 200 hours playing Skyrim and that was without any DLC. Excellent value for money. If you are a completionist and enjoy doing side-quests then this is the game for you. There is so much to do it is almost overwhelming, but an excellent map system can always keep you on track for your chosen quest. Brilliant game.

review: Before Skyrim, there was Oblivion. It was flawed, unbalanced, dated and had DLC for horse-armour, and yet it was still loved because despite these things, it was still one of the best games of this genre. Skyrim is Oblivion but without the bad bits. I still don't understand why there aren't more games like this. You are let loose in a massive open world and are allowed to do what ever you want. The closest games to it would be MMOs or Grand Theft Auto, but Skyrim is a single-player experience. You'd think that this would make it lifeless and unrewarding, but you couldn't be more wrong. The entire world is lovingly hand-crafted. Every character you see had to be placed there. They had their face, personality and clothing picked by a developer of this game... and then you're free to come along and end their life with one slash of a blade. Or not. The choice is yours. I didn't expect much from this game. I had kind of seen through Oblivion and it became lifeless for me, and I thought that since this was constrained by the same hardware that it wouldn't be a large leap, but I was so wrong. I couldn't wait to explore every crag and valley simply for the sake of it, accompanied by the amazing LOTR-style soundtrack. I happily gobbled up the quests and have had countless exciting memories of this game where I've accidentally picked a fight with some one bigger than me, or where the game glitches out spectacularly. What ever happens, it's a joy to behold. Even if you're not a fan of this sort of genre (come on, who isn't? The Elder Scrolls games are a genre in their own right!) you need to play this game. Get it when it's cheap and you'll more than get your money's worth, even if you only play a fraction of what there is to see and do. You can live a virtual life as a fisherman, merchant or fighter and unlike the older games which required a bit of imagination to pull off, this one has the depth and complexity required to make it enjoyable. The down-sides? The dragons are too easy to defeat, though this game has since been patched to include harder ones. You'll hate it when somebody dies through no fault of your own (damn you, radiant AI!) and you're left with an empty shop where you once purchased your stuff. You'll end up with far too much in your inventory as you plunder tombs and your companions become more of a burden than a help as you level up, transforming into mules to carry your rubbish as you battle against the undead. But really, who is going to be reading this review without an idea of what this game is like? Who hasn't seen the thousands of mods available for free for this game? They make the vanilla 100's of hours of gameplay turn into 1000's. You'll have no life for weeks after picking this game up! In short: buy this game.

review: Skyrim is by far the best video game There is so much freedom so much exploring and you can always find something to do in this game. The graphics are incredible which leads to incredible landscape views all the around the world. There is plenty of things to fight, places to go and things to find. There is also hundreds of items in the game . The game is very complex so you may think it is hard to learn but when I played for the first time I got the feel for the game in only days! and most i like the mod especialy the kaboobies ;p I highly recommend this game!

review: The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim has got to be one of the most worked on games of 2011 and 2 years on, it still doesn't fail to impress. The amazing work put into the game has definitly paid off with hours upon hours of things to do. The game works amazing on every platform from PS3, Xbox and PC. As I have experienced from the console versions, the loading screens take quite a long time and there are many glitches that happen every time you play. This is 100% different with the PC version as the loading screens are very quick, even on the top graphics settings and the glitches are much less frequent. Pros: - Amazing graphics - Amazing stroyline - A high selection of weapons - Amazing character interface - Easy to use controls - Large amount of side quests Cons: - A few glitches I would give The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim a well earned 10/10!

review: The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is one of those games that ultimately grants you the freedom to do the things that you can only do in your imaginative mind. For example, you can kill people in bars, villages, castles, stands, anytime you want, however you want. Killing by doing a finishing touch is my favorite part of the game. You can have a pet, wife, build a house and do a lot of varied things. Though what makes this game better is the mods, you can do tons of things with it and do a lot of hilarious crap, stunts, sex, movie scenes and other crazy stuff. This game just never ends and there's always things to do even if you don't want to do quests. Dragons, monsters, spirits, horses, women, potatoes, and stealing things craftily are all huge features in the game. Now, finally, don't be like me who waited to buy this game on sale and not pay the full price of it. Because it is definitely worth your money!

review: I've been a fan of The Elder Scrolls series for a while, and I think Skyrim is definitely a worthy addition to that line of games. Skyrim is a huge, immersive, lore-filled, immense world full of character. You can explore, fight, collect, or just wander around like a tourist taking screenshots. Even after playing for a couple of years, I still constantly find new places to explore and new experiences to be had. Everything about this game is extremely detailed and well thought-out, from the crafting system to the player homes, from dungeon layouts, to the races of the different NPCs you encounter and the way they use their culture to express themselves in their clothing, armor, weapons, homes, and towns. If the hundreds of hours offered by the game itself isn't enough, there are literally thousands of mods for Skyrim, offering everything from texture enhancements to full cinematic lighting effects. There are hours and hours of additional fan-made quests and storylines, in addition to the three official DLC expansions offered by Bethesda. New NPCs, pets, followers, houses, towns, armor, weapons, food, ingredients -- you can probably find a mod to change or add to almost any aspect of Skyrim. In this way, you can keep the game fresh and new, even after hundreds of hours of play. If you break it down to dollars spent per hour played it's probably one of the best deals in gaming.

review: Skyrim is amazing, defiantly recommend for medieval lovers. Here is a poem I wrote about Skyrim! Skyrim the sky was blue, it was true snowy mountains, huge lands the one who seeks adventure didn't know what he had inside what he could do, with the power could he fly, could he reach the sky no, but he was the dragonborn the one and only who could defeat the ancient ones the ones who could fly, glide and attack track their foes, eat their toes the dragonborn can intake their soul he can kill any sort of troll sword slashing, kicking and bashing loot the things you have killed sell the items, receive money and then buy a bunny burn a chicken, raid a house be stealthy like a tiny mouse get married or become a wizard like Harry Potter level up by doing quests to become the best but now you're crying because the villager was lying then you come back into reality and realise it`s only a game!

review: This game is not a "love it or hate it", it's a "love it AND hate it". Sometimes while playing I think to myself: "This is THE game, it's just a dream come true, is it real?", but the next moment it might change to: "This is the most stupid waste of time I've ever paid for". First of all, it is HUGE. It is enormous. I've done 300 hours into it and I'm still in the middle of the main quest. It's got everything: fights, spells, potions, horses, dogs, children, marriages, dragons, clothes, bookcases, treasure maps, grocery stores, pagan worshipping, war, armageddon, waterbreething, dead naked sorceresses in bikinis, mysterious ancient civilisations, glowing mushrooms, mammoths, zombies and lots, lots, lots of bugs. It is very beautiful, especially at night, when you see the northern lights shining, but also very ugly when the low and high resolution textures are messing up in front of you. It's got so many quests, tasks, characters and places, I think even developers don't know them all. It is a gem for those who like to explore and discover the territory for themselves. Each cave has something in it, each ruin might conceal a secret, each village might have a mystery to uncover. The freedom of choice given to the player is unnatural. You can be a werewolf, a vampire, a mage, a warrior, an archer, a thief, an assassin, a blacksmith, a miner, an alchemist, on top of the dragonslayer and The Chosen One, and most of that you can be at the same time. This schizophrenic development of the character results in a no less chaotic gameplay. You have swords, bows, daggers, maces, spells, magic staffs, magic scrolls, and dragon shouts, all of which you can use as weapons. You meet all sorts of enemies and you're free to deal with them by any means you prefer. There is no special weapon for a giant. You don't really have to use spells against a mage. Moral choices are also a blur. There is no "proper" or "right" way, really, you just do stuff and get stuff happen as a result. It's not a bad thing to use conjuration spells, necromancy is not punishable, poisons are as legal as healing potions, there is no white or black magic. Sometimes it's impossible to understand if you're doing good or bad. I think the only thing that stops freedom from being absolute is the quests. If developers would remove the quest lines as such, turning them into a mass of random tasks you can perform in any sequence, at any time (and preferably at any place with any character), it would make the game a triumph of freedom (and a complete mess). So, Skyrim is a beautiful, ugly, strict, messy, very stupid and very clever game, which everyone should play at least once. On the easy level it is almost casual, no effort is required to deal with the fights. It can be played on a Mac through Crossover, but it is sluggish no matter how low the graphics settings are.

review: This game is the most enjoyful and expensive drug that will ever be created. This game is just amazing! Great game and PC mods make it look amazing and a lot more fun. There is no doubt about this game being Game of the Year following Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion. This game is fantastic with its detail and perfected gameplay that puts gaming in RPG's on a whole new level. I am looking forward to the next installment of the Elder Scrolls whenever they can get it out as quickly as possible. However long that may be I will be putting my hours and life into this game as it requires that devotion with all the quests and aspects to understand them. I have played other generations of Elder Scrolls and I have not been disappointed yet. This is a fantastic franchise of games

review: How could anyone not love Skyrim? With mods abound to customize your game, it's a game that keeps on giving long after you get into it. I absolutely love this game, and if I wasn't running on a very weak computer I'd probably never stop playing it and modding it. I suggest Skyrim to anyone who has never played it, or even playing it on PC vs Console (the modding capabilities to change the way your game looks and plays are so much better than console -- take it from someone who first played Skyrim on her Xbox.) Absolutely well worth the money and an excellent game that you cannot put down.

review: Step 1 - Buy the game Step 2 - Mod the game until someone comes to your room and asks you ''What movie is this?'' The campaign is short but a great one. You have to save the world from the dragons who are led by Alduin, the most evil dragon....basically that is all there is when it comes to the campaign. But apart from that there is a story you create on your own with a rich and detailed open world to explore and million other cool side missions to do. This game doesn't hold your hand at all, you can approach the game in anyway you want by becoming a Thief, a Vampire, a Werewolf etc etc you can also join different groups like the Dark Brotherhood for example, you can join the empire and become an Imperial or join the Stormcloak rebels to free Skyrim from the empire influence. Crafting, Smithing, Enchanting, Marriage, Adoption, Purchase a house, Learning spells, Cooking etc, this game has so much to offer it will literally consume you. Astonishing graphics (especially with mods), amazing soundtracks and endless quests. This game is a masterpiece! Worth every penny! Personal Rating: 10/10 Greatest Open World RPG of all times

review: It may seem odd to review a game I have not finished, so take that into account as you read this. I first played the Elder Scrolls series with Morrowind. Back then I thought it was the coolest thing ever. Huge world, tons of monsters and weapons. At the time though I was big into MMOs so I felt very disconnected from the game. Alone. So my time with the game was short, and I never finished the main campaign. When Oblivion came out, I gave it a try, and instantly was reminded of Morrowind and why I lost interest in the game. So I probably played it for only a few hours my first time in. Elder Scrolls games are a fickle thing though... you see screenshots, hear about other people having fun, see Mod updates, and before you know it. BOOM. Right back in you go and you forget why you ever left. My right back in was Skyrim. So much hype, so much graphical goodness. I resisted for a LONG time, then came a Steam Sale and I was in. The game... Wow, so much better. Is it the dragons? Hell yes it is the dragons! I have about 50+ hours on record as I type this, and I go off and on playing the game so as not to get burned out on it. I modded it up as best I could and I think it makes it that much better. Graphics - Just amazing! Even unmodded this game looks stunning. Character models less so than the world itself, but still a great show for the eyes. Sound - I'm no audiophile, but I tend to get drawn in more if the sound is good. This game does not disappoint. Music, voice acting, sound effects, all perfect. The first time I fought a dragon, and it came swooping in and bathed the ground around me in fire, I was amazed at how awesome it sounded (surround sound headset of course!). Do yourself a favor and really crank the volume. Again, I am not finished the game. Will I ever? Who knows, and who cares. I am having fun so that is all that matters. If you are holding off for similar reasons that I was, wait for a sale like I did. But don't deny yourself the experience if you can. It is totally worth it.

This goes on until you no longer remember what your original goal was, that is the beauty of Skyrim and Elder Scrolls. Exploration, rewarding gameplay, choices (you are not given as much freedom in choices as you were in Morrowind, though) and funny  bugs that have always defined Elder Scrolls to me.

review: Ok, so the first thing i have to say here is that i'm in love with this game XD When i first saw the trailer for Skyrim i was like: "ohh...ok...another awesome video, filled with some good actions scenes and a lot of graphic magic to make it look better than the game really is...", meaning i liked the trailer but was kinda unsure if it was true to the game or if i was gonna be dissapointed to have an enhanced video and then the game would be below the expectations of it. BUT...this was the FIRST TIME EVER that a game completelly surprised me, i was blown away the first time i was able to play the game. Skyrim trully delivered what it was offering in the trailer. It's a big game and has a LOT to explore and a lot of hours for the players to get lost in it XD Its a massive game with a vast world to explore, lots of races to choose from to keep you satisfied, a bunch of weapons and spells to your hearts content, enumerous monsters and enemies to fight, so many roads and choices you can make to decide your fate in the storyline and you can be anything and follow each and every road in one single character, you don't have to start a new game to uncover all the paths in the game. Of course if you want to fully explore the game to its limits you will have to play with other races to discover some tiny things that are specific to each race. You can be anyone and do almost everything is the game: be a hunter and slay wild animals; be a miner and explore the depts of mines and find rare minerals; become a fearsome warrior and fight for the rebels agains the empire; join the companions and become a fearsome beast and transform into a werefolf to fight your enemies; explore the dark arts and become an assassin to work for hire for the dark brotherhood; join the thieves guild and become a master in sneaking, lockpicking, stealing and killing your enemies with one blow without them even noticing you; join the college of Winterhold, learn and practice to master all the spells to become a powerful arch-mage.... I could go on and on and on, on what you could do inside the game hehehe...........is THAT big :D I do advise to take some time to fully explore this game, this is not one of those games on wich you play like a speddy to get to the end and know the finalle. Its a waste to go and play it like that so do take your time, explore and uncover its secrets, its gonna be worth it :) The controls and gameplay are very easy to master in a couple of minutes so you will move around like you own the place in no time. At first, you must take your time and explore the skyrim world to find all the locations you need to go. It consumes a bit of time (but you won't even trully notice it if you're doing quests), the less patient people might complain about it a bit but once you discover all locations you can teleport to that location anytime you want in the future, thru your map. Map and menus are very easy to use as well and are very simple and well explained. You have every information you need explicit on your inventory and other menus. All the info for the quests is also there in the quests log, all you have to do is activate it and follow the arrows, litterally LOL but be advised that in a few quests and side-quests you may not encounter all the work done for you to acomplish it and you need to do a little digging yourself. Your character keeps evolving thru out the entire game(and after you end it as weel if you keep playing with the same character), it levels up as you use your powers, skills and as you finish quests, wich gives you some skill points to use as you see fit. I also strongly advise to always keep multiple saves, the game isn't all that glichy or even has a lot of bugs but, as every game, its not without its flaws. Sometimes you might get stuck on a mission or an AI character might not be doing what it should...it autosaves but to prevent that from happening you should always keep an extra pair of saves, its not a big thing and it doesnt consume much time, it takes less than a minute to do it and it ensures that your game runs smoothdly and you can always go back if you did something wrong or if you wanna deal with a situation differently. OK this review is going long so i'll just finish up by saying its a 5 star game for me and i strongly advise you guys to, at least once, try and play the game and dont jump into conclusions by what other people say, unless you have played the game yourselves.

And if you are board of the vanilla quests, or you just compleated them all (highly unlikely) Skyrim is one of the easiest games to mod, workshop and nexis combined! Also, quest mods aren't the only mods out thare. Thare are follower mods, weppon mods, magic mods, and so much more! If you don't alredy have the game, take it from me... GET THE GAME!!! 753 stars out of 5. You will most likely never get board in this game! you can spend a year on the game and still not compleat all of the quests.

review: Well,what can i say about skyrim(i am brazilan ,so if my english is not as good as it should be sorry)skyrim is a game about someone who wake up in carriage and is going to be executed be things he/she did or not ,everything could be just a mistake or this "someone" could have killed a whole city, a king or nothing,when "someone" is going to be executed when a dragon (that can be his worst enemy or a "friend" it depends of one little(or not) thing that i will say later) shouts and stops the executation of "someone" (ironically or not) saving his life, someone will later be helped by two mans, one stormcloak(nord rebels that want skyrim to be of the nords again, and destroy the imperials) and one imperial (imperial is a race and a faction the imperials want to stop the stormcloack and... i think is just this) "someone" is very lucky ,later he/she will or not discover that he/she can absorv dragon souls and use a thing called shout, and that he/she is something called dragonborn/dovahkinn ,this someonecan have great adventures , "someone" can own and build a house,get married,adopt a child,be a vampire or a vampire hunter,can defeat the first dragonborn/dovahkin ,ride dragons, help the daedra and get special artifacts as a reward,ride horses,fight giants,dragons,undeads,machines and other things, explore the dwemer/dwarve ruins,become the leader of the companions,the archmage of the college of winterhold ,the commander/or something like this of the imperial/stormcloaks ,and many many other things. but returning to someone what his story(that is the little thing)? what race is he/she? is it male or female? you decided and everything will happen in skyrim a beatiful place that has some "dimensional problems" like dead things starting to fly like... cows,dead bodys suddently dissapearing and other thigns skyrim is a open world rpg ,but what is special about skyrim? it is like a book that every time that you read a page another two pages appears on the book,you make your own decisions ,your own story or take a pre-made history and build made by other player ,make or use mods, that can add a little change or change the whole skyrim to something better or worst now my personal opinion, skyrim is the best rpg i played in my whole life, i hope you enjoy it and help this already big community of player become even bigger,if you have enough money i suggest you to buy it,then install take something to eat and drink sit in a comfortable place like your bed or a chair and put (if you have ) your headphones listen or not a music or skyrim soundtrack and have fun (ps: don't lost opportunities because you were playing skyrim)

review: Who's rapping? Dovahkiin Dragons? I'm not over keen I'll dice them like a knife Slicing right through an aubergine. My dragon shout flow Is sweeter than a SodaStream You won't belive your eyes I'm like an overload of dopamine A broadsword in one hand,and a magic spell in the other. I'm the last of the Dragonborn There's no other,my brother so run for cover. If you've got scales,then I'm on your tail,and I will not fail. Like a free-roaming sandbox game. I'm off the rails,I'll walk the trail,through awful gales,and storms of hail. 'Til all the nails Are knocked into your coffin,I'm not stopping. 'Til you're impaled,and I've prevailed. In the name of the Nords,I pray to the lords. You all get a taste of the blade of my sword. I'm taking on hordes of enemies,I face them with hoards of weaponry. They're draining my force,so chemistry comes into play with retorts and recipes. Alchemixing like a DJ,Restoration,restore my energy. My legacy,odyssey,elegy,prophecy's,written in heavenly bodies,and buried with every body that ever did bother to mess with me deading them terribly,horribly,I'm a celebrity,honestly,you're a wannabe,I'm a prodigy. The suggestion you're better than me at being a warrior? Ha! comedy. It's a gift to me,I don't just spit flames lyrically,but literally,and the Elder Scrolls are scripts,in witch I've written your obituary. I am the Dragonborn,wearing a hat with badass horns. I'm Dovahkiin,known globally,You're nobody at all. =) BY DAN BULL )

review: I met a friendly woman who offered me some food if i went into her house. I took the food she offered and found a secret passage way into a basement where I discovered she was a witch. I took nothing. But when I walked out, she attacked me. I killed her, took everything she owned, walked to the nearest blackmarket and sold everything I could. No more witch I guess.

review: Skyrim is one of those breath taking video games that goes on to become a Legend. The open world gameplay will make the world come alive to you. While you are the main character, not everyone else revolves around you and your character. You will find npc hunting, working their day to day jobs, children running and playing tag, people praying to their gods and much more. But you still can interact with them. which can start new quest's, the option to have a follower and more. The main quest line alone is a piece of art and will keep you busy for a good bit of time. If you really enjoy your social life than this game is not for you. Because once you start; your not likely to stop anytime soon. Good luck on your new adventure hero and Don't forget to check out the mods for this game. There are quest mods to add even more gameplay hours, New weapons, Player homes, new worlds, and Even exploding chickens.

The mods will keep you entertained once you have played it for 200+ hours, Which is one of the reasons to have this on the pc. If you're thinking about getting this game you deffinitly should! It keeps you entertained for hours and it feels like minutes.

review: Oh my god, who doesn't think this game is a game of the year? Sure it has it's fair share of glitches but please name one, GREAT, game that doesn't glitch and heck, half the time their quite funny. It's an amazing single-player experience you'll only get once every few years. I started playing it once and could never stop, it's so fun. Over 800 hours in this game i can tell you that this game is a must buy if you don't have it. The only things that could be improved on this is perhaps a co-op mode because who else thinks exploring Tamrial with a friend is awesome? This game is so immense, chocked full of wonderful content. This is a must buy, 10/10

review: The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, one of the most in-depth games you will ever encounter. Many quests and stories to tell, you can instantly conjecture when you are born into the world of Skyrim. In the beginning of the game, you emerge as a captive member held by the imperial army, captive from trying to cross the border of Skyrim. Sitting in the carriage with your fellow captive thieves and bandits, questioning where you are flowing. As youre held captive by the solders in the carriage, being carried over the roads to Helgan. As youre being kicked off the carriage, held in your queues to your beheading, you notice your foes worried about a large scream across the lands of Skyrim. As you place your head on the pedestal, ready for your penalty, the scream becomes stronger. All of the sudden, a dragon appears, landing upon the castle to your left, he speaks in his dragon tongue and destroys Helgan. This is your time to escape, and begin your journey in the world of Skyrim. Who knows what this frozen land has in store for you. The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is a action role-playing game, allowing you to create and customise your character, join a race and choose how your character handles in dangerous encounters, there is a range of possibilities to role-play in the world of Skyrim. The game is playable in a first person perspective or in a third person perspective, both can be toggled easily by using the scroll wheel. The game encourages you to freely roam the environment, finding dungeons, towns, abstract structures and a range of side-quests to find while following the main quest, this allows the player to freely choose which quests the player can freely choose to conquest. The atmosphere the world of Skyrim creates is outstanding. Viewing this frozen nation in its misfortune is interesting and viewing the world revovle around you. As you progress throughout of the story, you get view different cultures and view how people live in various cities as you progress through the story. You can fully view how people and what people are willing to do to survive the events and the catastrophe of the lands of Skyrim. Viewing the scenery at its best adds to the atmosphere, looking out into the distance and spotting the large mountains standing tall and superior with a hint of snow on the peak, ruins standing, capable of anything, do you dare to enter? Then looking down the plains of land, grass blowing in the wind. The scenery an essential characteristic to the world of Skyrim. Graphically, the game is outstanding, this statement is considered even without graphical modifications. The game has high resolution textures, this being the ultra graphical setting, but if youre feeling curious, you can get even better textures with the free downloadable content that Bethesda Game Studios offer. Adding onto the graphical discussion on The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is something I mentioned earlier, the scenery. The scenery is just breath-taking. If these visuals arent enough for you, the graphical modifications created by the community are phenomenal, I couldnt recommend more that you browse through some videos on YouTube of them, but on the negative side, some are very intensive to your computer unlike the default textures. Talking about the performance of The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, the game is polished and the performance is outstanding. This is a enormous statement, but the game could almost run perfectly well on any PC. Ive know many people who have ran The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim on a laptop without messing with any graphical settings, running smoothly of course. This truly shows the effort in the development cycle that Bethesda Game Studios has put into the game. On the unfortunate side of this, I wish that the game was supported for multiple operating systems, but alternatives can be found to still play the game on different operating systems. Content; the department that The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim does not disappoint. Approximately the game has around 300 + hours of content, this isnt including modifications. If you feel that this isnt enough, you have modifications to add extra quests and various other content, The Elder Scrolls community is talented for creating these outstanding modifications. Now finally, to the conclusion to The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. This game is well worth every single penny, the amount of effort that the developers have established into this game. To you, the reader, I recommend you buy this game, take your time while playing the game to look at the detail this game contains because this game deserves the title along the side of the Elder Scrolls games.

review: Having played 90+ hours of Skyrim this past week, I figured that I should write a review on it. First of all, I had to said this is an amazing SandBox+ RPG experience. I am someone who enjoyed doing side quests as well as misc quests as a mean to earn more money. I got to say that till now I had not finish the story as there are so much more to do. I was pleasantly surprised initially when I see people with over 2000~4000+ hours of gameplay time. All I can say is Skyrim had just that much content especially if you include all the DLCS. I mean just building a single house took me more than 2 hours, not to mention the fact that I had to design and decorate my own house. It pretty much a chore that feel great after you are done with it. I am also barely done exploring Skyrim after 90 hours in, the combat are extremely fluid and animated especially when you do a sneak attack. There are many other great elements in Skyrim such as pick-locking which can be extremely frustrating but fun to play around with. I had never been this impressed with a RPG before and I definitely think Skyrim is by far the best I had played so far for this price. I definitely recommend this game to every RPG lovers, you won't ever regret it especially if you enjoyed other RPG such as The Witcher as well as Fable.

review: The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim: -Field Rating 9 -Graphics 9 About Graphics: -Skyrim is a beautiful game, made even more beautiful by the extremely active modding community. The engine was a wonderful leap from the previous engine we saw in Oblivion and the Fallout series. The details in the environments are wonderful reminders of just how intricate the world really is. -Gameplay 9 About Gameplay: -Skyrim lives up to its Elder Scrolls name, granting us the freedom to craft our own story, in a gigantic world where you can spend hours simply exploring. The combat has seen a huge improvement since the days of Oblivion, with the ability to dual-wield chaning up gameplay styles wonderfully. The physics however, are still as wonky as ever. Sometimes with hilarious results. You won't get tired of wandering around this world. -Story 9 About Story: Enough interest to drive you forward, and plenty of lore to keep you distracted, Skyrim finds the wonderful balance of permeating the world with the story, yet giving you the freedom to advance the plot when you wish. Multiplayer: No Depressingly: no. Replay-ability: 9 -The only thing that will stop you from coming back to Skyrim for awhile is completely burning yourself out. But then the cycle repeats. Overall 9/10 -Being a long time Elder Scrolls fan, Skyrim was a welcome breath after the much loved, much played Oblivion. The freedom, the scope, and the environment are great. The graphics are beautiful. Though none of the Elder Scrolls since Morrowind have yet captured the full extent of the magic that made Morrowind so great, Skyrim has been a huge push in the right direction. A must buy for any RPG or open-world gaming fan.

review: Wow. The only word that I can use to describe this game is "Misleading." I have over 320 hours on this game, and I have yet to even see the Skyrim. I've tried Googling the location of the rim, but to no avail. This game doesn't even have helicopters to use to even get to the rim! Like, wtf Activision? Fix your game. This is the biggest waste of 74 Euros ever. I even installed the Beautiful Males mod because I got tired of looking at Battlefield to get me off, and that doesn't even do it. The  physics are atrocious. No flopping, no particle effects, nothing. Why would you put naked men in the game if it isn't even arousing? I guess the snow is ok, but nowhere near the quality of the snow in that one level of Call of Duty. I can't remember which one, though. Graphics - 2/10 Gameplay - 1/10 (WAAAYYYY better on consoles)  physics - 2/10 (Left too much to the imagination) Snow - 6/10 (I'm being generous with this one) Overall - 10/10 - A fantastic game with an amazing storyline. You can play it fer dayz.

review: Quite honestly, I thought I would regret buying this game again after having 100s of hours in it on Xbox 360. Oddly enough, I didn't. Even after completing everything this game has to offer (which I might add, is a ton), mods give this game a complete new life. Sure, Skyrim isn't the best Elder Scrolls to date, but it's pretty damn good. Even if you've played it on a console system before, it's not the same. This game is a must have for any RPG lover.

review: Skyrim is the perfect example of how a vast and addictive adventure game is done, without overloading the player with Witcher-like  complexity. You begin the game picking only your race and from then, what type of fighter you are is completely built off of how you play, making for endless possibilities of the fighter you can become. It is a poor idea to just stick to the main story all throughout, because it will leave you at a disadvantage if you ignore the varying side quests and beautiful exploration, which allow you to uncover some of the best equipment as well as enhance your skills and levels. This in turn, has given me a massive playtime of 37 hours so far and the main story still only feels like it's a quarter of the way through! This is a fantastic watercooler game, allowing for you and your friends to share hours of stories about your unique adventures and play style in Skyrim. If you have the system specs and you love exploration, DO NOT MISS THIS GAME!

review: TL;DR end of review. This game: -Has a magnificent story. -Cheats -Awesome Mods (Nexus) -Open World -Do almost anything -And the list goes on. If I had more money, I'd buy 10 more copies of this game for anyone who really needs to play it. In this game you can: -Go Anywhere -Kill anyone -Scream -Get married -Buy a house -Kill dragons -Eat (dragon) souls without being a ginger -Store a thousand item in your inventory -Climb mountains on a horse -Duel with losers ingame -Travel -Explore a wide vareity of places, cities, villages, dungeons and many more -Have a cute lady follow you everywhere and defend you (better with sexy mods). Too long, didn't read (TL;DR) -----Buy this game, don't pirate it.----- -----The developers deserve more than pirated downloads of the game.----- -----This game is totally worth you $20 (or $5 if sales)----- Support the developers, think about it, if you don't buy their amazing games, they may go bankrupt and not make good games like Skyrim, Fallout NV, Dishonored, etc. then we'd get stuck with  EA and Ubisoft. You can't buy anything in this game for real money. It wouldn't rip you off. Spend $20 for this game and play forever instead of buying another overpriced game from another game developing company.

review: Skyrim is easily one of the best games of this generation. Its one of the games that you get as much out of as you put in. Its also one of the games you play exactly how you want to play. You can choose to ignore the main story immediately after beginning or play through the quests like a linear action adventure game. Speaking of quests, theres an awful lot of them. Even after playing over 170 hours altogether, I have a plethora of quests on my active quest log, never mind the ones I havent even started yet. So yes, Skyrim is 100% recommended by me.

The storyline is vast however completed the campaign in 1 week and the side quests i believe will take months which i will enjoy alot. Thanks to the steam community for Skyrim mods it is great and gives lots of laughs and hours of gameplay. Muskets, new swords and clothes are great to add into the game and my Dragonborn is now fully equipped for battle , taken out Miraak and now building a good armour set however nothing beats the Eleven blades, armour and bows.

review: I bought this game in 2011 for the PS 3 .. but due to known Playstation problems I never finished it . :( And then it was on sale on steam and I just had to buy it . And I must say I never regreted it . Even today this game still shines , especially if you activate one of the mods for e.g. weather , trees .... and so on . I still haven't finished the game ( due to working a lot ) but every once in a while I play an hour or so to relax . Graphics 7/10 Even by today standarts the graphics are still nice .. they're not top notch anymore , but hey the game is 4 years old . If you enable the mods it would be definitely an 8 or 8.5 rating Music 10/10 Just perfect .One word to describe it ..hm EPIC . When you're walking in the cold snowy mountains .. or in the green woods of Skyrim ..it really hits home . Or when the dragons attack.. Controls 9/10 Controller ist supported , And I advise you to use it , because with the keyboard.. it just doesn't feel right . Length 10/10 I had like 100 hours on the PS 3 and now like 50 hours on the pc ..and I'm just doing side quests haven't even touched the main quest ....enough said. Supports Steam Cloud and comes with Steam Trading Cards and Steam Achievements On the ( maybe ) downside for you .. - No mulitplayer mode ...well if you want that you can buy " the elder scrolls online " or play WOW .. - Sometimes it still has graphic bugs

review: The game is very enjoyable but it has it's problems. The enviroments and the feeling of the world is amazing. This is the strongest part of the game. The rest is sadly very mediocre. The combat is simple and spammy and lacks any serious depth considering it's a rpg. Exploring the world is cool and all but many of the places you'll find are generic tombs that all look the same. The quests are a gamble, some of the questlines are great but some, not so much. The problem is that alot of the quests are mmo like "gather x amount of these items" quests. These kind of quests I feel do not belong in a singleplayer rpg like this. The game also artificially extends the game by having randomly generated repetetive misc - quests. At this point the game got really dull and I stopped playing when there was basiclly only these quests left. Besides all of it's faults though, it is a game worth playing and many do not seem to notice these things since skyrim brought in alot of people who usually do not play rpgs and has not gathered any pre - expectations. The game is overall a pretty dumbed down version from the previous entries in the series which makes me enjoy the game alot less. It is a very easy game and is designed for a more casual crowd then morrowind, oblivion or even the earlier ones. But as I said it is still a fair amount of fun and with an insane amount of mods, you could play this for a long time. I'd like to say though that for all people who love skyrim, you should atleast give TES IV : Oblivion for I feel that some would enjoy that games more deep systems and harder difficulty. Thanks for reading my rather lengthy review, I hope it helped you in your decision for buying the game.

Like all of Bethesda's giant, open-world RPGs there are plenty of bugs to wade through (and have fun with!) and you'll definitely sink way too many hours into this game. It's fun on a whole new level - Bethesda is the best at this type of game and they've done an unparalleled job once again. Pros: Good Gameplay Beautiful Graphics Enormous World to Explore Mod Support Immersive Cons: Still Not as Good as Morrowind Was If you like Bethesda RPGs, have enjoyed any of the previous Elder Scrolls' games, or just love fantasy, pick up Skyrim - you'll love it. The immersion is top-notch and you'll wander the endless mountains of the beautiful countryside for hours on end, truly believing you are the Dovakiin. I still preferred Morrowind more; however, the graphics and beauty of this game cannot be beat by any of its competitors. A+

review: Masterpiece!!!It is a world that you enter and do not want to leave.I just wish they would have kept adding more expantions to it.Its too bad they stopped and moved on to other projects.They didnt keep this going as well.Would have been amazing to keep seeing the story grow stronger.But there is Mod work that is rather great as well.All I can say is get some snacks,turn off the lights,sit back,and enjoy a massive world filled with beautiful sights,lore,magic,mysteries,enemys,and friends.But Most of all the Dragons!

review: First off, Skyrim is a still a great game that sadly suffers from a number of issues. If you have played Oblivion, you probably will be disappointed in the long run with Skyrim because of the gameplay being dumbed in several ways. For example, the spell system is fun with the dual wielding but sadly they toke out the custom spell making and that was always fun as a mage in Oblivion. Combat is dumbed down alot but it is still decent because the Elder scroll games never had the best combat. Many of the qeusts and characters feel lacking in depth but I did expect this as Bethesda isn't the greatest in those aspects of games like this. There are still a few good points in Skyrim, despite the several flaws I've already pointed out. Such as the better support for mods that Bethesda has provided in cooperation with Valve, Workshop is great and the community behind the mods are great as well. These add so much gameplay hours that you can get double the hours if you install some mods, they even made me rebuy the game on PC with the DLC's. DLC's are lacking expect Dragonborn(great expansion). Generally it is way more stable then previous games even though it isn't perfect in this matter Despite the flaws of the game, It still provides a great way to waste hours and one of the finest sandbox RPG's out there. However I recommend Oblivion more then this game because of the fact that it is basically this but then way better IMO.

review: Even after almost 3 years, this game is just great! There is alot to do and to explore, and the modding community has alot of other great things. There are some bugs in the game tough, but im sure there are some fixes for those bugs in the steam workshop or somewhere else on the internet so they can be fixed.

review: The game is very enjoyable but it has it's problems. The enviroments and the feeling of the world is amazing. This is the strongest part of the game. The rest is sadly very mediocre. The combat is simple and spammy and lacks any serious depth considering it's a rpg. Exploring the world is cool and all but many of the places you'll find are generic tombs that all look the same. The quests are a gamble, some of the questlines are great but some, not so much. The problem is that alot of the quests are mmo like "gather x amount of these items" quests. These kind of quests I feel do not belong in a singleplayer rpg like this. The game also artificially extends the game by having randomly generated repetetive misc - quests. At this point the game got really dull and I stopped playing when there was basiclly only these quests left. Besides all of it's faults though, it is a game worth playing and many do not seem to notice these things since skyrim brought in alot of people who usually do not play rpgs and has not gathered any pre - expectations. The game is overall a pretty dumbed down version from the previous entries in the series which makes me enjoy the game alot less. It is a very easy game and is designed for a more casual crowd then morrowind, oblivion or even the earlier ones. But as I said it is still a fair amount of fun and with an insane amount of mods, you could play this for a long time. I'd like to say though that for all people who love skyrim, you should atleast give TES IV : Oblivion for I feel that some would enjoy that games more deep systems and harder difficulty. Thanks for reading my rather lengthy review, I hope it helped you in your decision for buying the game.

review: Before writing this review I must admit I'm a bit biased, I'm a huge TES fan. Although a general tendency can be noted in which the TES games became a lot easier and more generalized, Skyrim still is Awesome! Even without mods Skyrim is very entertainable and I love the different enviroments you encounter, especially on the more eastern part of the map with all the huge height differences! Just love that place. The game just rocks it by the thousands of awesome mods available, definitly one of the best games around for me :).

review: () My laptop is not so good that I need to run this game in low graphic. However, the low graphic is no matter in front of the great glamour of this game(both the story and the landscape of Skyrim). Fortunately, this version includes the Chinese(language), which can help Chinese players enjoy their adventures in Skyrim~ The story is substantial so that it ensure a long time playing.(not like some games, have big maps but lack of playability). There are also lots of interesting optional missions :D All in all, TES V: Skyrim is the best game of this series. It's really worth that price.

review: Sorry for my English, but.. Not caught in the beginning, but later fascinated very much. This world does not want to leave, do not want to play other games as "The atmosphere is wonderful and the world can coexist with other". About fine: after some time - without mods "in any way", they are diverse, funny, mysterious and full taste, and all I want to decorate and diversify this world that attracts you more. And how many do not play and you get a lot of fun. Of the shortcomings can be identified imperfect pumping system skills, as has circulated quickly certain skill, you can easily kill any enemy of the rat to the dragon, but it is the little things and this is purely my opinion. Play, try, Skyrim worth the time spent, it's a wonderful holiday!)

review: Latest game in the Elder Scrolls series (prior to Elder Scrolls Online), many elements of the game have been dumbed down and/or streamlined for more casual gamers to get into it. If you ignore all the great things from previous games though this game stands on it's own merits as a fun romp through a sandbox world. The singlular reason to buy this game on steam rather than on the console is the capablity to be modded. Check the Steam Workshop and the Nexusmods for details on that. You are in control - you can change the difficutly at any time, you can install whatever mods you want to make the game more enjoyable. Anything you want you can do. If you want to challange yourself, legendary difficutly + difficutly enhancing mods exist. If you want it easy, then novice difficutly lets you hack and slash your way through the story and of course there are all shades in between. Swords, Maces, Bows/Crossbows, Shields, Dual Wielding, Magic, and more. Play the way you want that's the name of the game. Your experience is what you make of it, imagine you are in a story and play that way!

Its beautiful looking, even moreso in motion, has fantastic modding support, and can sustain you for a very very very long time. To top it all off, the game goes on sale for super cheap, making this one of the easiest recommendations I can make. Buy this game and mod it to hell and back.

review: If you're expecting a game with loads of varied  to do and challenging, deep, gameplay mechanics, this game is not for you. If you're expecting a game that's like a superdrug in terms of addiction, then this is for you. People claim this game has "Infinite quests" when it doesn't really. It has about an estimate of about 50 different kinds of missions from different factions that you can do over and over and over until those stats all reach 100. Then you legendary them and start all over again; All in all this will probably take you 100 to 1000+ hours depending on the kind of stuff you do. Luckily though, modders have salvaged this game into a truly infinite experience. I'm pretty sure any and all issues one might have with this game can be easily addressed with a mod on the workshop. My one and only problem with skyrim is that I never recall any distinct sensation of "Fun" or memorability (Aside from the clearly lovingly created world behind the game) to be had in the game outside of the Thieve's Guild or The Dark Brotherhood, though that didn't stop me from playing it for several hours. That's why I find it hard to review this game. Whether or not it's worth a purchase depends on whether you play games for enjoyment or to kill your time. Seeing as it accomplishes a colossal amount of time killing in comparison to most other AAA games regardless of the fact that most of it feels like busywork without any fun mods, I have no choice but to leave "recommended" and not a "Not recommended". I mean, in the end, this game captured my attention, and I still will likely go back to it for several more hours when I feel like getting back into the game. So didn't it accomplish what it set out to do? That's debatable, but it's still worth a purchase on the basis that it's a game that will hold off the need for other games for a while. And it goes on sale more often than most games, so it's hard to truly go wrong with this game.

review: Years spent developing The Elder Scrolls V, after IV Oblivion in 2006 and the work put into Skyrim is evident. Released in 2011, we are no longer able to call Skyrim an up-to-date game yet it still tricks you in that sense with its breathtaking graphics, of which make the world around you feel beautiful whilst still portraying the hard, gritty coldness of the snowy nordic homeland. The main quest starts with you as a prisoner (again) in the middle of a civil war between the Imperials who had gained control of Skyrim and allowed everyone to live there, and the Stormcloaks who are nordic rebels led by Jarl Ulfric Stormcloak, who seem to only want Nords in Skyrim. On the verge of execution you find the dragons have returned and after having narrowly escaped with your life you set out to defeat the dragons, finding out you are Dovahkiin, dragonborn. On top of this main quest there are quadrillions of side missions, all of which add fresh varieties to your time in Skyrim and allow you discover more locations in the world around you; you can fight the great war with either the Imperials or the Stormcloaks, you can join the Dark Brotherhood and assassinate the Emperor, you can join the college of Winterhold and aspire to become Arch-Mage. The freedom in Skyrim is incredible and the developers have made it so that all the decisions you make on your free roaming have an affect on your gameplay and quests, take a pilgrimage to the different temples, visit all 9 holds, join the thieves guild in Riften, explore hidden caves and burial sites, hunt down daedra, the world is in your hands. Then when you have done adventuring for the day, buy a house in one of the major cities and sit down to read one of Skyrims hundreds of detailed books, all giving you more information about the Elder Scrolls lore and some helping you level up or start a new quest. In conclusion, I love the Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim and recommend it to everyone, it is a fantastic game which will allow you hours of enjoyment and whilst it has nice graphics and good gameplay, actually is not very demanding in spec. My Skyrim rating: 10/10 Buy it!

review: Quite simply, the greatest game ever made. I played this game for a year after it came out. Then I got involved in some other games for a year or so and then decided to go back and play Skyrim again. It was just as fresh and exciting the second time around as it was the first time that I played it. Skyrim is VAST. Huge. Monstrous. There is just so much to do here that it never seems to get old. I only used a few simple mods, no real game changers, just a few things to make the game a bit more fun for me. BUT for those who want them there are thousands of mods that WILL change the game which adds entirely new game play possibilities. I'm done gushing for now. I can wholeheartedly recommend this game to anyone who has ever had an inkling to play an RPG. Best game ever. Really.

review: The fifth game of The Elder Scrolls franchise. Skyrim is a unique roleplaying , action and adventure game that you could never compare to any other title. You start out as a prisoner going towards Helgen to be executed , but luckily a dragon comes to destroy it and you manage to escape. From there on you make your adventure. You can do anything you find interesting such as doing side quests , the main story quests , exploring the huge lands of Skyrim or leveling up your skills. The main story isn't that long , but the side quests will take around 1000 hours to all be completed. The Elder Scrolls V:Skyrim has a high replayability or if you ever get bored from the vanila version , get mods from the Skyrim Steam Workshop or from the Skyrim Nexus. You won't go wrong by buying this game, even if its published 2011.

review: I have put many hours into Bethesdas latest Elder Scrolls game and I can confidently say its great! Explore the vast wilderness of the Nordic homeland or relax in one of the many populated holds the game offers. Complete quests in a variety of ways resulting in great value, just create another character (yes you have to play through the same helgen part over and over again) and set forth on your quest... The amount of choice in the game is spectacular for open world RPG lovers, change your characters eyebrows and ears to degrees of precision that I never thought possible. Many of the larger questlines have a set path for you to follow with smaller choices along the way whilst side quests let you choose (usually from 2 options) which path to take. Mods are a great way to keep things interesting, not only can you change the game in ways that give it a whole new feel, but you can just tweak things like textures or weapon appearance. For a relatively small amount you can add in Solstheim or Fort dawnguard to your world and enjoy the new threats and adventures the world holds, or give up your dragon fighting ways, hang up your daedric armour and start a family, giving Skyrim a new generation of Dragonborn (if it is genetic)

There are so many quests to follow, it will waste your days for weeks, or even months.

review: Playing this game without 2K - 4K texture replacing mods and no ENB Preset should be a crime. Playing Skyrim in 2014 with no mods at all is just wrong and sad, really. Also, be ashamed of yourself if you haven't ever configured an .ini file. Lastly: Never ever clean your Skyrim.esm when using Tes5Edit, nor shall you ever use K ENB without having an SLI/Crossfire setup (except if you have a 980, then you may squeeze more than 30 fps)

This is honestly the best game I've ever played, and I've played a lot of great games. Skyrim gives you plenty of options which gives you a unique sense of freedom you don't see in most games, another great thing about Skyrim is the plot. Skyrim's plot is one of the most epic story-lines you'll ever see in a game.

review: My review for The Elder Scrolls V Skyrim: - Various races with their different abilities (you can even become a cat or a lizard too). You can be a boy or a gurl (and I'm not Prof. Oak). - A lot of quests (really guys, maybe I can finish most of unrepeatable quests, but by the time i've done that, i probably spent more than 1000 hours. - The map is vast, a lot of point of interest, and by the time you unlock every one of them, your map's gonna be full and heavier. duh. - Travel Skyrim as the mighty dragonborn, a warrior who can master every kind of weapons and magic, and also have a dragon blood running through your veins, Which is nice. Oh, and you can also shout with the dragon language. So you can curse people without them understand it. Because two things, one, they literally don't understand what you're saying, two, they're probably dead, cuz dragon language rulez. FUS RO DAH. - Even though you are destined to be the mighty dragonborn, you can, and you should seek part-time job. You can be a blacksmith, potion or poison brewer, equipment enchanter, whatever that is. - You can join a group of mercenaries, magic nerds, bunch of kleptomaniacs, or fraternity of murderer. Oh, you can also become vampires, or against them (Blade will be proud), and have your own castle (you have to share with your fellow hobos, though. - Oh, and you can marry, too. Good for you, forever alone. - You can drag dead bodies whenever you want, throw junk whenever you want, and the guard still ignoring you. - This game is moddable, original is great, with mods, no question asked. 9/10

review: The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. It's just one of those gems in gaming where as soon as when you get into it you may lose the way out. I originally played skyrim and it's official expansions on the PS3 version on their release days and i haven't played a game that good in a long time. Time spent was nothing impressive for elder scrolls standards though mind you it's just roughly +400 hours or so on the main save playing as a khajiit with a warrior/assasin build & playstyle. sword > shield later 2 words and from a bow i went to a dwarven crossbow (DLC wep) What makes this game so much fun is that it's easy to learn for users both new and not so new how to play it. You start of with whatever weapons and armor you can scavenge, steal, craft or be gifted and one step at a time as time flies by you discover and learn new ways to improve your skills and armor. All you have to do is pick up any weapon you like and use it in combat. Tired of that same sword? purchase a bow! bow too boring? craft a hammer! the options really nearly endless. Skyrim is also one of those games that is not only about fighting and exploring either. you can buy your own house, you can get married and live a happy life together or alone. Handy to know for some of you out there is that this game allows players the choice to start same sex relations, i know it's been a debate and a gaming media thing so for that exact reason i'm just gonna throw it outta there it in hopes it might be useful for anyone who find this important. But back to the home thing. In the hearthome expansion pack (5,00 $5,00 Steam store) the home and marriage feature gets a nice big upgrade which gives you the ability to get a plot of land at 3 set locations and build your own house from scratch starting with a small simple cottage to perhaps a huge manion complete with kitchens, bedrooms, armories, and livestock which you can decorate as you see fit. if you meet the criteria it also allows you to adopt up to 2 children to raise as your own and adopt a pet (Note: Please adopt meeko). again the possibilities are nearly endless. For those who like to turn a page or two and read something in their own time about the history of skyrim or simple daily things like spear polishing and putting bread in the oven the elder scrolls V: skyrim has more than 1000 pages of lore spread through all of skyrim covering many topics such as history, myth, monsters, races, religion, art, and more. these books are found in caves, homes, stores and pretty much anywhere people have been. be on the lookout some of them are actually pretty fun to read. To sum things up skryim is a masterpiece any player can easily lose the time on pure from the many features and near perfect constructed world. Be warned! All the best! (s.i.e)

review: The perfect game to make an epic journey. Will suit many playstyles and player preferences, and most likely even excel it in the process. Of course I recommend it, it's obviously one of the best RPGs ever out there! P.S.: ...Just installed it again and played for like 4 hours without a break. Damn it, it's so immersive!

review: This is my first foray into the Elder Scrolls series, though I bought Oblivion and Morrowind and will get around to exploring those eventually. I played a little of Morrowind but not enough to form an opinion yet (so far it's neato!). It's one of the most beautiful games I've ever played and the music is gorgeous and haunting. I've sunk many hours into this game but I still haven't completed the main questline. I'll get around to it eventually, but there's so much to do and see that it doesn't matter. I'm thinking i should increase the difficulty a bit. It's easy to cheese everything if you choose blacksmithing, enchanting, and alchemy. The combat overall could be better. HOWEVER, there are many, many mods that fix the game's flaws and add all sorts of wonderful things. Do you want to add more immersion? Well, there are survival mods that affect the food you eat, how deeply the cold influences your behavior, and how you attack. If you don't like something, get a mod that changes it! If you need a "desert island" game this one is it due to its endless replay value.

review: My review for The Elder Scrolls V Skyrim: - Various races with their different abilities (you can even become a cat or a lizard too). You can be a boy or a gurl (and I'm not Prof. Oak). - A lot of quests (really guys, maybe I can finish most of unrepeatable quests, but by the time i've done that, i probably spent more than 1000 hours. - The map is vast, a lot of point of interest, and by the time you unlock every one of them, your map's gonna be full and heavier. duh. - Travel Skyrim as the mighty dragonborn, a warrior who can master every kind of weapons and magic, and also have a dragon blood running through your veins, Which is nice. Oh, and you can also shout with the dragon language. So you can curse people without them understand it. Because two things, one, they literally don't understand what you're saying, two, they're probably dead, cuz dragon language rulez. FUS RO DAH. - Even though you are destined to be the mighty dragonborn, you can, and you should seek part-time job. You can be a blacksmith, potion or poison brewer, equipment enchanter, whatever that is. - You can join a group of mercenaries, magic nerds, bunch of kleptomaniacs, or fraternity of murderer. Oh, you can also become vampires, or against them (Blade will be proud), and have your own castle (you have to share with your fellow hobos, though. - Oh, and you can marry, too. Good for you, forever alone. - You can drag dead bodies whenever you want, throw junk whenever you want, and the guard still ignoring you. - This game is moddable, original is great, with mods, no question asked. 9/10

review: My 400+ hours in game ought to say something about the vastness of the game world and the wisdom of paying whatever this game currently costs to play it. Even in Morrowind, I think I never spent more than 120 hours total. I've played Daggerfall, Morrowind, and now this game and the MMO beta in the franchise. Every time the Elder Scrolls takes a step forward, it seems to lose some things that made me a fan of the series earlier on, while expanding upon others--for better or worse. I miss the ability to buy a sailing ship, to craft any sort of spell (even levitation), and to make any sort of class I wanted. I don't like that you can simply be just about everything to everyone if you follow all the different quest lines to completion. I don't like that you have to choose between two sides that suck in a war in order to enjoy certain added benefits and plotlines. I find it irritating (SPOILER ALERT) that the imperials should be such a bland bunch of lackeys led by someone who apparently has real virtue--until you assasinate him, while the other side seems like a good bunch of warriors led by such an uninspiring, self-important primadonna. I especially find it irritating that although you can be all things to all people in all plotlines, with the one exception of being forced to choose between two equally uninspiring sides, the one thing you can never be is ruler, no matter what you do. You can kill dragons, and even emperors, but you cannot do anything to become ruler of Skyrim. Seems kind of silly to me. Okay, so maybe Skyrim would never welcome an Argonian to rule over them... but if we're going to play the reality card, well, there's a lot lacking in the major plotlines in that respect. I also don't like that you're forced into a few things that I find personally detestable once you initiate a given quest. I wouldn't recommend letting anyone under 18 play this game either as there are too many mature moments. Even so, with all its glaring faults, this has been my favorite game in the series to date. I whole-heartedly recommend it to anyone who enjoys fantasy rpg's.

review: -Skyrim; I'm not sure how I can review this, never having played older TES games, but I can safely say, after a better playthrough, this is a good game. -Gameplay is pretty varied, ranging from full-on combat, using magic, or my all-time favourite: sneaking. -Combat... Isn't brilliant. It isn't stiff like a rock, but still a bit rough. It has some dinamic though, like executions, different attacks for different directions, and special effects like extra damage on undead, or freeze damage on stamina and magicka, etc. -As for quests, I feel like the game really shined in the guild quests, the companions, college, and thieves'. But was lackluster on early-game story missions. That being my opinion though. -Side missions are interesting at least, but some are/seem boring and occupy space on your journal. -The leveling system works a bit "weird", differently from what I'm used to. By getting good at a skill: One Handed, Destruction spells, lockpicking you gain overall EXP, then you use tab and click level up, not fully fond of it. -Overall, I'd give it an 8/10 since a max rating has to be a perfect game for me, and I have not found one yet. -Leave your feedback below. Thanks

review: I can't stop coming back to this. Somehow, Steam hasn't even logged all of the hours I've put into this. One of the brilliant things about Elder Scrolls is how simple it is to charge right through the story (if you have your waypoints on) or to just roam around endlessly for hundreds of hours doing nothing of significance. It's genuinely beautiful, especially when you consider the myriad of content created by other users to add to this game.

review: Before you point out my low playtime on record, know that I only obtained Skyrim on this account recently. I have done multiple completionist playthroughs and have been spending significant amounts of time modding over the past year. Skyrim is a massive game by itself, but add on the massive modding community and you have a game which is just as endless as Minecraft. The power of mods is a force to be reckoned with, with enough mods installed you can turn Skyrim's graphics from mediocre to unmatched. Despite this, the sheer scope of the vanilla game means that it is still a highly enjoyable experience. With all this in mind, I can say one thing for certain: "You have to buy this game."

That was before I played Skyrim on PC. You hear people who play this on Xbox go on and on about finding 'Dawnbreaker' or completing the Dark Brotherhood questline. I just butt in and say, "Yeah, but have you ever ridden a giant rabbit into battle?" 12/10 Like Skyrim with Mods.

I'm just at a loss for words here on how much this game was worth the price. I would recommend buying the set with every game in it plus the DLC's; there's more bang for your buck. There is a LOT to do while still being engaging and I look for games with that, which there are few of in the RPG category. I haven't played it enough to give full rundowns on all the cool features, but this game gets an A+ in my grade-book! (Seriously I can't put into words enough to say, but it's just incredible and if I had it planned out like an essay I'd have a page or two written for this.)

review: Do I recomend this game... HELL YES! I've been so busy playing the game, I never wrote a review, I have played this game far more than any other game I have tried, and with all the mods from various places, the game possabillites are endless. I would get into some of my personal mods I am using, but I will spare you the details other than possible infestations and pregnancies. The balance of the Vanilla game is great, and it happens to be a great starter for one to play. I use the Creation Kit to make changes so I don't have to run to town before getting half way through a single "dungeon", and I tried on several aspects to increase rank wise for aditional perks in different areas. Like for use of 4 enchantments instead of 2, but it is set up where you can only up it once, not 3 times, so was forced to hit 4 directly. And same thing with increased carriing capacity, allows for only a single upgrade to it. Am still a novice, or I would change the base settings to add more branches off that one. Once you learn the controls, that are quite simple, game play is smooth, combat is not really my thing in most games, but in this game, it keeps me going back for more, on a regular bassis, Difficulty is moddable while in game, even in battle, to make the boss fights a bit easier if needed... Ok, there is just too much for me to say about this game, and after speaking with friends, this is the last True "Elder Scrolls" game, as the Online version totally sucks, and not even made by the same team that made this game, shame shame... Anyway, This is the game I play, as my times show, and will continue to grow as time wears on, and new mods become available as 3rd party content, I will add it to my game such as,"Become a Lord" in my case, Lady... Should just say Jarl so there is no gender differientials... Ok, back to my game, Have to Kill Aulduin for the 10th time....

review: Skyrim is a complicated game to review, even after all these hours. In its original form it is somewhat lacking. I've seen the phrase "wide as an ocean, deep as a puddle" used in reference to Skyrim and I understand why. For all its virtues are substantial vices, trade-offs that may be necessary but have a tangible effect on the overall experience. Allow me to elaborate. The sense of exploration comes at the cost of individual locations rarely being very memorable, with few exceptions. The sense of freedom comes at the cost of a truly strong narrative: the return of dragons as heralds of the apocalypse at Alduin's claws never becomes as fleshed out as it could have been. This is supposed to be a nation at civil war and a world on the brink of annihilation, but that never really shows in game in a very tangible way. The story elements of the game have plenty of "telling", but comparatively little "showing". Even aside from direct story, most characters are simply there for the sake of existing. Few are more than 2-dimensional, or for that matter worth remembering. Paarthurnax is the stand out for me personally. I don't expect every NPC to be relatable or have clear backstory. That would be ridiculous, in a game this size. Still, while it's understandable it's still grating after a while. The game play is simplified compared to its predecesors, as I'm sure you have heard people complain about. This isn't entirely a bad thing, but remains a matter of taste. I found some elements of Morrownd and Oblivion more complex than truly necessary, while others will see Skyrim as stripped down in comparison. To be fair, it is. Objectively, features and gameplay elements have been removed. How much that affects your enjoyment is another matter. I enjoyed both Skyrim and its predecessors despite their differences. So if vanilla Skyrim has flaws and virtues in equal measure, is Skyrim still worth getting? Yes. It cannot be overstated how much difference mods can make for this game. New lands to explore, expanded gameplay elements for vampirism and lycanthropy, more weapons and armor, better hair and face models... If you can think of it, someone has probably got a mod for it. This makes Skyrim customizable in a way few other games can boast. If you're willing to make the effort of learning to mod it, the game is absolutely worth it. If you're not, it may be best to wait for a sale. It gets a price drop on a near-constant basis, so chances are you won't need to wait long.

review: A game that enables you to play as either gender and personalise your character to the last detail is always going to gain my interest. A game where you can ride horses, use magic and beat the  out of dragons is definitely going to gain my interest. A game that isn't linear, is packed with fantasy and lets you wear badass armour and make or find formidable weaponry is.... yeah, you get the point. Skyrim is just so full of everything that you couldn't play it the same way twice. Right from the beginning, you can choose the type of person you are going to be. A sneaky thief, a wizard, a hero, an assassin, an annoying git; you can follow whichever path you feel like and change it daily, if you want to. You can build houses and adopt children. You can punch random people in the head. You can start bar fights. You can murder innocents. You can adopt stray doggies. You can marry in a same sex marriage (well played for beating the UK at this). You can save villages. You can wreak havoc in villages. You can make enemies of an entire race of people. You can assassinate kings or make them kiss your butt. I could go on... Even if you dislike the concept of magic and prefer the 'down and dirty' physical combat like I do, the game does not disappoint. The storyline retains its relevance throughout and keeps you absorbed. And I haven't even mentioned the incredible, contrasting scenery yet. Highly, highly, recommended. I didn't even LIKE RPGs before I played Skyrim, and now I am searching in vain for a game to live up to it.

review: My Review: ONE OF THEE GREATEST VIDEO GAMES IN THE HISTORY OF GAMING. PERIOD. Seriously though, this game has set the one of the highest standards (along side Fallout 3) for an open world, rpg, action/adventure game. This games greatness lies in its vast open world space, exploration, Lore, and unlimited replayability with the addition of...wait for it, MODS! Yes! Mod support for this game is one of the largest communities in the realm of PC gaming. The game is essentially limitless with the amount of new high quality content that has been, and STILL is, being created 3 years after the games release. It is clear the Skyrim modding community has not decreased their pace, and if anything, have only gotten bigger and better. Skyrim has left a legendary mark in video games which modders will continue support into the years to come.

review: Skyrim certainly had a lot to love up to after the wonderful experience that was Oblivion. After playing over 100 hours i can safely say that it lives up to it, and then some. Skyrim is a stunning open world RPG with so much to do and so many places to see. The class and race variety is really deep so that you can play with pretty much any style you like. The theme of the place is mostly snow but there are a lot of different themes too with some of the nice green landscapes that we liked from Oblivion. If you decide to just wander off somewhere you will always run into a new place with something to do. The main quest can be brief if you just follow this but the side quests really open things up and add to the whole skyrim experience. Overall I loved the game and would put it in the "must play" section. Would run into Whiterun and kill all the people just for the lulz again. 10/10

Pretty much anywhere you go in this game there will be something intresting to find and many missions to complete. You can be walking around following the objectaive marker at the top of the screen and then you might find a cave full of monsters and tonnes of loot. The combat is fast and fun with lots of wepons and spells, this makes the game fun to play the game again after you beat the game. (If you some how mannage to do all the side missions or you just want to start a new character) There is many diffrent perks to make it easier for your playstyle, for example if you are a mage you might want to get a perk for destruction magic so it does more dammage or increse your enchanting so you can make your armor give you a magic bonus. The music is great with an awesome main theme that playes when you fight dragons. The main story is about a dragon that appeared out of nowhere summoning other dragons back to life so it is up to you, the dragonborn to stop them. The side missions also have storys that dont even require you to have beat the main story with intresting plot twists in the middle. Skyrim has tonnes of mods that are simple to get from the workshop and can make this game crazy with mods that give you insane wepons, armor and missions. Skyrim is probably my favorate RPG ever and I highly recommend it to any openworld RPG fan. I also recommend buying the Legendary edition because the DLC adds some fun content that adds plenty more hours of gameplay.

review: My favorite RPG game ever created. In my opinion, it is a huge step up from Oblivion. Leveling is smoother, combat is much more realistic and varied, and there are just so many things that Skyrim adds to the game that were missing in prevous games. This game also has my favorite graphics out of any game I have seen, which isn't bad for a game that is around 2 years old now. I highly recommend this game if you are a fan of the previous Elder Scrolls games, or just enjoy medieval type RPG's in general. Bethesda did not dissapoint and their reputation for creating great quality games still stands.

review: If you are ever forced into a situation where you can only buy one game on your PC then make it a Bethesda game and make it Morrowind. Unless you want to have epic battles with dragons then make it Skyrim. As usual this game is one that impacts an entire generation. An absolutely massive game, with solid mechanics, beautiful graphics and an  ton of glitches. Thankfully, due to the massive moding community you can fix everything in a few seconds and then take the game to an entirely new level that is customized to your personal tastes and persuasions. More gushing about the game can be found here on my blog, which is the blog to end all blogs:

review: This is truly one of the best games I have ever played. An epic tale that allows you to play it however you want to. Along with Steam Community and an entire modding community behind Skyrim, the possibilities and adventures are endless. If you have not tried out the epicness of Skyrim, I recommend picking it and living it yourself.

review: Do I recomend this game... HELL YES! I've been so busy playing the game, I never wrote a review, I have played this game far more than any other game I have tried, and with all the mods from various places, the game possabillites are endless. I would get into some of my personal mods I am using, but I will spare you the details other than possible infestations and pregnancies. The balance of the Vanilla game is great, and it happens to be a great starter for one to play. I use the Creation Kit to make changes so I don't have to run to town before getting half way through a single "dungeon", and I tried on several aspects to increase rank wise for aditional perks in different areas. Like for use of 4 enchantments instead of 2, but it is set up where you can only up it once, not 3 times, so was forced to hit 4 directly. And same thing with increased carriing capacity, allows for only a single upgrade to it. Am still a novice, or I would change the base settings to add more branches off that one. Once you learn the controls, that are quite simple, game play is smooth, combat is not really my thing in most games, but in this game, it keeps me going back for more, on a regular bassis, Difficulty is moddable while in game, even in battle, to make the boss fights a bit easier if needed... Ok, there is just too much for me to say about this game, and after speaking with friends, this is the last True "Elder Scrolls" game, as the Online version totally sucks, and not even made by the same team that made this game, shame shame... Anyway, This is the game I play, as my times show, and will continue to grow as time wears on, and new mods become available as 3rd party content, I will add it to my game such as,"Become a Lord" in my case, Lady... Should just say Jarl so there is no gender differientials... Ok, back to my game, Have to Kill Aulduin for the 10th time....

review: The epic atmosphere that wraps this chapter of the TES saga is stunning, allowing the player to dive into a magic world on the edge of a crysis felt never before. The gameplay is quite simplified compared to the previous chapters, nonetheless it still gives a special insight into the fantastic lore of The Elder Scrolls. 10/10

review: You can play this game over and over again trying different builds (though I mostly end up being a sneaky archer and swords man). This game never gets boring, and if it does somehow, there's a ton of addons and mods you can choose from (My personal favourite in terms of user mods: Helgen Reborn). Over all this game will fill many hours, as long as you fully play it (meaning not just rushing the main quest). There are many nice side quests that are often better then the main quest (The thives guild quest IMO for example). The DLCs Dragonborn (Having started the Elder Scrolls with Morrowind, I especially enjoyed Dragonborn) and Dawnguard add to the many quests and play time. A great game!

review: "Just when I thought I was out... they pull me back in." - Michael Corleone Who am I kidding? I was never "out" on this game. 2 years and ~420 hours later I'm STILL finding new things to do and places to explore. Betwen Morrowind, Oblivion and Skyrim I've probably spent way more time than is healthy traversing the landscapes of Tamriel. And the mods available for Skyrim now have me wanting to go back to Morrowind and Oblivion, freshly modded up, for another round.

review: Skyrim is an amazing single player action/adventure RPG, massively recommend to any who love large open worlds and open gameplay. Even if you confine yourself to just the main quest, this is still quite a large scale game. If you delve deeper into the side quests for factions, and randomized mini quests, you can easily put hundreds of hours in this game. This game is open to a lot of gamers - and difficulty is adjustable in the options so you can still play a fun game even if you aren not the quickest or slickest gamer. Combat requires you to make good decisions on default difficulty - one bad mistake and you will be dropped quick. When I state the game is open - it is in different styles as well! Skyrim has very open advancement, and many opportunities to advance your skills in either magic, combat, or stealth (or a combination of all). You are not as restricted as in previous Elder Scrolls games (and they were very open). Skyrim even has perks - skill points you can place on skills to improve their function even more than leveling up. Great for those who like skill trees! Before I hit negatives: I recommend if you intend to play this for more than the main story - research console commands (the ~/` key). I don't recommend using them to ruin the core gameplay (it is possible), but you can use them to work around certain bugs, and annoying issues that can occur and ruin your fun. On the negative side - even with the game patched up - there are bugs. I recommend highly making multiple save files, and frequently. You may play constantly without running in to bugs, but some play and constantly end up needing to reload. My playstyle is very explorative - I will get stuck in the environment and need to load again. Occasionally important - but not required - NPCs will be killed through random events and attacks. This can be frustrating when you go to a town ready to unload items for sale only to find the shop keepers body outside and a pack of death hounds nearby. Also in the negatives - The "Hoarder" gameplay style is not conducive to this game. Skyrim imposes a strict carry limit. When you exceed this limit, you slow to a crawl, and cannot run, or fast travel between places. This means you may literally spend an hour or more walking slowly from a dungeon back to town if you are a hoarder who keeps and/or sells all items! Some players tend to use the console commands to increase their carry limit - but this does defeat part of the core gameplay concept - it is your choice though. Overall - I thoroughly recommend this game. Though not as innovative as some of the other Elder Scrolls games, this is still an incredible achievment despite any bugs or issues encountered.

review: Offers endless hours of fun, whether it be completing the engaging story missions, the countless number of side quests that keep you occupied or just running about killing everything that comes into sight. Skyrim includes numerous armours, weapons and items, with the ability to craft many of them yourself. This collection can be ever expanded with the almighty world of modding, one of the best things The Elder Scrolls series is known for in my opinion.

review: What to say about this game? Its fun, exciting and teaches you to fly.. after you foolishly try beating up a giant. Its got something for everyone, no matter what your favourite play style. Like charging at the enemy? grab a suitable sword and get hacking.... enjoy stealing stuff.. theives guild for you, and you can always do worse than joining the mages guild, calling yourself Tim the Enchanter and spending your days blowing up bits of the landscape, before mocking a passing party of knights. Stir in a civil war, plenty of side quests, odd jobs, not so odd jobs, and just plain weird jobs and you've already spent 100 gaming hours exploring one huge sandbox of a game world before you've even tried starting the main quest. Does the game have its faults? of course. The menu system could be better for us PC users, and the 3rd person kill cam breaks the illusion while you are in the midst of a huge battle. But all in, its worth the money and gets a Boris rating of 9 gallons of napalm out of 10.

review: In our current world, which you have to share with billions of other people, controlled by our government, where everybody gets a designated amount of space, where they can live their lives freely, sometimes, you just want to be something more. Because the truth is, you are obese, sweaty, your hair is greasy enough to bake fries in, and your biggest sexual satisfaction is jerking it to Audrey Bitoni's new porno blockbuster. That's why sometimes, you just want to be a dragon-slaying, knockback-shouting, everything-demolishing, overpowered health potion-drinking fire-shooting badass viking. Come on. How often do you get to actually be the hero of a whole country?(A sparcely populated country that consists mostly of IQ 20 Giants and some horkers, but still.) This game makes you feel like a total buttkicker. You can be anything you want to be, from a Brad Pitt-lookalike Nord with A MOTHA FUKIN' BATTLEAXE to an old mage guy. Because, you know, if you get old, you gotta put on some robes and a hat and shoot lightning from your hands and . The downside is that this game treats you like a  political . After my complete level 80 playthrough, I can say I have somehow helped or fought for 814.5 political extremist groups. (The Forsworn only count as 0.5, because they're essentially a primitive tribe of batshit insane battlemages that wield wooden swords in an age where steel has already been discovered.) But that doesn't keep you from spitting fire, or freezing  solid, or sneaking(in a pooping position that is) past hordes of enemies like you're freaking Houdini. I say, buy it, so you can gain some more calories and spend that many more days without taking a shower. (I'm talking to you, Manos.)

review: One of the best games I've played in a while. In this century, theres not many games that have the feature of long term play. By this I mean that I want a game that I can play even after I complete the main story line and still have fun in the game and this is just it! Better than FarCry2-4 where there are side missions. Skyrim is full with diffrent ways to complete the story and different ways to play in general. There are many characters you can play as, different skills you can master at and overall the game is just a thrill. I recommend this game for anyone who is in for semi-relaxing games but also want some action. You can have either in Skyrim. Added to all of that, there are so many steam workshop mods that you can subscribe to, if theres something in the game that you dont exactly like, make the game twice as good. Worth every penny and more.

review: I can personally attest to the fact that Skyrim deserves all the hype it's gotten. One of my favorite aspects of the game is the fact that it isn't a mainstream, overly-colorful, slightly too fantasy-oriented RPG, that ends up being a bit cheesy. Instead, Skyrim has created a beautiful, yet rugged world in which anything is possible (especially with mods), and provides enough realism and strategy to be intense, while still being a fantastic, mythical experience that leaves you awe struck and nerd-gasming. Play this game, I beg you.

review: This game is beautiful and it has soul. While I think it's not the best TES game, it surely stays true to what makes this series amazing: insanely detailed world, fantastic atmosphere, the huge open world that calls the adventurer in me to explore every corner and delve into the legends of the Nords. The art style, music and character models make Skyrim the most spectacular experience so far in terms of a living world to explore. The RPG mechanics are getting thinner (stats, skills, birthsigns, attributes) but the progression and character customization are still pretty solid in their absence and a good improvement from Oblivion. I can't wait for the expansions for this game.

review: The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is everything gamers expected and more. As the follow-up to Oblivion, arguably one of the best RPG's of all time, people expected a lot and Bethesda delivered. That's not to say that Skyrim is without problems, far from it. Fortunately, there is so much good in all of Skyrim that the problems are easy to ignore. I'll start off by saying that if you didn't like the combat in previous Elder Scrolls games, you probably aren't going to change your mind with Skyrim. That being said, combat has changed fairly significantly. The biggest change is in the addition of dual wielding. In previous games, you could assign a one-handed weapon and a shield, or a two-handed weapon and then add a magic attack via right bumper. In Skyrim, you have far more freedom to equip what you want. Basically, everything that uses one hand can be equipped as long as you have a hand available. Also, magic now counts as using up an equipped hand. What this means is, you can use two one-handed weapons to dual wield at the expense of blocking, sword and shield (of which the shield now has attacks of it's own such as shield bashing), a sword and magic spell, or two magic spells. All of these combinations also feel much weightier and no longer feel like the crowbar from Half-Life. Hits feel like hits, magic spells feel like they are doing significant damage and blocking gives you a sense of danger avoided. If you do go the melee route, you'll still get a bit of a sense of button mashing but it's still a big step up from Oblivion. Rating: Viking life 9.5/10

review: I recommend this game. Bethesda have desgined and created a true masterpiece. The Elder Scrolls series is some really great lore, the feel it has is so immersive, more so to our own I feel, and I have to say, slightly more so than J.R.R Tolkiens lore on middle earth. Skyrims feel is no diffrent to the other games in the franchise, altho I must admit I haven't had the pleasure of expieriencing any of them other than a small 1 hour, 1 death play of Morrowind, Skyrim, of course, in fact I believe to have over 2000 hours of gameplay in Skyrim, as I play on the Xbox 360 most of my time, and my fellow brethren allow me to indulge them in some lore and I'll do some roleplay with their character which we don't mind. Oblivion also, I've had many an adventure in the realm of oblivion and Cyrodill, I even have the game manual and every DLC, paid full price as on the XBOX. Probally countless more hours on that game, and I'm definatley familiar with lore in The Elder Scrolls, however, the freedom and power that come with playing and being immersed in an Elder Scrolls game is unlike any other, thanks to bethesda softworks and many other countless reasons :OO: the impact it has on the way at least I think, is significant, makes me want to roleplay,and I shall set out and weave my own fate, outsatanding..... :') If you play skyrim, and your rig, whatever you play on. be it laptop, linux I think you can run it on? Mac, anything I guess, if its about the average, I say you definatley should get some mods running with skyrim, it only matters that you have the right and required system/rig, to run it on IF you want graphical mods, or highly increase data and such, otherwise, not so important. You would want to go to Nexus mods and community, on the web, and search on catorgorys for anything your interested in. Also before I tell you what I have, you will need to know how to install mods, if you don't already know, of course if you are unsure of anything you may not want to mess anything up or waste your time to try it, for a great guide on how to do almost everything with mods, search YouTube for Gopher, and watch his video on, well anything, hes a great guy and he explains all you need to know better than most people do that I've seen haha. Hope you get through that alright, and really, if your under 10 years old, which its sort of illegal or breaking some rules if you are, to play the game exetra, you might find it hard to understand, skip things and not do what you need to correctly, causing things to get messy and possibly broken. Don't take shortcuts (follow the guidence/trail) you can ask me anything on the matter too I'd be happy to oblige. Personally I have many* about 50 immersion modifications (mods) and more gameplay effects and changes, also maybe 5 overhauls, one for each, audio, combat, skills, enviroment, gameplay, and a complicated one. Well its a long list of around 600 alltogether modifications, bare in mind that some of theese are about 3kb in size, so i could somehow merge together all the files ive found and downloaded and get to only have 50 or so mods, but not really necesary, with Nexus Mod Manager. Basically, modifications personalise to your dreams and taste, give you what you want and possibly more, there are about 25'000 modifications to be found on the site and many more to come, you can always create and add yourself, Skyrim is endless then and truely magnificicant. If we were to modify older TES games it just wouldnt live up to Skyrim modded as it is down to technology, but can give you endless more time playing with excitement and emotion, and even merging other realms, ooohhh hah (: so much to tell you I could, I guess if you want to know more I'd be a good start to ask on, and your welcome to. It is a great life expierience to explore and adventure Skyrim, turn HUD off at the start if I were you, to be more immersed, and if you will add mods, play through the beggining untill you are 'Unbound' and start to configure, and do not forget to save! Oh that's another thing, if you have more than 4 saves it usuallyy caused loads of problems, like Crash To Desktop and corruption with data, that sort, so limit your saves wisely. Just to say, there is a mod made for Skyrim, for littrally 60% of what ever you think of, and if not, make it :), hardly limmeted, I dont know how to say to people that they should start playing it... If you, are hungry for adventure, seek the land of Skyrim! Fare well..

review: Having spent many hours (days, weeks :-) playing Skyrim, I finally feel qualified to report that it is without doubt one of the best games available on STEAM. The vanilla game is very good but where this addition excels is in the mods and the modding community attached to it. With over 8,000 mods, you can play as anyone from an immortal god sent to save the planet, to a serial  and murderer intent on destroying it (I have been both). And anyone or anything you can think of in between! Be warned though, this one will consume you and your time. Having cut me teeth on TES IV OBLIVION, I had high hopes for this sequal and it did not disappoint. If you consider yourself a true gamer or have ever wondered what it would be like to really live another life (within or outside the law), SKYRIM is a must have!

review: Let me clear things up by assuring you that none of the quest bugs, graphical issues, gameplay glitches, or unexplained crashes I've encountered can change the fact that I played this amazing RPG for well over 400 hours and absolutely loved every single moment of it! This game is absolutely fantastic and fascinating! even after years of playing this game it doesn't fail to surprise and amaze me! But the thing that really brings skyrim to life is its modding community! There are millions of great mods out there waiting to be explored! If you're new to modding or don't even know what that means i'd suggest visiting a youtube channel called "gophersvids", you can find tons of recommendations and instructions on how to make your skyrim experience UNFORGETTABLE! And now to cap it up I'd say that you MUST buy and play this game if you're even slightly interested in role-playing games!

review: Skyrim is probably one of my favorite games. I have played it on the Xbox, Ps3, and Pc, and all I can say is... wow. The game is great ; It has an awesome plot, graphics, and interesting mods. Because however, I have played it on different consoles, it is annoying to have to restart, and then proceed to get through all the cutscenes and quests I have completed so many times before. But time and time again, I find myself dealing with the struggle and continuing where I left off previously, and strangely enjoying every minute of it. This game has a few flaws, but if you like rpg's, get this game now! 9.5/10

review: One of the greatest games of all time. Building on the lore and events from past Elder Scrolls games, Skyrim really takes the gameplay and graphics to the next level. Beautiful, fun, expansive, a near endless amount of stuff to do, two main story arcs running simulataneously, morality decisions....pretty much everything you could want from an open world RPG. There are bugs, and you will need to save often, but between the vanilla game, the DLC, and all the crazy mods available, this game will be responsible for your lack of sleep potentially for years to come. I think this has become number three on my list after Morrowind and Baldurs Gate.

review: why i love skyrim. i was playing and looking for this dungeon. so im riding along the night on my horse. coming near the dungeon i see some lights flickering on my left side. deciding i can ignore the dungeon a little longer i was going to check it out. upon arrival i noticed it was a village with a ghost on a ghost horse sitting in the middle of the village. trying to kill it i saw i did no damage on him so i got back on my horse i and decided to follow it. whilst following the ghost i came across a freaking dragon rising up form his grave. deciding i had to kill see where this ghost was going i ignored the dragon and went by as fast as i could. still following the ghost i noticed by now he had no head. still following the ghost i came across a bandit ambush. trying to flee from this as well they dropped a boulder from a bridge ontop of my horse. sprinting away as fast as i could i kept following the ghost, but now on foot. finally the headless horseman stops at this tomb kinda looking thing. as i look around a bit the ghosts vanquishes and im now alone in the tomb. killing a few skeletons i see the ghosts his grave. after getting the loot and having exhausted my next options i decided to go back to the village where i met the headless horseman for the first time to go find my dungeon from there on. back at the village the same dragon i saw resurrected earlier flies by and attacks it. killed him and went to my dungeon afterwards. this just happend to me. this game is F*CKING AMAZING!

review: The game is set in the titular snowy realm, its the fifth in the fantasy series that defines the term open world, and its got dragons in it. This game is addictive with its storyline, exploration, quests, factions. The game litterally grips you tight and won't let you go! :P The opening of the fifth Elder Scrolls game immeditely throws you into conflict, destruction, the civil war storyline and the arrival of a dragon which means potential doom for Skyrim. This game is set in the cold, snowy harsh-land of the Nords (which is based on Norse-men/Vikings) and Skyrim has a lot more to deal with than only dragons! Skyrim is torn between two sides due to the Civil War - the Imperials and the Stormcloaks which both have different interests but seeks to oppose the other side for power. Then there is all these other factions who need help such as the Companions (whose storyline I REALLY love), The Dark Brotherhood and the Thieves Guild to name a few. Skyrim has a vast and beautiful landscape with it's amazing cities (Whiterun, Riften, Winterhold and Solitude are my favourite cities by far) that has it's own history, culture and story. With Skyrim, you'll always have SOMETHING to do. Whether that is questing, fighting, exploring, crafting, stealing - there is so much to do and Skyrim gives you tons of choices and options which for me is one of the most important things a game should have. Skyrim is a complete free-world so you could do whatever you want and aren't limited to just one thing for example you can completely skip out the main storyline about the rise of dragons and as well as that the game has amazing replayablitity. You can replay the games tons of times as different races, classes, stories, modded or vanilla. Basically in a nutshell, Skyrim is an amazing game where you can truly live the life of a fantasy world. So, for that I give the game a thumbs-up and a 4 out of 5 stars! :D

review: When you hear the word RPG, what is the first thing that comes to mind? Elder Scrolls, or Dungeons and Dragons? Maybe both? Skyrim is an example of what happens when true elements of both RPG & action are put the ultimatum. It's an absolutely beautiful game with a game soundtrack to pay money for. With the addition of mods this is in the top 10 list of all time greatest Steam Games. In the beginning you start off a prisoner in the hands of Cyrodill's Imperial Legion led by the region head legatus, General Tullius. Although you start off on death throw if you will with your head about to be a seperate part of your body entirely the game quickly breaks the idea of an execution by bringing in a sudden dragon assault on the city of Helgen which is at the time an Imperial outpost connecting the rest of Tamriel including parts of the game Oblivion to the region of Skyrim. There are more quests to even count in this game, I lost count around 60 but the addition of mods can add around another 1,000 quests if not more. Which then we come to the crown jewel of many steam games, modding communities and boy.. Does Skyrim have one, well over 100+ different mods for every reason what so ever. There are mods which fixed the broken military system in the game, there are mods which adds more travelers and adventurers on the road adding more of a lifelike feel to the game. There are also mods which can hurt the games realism as well, some mods are not meant for the lore of Elder Scrolls but the entertainment of the player instead. If I were to give ESV: Skyrim a rating, In a range from 1 - 10 it's nearly a 9.5, It's great on so many levels but there are snibbets even with mods still aren't correcting. Guards only want you and nobody else. The NPC's do the same constant moves 24/7, and for some reason I never understood this an NPC who's 10 feet away will stop everything they're doing to say Hi to you. SKYRIM RATING: SYNDICATE RATING Gameplay - 8 (Gameplay is good but could dramatically be improved with more combat actions) RPG Element - 10 (This game seemed to never have an ending to the nearly limitless number of quests you could do, on PS3 I spent well over 100 hours playing the game and was just barely getting done. ) Multiplayer - 0 (The Game isn't meant for online play, and it really doesn't take anything away from the true game itself.) Graphics - 9 (Graphics on Vanilla are good for the game, but with enhancement mods it will skyrocket to a solid 10 with every little detail imaginable.) Replay Value: 10 (This game is beyond the single word of addicting, it will make you come back for more and more.) Official Syndicate Rating, 9.6 - Skyrim is a masterpiece in Roleplay engineering a true marvel of Bethesda. The amazement is after 3 years this game still runs as strong as ever! Revitalized with the modding community Skyrim maybe one of the legends of the RPG and maybe even Steam game series which lives on.

review: This is the game the never, ever ends. I picked this game up thinking I wouldn't like it having never played a previous TES game before. Sat in my Library untouched for about a month or two, and finally took the plunge. I was wrong. I was so very, very wrong. This is probably the best purchase I've ever made on steam. Add in the unlimited potential of modding, and it's an adventure that continues forever. I've probably restarted over a hundred times by now with a new character, and still only have beaten Alduin once. ONCE. There's still so much more do to and explore that I'm still discovering quests and areas and little hidden things. I still can't believe how much there is to do and I'm still finding more. At it stands I'll probably wake up one day having lost all touch with reality and actually start seeing the world as Skyrim with how much I've played. And I'm totally ok with that.

review: Great RPG, go where you want, kill who you want, steal what you want. The quest are great with a good story behind it (I dont do alot of story lines, not really a fan in any game). The combat seems like an improvement from previous Elder Scroll games. Magic is fun to play around with but I'll always use my trusty Bow, the aim is right on, just hard to hit them flying dragons. Skills are done nicely, If your an archer type, using bows alot, and wanna try 2 hand weapons, you dont have to make a new character, just start using 2 hand weapons with your archer and you'll gain skill. Since there is level ramping (enemies in the world level and scale up compared to what level you are) when you switch to using 2 hand weapons, you will notice a damage differance, but just keep using you'll get your skill where it needs to be soon enough. Its easy to get lost in doing side quest from the main story, as they randomly generate. Over all, if you like alot of the Elder Scrolls and/or Fallout series, you'll love this. 9/10

review: One of my favorite RPG Open World Fantasy games! World is really big and just fantastic. I love the style and gameplay of this game. Quests are really fun and you are never bored while playing. I really like the style of playing because you can play as warrior or wizard style. Also there are skills/levels for character which you decide which one to upgrade. World is huge! Fantasy level is normal because you can kill also normal warriors/people instead only monsters/dragons. Story line is really sick! Only the problem is on start of game because you need to walk a lot but later when you discover all the places and towns then you can use fast travel option. Game also have a lot of side quests and hiden places to complete and discover especially if you buy legendary edition of the game then you have a lot of new quests. Like i said, it's one of the best RPG games so i reccommend this game to all RPG and Fantasy lovers. Game it totally worth of money! 9,5/10

review: In Skyrim you may find yourself in a huge open world where you can choose which path of many you'll take, and, if you put enough effort, why not all of them? You have a really good main questline that is surrounded by even better questlines, like the epic Thieves Guild and Dark Brotherhood quests. You will have over two hundred hours of game before you're able to say "I've got no more quests to do". If you've finished your main questline, slayed Alduin and saved the world, you can still go after the Dragon Claws, Dragon Shouts, Dragon Priests Masks(you probably notice they've got all about dragons this time right?), becoming the leader of the Mages College of Winterhold, Thieves Guild, Companions, Dark Brotherhood, becoming a general on a civil war, collecting all the Daedric Artifacts(which one has its unique quest), joining the Bards Guild, and even doing tons of sidequests, and do all of this with a character that most suits your style of playing, it can be a mage, battle mage, warrior, berserker, paladin, stealth assassin, rogue, summoner... And I'm not even talking about the DLCs that come with new questlines and a whole new continent for you to explore. As if this was not enough, the game counts with a incredible number of totally functional mods that can add more quests, more races, more weapons and armors, take the graphs to a whole new level, make the game mor immersive, give you a new user interface, completely change the whole game that even make you feel like you don't know how to play skyrim anymore(T3nd0, i'm talking to you), and all kinds of mods you can think about(don't use it too much or you may end up like a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle slaying trains on Mario Land). That's it, if you like action RPG with a lot of stories for you to be part of there's no way you're not liking Skyrim.

review: Nowadays, there's no reason not to get this game. A playthrough will last you for about 100 hours, which is really good considering it's a 15 game (and getting it for -75% is rather easy if you're patient). Skyrim is a good game. I wouldn't say it's great due to its mediocre combat, mediocre physics and lack of feeling of progression at times. But it's enjoyable nonetheless. I feel like the game's overrated, but it's certainly not bad.

review: Skyrim has to be one of the most epic (and I mean that in large proportions as well as completely awesome) games that I have ever played. There is a deep sense of immersion to be found, hours upon hours of gameplay (especially if you create multiple characters) and a near endless supply of awesome mods to keep you going. Only things I don't like: Buggy as I'll get out, although not unplayably so. Just ask someone about the horses. Dragon Combat is a bit lacking The Sneak skill is freaking BROKEN you can one shot bosses if you aren't on the harder difficulties Lets fight even MORE Dragur! Also, PLEASE get a DLC, at least one, and Hearthfire doesn't count. They are both good, get one, get both, heck get Legendary Edition if you want and have them ALL, but please get one of them. They add so much to the game. All in all, I'd say 9/10. Great game :D

As always Bethesda has give us a MASTERPIECE of a game, Bethesda is used to make high detailed open world RPG games, following Fallout 3 from 2008 with the open world high detail terain they did it again, but in a much larger world with much more stuff to explore, Tod Howard is a genious... The story is great, some kind of fetish for prisoners is what Bethesda loves, but the whole game is unbeatable, even after you finish the game and start all over again you will find something new, random events are great, so it gives you planty of side quests, apsolutly an amazing game, 9.5/10

review: Excellent game for when you want your own personal game time. Plenty of quests for when you want to make progress on storylines. But just as enjoyable if you want to just chillax and explore. The latest patches go a long way but highly recommend the unofficial patches to fix some left over minor bugs. The workshop and nexus have excellent mods to customise the base game into a version you enjoy. If you found something annoying in the game, likely someone else did too and already created a mod for it.

review: Note: My experience may vary from yours since I was running 70+ mods, some of which altered companion AI, voiced dialogue, graphics, etc. This review is directed at players who never played The Elder Scrolls before and have little experience with fantasy RPGs. Skyrim is one of the greatest western RPGs of this generation but I'm convinced that it's not for everyone. If you're not sure if this is the right game for you, then ask yourself the following questions: 1. Do you enjoy playing in a fantasy setting similar to Lord of the Rings that includes magic, Orcs, Elves, demons, etc. ? 2. Do you enjoy lore? That includes paying attention to the dialogue, considering the impact of your choices on the main story and possibly even reading many pages of text? (the last one is optional) 3. Do you enjoy exploring dungeons? It involves enemies, simple puzzles and loot that may include gear or ability upgrades. 4. Do you enjoy playing a single player experience in a vast open world with only AI to interact with? MMO players often find the game too quiet and lonely. 5. Do you enjoy embarking on hundreds of side quests? I know a number of people who were distracted by the side quests and eventually forgot what the main story was about and unfortunately quit. 6. (Optional) Do you enjoy endless modding possibilities? Skyrim has the biggest modding community on the internet and the things you can change range from absurd to epic. Please note that excessive modding can make your game very unstable and even render it unplayable if you're not very careful. I spent days preparing a list of cohesive mods then I installed and uninstalled them a number of times and troubleshooted multiple problems to make them work. The process can very tedious but the results are completely worth it. If your answer to all the above questions is Yes, then I would recommend that you get Skyrim. A number of my friends quit the game within a few days because they got distracted by side quests and forgot the goal of the main story. If you're like them then I recommend that you beat the main campaign first. You'll have all the time in the world after that for the various quests, factions and DLCs. Bethesda's take on the various playable races and their designs is very different from the likes of Lord of the Rings and Warcraft. Do not expect to see skimpy armors or fair elves. The game has a considerable number of bugs. Nothing that would ruin your experience but expect the occasional glitch or crash to happen. I recommend saving every often. Fallout 3 or NV fan? You will feel right at home. Just replace the guns with swords and magic and the post apocalyptic wasteland with a fantasy setting.

review: Fantastic game! Gamers who enjoy a continuous story and plenty amounts of side missions and quests filled with magic, dragons and old fashioned combat, will be more satisfied than having a fap on a sunday morning. Great graphics, great gameplay, great storyline. Not much else can be said apart from it being MASSIVELY ADDICTIVE!

review: The elder scrollls:Skyrim its an epic adventure trough the land of skyrim... often im asked what`s the best weapons armour, my answer to that is: that all depends on YOUR point of wiew my friend IF you wanna be stealthy i can craft you the finest dagger in all of skyrim, if you want to be strong i can craft you the finest battleaxe, if you wanna be a mage or maybe an archer i can craft you the most powerfull staff and bow, you can hunt for food,fish,steal,buy your food if you want you can choose to do sidequest or mainquest and learn power of the voice... you feel sleepy? then find a village or maybe a city and an Inn with beds, or are you looking for an adventure heh if you are you can just talk to people and ask for quest or you can just find your own adventure need money heh then you can be stealthy and pickpocket people or do quest and claim you reward or sell stuff you dont need go to dungeons find chests loot bodies slay your enemies or be nice to them and get allies backstab people learn how to transform to a werefolf and eat your foes, get ambushed by bandits, fight the most eoic creature ever lived... DRAGON kill it loot its body take dragon bones and scales SO if you wanna be strong craft dragon bone armour and fight kill and slay epic monsters in the hole world...this is skyrim... this is an epic adventure...

review: This game is awesome. I had it for the PS3, beat it and thought I would play it on my PC because it's just that good. I bought the bundle pack with the DLC so I am excited to play them all! I dont even do the main quests, I just like wandering around and going into caves etc and fighting enemies and finding some pretty sweet items (most of which I sell for money). Did I mention dragons? I love dragons, it makes sad that I have to kill them but nonethless, they died with honour. Oh, and there's some pretty funny glitches.

review: I could type up a long review for this game and explain how great it is in-detail. But words can't describe such a beautiful game. It released in 2011, and still graphically tops most releases today. And with mods only further improving the aesthetics, it's amazing eye candy. The main story is average. But with the tons and tons of side-quests, it comes together for an amazing universe and story with great lore. I've found myself spending a lot of time simply reading the books within the game. The sword combat isn't anything to write home about. It's the same as all TES games, though, and sadly isn't on par with Oblivion's difficulty. But throw in magic and other ways to fight, it's still entertaining. The environments are amazing. Throwing away the bland and copy-paste dungeons of Oblivion, each new location is filled with fun enemies and beautiful views. All in all, Skyrim is my most played title and amazing in every right. If you are still thinking about getting Skyrim, I recommend you do it ASAP. With tons of mods to fix the slightest problems you might find or to simply improve your own experience, it's a game that hardly ever gets old. I highly recommend you get it.

review: This game in unlike any other elder scrolls game, with the endless amount of mods this game goes on forever and you never really beat it completely and this game as made me rethink whether or not i really want to do anything with my life, amazing game with or without mods...........With that being said, esbern is the biggest  i have ever met in my entire en life, not that hes a bad character but the fact that he is the most buggiest piece of trash i have ever seen in a game this old, a while back i pirated this game and ran into an issue where his sassy attitude wouldent speak to me and i couldent open his little prison door and talk to him, this caused me to quiet the game thinking it was aproblem due to it being pirated, now after playing it on steam i figured "Pshhhh deres no wayyyy ill run into the same problem again, i mean this is the official steam version, with countless updates and bug fixes" But oh was i wrong, every damn mission i run into with this asshat he dosent talk to me, i ended up lowering my standards to typing a cheat that allowed me to skip the quest at hand, this made me feel like trash considering i missed a large amount of information that he had to offer. After i typed that code in and "complete" the quest i figured " Eh, he'll just be broken for this quest right?" NOPE AGAIN, this little  didn't talk to me for the whole FUGGEN GAME!!! I then figured screw that old fatass, im doing my own thing and completely ignored all quests involving him. Besides the fact that esbern is a total slingbanger , this game is incredible!!!

I recommend this game for enyone who is looking for exitement in an rpg game. U will get pulled from one story to the other all while exploring this vast and wonderfull world (nicely polished) The only small thing i can find is the fact that there is no Online-Multi co-op option, but then i guess thats where Eso will fill in the blanks. 9-10 sound(track) 9-10 storyline 8-10 gameplay-mechanics A Big thumbs up.

Mods even add story lines and missions, even dungeons are added. A very good game.

review: So many filfy hagravenses to burn... On a more serious note, the game is fantastic. The adventure/exploration of the game is great; the outdoor environments are varied and beautiful at a distance, though as you get closer you're going to see some low-poly terrain and texture lines. The stories you can find in random dungeons around the world are great, giving the adventurer hours of reading material and interesting events to figure out, but each time something like this is found, the empty space between the points of interest are filled with enemies, when in my opinion would better serve as beautiful tours through past civilisations and lives. The game is great for almost every gamer, with exploration, adventure, role-playing and action. However, by putting all of these elements densly into the game, each individual part loses focus. If you just want to explore, you're going to have to cut through swathes of enemies (somewhat mitigated by setting the difficulty level to Novice). If you want in-depth combat, most of it is there, but bosses are basically just the same old enemies with more HP and damage. I would love to see purely adventure/exploration areas in the game, with no combat and plenty of interesting stories to discover, along with bright, beautiful environments. I'd also like to see puzzle-/strategy-based boss-fights, rather than just buffing the same mobs to boss-levels. The modding community has given this game everlasting life in the form of content additions, visual enhancements and improved gameplay depth. Overall, Skyrim is an incredible game which manages to present an in-depth world for you to explore. However, it doesn't quite achieve this depth with any of the gameplay elements.

review: At its core, Skyrim is a fairly solid game - rather a lot of bugs, to be sure, but still an enjoyable experience. More than six or so voice actors would have been nice, as it's rather weird running into, for example, shopkeepers that have the same voice as a quest-line's primary antagonist (though I would like Nazeem more if he had Alduin's voice). Where the game really shines, though, is the modding community - most problems that you can think of in the game have been either fixed or bizarrely exaggerated by a mod that's out there, somewhere, and that's without going into the handful of mods that add things with Tommy Wiseau's voice.

review: The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, so much to say about this game. I will try to keep it short.  = Poor  = Fair  = Good  = Nice  = Awesome  = Amazing  This game is without a doubt the best, and I mean, the best game I have ever played. In all its beauty, Skyrim brings you all your heart could possibly desire. You can practically be anything you want and the options are endless. Customize your characher like there is no tomorrow. If you want to explore, this is the game. If you want to fight endless ammounts of bad guys and monsters, this is the game. If you want a variety of different combat styles, this is the game. You get to do all that in the most beautiful universe, and I assure you, that you will play no other game that has the same extrodinary nature like Skyrim. Even if you aren't the biggest fan of singleplayerbased games, this game will catch your attention right away. This is a true beauty. ing fantastic!

review: "The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim" is an amazing, enticing open world with vast quanities of things to do. Whether it be fighting off Legendary dragons or delving deep into the ancient Dwemer ruins, it is impossible to get bored. The music is exhilarating and triumphant, the gameplay is stupendous, the languages within the game are linguistically beautiful and you feel like the characters are one with your family. After indulging for hours on end playing this game, you'll find your self-impowerment increasing and you will feel like the Dovakhiin, or, Dragonborn. The soul of a warrior... (I recomend playing at an "Adept" or "Legendary" game difficulty or the game will seem a bit slow) -Enthusiastic

review: This game has taken so much of my time up, but Do not regret it for a second. Originally I had it on the ps3 when it first came out and sunk about 300-400 hours into it then, After the debacle with the DLC on the ps3 I bought the game on the 360 so that I could play the DLC when they each came out and sunk a few more hundred hours into the game. Now I have finally found wisdom and got myself a gaming pc I have it again, this time modded for a whole new experience to sink more and more hours into. If you like fantasy, first person and making up your own character back story and character quirks then this is the game for you. You can do anything and everything in this game, but the question is, what does your character want to do?

I've played this game for 2 years after i downloaded it from the Internet, piratly, after 2 years i still was amaized from the game, it was awesome, and it's still awesome. so i felt bad for not buying that, i bought it even if i've played it for 2 years and i know the main stuff in the game, i don't regret it. awesome game bethesta ! thank you !

review: This is my review which lists the pros and cons of, The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, for the PC. I've beaten this game three times outside of Steam, and I don't just mean the main quest... I'll mainly try to review the modless version of the game, but I really will try to emphasise how mods can enhance the game and every aspect of it. I'll try to be as descriptive and helpful as I can, while still maintaining that checklist flow. This should sum up just about everything that needs to be said in one review. If anyone has any pros/cons they think I should add, go ahead and tell me in the comments and I'll adjust the material accordingly. Some of these on the list will only be recognizeable by fans of the previous Elder Scrolls games, but they'll be subtle. Here goes... *Pros? +The amazing open world of Skyrim to explore +Decent and immersive story to follow for each questline +Graphics look simply amazing, they're not too extensive on the hardware, and there are plenty of mods to enhance them +Fast travel is an available option once you discover a location, and there are countless locations to discover +Epic soundtrack composed by the well known Jeremy Soule to enjoy +Countless of NPC's to interact with +Unlike Morrowind, this game has more than a single digit of voice actors, haha +Plenty of followers/companions to follow you on your adventures +Tons of factions to join +Countless of quests, sidequests, and misc. quests for you to do +Your actions, choices, faction activies, progress, etc. all have an impact on Skyrim, it's people, and you +A 'crime and effect'/bounty system +Ability to interact with the Daedra Princes +A massive amount of items available in-game +A massive amount of different creatures and enemies for you to fight, and plenty of 'boss' fights available +Plenty of playstyles to choose from (e.g. warrior, thief, mage, craftsman, etc.) +The ability to become a vampire or werewolf, which is very well done (both have their own skill trees) +Tons of skills to level and expand on, there are branching skill tree perks (they've added aspects to the skill tree that can expand the max level to 252+, instead of the original 81) +A difficulty slider for 5 different difficulties- can be changed any time in-game +Amazing character creation (e.g. name, gender, race, hair, eyes, skin tone, paint/dirt, facial construction, etc.), and there are even mods to expand your options +Houses, wife, kids, and pets (Hearthfire DLC adds extra huge houses that you can build up yourself) +Console codes are an option. You can go ahead and cheat, or if you're stuck in a glitch or a bug you can go ahead and try to fix it with the console which is very useful. The console does not deactivate achievements like in Fallout: New Vegas +The DLC expansions are amazing, and are totally worth the price; and you'll clock in tons of enjoyment and hours to the game, which is why I recommend The Legendary Edition to begin with (Dragonborn DLC adds Solstheim to the map- which past fans will remember from the Bloodmoon DLC from Morrowind) +Free 'HD Texture Pack DLC' available for download, which is completely optional +mods, Mods, MODS!!! There are countless of mods out there for you to enjoy, literally. They are easy to install. And, they can change the whole of the game completely. I can't even begin to capitalize on this 'pro'. They can change everything +Steam Worshop integration, and Nexus Mod Manager support +Still a huge community +Steam badges, trading cards, backgrounds, emoticons, and achievements (And Steam Sync is integrated) +Fully mappable controls +My opinion? Morrowind > Skyrim > Oblivion, although newer gamers may not be able to enjoy Morrowind, so Skyrim may be the way to go for you +No cliff-racers *Cons? -Not as good without mods- but still amazing nonetheless, mods are completely optional. This may be more of a con for console players I guess -Mods can sometimes cause CTD's (Crash to Desktop), corrupt saves, bugs, glitches, etc. -Bugs, glitches, and crashes -Some Morrowind 'fanboys' hate on the game- so you might be reading this and end up being one of them (before you say anything; Morrowind is one of my favorite games of all time, and I can admit that I like it way better than Skyrim) -Main questline is a bit short -Repeated NPC lines can get a bit annoying- there are mods to fix that though -Horses seem to be a bit slow and weak- there are mods to fix that though -Becoming a vampire seems to have more cons than pros in my opinion- there are mods to fix that though -Can become a bit OP later in the game, if so, turning up the difficulty should help a bit (might be a good thing or a bad thing) -A bit lacking in graphical/display settings- but it's not that taxing, and it does offer "plenty" of settings in the launcher -Dragons eventually become the new cliff-racer- there are mods to fix that though Well, that was my review of Skyrim. I hope I convinced you to purchase this game. Or maybe I convinced you not to purchase this game, you never know. Anyways, thanks for reading, and I hope I was helpful in your decision. Or, maybe I just convinced you to go ahead and get into mods, hah

review: I absolutely love this game. I have spent many hours playing it on the xbox360 and ended up buying it again on the PC so I could start trying all the interesting mods and HD rendering. This is a game that you can play over and over again and each time you play through it, it is an entirely different experience. Only downside I can think of is there are a few questlines where you have an option to go one way or the other (I wont go into details to avoid spoilers) any one side is really well developed and interesting and the other falls short. There are only a couple of them where this applies though.

review: The elder scrollls:Skyrim its an epic adventure trough the land of skyrim... often im asked what`s the best weapons armour, my answer to that is: that all depends on YOUR point of wiew my friend IF you wanna be stealthy i can craft you the finest dagger in all of skyrim, if you want to be strong i can craft you the finest battleaxe, if you wanna be a mage or maybe an archer i can craft you the most powerfull staff and bow, you can hunt for food,fish,steal,buy your food if you want you can choose to do sidequest or mainquest and learn power of the voice... you feel sleepy? then find a village or maybe a city and an Inn with beds, or are you looking for an adventure heh if you are you can just talk to people and ask for quest or you can just find your own adventure need money heh then you can be stealthy and pickpocket people or do quest and claim you reward or sell stuff you dont need go to dungeons find chests loot bodies slay your enemies or be nice to them and get allies backstab people learn how to transform to a werefolf and eat your foes, get ambushed by bandits, fight the most eoic creature ever lived... DRAGON kill it loot its body take dragon bones and scales SO if you wanna be strong craft dragon bone armour and fight kill and slay epic monsters in the hole world...this is skyrim... this is an epic adventure...

review: I just can't express how amazing, well-done and powerful this game is. It is just.. the Best RPG I have ever played in my life. It is kinda addicted as well. Moreover, it never ends and has an amazing story. Even if you will get bored from it in far future , it has plenty of mods in the workshop that will make game even more fun. Totally worth buying.. with all DLCs that it has. 10/10 ...

When you buy a game twice just so you can mod it you know you have a problem that can only be dealt with by years of expensive therapy. Don't waste your money on that, however buy more video games to escape those problems. This game will make you question many things. Things like why can horses climb up walls? Or, why do dragons land just so you can kill them? It is a very thought provoking game. I plan to write all future essays that I have to write on this game and minecraft. Buy this game so you can be like me!

review: First off, it's a great game, it would be stupid to deny it, but if you've had some issues with Morrowind and Oblivion (and even Fallout 3), they haven't been fixed. The animations are still awkward, the combat AI is stiil "fight or flee", without any variation or tactics needed. I don't care about the "main story" as it's a sandbox, but the dialog is abysmal. The balance later in the game crawls into a hole and dies, making the game quite dull the farther you get. And as with any Bethesda title, there are bugs everywhere. But it's still fun to play and when the community starts churning out mods, it's gonna be amazing. As someone who hated Oblivion before it was cool to hate it, I say I had fun with Skyrim. Get it when it's on sale.

review: Pretty average open world RPG/ARPG (with dumbed down RPG elements from previous games) when unmodded. Game quality increases with the right mods. Thankfully Bethesda kept the tradition of including mod support. All my pet peeves (dragons too easy, vampire/werewolf system, graphics, combat, crafting, dull/hollow NPCs...) can be fixed with mods. Tens/hundreds of hours long with mods like Falskaar (user made, adds a whole new area with voice acting and all) extending it even more. 3/5 unmodded. Still not a bad game, but why settle for mediocre? 4-5/5 when properly modded.

review: "The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim" is an amazing, enticing open world with vast quanities of things to do. Whether it be fighting off Legendary dragons or delving deep into the ancient Dwemer ruins, it is impossible to get bored. The music is exhilarating and triumphant, the gameplay is stupendous, the languages within the game are linguistically beautiful and you feel like the characters are one with your family. After indulging for hours on end playing this game, you'll find your self-impowerment increasing and you will feel like the Dovakhiin, or, Dragonborn. The soul of a warrior...

review: Skyrim is like Pringles. A more serious review: The Elder Scrolls Skyrim is without a doubt, one of the very few games that hooked me on for hours. Very few games achieved that. I've played many games that as much as I loved and enjoyed playing, they couldn't suck me in this black hole where I just can't stop. Skyrim is like Pringles, say you only want one chip, then you want another, and another, in the end you finished the entire can before you know it. As a game, Skyrim's endless number of quests, side stories, NPCs, items, dungeons, random overworld events mean you never run out of things to do, which also means you can never really stop until you tell yourself "I've totally played this for way too long". Skyrim is a first person RPG, a standard not many RPGs follow. Nearly every one I've played is third person or real time, but the first person style makes Skyrim that much more engaging, with combat very skill oriented. You have stats, but it is simplified to only health, stamina and magic, meaning there's no need to fiddle around with crazy amounts of numbers to figure out what are the "best" equipment. Some may disagree and prefer having more stat variety, I say the simplicity means you spend less time looking at your inventory and more time fighting, which is where the fun is. Unlike most other RPGs, if you missed, it's because you missed. Everything based on your skill of aiming. Similarly, if you failed to block, you didn't block in time. All of this makes Skyrim the most action oriented RPG game I've played, something which I find really fun. Fighting is all part of your own skill whilst other RPGs are basically down to just picking the right skills and hoping the RNG will make the enemies miss or for you to land more critical hits. TESV: Skyrim is a black hole. It is Pringles. It is the game that few games achieved to do to me. Suck me in and not let go. For comparison, the other games that did this were: Pokemon Red, The Sims and Metroid Prime. I give TESV: Skyrim a Pringles/10

review: About 1400~ hours played (Console+Steam) and I'm still having fun at this. The game itself is huge enough to spend hundreds of hours with it, but when you reached the point where you get bored by the vanilla game.. then the real fun begins: Mods. The game is awesomely supported through a huge community and allows you too do almost everything you want. Flying? jepp. Become a werebear? no problem. Become a lich? why not? blood not realistic enough? take this mod. It's the best action-RPG-game I know so far, I'd definitly recommend it. PS: It's engine is so amazing that you can even run it on a low spec machine smoothly (if not you can install some perfomance mods)

review: Skyrim is an amazing game released by Bethesda 3 years ago. It is the 5th game in the Elder Scrolls series. I have only played Skyrim (TES 5) and Oblivion (TES 4). Skyrim is a game with a lot a re-playability, so unless you have no patience, then you'll enjoy it. Allthough it can get very repetative sometimes. One of my friends describes it as going into dungeons and killing Draugr. The main focus is around the dragons, which have returned after the Oblivion Crisis. I highly recommend this as it is now quite cheap and so are the DLC which let you ride dragons, become a vampire lord and build houses among many other things. Can't wait for the next Elder Scrolls game. (not Online, that's daylight robbery)
game-hours: 331.7
review: This is possibly the best elder scrolls game ever. It has improved or added features from other games. I would know. In the direct predecessor, Oblivion You can do many things such as join guilds and organizations like the Dark brotherhood, The Thieves guild or The Blades. In Skyrim There are changes, Such as the fighters guild in Skyrim is called the companions, I know these arent the same groups but they do the same things. And the Mages guild is the College of Winterhold. There are also very nice DLCs for this game such as the Dawnguard or Dragonborn DLCs. The Dawnguard DLC adds the ability to become a vampire lord as well as perks for the vampire lord and werewolf. It also adds a questline where you have to fight the vampire menace by killing one of the most powerful vampire lords in Tamriel, you do this by getting a magic bow to stop the vampires from getting rid of the sun. You also have the choice to join the vampires and block the sun temporarily so that you dont get negative effect from it. That sums Dawnguard up. Now lets get on to Dragonborn. In the Dragonborn DLC you get many new things such as shouts, armor, weapons, There is also another new quest line. In this one you fight Miraak, The first dragonborn. You go to the island of Solstheim to find out why cultist tried to kill you and you run into some trouble along the way. You have to learn the shouts that made Miraak so powerful. It is mainly one shout, called Bend will. With this shout you have the power of flying dragons. Cool huh? You have to go to the Daedric lord Hermaeus Mora to learn this shout. You also meet the Skalls, a people consisting of Nords that believe in a god called the All-Maker. That sums that one up. The is a minor DLC called Hearthfire that adds the ability to adopt children and build your own house but that is mainly it. The modding community also are a very important part in this game. They make many fixes to the main game and also enhances it. There has been many mods that patch parts of the game that make it 100 times better. That sums Skyrim up. If I was giving this a number rating then I would give it a 9.7 out of 10.

I will try to keep it short.  = Poor  = Fair  = Good  = Nice  = Awesome  = Amazing  This game is without a doubt the best, and I mean, the best game I have ever played. In all its beauty, Skyrim brings you all your heart could possibly desire. You can practically be anything you want and the options are endless. Customize your characher like there is no tomorrow. If you want to explore, this is the game. If you want to fight endless ammounts of bad guys and monsters, this is the game. If you want a variety of different combat styles, this is the game. You get to do all that in the most beautiful universe, and I assure you, that you will play no other game that has the same extrodinary nature like Skyrim. Even if you aren't the biggest fan of singleplayerbased games, this game will catch your attention right away. This is a true beauty. ing fantastic!

review: I have put in exactly 392 hours into this game since I first purchased it. Despite some relatively simple AI, somewhat outdated graphics, a really irritated inventory menu and the inevitable bugs that plague the game, Skyrim is one of the greatest RPGS of its era. Though simpler than the previous titles of Morrowind and Oblivion, it allows you much more freedom than either of the two. You can build your character around your particular playstyle with no real "Optimal Builds", and if you ever decide you dislike the way your character is set up, you can simply start training another skill and become good at it. If you spend enough time in Tamriel slaying dragons and saving damsels in distress, your character can learn and master all of the different skills that are available to you. The open-world environment and HUNDREDS of places to explore and quests to complete, you never really feel like you're being forced to go down one particular path and every time you play, you'll end up discovering something new. The indepth lore surrounding the Elder Scrolls series heavily immerses you in the world and story, making you feel like you've stepped into another world. If you love RPGS, this is a MUST HAVE.

The story is a bit seen though but because great Skyrim is famous for it's mods the story will be more interesting after a few mods installed. Graphics are just great. Actually they keep me speechless mostly. And of course bugs, they are the balancing thing between the bloody combat, magic, sthealthiness and travelling. They make this game interesting. I mean that players sometimes even seem to look for the bugs. but as I said in the start ONCE IN LIFETIME. Great game. with 0(worst) - 10(best) i would give 9

Skyrim offers a free roam world full of quests, secrets, and hidden tresures that litter the stunningly beautiful, midevil landscape. I would recommend this game to any gamer whether they prefer Call of Duty styled first person shooters, or World of Warcraft styled RPG's. It also offers a number of DLC packs that will carry your adventure through the Elder Scrolls series even further! If you ever get bored of the run-of-the-mill questing crap you can always look towards the Steam Workshop for over 19,000 different gameplay enhancing mods. This work of art will always keep you on your toes, so keep yourself awake every night playing until your eyes are dryer than the Sahara Desert!

review: Okay....So this is a game where you will never want to quit playing. It has main story lines/quests........But then it has side quests, and they are not like most other games. These sometimes take up to as long as the main quest, that is what i love i could sit down and play all day long if i could. If i had a life i would throw it away to play this game, but i can not do that because i already did. I would fap to this game like it was porn. I would marry this game. I would Die with this game, and tell them to put it in the grave with me. It just makes me sooo happy to see it when i'm down i put in the disc start it up and drown in the, eminse.....fictional world of Skyrim...as the Dragonborn. The dragons are my mentors... the Priests and the Greybeards...the dragons are my friends not my enemies.......I LOVE THIS ING GAME DO NOT MAKE MORE THIS IS JUST UHH....PERFECT. The reason i have barely have any hours is because i currently have a  PC...so i play on my dads Pc when i can, but i'm getting a new one soon. 1,000,000/10 BUY IT NOW!!!!

review: this is my review for this 2 year old game. to start off dont be fooled by the only 5 hours logged on stewam. I first played around 300 hours on a non steam version of the game and picked it up again in sale. now off to the game. now where to start? the story: the stoy is little short but still great to play trhough, good voice actors, enjoyable story and when your done with the main story there are plenty of thing to do around like just freakin murdering everyone or blowing lydia of high hrotgar with FUS RO DAH :D or just do what you want. write your own story. the gameplay: if you like to play in first or third person your choice I like the third person view myself since you can see more of the beautiful world of skyrim around you. the cmbat is solid. not super hard or something but still pretty good. SO many weapons in this game just choose what you want. the graphics: its okay i guess. not the best ive seen but hey its a 2 year old game. and oh yeah some textures are just terrible. but thanks to the awesome skyrim community there are some great texturepacks out there that make the game look so much better. and speaking of the community. its still huge after 2 years. its awesome. there are so many mods for this game that add to a great gameplay experience. go check out the nexus site for mods and the steam workshop ofcourse well to wrap this review up: I sunk in well over 300 hours and im not even bored yet. the open world is so huge and its worth exploring. for me personaly pretty much one of the best games ive ever played. deserves a good and deserved 10/10 buy it already. bye

review: This game is perhaps one of the most comprehensive, vast, and expansive games I have ever played. Throughout my journey through the world of Skyrim, searching through nordic wastelands, crawling through massive dungeons, and completing wonderful questlines, I felt utterly involved, and absorbed into the game. This is a game I very happily paid $60 for, and would highly reccomend it to anyone who's played an RPG similar to this in the past, or even just people who haven't, but would like to know what the epitome of an RPG may be. This has been my favorite game to play through, and I don't regret a second of gameplay.

review: This game is 100% pure brilliance. If you're the type that likes RPG's (and if you're not it's a good way to start :> ) then this is definitely the game for you. The main story itself is quite good, but the way you can go before you get there, side quests and so forth, is just really really good. You should indulge yourself into this game, this is an amazing piece of art, and the design is just beautiful with and intriguing story. Don't forget that it's PC, and the biggest plus from that is the mod community. There are so many good mods, and mods that will make the game better. Buy it, it is just that great.

You can be a man or lizard depends on your level of nerd(mine is 42) and then you preety much die... alot if you don't know what you are doing Don't forget about DLC! that's always necessary Ok let us be honest. Skyrim is an amazing game. Yes it has like over 9000 bugs. But that really does not matter. I reccomend this game alot to anyone so buy it for yourself, mothers, fathers, sisters, brothers, grandma, grandpa, aunt and uncle, cat, dog, dead pet goldfish(RIP) and of course your friends. Have fun!

review: This game is great value for money - especially with the three added DLCs of Dragonborn, Dawnguard and Hearthfire. It can be a bit annoying to arrive back in Whiterun and be instantly hacked to pieces by Vampires, however, they do have some great kit that you can nick off them once you've given them the good news. Being able to choose between following the set storylines or just wandering around the world aimlessly gives many variables to one's gaming experience, and of course the plethora of mods just adds nice customised play. Having the mods easily accessible via the Steam Workshop is highly convenient. Awesome game, awesome experience - play it now!

review: The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is the fifth edition of the popular series of role-playing game. This time the story revolves around the return to the land of the ancient race of dragons and assign us to play the role of one of the last dragon hunters. The game starts with the creation of our virtual hero. You can choose from ten diverse races, whereas there is no division into classes. With advances in play, our character becomes more powerful. When you go to the next level, you can independently increase one of the three basic characteristics: magic, strength and health. Skill system has been divided into clear groups, for example: one-handed weapons or two-handed. Each of these categories contains specific abilities and attacks. There is a new combat system that is more dynamic and also requires tactical thinking. Each hand hero can now assign a weapon, shield or spell. Skyrim offers the opportunity to explore a huge virtual world, which contains, five major cities and hundreds of the underworld. In order to facilitate getting around such a large area the authors have introduced the option of traveling between locations. We can also modify our game through various add-ons created by the community. To summarize the game has quite an interesting story, it is well optimized, has a very good soundtrack and a huge world to explore. During the game, I spent many wonderful hours exploring the provinces of Skyrim. My final rating is 9/10.

review: If you're a person who likes to find all the loot, search every nook and cranny, complete all quests, well I'd say you're probably in for a couple of hundred hours with Skyrim. Let's make that double if you're playing with Legendary difficulty option since it makes every single thing in game to have absurdly high hitpoints and cuts your damage down about 4 times the normal difficulty setting. Still can't decide if legendary difficulty is actually a challenge or outright torture to kill time (not very much so) efficiently. Still being able to enjoy playing it third time. Would definetely recommend to any open world rpg lover.

review: Imagine Fallout: New Vegas. Cover it with snow, take out the fire weapons and fill it with medieval ones. Sprinkle it with dragons, other fantasy monsters and horses, and you'll get something not far from Skyrim. Vanilla Skyrim is a good game. It could have been the best game made, but tries to cover such an enormous terrain, such an absurd amount of quests, it necessarily had to end up filled to the brim with bugs, unsolvable quests and various other glitches. Luckily for everybody, Bethesda decided to make this another of the moddable games, resulting in a nearly flawless epic adventure that you can customize to your own tastes. More dragons, no dragons, more quests, more provinces, more spells, more houses to buy or build and call your home. There's pretty much nothing you won't be able to find a mod for. The result is an amazing experience where you can put hundreds of hours with a single character (and not even counting the DLCs) while collecting items, exploring the bazillon dungeons all over Skyrim, comleting quests, or generally exploring the biggest game world I've ever seen. In short, this is as good as a game can be to put your money in.

review: First off, it's a great game, it would be stupid to deny it, but if you've had some issues with Morrowind and Oblivion (and even Fallout 3), they haven't been fixed. The animations are still awkward, the combat AI is stiil "fight or flee", without any variation or tactics needed. I don't care about the "main story" as it's a sandbox, but the dialog is abysmal. The balance later in the game crawls into a hole and dies, making the game quite dull the farther you get. And as with any Bethesda title, there are bugs everywhere. But it's still fun to play and when the community starts churning out mods, it's gonna be amazing. As someone who hated Oblivion before it was cool to hate it, I say I had fun with Skyrim. Get it when it's on sale.

Good Points: * Good enough main story and insteresting subquests * Aswesome graphics and landscapes * Skill trees and combat * Huge world * Best Elder Scroll so far. * Open worldness (You feel quite free) Bad Points * Can easily become too easy if you abuse the game (unbalanced) * Can lose interest if leave the main story. * Repetition. (ex: Killing the first dragon is cool but afterward it becomes too easy and boring chasing them)

review: MANKINDS FIRST STEP INTO SPACE COLONIZATION. Skyrim combines elements from many other successful titles into a bland pure joy. The game boldly takes inspiration from call of duty, mimicking its graphical fidelity perfectly. The environments one visits are truely breathtaking, my favorite was Cave#107( you Cave#106 lovers, #107 was superior in every way). The combat was nailbiting at every turn, I wasn't sure if i'd have to alter my tactics from an encounter to encounter basis. However I was able to prevail with my old faithful strategies, it reminded much of the feeling of being a warrior constantly improving his unique tecnique as his life progresses. The music was truly astounding, I liked the part where the choir yelled. The combat mechanics were unlike any other, who knew that streamlining the looking for raid mode in world of warcraft would've benfited a single player RPG? The indepth lore behind the dragons was -------------------------------------------------------------------SPILLER ALET-------------------------------------------------AWESOME. -------------------------------------------------------------END OF SPILER------------------------------------------------------The games loot system was incredibly rewarding too, I fealt like an empowered badass slaying bandits and then picking up their numerous loaf of bread. On the topic of bread, the cooking in the game was unlike any other I've seen, chef gordon ramsey would draw inspiration from these mechanics. Inspiring. How does one describe the dragon fights in one word? EXTRIMTENSESOMELYBADAWSOM I HAD TO MAKE UP A WORD JUST TO DESCRIBE THESE FIGHTS!!!!1 The battles were tests of everything I've learned my twelve years of life, everything i've ever known culminated into these battles. If you are faint of heart, DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME. Each type of dragon stronger than the last, bringing its own unique menchanics to the mix forcing you to adapt your life to battle them. The fact that i can just be attempting to meet my wife in my home city just to be attacked by a dragon helps to build up the feeling of hopelessness this world has and in no way breaks the flow of the game. In conclusion, this game is my game of a lifetime. This game will define me as my life continues and I master the art of making nude mods, perfect for the kids bring family. 12/9 AND IF YOU DISAGREE  YOU BEST GAME EVERY OU FUXING NOOB I SWAERT PLP IKE YOUY ARE RONG WITH GEM INDUSTRY ASKIG HIGHER TEXUTRE RESOLITIIN  YOU THIS GAMEW IS PERFECT FOR MY IMAC WHEN IOM GAME, and sneak.

Never really ending you can always find something new 5. Look up mods on the steam workshop once you put 100 or so hours into the game without mods. There is nothing negative about this game! I would buy this game if it was $200.00 I really hope they re-master some of the older elder scrolls sometime.

You can take on many different quests in so many locations that it keeps you entertained throughout. Your skilling up is also done at a pace that keeps the fights and battles interesting. The scenery is breathtaking, the detail awesome, the realism fantastic. I think this game ranks 10/10 and to me is the top of all RPG games. Bethesda has done an awesome job. Now I would love for them to upgrade both Morrowind and Oblivion to the same standard as Skyrim. I have the whole set from Arena through to Skyrim and each game got better and better. Well done to all the modders out there that have done a fantastic job to add more spice to the game. I would definitely recommend this game to every single RPG player in the world. A must have. Can't wait to see if there are more expansions in the making.

Skyrim has some amazing graphics and the modding community has even taken this further. (Assuming you have the PC for it) But it's not the graphics that make this game, it's the rich and beautiful world full of mythical creatures. While it is true that bethesda has a bit of a reputation for releasing buggy games, the modding community has set that straight with their Unofficial Skyrim Patches. If you are a fan of RPG's or series such as The lord of the rings, or Narnia, then i recommend you get this game.

review: This game is the best game I have ever played, story and gameplay really went in to my heart and veins while exploring the land of the nords, Skyrim. As a Nordic guy I must say the whole nature and weather really feels like reality and at the same time it is just this epicness with all magics and awesome fights. I wish I could live in this world for ever. For me this game is worth way over the price it is. If you want to experience what I felt like was a true dream. Buy this game. I really wish I could experience this game over and over again for the rest of my life..

review: 10/10 After countless hours on journeys and quests all over skyrim, i'd like to mirror my impression in this review. I had high expectations for TES:V Skyrim, and i wasn't let down by Bethesda. I bought the game at release, and i'm still playing it today, cause in my opinion its still one of the very best action-rpg's ever! So lets take a closer look why i think so! Story: The main story covers the appearance of dragons in skyrim and the role which our protagonist plays within it. As TES-usuall, the main quest can be completed within several hours. Even though its predictable, its not boring. The presentation of the happenings in skyrim is epic and fighting the main quest is fun. As usuall you do not need to follow the main quest, and can start exploring the map from the very beginning without any obstruction through not following the questline. Sidequests: A sidequest can be found around ever corner in skyrim, and as expected they cover every event you can think of. From loveletters and intrigues up to assasinations and theft. Almost everyone has a story to tell... and need your help with it, of course! Fighting: The fights in TES:V are very action-heavy, and have nothing in common with traditional roleplaying games. Simple math, the one with the bigger weapon wins most of the time. If you don't expect strategic, roundbased and profound battles, you will be very happy in skyrim. Because after all the fights are a lot of fun, and the fact that you can still chose how your character should fight - either with spells and summons or with swords and shields - makes the fights enjoyable. Characterdesign and gameplay: The character customization in TES:V is extensive as used to TES-games. You can make your character fit perferctly your preffered playstyle. The visual custimization is as wide as the playing one - lots of different armorsets, which you gather from quests, find in dungeons or craft yourself give your character a unique look. The skill perks are very deeply designed to match your preffered playstyle. You can create loads of perk combinations to design your unique character. Every playstyle you can imagine is covered by it: You want stealthing, destruction mage in heavy armor with alchemy skills and pickpocketing? - Sure! An axe wielding rogue, light armor and the ability to summon creatures and also handle a big two-handed mace? - Not a problem! The Elder Scrolls - Skyrim is a very extensive game, with a huge world to explore and countless dungeons to defent. Elder Scrolls fans, aren't even asking themselfs to buy it or not. For RPG and action fans its definitly worth a closer look. Its contains hundreds and hundreds of hours of quests and exploration, and (at least for me) never gets boring!

review: Coming from someone who has never played Elder Scrolls games with the exception of Morrowind (though I didn't complete it), I was expecting this to be the same and just make me lose complete interest after a short while but turns out to be the complete opposite. Bethesda's latest Elder Scrolls game, Skyrim has really gotten me sucked in and having an interest in the franchise. The game was everything that I hoped for back in Morrowind but after its poor tutorial, confusing gameplay, and lack of direction on what to do, I gave up but ever since Skyrims release, Bethesda has addressed and improved beyond my expectations, beforehand and now. Things like the free save system, where you can save whenever you'd like, an enjoyable combat system with various kill animations, third-person mode, the improved questing journal and map tracking, settling and customizing your own house(s) or even just listening to the nordic chants of the fantastic soundtrack, these all add up to the experience. Lets start with the storyline, which is a fairly big part in an RPG. The rebel Stormcloaks, who are trying to break free from the Empire and be independant from the Imperial Legion, who are in conflict and waging war to determine who will prevail and claim Skyrim as their own. As well as having the infamous Thalmor elves have a neutral alliance with the Imperial Legion, in which nearly destroyed the Empire years ago (a scapegoat). In the middle of all this, dragons have been coming back to life without any explaination and how you need to stop it from happening as the Dragonborn or it will be the end of times with the legendary dragon, Alduin, the main antagonist of the game. While I applaud Bethesda for making such interesting and enjoyable side-storylines across the entire game, without spoilers, the main quests are somewhat disappointing, especially near the end as I felt the conclusion didn't live up to my expectations and felt underwhelmed. I didn't feel like it was a huge accomplishment which is something I really wanted at the end of this especially with Alduin leading the charge. As soon as the game starts, you're thrown right into the storyline with a very intense introduction and will eventually meet various characters along the way who you befriend to aid you along your adventures. NPCs, while they're improved, the guards may be just as generic while some of the other NPCs are unique and different in their own way (other than some shared voices). Learning about their backstory or an issue that we could help them with allows for many ways to approach this game and its interaction. This is an RPG for a reason and because of that, it's very welcome to not only talk with NPCs, but also reading various books and history about the events before AND during Skyrim. There are many things to do in this game, such as lockpicking, crafting, exploring, cooking, or just having some fun with a quest or killing random foes you meet out in the wild. Many other skills such as heavy armor for example, make you tougher and harder to beat down and reducing the weight of your armor (less weight = holding onto more items) when you wear heavy armor with various perks or sneak, which allows you to be more difficult to spot for enemies. You and also gaining various perks to say, do 6x the damage with a one-hander if you attack while sneaking. This can make encounters fun and how you want to deal with enemies throughout the game. Did I mention this game allows you to go at your own pace? Meaning you can approach a quest the way you want to and when you want to. There's no hand-holding here, you do what you want, making this game great for exploration which is hard to resist as you'll never know what you may find, be it a random encounter/event, a rare item/quest, or dungeon for even more loot. Not only that but their are no classes, so you can choose to be whatever you'd like, whether it be someone who relies on sneak and stealth to take out your enemies, the typical heavy armored warrior and fire casting wizard OR why not do a mix of either? You can dual-wield a sword with a magic spell in your off-hand rather than a shield. This lets to decide and choose on how you as the player want to play their character in a way you enjoy it the most. That being said, while the "role-playing" part is indeed fact, the combat is still not as great as many claim it to be. Yes, it has improved animations, it doesn't feel as stiff like it did previously in previous games when you say, swing your sword at the enemy and even has a kill-cam with various kill finishers (which is badass), I find it boring chopwork while watching the enemy health bar slowly get shorter and shorter, then drink potions when my own health goes low. Rinse and repeat. The finishing moves are awesome to look at and make you go: "That was brutal!" but eventually the same finishing moves occur back and forth and it gets old fairly quickly, yes, you'll unlock more the further you get into the game but their isn't a huge variety. Something I'd also like to add as well, while this game is great on its own, the true replayability and survival of this game continuing is simply the mods. The modding community has grown so much and popular with the game that many people have implemented new weapons, armor, mounts, quests, character customization, and even zones into the game. Pure console gamers have no idea what they're missing. Just seeing articles and videos doesn't do the modding community justice. It adds more depth and provides a lot more fun. What the modding community has achieved with Skyrim is downright incredible. Combat overhauls, visual enhancements, immersion mods, entirely new lands, and even UI mods can add so much to the experience. Half second loading times are a bonus. Of course, their are still small bugs/glitches that can occur but are most of the time, easily fixed with a reload. I have about more than 30 mods installed and my game is running smoothly on highest settings. At the end of the day, I feel as though, Bethesda has done an outstanding job and made me an Elder Scrolls fan where the previous games did more or less. Some factors in the previous game I did not like in Morrowind, everything here in Skyrim is so much more polished and well done, it's a lot easier to get into. Skyrim has raised the bar for all other RPGs out there and should not be ignored if you do not have this game yet. Despite the disappointing ending (in my opinion) of the main storyline, I have to say that Dawnguard and Dragonborn are much better, making the game even better since they both add quite a bit of content and storytelling to the game and fleshing out the world even more. If you're looking to getting this game, I recommend you wait for a sale on the Legendary Edition, that way, you get everything in one, and you're set to go. Oh, and you can't forget the mods, it makes the game that much better.

review: The Elder Scrolls series has forever been a part of me, Morrowind, Oblivion and now Skyrim -.. Words cannot describe the experiences and the accumulation of hours that I have put into the games. Skyrim nor displeases or fails to live up to the expectations. The gameplay and missions are extensive and unique and the RPG revolving around Dragons is literally amazing. The shouts and skills operating around each character makes the game even more addicting. I totally recommend this for anyone, especially Skyrim, alongside the older games and especially the newer one; the MMORPG.

review: Overall: Great fun. If you like exploring, roaming and looting, this is definately the game for you. Skyrim is a huge place, where you'll find mostly scandinavian-like countryside, but still a huge variety of ambience and style. I did not really play this for the story, it is kinda interesting, but not too deep and pretty short. The main part of the game (at least for me) is roaming, sidequests and exploring. There are quite some generic misc-quests which will send you into a dungeon you then finish and return the quest. This might get boring after a while. However it is very exciting for a lot of dungeons. The Dwemer ruins especially are awesome. But still, if you find yourself stuck with boring quests, there is the Steam-Workshop loaded with free mods and/or custom made questlines. Potential for hundreds of hours of gameplay!

review: Skyrim, it seems, is a game that people buy expecting it to be the best or the worst game ever. When they plunge in, most people think it's very good, with its beautiful world, a story that's pretty good (in my opinion), and nice atmospheric music. After you plug in several buttloads of hours, though, it starts to lose its appeal, and gets repetitive. The game mechanics are all very nice, although the combat usually ends up just mindlessly hacking/spurting magic at your enemies. Playing as a sneaky thief, however, might help make it more interesting, with bows and whatnot. The story might seem kind of ehhh, but really, I just like the lore. All things considered, Skyrim is definitely a worthwhile game.

review: Skyrim is one of the greatest games I've ever played, and with a handful of mods it is probably the single greatest game in my modest Steam library. For me, it's all about immersion. The land of Skyrim is richly atmospheric, as many games are, but it is also organic. From the most mundane cellars to the windswept mountaintops and everything that lies between, the land of Skyrim was painstakingly crafted, with equal parts skill and love, to be a living and breathing place. Find a tavern and take a seat, and the little village lives on without you. You'll find yourself, even on second or third characters, discovering new conversations and overhearing new dialogue; you'll stumble into new random events, and forge brand new paths to the same old objectives. The very landscape, even, takes on new angles as your characters develop into different people with different direction, loyalties, and perspectives. I have never actually completed the main storyline of Skyrim. This is due not only various glitches that make missions unable to accomplish (most of these caused by conflicting mods, not the game in its original state), but also because only very rarely are you ever pressed to follow the structured storylines or sidequests. From the beginning, you can choose to join the Nords or the Imperials and see where each path takes you. You can join a number of guilds. But neutrality, or even hostility towards these parties, is completely possible and maybe even preferable after a few playthroughs. Skyrim is made even better through a number of mods. ENBs and texture enhancements, bug fixes, user created quests, companions, armor and weapons, and even entire islands to explore - there are literally thousands of mods available and in a very brief time one can accumulate hundreds and consider many of them to be absolutely must have... Many mods exist to cater to whatever your thing or niche might be. As a History and Anthropology student, I thought itd be cool if the Imperials didn't just emulate soldiers of the Roman Empire, but actually looked like them. I was part of the Historical Revival team as an artist and historical consultant  our mod, which also includes some Celtic and Eastern equipment and weaponry, received over a thousand endorsements from the Nexus community before we abandoned the project. During Holiday Sales, Skyrim is hitting the $10 mark (or possibly even lower). For the layers upon layers of entertainment this game offers, it is almost criminal to not own this game.

review: Skyrim... Oh my where to start... Helgan would be a great place to start seeming that's the first town you see in the game, and my oh my it's one of many, and I mean many! Skyrim is a fantastic open world, free roam game in which you create a character to help you complete the hundred, maybe even thousands of main story, and side quests! In Skyrim you play however you want to play as, be it a Mage, Archer, Warrior, even a Human Cat! You can go where you want, when you want with use of Skyrims fast travel, but if you really want, how about you just get there on foot, meet some people on the way, maybe you meet someone who needs help, maybe you meet someone who is out to kill you! It's all possible in Skyrim! Skyrim is one of my all time favourite games, when I'm bored, I play skyrim because even though I have played it for 100+ hours, I'm always finding new places, new people, new missions and more! Also Skyrim has the steam workshop and the nexus mod community behind it's back, so if you do get bored with Vanilla Skyrim, there are Thousands of downloadable quests and mods to keep you entertained for hours on end! Final rating of TES:Skyrim : 9.8/10

review: Skyrim is known as one of the best games since it has won over 200 awards. Not a lot of people remember the original Elder Scrolls but they dont remember/know how good the original Elder Scrolls are. This comes to Skyrim, a VERY long game. If you buy the offical prime guide there is 1134 pages, no joke its real. You play as a prisioner that by luck escape from a dragon who destryoed the town ur in. The game is like a medival time scenery. You can literally do watever you want, even KILL someone for no reason but youdo get a bounty from the nearest city which is not very fun considering if theres 5 guards fighting you. Since this game is extremelly long, only like 2% from all systems actually beat this game 100% and they may have around 2,000 to 6,000 hours, yes its that dam long. So hope you enjoy this game and remember, pickpocket,kill,and rob everyone (just kidding, dont do it unless you want skill points)

review: Probably the best open-world RPG out there. Definitely one of my all-time favourite games. The replayability is superb and the modding community is highly active, which makes it easy to play the game the way you want to play it. For me the modding experience has been the greatest aspect of the game. You can easily make the game graphics look like up to date games (as long as you have a decent graphics card). The atmosphere in the game and the way the game feels alive is something that will keep amaze you throughout the game. It really feels like a living world, even though you will stumble upon bad or awkward NPC movements and behaviour (but mods can help fix this). The music and voice acting is as good as it can get. If you like RPGs there are no reasons why you shouldnt own this game already. 10/10.

review: I spent a bit of time in this game played around for a bit. learned some new tricks. Must say from my other TES games i have played, this is by far the most fun. I still play morrowind and Oblivion to this day. Steam is no where near the actual hours i have spent in those other games, Now as for Skyrim. would i recommend this game to anyone? Yes i would. and why would i do that. Well for starters, its mod friendly, and i do mean friendly. once you get a mod sorter to help with errors and mismatches and putting them in a proper loading order, this game becomes more than just Skyrim. it becomes a life of its own. With player created content this game could live on, and get better every year, not with the Devs help but by the Modding community. If this was a Game Dev Tycoon game, it would get that 11/10 rating. Its just that good, so good infact that i deleted my 2012 review and completely redid it. even right now, i watch youtube videos on mods to get my game to that next level. I even wiped clean my current Skyrim to get ready for a realistic game play this time around, i wanted everything fresh and clean as i piled mods on to make my game better. this will take me a couple days to get ready but once i jump in. ill be gone for a while. Some games are just so good, you go wow. whats next. all i can say is, thanks bethesda I hope Fallout 4 is as good or better than Skyrim. you got some big shoes to fill now. until then Skyrim, Morrowind, Oblivion, TESO, New Vegas, Fallout 3 will be getting a lot of my time. more so Skyrim though hehehe oh yea Buy Skyrim!!!

review: Well to start all the Elder Scroll Games are really just horrible to watch unless you have already played them and can understand them while watching. And despite the fact that the game doesn't look very action packed once you get into you are in great battles were you need to use tactics and smarts along with some skill to beat them, in the start yes all it is is run here hit him 2 times and bam he is dead, but as you reach lets say lvl 10 (maybe a half and hour of running around caves, not even) you end up having to use tactics not on your right trigger or mouse. Along with the amazing combat there are 1000's of quests which all have there own detailed back story, and there are also 4 guilds, 3 branches, and 1 main line which each have there own detailed rich and emotional back story that is as i describe it like a book, where every mission is like a cliff hanger and once you finally find a break point, it's 7 hours later and you just did like 20 quests. Then the treasures, the goal to become rich beyond everyone sucks you in where you need to steal from everyone to increase your coin purse by only 500 gold sucks you in till the point where you end up murdering a whole city for there stuff. Plus there is a huge world covered in towns and mining camps and caves that you can explore when ever you would like to filled with magical treasures and plot twists. And finally every player can create a character that they see them selves as training skills and grinding levels(which is the only game i have enjoyed grinding levels on) s you personalize your character to be the amazing hero you wish you could be.

review: I used to be a Bethesda dev working on Skyrim. I tried to make sleeping a meaningful mechanic, as player recover as they sleep. I also designed cool dream themed menus with deep proverbs while opposing factions may try to assassinate you while you sleep in late-game. I geniunely believed this would be very immersive, a neat break from the flow for players to think and plan their character. Todd Howard, however, was not as pleased. He calls me out during a meeting, belittles me in front of our coworkers and calls me "Dreamboy". The whole company now makes fun out of me and calls me Dreamboy. I got demoted, but I kept working. I thought about how to make the passing of in-game time more meaningful. The "Dragon Apocalypse" happens on day 50 and the Aldmeri Dominion invades on day 100. This would immerse the player in a sense of heroism and danger. When I go to the toilet after finishing these changes... Todd finds me and repeatedly punches me in the liver and solar plexus while calling my son an autistic r*tard. I got demoted to Janitor's closet now. I still tried to make the best of it and kept working hard. I made it so that NPCs from the opposing faction are hostile, and you have to sneak or disguise yourself if you want to do business in Solitude as a Stormcloak, for example. To me, this would make the game intense and real. I come home later that day and found my wife crying in the living room, and when I asked what's wrong, she said that a man approached our son at school and asked him if it's "hard to be a r*tard with a f*g dad." Although I should have stopped at this point, I felt like it was still my duty to make this game as good as possible. I wanted to include an optional "Hardcore Mode" like in New Vegas - I believed this would immerse players as it would make food and taverns meaningful. Later that night when I took out the trash, someone throws a bag over my head. I hear people laughing and making fun out of me as someone is stomping on me. Then suddenly, after taking kicks and punches for a long time, someone pulls the bag off me. I felt a wet finger pressing against my anal. I hear Todd's voice saying, "Is that hardcore enough for you, Dreamboy?" No one talks to me at work and my old friends act like I don't exist. I give this game a 7/10 because I had to install a bunch of mods to make up for all the scrapped content. It is, however, a great game to waste time in, if that's what you're looking for.

review: I'll admit, at first when I heard of the game it didn't seem as interesting, thought it would be like the rest that claims to be epic when it's not. But over time I saw my friends play it, and when I looked it up for a voicepak project I was working on, I was wrong... the game was something I was actually expecting in a game: no ending point, full customization, the ability to fight in 1st person with any weapon, outstanding music, ability to make potions, armor, weapons and food like in MMO games, and a great storyline with many branching quests. All in Single Player! I never got the DLC yet, but I can already tell it'll make the game worth every cent it's worth! Too addicting. Even the mods make the game fun. Never gets old with a character with wings. ESPECIALLY if killed by a giant! (Flying in the air always cracks me up. XP) Screw the 10/10 rating, and even the 20/10 rating... it deserves the 50/10 rating!! Best RPG game ever on Steam!

review: Really great game! another Bethesda game that i am happy with have it for xbox and when i came out i spended atleast 200 hours into the game doing everything you could look for random quest, Easter Eggs, Bugs ETC ETC ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Now to raiting Gameplay: Can be sometimes buggy AI stops attacking or it randomly goes CTD(Crash to Desktop) but overall the gameplay is amazing and i giving it a 9/10 ------------ Crafting: The crafting system is really great in this game easy to learn and so only sad part is that in oblivion the crafting system could be a bit more tricky :D which made the game a bit harder then what skyrim's crafting is 9/10 ------------ Skills and perks: This is a great feture for the role play games like this one uppgrade Heavy armor light armor one handed two handed and so can sometimes be a little bit over powered when you have 100 on something like Heavy armor... you become like a god the enemys hardly damage you :/ 8/10 ------------ Visuals: The game is very grey which is really bad in oblivion the game was more colorfull but in skyrim it's almost just grey everything citeis like whiterun is like a dead zone nothing lives there or anything :( 4/10 ------------ Modding: This is probably the best thing in this game... MODDING allows you to mod the crap out of your game and make it look like a new game just with the new engine Bethesda is using i'm mostly using Visuals mod in the moment but i'm soon moving over to cities to make them have more life 10/10 ------------ Overall the game is really great and with mods you can have alot of fun in this game there is like TONS of things in this game but i can't say everything :D play it to get your own feeling of the game. Then post your recomendation :D RATING: 40/100

review: The Elder Scrolls V Skyrim is an open world role-playing game developed by Bethesda Game Studios and published by Bethesda Softworks in 2011 The game takes place in the Nordic lands of Skyrim where the character must defeat the legendary dragon Alduin who according to prophecy will devour the world. The player can also become part of the Imperial Legion or the Layers of the Storm, parties that are under civil war. This game has several different stories going on at once in a huge world. Skyrim allows more than 100 hours of gameplay doing different things. It has a great replay value and looks very good for a RPG. Also it has lots of mods. The game is not linear, the player can explore the vast world choosing to meet goals . You can also get mates who attend to fight with you and deal with several creatures of nature that get in your way and the dragons that Alduin revive . The graphics engine called Creation Engine improved graphics and interface level when compared with Elders Scrolls IV Oblivion. It is a game that even those who enjoy other genres find more entertaining. Skyrim takes us into a different world, like when you watch " The Lord of the Rings ". The combat system is also improved compared to other Bethesda games like the excelent Fallout 3. Skyrim sold over seven million copies in its first week and was the best RPG of 2011 . The game was released for PC , PS3 and XBOX 360. Although the minimum requirements are lower, a Quad Core PC processor , 4GB of RAM and a powerful graphics card with 1GB of video ram is recommended. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ESPAOL ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim es un videojuego de rol de mundo abierto desarrollado por Bethesda Game Studios y publicado por Bethesda Softworks en 2011 El juego tiene lugar en las tierras nrdicas de Skyrim donde el personaje debe derrotar al legendario dragn Alduin quien segn la profeca devorar al mundo. El jugador adems puede convertirse a la legin Imperial o a los Capas de la Tormenta que estn en guerra civil. De esta forma el juego posee varias historias diferentes que ocurren al mismo tiempo en un mundo enorme a disposicin del jugador. El juego permite jugar tranquilamente 100 horas haciendo cosas diferentes. Tiene una gran rejugabilidad. El juego no es lineal, el jugador puede recorrer el extenso mundo eligiendo que metas cumplir. Adems puede conseguir acompaantes que lo asistan. Tambin puede enfrentarse a los seres de la naturaleza que se encuentren en su camino y a los dragones que Alduin revive. El motor grfico llamado Creation Engine mejor el nivel grfico y la interfaz si lo comparamos con el Oblivion. Es un juego que hasta los que disfrutan ms de otros gneros encontrarn entretenido. Skyrim nos sumerge en un mundo distinto, como cuando uno mira "El seor de los anillos". El sistema de combate tambin est mejorado con respecto a otros juegos de Bethesda como el excelente Fallout 3. Vendi mas de siete millones de copias en su primera semana y fue el mejor juego de rol del 2011. El juego se lanz para PC, PS3 y XBOX 360. Aunque los requisitos mnimos son mas bajos, en PC se recomienda un procesador Quad Core , 4GB de RAM y una tarjeta grfica poderosa con 1 GB de ram de video.

My reaction was: "OH MY GOSH THIS GAME IS EFFIN AWESOME, GOODBYE SOCIAL LIFE, OH LOOK, MODS! GOODBYE LIFE, GOODBYE FAMILY, HELLO DRAGONS, HELLO WEIRD MODS THAT I DON'T EVEN NEED, AND HELLO MAGIC!!!" Now, you may think that I'm overreacting, or just typing stupid random things. If you think so, you have never played skyrim. Just buy this game, it's worth it.

review: A wonderful game and a true testament to the Elder Scrolls Series. Not as big as my beloved Daggerfall or Arena, but complete immersion into the environment is still possible. An easy to use skill system (though I do miss the in-depth ones of old) and a great character generation system make the game easy to play your way. Above all I love the customizability of the game itself, leaving it to the end-user to shape the game as they see fit. A great and immersive set of stories to go through, with DLC expanding it to many hours of enjoyable fun. This is by far one of the greatest games that I have ever played, and continue to play!

review: Skyrim is one of those games you could play constantly for weeks, or even months and it's still fun. Then even after you get bored of it you can return months later, start a new adventure and have just as much fun as last time, if not more. Throw mods on top of it, the game just gets even better. The open world exploration is fantastic and there is always something new to discover, it's truly an adventure game and I recommend it for anyone who likes fantasy games and open world games.

review: Ok. My second review. Skyrim. Thats all I need to say. Bought it in England and started and I could'nt get enough of it. I searched every nook and cranny for items and crafted items such as the Daedric armours. The diversity of the 9 holds and the annoying meme make this game really great. And then enemies. With a good enough battle plan you can kill without even being suspected or even just run in and slash them up or crush their skulls. Oooooooo. The shouts. Holy . Those shouts. FUS RO DAH!!! I loved the shouts. My favourite is the dragon aspect or the cyclone shout, and I'm not saying the unrelenting force because cyclone flings them further and high in the air and dragon aspect because, 1. you look ing badass and 2. because when your health reaches around 1/3 there is a chance for an ancient dragon borns spirit to appear to help you out. Not only does it have great power, it will shout. Say what you want about this game but it will always have a place in my games library. Plus the modding allows more fun such as the whiterun camp attached to the wall is great for a beggining player that needs a good place to store their new and inventory filling items such as foods and weapons in special specific and overall very usefull chests. I rate this 100/100. (Nord accent)"I used to be an adventurer like you, then it ook an arrow to the..." (Me)"FUS RO DAH!!!" (Nord accent)"No lollygagging" (Me)"I'm at the in' shop. Leave me ALONE!!! Jeez." (Nord accent) stop shouting. You're shouting is, making people nervous." (Me)"Well  this *Stabs the guard shouts his body*. Well now that that has been taken care of, i can finally...OH !!! *Gets tackled by commander Caius* (Caius)"You're under arrest* (Me)"Ah crap"

review: The way it is with all Bethseda Games: Beautiful world, great setting, short main storyline, interesting side story, many many sidequests, much to see and much to do - the other side of the coin? Bugs - bugs everywhere. Glitchin through objects and gettin stuck - NPC's glitchin around, quests not starting, some quests become stuck and can't be completed, random CTD's and so on - thanks to the Community, there are Unofficial Patches for the game and the DLC's and boy, they are needed - Bestheda, one question - What would you do, without the Community that loves your games? Let me answer that question for you - You would be out of business in 6 months. And for the enhanced game experience, go get yourself a lot of mods. But be careful of the random CTD's.

review: Addictive, engaging, a depth that will rarely be rivaled. Skyrim delivers a journey unlike most found in modern RPGs, an ability to go where you want, when you want, and more importantly *how* you want. With modding at the forefront of the game, it retains a freshness that stays long after others have fallen by the wayside. Spend time with Skyrim, and you'll find out what everyone else has so far: there's not enough time for both Skyrim and other responsibilities. But those other responsibilities can wait a few more minutes.

review: The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is by far my favourite game ever. The graphics, the gameplay, the storyline.... even the sidequests! Everything is just mind-blowing. I've played this game multiple times and I did notice some bugs (people talking or moving weird) but nothing game-breaking. If you have the feeling that Skyrim is missing something, you can always check the Steam Workshop for mods, there are a lot of them! If you haven't bought this game yet, do it now and immerse yourself into te wonderful province of Skyrim! The DLC's (Dawnguard, Dragonborn and Heartfire) are also very good. Dawnguard and Dragonborn add a lot of content with two locations even more jaw-dropping than Blackreach and Hearthfire gives you the possibility to start a family and build your own house. This house is customizable. The downside to Hearthfire is that the houses you've built aren't customizable enough. For example: If you wish to build an armory you choose armory and start building. When you are inside your house you can furnish it by selecting what item you want. It doesn't give you the ability to move your furniture the way you like. In short: Good: - Awesome game. - Graphics are amazing. - Storyline and sidequests are compelling and interesting. - DLC's add a lot of content so it's worth buying them. - Lots of mods in the workshop to enhance the game. Bad: - Some minor bugs - Hearthfire house not customizable enough.

review: Considering the fact that i have over six hundred hours on this game I would have reason to believe i have experienced everything this game has to offer, that is complete BS. The community creats mods and texture packs for this game ever expanding the games content. Even though the game might seem easy afer a while mod packs like Skyrim Redone and ACE adds a level of difficulty that hardcore gamers will appreciate. So all in all this is a game that is well worth the price.

review: Being a fan of Bethesda games like fallout, and etc. I saw Skyrim instore and decided to give it a go, not having prior knowledge of previous elder scrolls game i jumped in the metaphorical deep end that was Elder scrolls Lore. I was greeted with a carriage ride towards certain death by Imperial dogs and then saved by the Antagonist of the series as he appeared in the nick of time before my head was about to get a swift decapitation. That my friends...As an intro for a video game is one i can respect, having the Antagonist save you and have your Decision to either follow a Stormcloak or an Imperial immediately challenged is really intresting to see how the game can piece it all together. As i said before i had no prior knowledge of Elder scrolls lore so as i played through the game reading the hundreds of books I learnt more about the lore and who i was. The Game itself had really beautiful visuals, the characters don't stare at you anymore like you have a piece of sweetroll left on your mouth and the background moves freely as you speek to NPC's. The story itself keeps you immersed in the world and has you on edge. The DLC's further increase the story with extra weapons, Dragon Shouts, enemies, lands and BLAH BLAH and you learn that Skyrim is just a baby considering the huge land of Tamriel. Long story short Skyrim has a really awesome plot and can keep you addicted for hours, learning all the mechanics of the game, even installing thousands of mods like weapons, armor or Skimpy armor for the female characters (If thats the way you play) or even a magic spell that turns people into chickens is Pardon my french F**ken awesome. The game can get very stale and boring if you play it too much, but the dlc's and mods help to keep the game fresh

It has great replay value. Though it is a little buggy from time to time, the glitches often just make me laugh and are easily fixable if they get in the way of gameplay (with the use of some commands). I can waste hours just messing around or actually play the game seriously, and that it the beauty of most open-world games. Overall a great game.

This is one of those. One of those games that will be remembered decades from now, recognized and heralded as a true masterpiece of gaming that paved the way and set the bar for all games after it. It's a game that is simply breathtaking. As soon as you enter it feels like an entire world has been wrapped around you. A whole world for you to explore, however you want and whatever path you choose to do so down. Get this game, because no other game will ever match Skyrim for a long, long time.

review: Fus Ro Da! This is the best game i have ever played! Thousands of times better than any large scale MMORPG such as World of Warcraft...The only thing this game is missing is a multiplayer system and this game is a perfect unbeatable one! Hopefully when The Elder Scrolls Online comes out...My hopes will come true...

review: Decent game, but the PC version isn't without console-ridden features that annoy mouse/keyboard users like myself. Hopefully a modder will address this issue. Skyrim in no way threatens Morrowind goty as my all-time favorite Elder Scrolls game. There is some fun to be had in Skyrim but be warned it's very streamlined and built for the masses instead of niche open world RPG lovers specifically. The price at $60 is a bit steep but you can get many hours out of this game, despite bugs and streamlining, and numerous annoying console-esque run-ins with the interface/menu.

review: Refusing to stop, the Elder Scrolls franchise's newest entry, Skyrim, goes down kicking till the very end. Admist civil war, the eater of worlds, or 'a bad- dragon' decides to come back to add to the turmoil, and why not? It would seem that the time is ripe for dragons to come and gourge on the souls of our world. However, as luck would have it, there is (as in all fantasies) one person who can stand in the dragons' way. Watch out Keanu Reeves because a new chosen one is in town, get ready to hack, slash, burn, freeze, stun, scare, eat, stab, punch, shoot, throw, shout, claw, jump, and fling your way to victory past racist guards, foolish bards, crappy elves, drunken nords, or legendary monsters of epic proportions. Hoprfully you do not have a girlfriend or 8-5 job, because if you do, you will not have the time to "one-hundred percent" this game. I mean, have you seen the hit short film "Dragonbored"? Some amount of stars that amounts to 5.

review: Possibly the best game I've ever played, second to none. The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is without a doubt one of if not the best open-world role playing games of this generation. Endless replayability, an unsurpassable amount of mods, a unique experience and countless hours to waste away enjoying the immersion this game has to offer. Bethesda truely excelled previous Elder Scroll games with this release. The Pros; > Open-world, beautifuly designed. > Detailed Character creation and Arcehtype building. > 300+ hours of playable content. > Extremely Lore based. > Truely immersive storyline. > Excellent Audio. > Well designed game mechanics including combat, leveling, perks. > Vast array of Weaponry, Armor, Spells, Potions and much much more. > Mass amounts of mods, ranging from graphic, gameplay, item, house, and character mods. > A substantial amount of enemies ranging from dragons, bandits, draugrs, thieves to vampires. The Cons; > Voice Acting is repetitive. One several occasions you will notice NPC's voiced by the same actor with the same voice. > Replayability is much lower without the use of mods. > Some areas of the large open-world seem reused. There seems to be little variation to open world textures and dungeons. > Questing can sometimes seem repetitive. Go to X, get Y item, return to Z. To finish this up I've put over 500 hours into Skyrim across three systems (Xbox, PS3 and now the PC), I've never felt as immersed into a games storyline, open-world and lore - it is truely a different experience to any other open-world RPG. The Character Creation and Arcehtype building is perfect for this type of role playing game. Want to play through the game from a stealth approach, done. Want to tank more damage than a German Panzer in WW2, done. Want to fire, frost and electrify your way through every bandit camp and dungeon in the vicinity, done.There is literally no limit, don't want to stick to a specific arcetype? Done, Jack of All Trades. With 10 playable races, you're able to customize your character to your own liking and fight the way you believe you should. With 18 skills ranging from Archery, Lockpicking, Two-handed, Destruction, Restoration, Smithing and many in between there's plenty of variety. Leveling never feels monotonous, level at your own pace or powerlevel before you've even started the main quest. Play the game your way. With over 270 quests, including the main quest, side quests and sub quests, there's never a dull moment. You'll be lucky to even finish half of them before you take an arrow to the knee. I could not recommend this game more highly. If you even have the slighest interest in RPG's or open-world games take the plunge and pick this game up.

review: Within an hour of starting Skyrim, I'd decided this was the pinnacle of the Elder Scrolls series; 144 hours in, I'm not so sure anymore. There are diminishing returns in the game as the quests become sparse and your character becomes an unkillable god that can strike enemies down with a single blow. Morrowind for all its flaws felt so much larger and more open somehow. Maybe I'm just older or maybe all the locations and journal entries and achievements aren't quite the same as being forced to roam a giant world and make your way with no knowledge of what was to come or what was left. Regardless, it's still one of the greatest games of all-time and I don't think anyone will consider their time wasted after they wander the hills and mountains of Skyrim.

review: Bethesda has outdone themselves yet again with Skyrim. Perfecting the open world genre and building upon their previous games, Skyrim is a perfect open world fantasy action-RPG. There are a limitless amount of side quests and a plethora of primary quests and guild missions. This game will keep you busy for at least 100s of hours, maybe more depending on your play style. The game supports multiple play types and character classes and is one of the few RPGs to allow you to multi-class. This game is completely worth the list price and in my opinion, is the best fantasy game on the market today.

review: The Elder Scrolls V Skyrim legt grafisch und spiel technisch einiges drauf als sein Vorgnger Oblivion. Wer sich gerne lange in ein Spiel verbeist wird viel Spa an Skyrim haben denn es ist nicht verpflichtent sofort alle Hauptquests zu erledigen, im gegenteil der Spieler hat die Freiheit zu whlen ob Haupt- oder Nebenaufgaben. Dazu ist Skyrim auch ein Open World Spiel. Dawnguard: Erste Erweiterung bringt den Skillbaum fr den Werwolf wie auch fr den Vampirmeister. Man whlt eine Seite (Gegen oder fr die Vampire) und zieht dem entsprechend los. Eine lohnesweter Erweiterung. Heartfire: Wer gerne Sims spielt oder Huser baut wird sich hier wohl finden. Es kommen neue Vorkommen und neue Gegenstnde vor. Man kann sich ein Grundstck kaufen, ein Haus bauen und dieses dan verdeitigen gegen Gegner. Eine nette gnstige Erweiterung fr jeden der etwas neues mchte. Dragonborn: Man geht auf eine Insel in Morrowide ... und was bekommt man? Richtig, viele neue Gegner, neue Rstungen/Waffen und viel neues in Skyrim. Auch die Storyline in dieser Erweiterung ist fesselnd! Alles im ganzen ist Skyrim ohne Erweiterungen ein groes fesselndes und grandioses Spiel, mit Erweiterungen noch grer,grandioser und fesselnder als zuvor.

review: The Elder Scrolss V: Skyrim......oh boy....This here ladies and gents, is the game you buy and play if you want to lock yourself up in a room for 267 hours worth of you life dedicated to doing all the crap in this fantasticly fantasmic world of Elves and Orcs and intelligent walking dinosaurs. Skyrim is big. REALLY...big. And that's not just accounting for the world map I'm talking about the quests, weapons, skills, MODS (very important btw. Once you use mods you can never go back to vanilla skyrim again.), and pretty much everything the game has to offer is downright amazing. But I do have a few nickpicks. Don't get me wrong though reader of my little review here, Skyrim is my favorite in the series of The Elder Scrolls, but that might be because it's the only ES I have ever played in my life O_o anyway, the game does suffer from some things here and there. The modloader is great in all, but the MAJOR problem I have with it is that it doesn't tell you what mods are conflicting or not, so you'll be playing the game and it just closes for no reason. If there's a setting that you can adjust so you can see the conflicting mods then plz send me a PM and regard my last statement as irrelevent. Skyrim also suffers from an extreme amount of what I like to call "Grey effect." What does this mean? It means Skyrim looks very bland and washed out. Nothing really stands out unless you use mods like Increased saturation boost or Increased contrast boost and other types of shader mods. Another thing I have a nick pick with is that fact that at the end of the game, the cool armor you once wore like Nightingale, Shroud armor, Thiefs guild, etc. become incredibly inferior to the dragon versions. IMHO I really don't like the look of the dragon armors. They give myself of a sense of character. It makes my interesting dragonborn not so interesting. The last topic I have to cover is mages. I...HATE....MAGES.......Pretty much one hit kills once you reach level 28 and above if you don't have like level 80 enchanting so you can have resistances. They are broken. And the player version of a mage is just not worth it. It's just not worth it. But it does add a bit of challenge fun here and there. That's my review! Hope you enjoyed it! I definitley recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of open world games and RPG's. Peace-

review: How does one review a game that never ends? Gameplay wise, the game is tightly designed, and very effective. but it is not perfect. The plotlines are hit or miss. There are some real gems in characters here. You have the Jarls, each of which is well developed. The guild heads are just as well(if not better.) However some characters are simply dull or annoying. by the aforementioned information, you may think this a mediocre RPG. oh, you could not be more wrong. When you enter the game, you enter a new world. This game is truly an accomplishment in Open-World storytelling. the different reigons of the Province all feel different, from Swampy Hjallmarch to the colorful forests of the reach. The game presents you with an intersting world to explore, with interesting dynamics with regards to the Imperial-leaning western reigon and the Nordic-Leaning Eastern reigon. to give you an example, we can look at whiterun, the center of the game's action in it's main questline. you have a king who can't decide which side of a war to join, but who wants to do right by his people, you have an aspiring shopkeeper, a landowner who needs an axe to the skull, a shopkeeper who only wants to care for her daughter, two brothers running a Tavern and a shop, a healer, a evangelical preacher of an illegal religon, a smith who wants to prove herself, and others. These characters have personality. It is a step up from Oblivion's inconsequential NPCs. The game looks great, and has its own artistic style which works well. As other reviewers have said, the open world is perfectly crafted, down to the troll who killed your horse. It is not a perfect game, the civil war and dragon questlines are lackluster, and the magic system is lacking a large selection of spells and any intersting flavor. The combat can be clunky at times. Is the game good? Yes. Is it the messianic game? no. Should you buy it? yes. Oh, and also, mod the hell out of this game.

With mods such as Midas Magic, Quest to Ever-something *Sorry, forgot the name!* And Wyrmtooth, alongside other combat/ quest mods, it'd be worth 25$, easily. Recommending because it is a good game, but lacks real quality of exploration that games like Morrowind and prior had.

review: TLDR: this game is tops. If for some reason you haven't tried Skyrim at this point, the gamer inside me wants to express its greatness to you. Haters gonna hate though, if you're among them, move along. A beautifully designed fully immersive world. I'm sad to admit I'm in the population of Elder Scrolls players who started with Skyrim, but what an absolutely amazing game. I've played roughly 10x more than my clocked hours on this account, from previous accounts, other consoles, and watching friends play. I am currently on my 10th playthrough, which was mostly played on 6/6 difficulty - Legendary, other plays outside the first on 5/6 - Master. Every playthrough was an adventure. Purchasing the Legendary Edition was a great buy, and well worth the investment. 6/6 diff has proven itself to be a hefty challenge, and it requires you to use every beneficial aspect of the game possible in order to step out the front door (or prison gates). With a civil war going on, ancient Dragonpriests maintaining themselves and their undead armies centuries after their deaths, relentless elves from the Aldmeri Dominion, troubling social class strata, pesky and meddling Daedra, and people with problems around every corner, the options of things to do are virtually endless. Will you choose to help and save the world, or become the most powerful super villian Skyrim has ever seen? Oh yea did I forget to mention dragons? Cuz we got those too. An wonderful aspect of this game is the amount of workshop material developed by the community, and many mods alter the gameplay from texture updates, ui features, building your own civilization, allowing followers to mount horses, having a handful of followers to be your personal army, and more unstable ones that even let you turn into a dragon yourself. After strolling the steam workshop along with nexus mods, I've found dozens of addons that I've stuck with through multiple playthroughs. 3 DLC: Dawnguard, Hearthfire, Dragonborn In a nutshell- Dawnguard further develops the plight of the vampires in Skyrim, and allows you to either join a faction that seeks and destroys vampires, or become one yourself. Hearthfire adds 3 plots of land (in addition to the 5 buyable houses) available for purchase, where you can build your own home with a creative house building interface that lets you build your house piece by piece and eventually build a large manor with 3 wings and a basement. Don't forget your spouse and (up to) 2 adoptable children can move and live there as well. Sadly Winterhold is the only hold where a house or plot of land is unavailable to purchase. Dragonborn offers the new playable area of Solstheim, and a main quest line to go along with it, involving a previous Dragonborn who abused the powers of one of the Daedra, Hermaeus Mora, and gained immense power. The spells, abilities, and Thu'um (or shouts) you discover in this expansion are extremely powerful, including unique buffs you yourself can siphon from the knowledge contained by Herma-Mora. All in all, 11/10. If you're on console, good luck fully completing a playthrough, you will hit a game breaking glitch. PC users luckily can use console commands to fix virtually any problem, glitch, or mishap you may encounter. Familiarizing yourself with useful commands is recommended. As with a game this big, you have to expect hiccups, but on PC there hasn't been a problem I couldn't fix. Recommended over and over, replayability is huge, if you get bored, mod it up, there's lots out there.

review: When i first picked up skyrim back in 2011 or early 2012, i thought it would be a game that i would play for a couple of hours and get bored of it. how wrong i was. Not only does it have great content, gameplay and graphics, there is also a ton of mods out there that keeps the game fresh also allowing you to customise the game to your play style. For those who feel that graphics are important in a game, just use an enb and graphic mods to further enhance the already beautiful world of skyrim (once again many options out there that caters to pretty much everyone). DLC's are great, adding even more top notch content for many more hours of gameplay, not to mention the many side quests that you could choose to take up in the vanilla game as well. Doesn't matter whether you played the previous games in the series (i hadn't at the time i purchased skyrim), you'd still have a blast playing. strongly recommend this game especially for people who love open world adventure and role playing games.

What not to like in this, freedom of exploring, quest, treasure hunting, anything you want, but this is game is not about doing what you want but living a life as a medieval style chracter.I will admit this game had a tons of bugs needed to be fix and still have some but not much to be notice any more but other thne that this game is almost perfect, this game is just to impossiable to hate and dislike, try it out, download mods and enjoy, for you people that dislike it, try giving it out shout to it agian with the dlc and mods, you may see that it's not bad as u think it is.

review: Skyrim is a very in-depth RPG game that you can spend hundreds of hours on and still have content left to complete. If you're looking to put a lot of time, and effort if you want, into a game then I would definitely suggest Skyrim. There are so many other things you can do which aren't part of the 'main' quest line. Even when you have finished the first quest line you are introduced to, you are no-where near finishing the game. That's one of the main things I love about it. Skyrim will always offer you something new to do; and when you get to the point of wanting more, that's when you can choose to mod your game. The modding community for Skyrim is very large. If you don't like something about the game, chances are, there's a mod to change it. If you feel like things are missing from the game, then there's probably a mod to add it too. You can pick and choose from mods to make the game how you want it to be. The Steam Workshop makes it easy to mod your game with minimal effort involved. If you want a single player game that you can lose yourself in, pick this one. In my opinion, you could never play this game and regret it. Pretty much the best RPG game out there

review: Well. What to say? This is a legend already. It is somewhat old now, but the good story is never old, you know :-). Just like in BioShock - you will want to know the end of the tail... And the world will turn your imagination on! Minor bugs are met, but they do not spoil the point. I really liked this one!

review: I have always been a bit hesitant to try any of The Elder Scrolls games. Sure, there was a lot of hype and most of my friends would disappear for days after a new release, but surely I wouldn't find anything about the games enjoyable. I mean, it's not Call of Duty or Halo. I couldn't snipe a guard on a tower or pull out my assault rifle when there were enemies nearby. I was too afraid to venture out of my comfort zone. When Skyrim came out, pretty much 90% of my Facebook feed was filled with my friends bragging about killing their first dragon. I was so jealous. I wanted to do that, but I still didn't want to spend $60 on a game I thought I'd hate. I pushed it off and continued pouring my time into Call of Duty every night. Fast forward about a year and a half. I finally had a chance to try out Skyrim for free on my freshly built gaming PC. To say it was amazing would be an understatement. I was surprised that I actually liked playing RPGs. Not only that, but I wasn't half bad! The controls were easy to get used to and Skyriim is actually what helped me feel more comfortable using mouse and keyboard. I easily put in over 80 hours within less than 3 weeks (which is pretty impressive considering I have a full time job and I'm a single mom of two!). So, it's safe to say I was addicted. I loved everything about the game. Being able to choose my class, my race, etc. It was all customizable to my taste. And that's not even counting the countless mods that are available! As if I wasn't happy enough just being able to play Skyrim, I found out that The Elder Scrolls Anthology was about to be released. Needless to say, I didn't hesitate to buy it and have no doubts that it was money well spent. Skyrim seems to go on forever. I play and play, yet the quests seem neverending. Not that I'm complaining... But I'm also looking forward to going back and playing the previous TES games as well. I wish I had given them a chance before, but I'm so glad I finally did!

review: This is the game the never, ever ends. I picked this game up thinking I wouldn't like it having never played a previous TES game before. Sat in my Library untouched for about a month or two, and finally took the plunge. I was wrong. I was so very, very wrong. This is probably the best purchase I've ever made on steam. Add in the unlimited potential of modding, and it's an adventure that continues forever. I've probably restarted over a hundred times by now with a new character, and still only have beaten Alduin once. ONCE. There's still so much more do to and explore that I'm still discovering quests and areas and little hidden things. I still can't believe how much there is to do and I'm still finding more. At it stands I'll probably wake up one day having lost all touch with reality and actually start seeing the world as Skyrim with how much I've played. And I'm totally ok with that.

review: If I had to choose between this game, and my girlfriend. I'd pick this game. EDIT: I'm single now ON A MORE SERIOUS NOTE: This game is the best in its genre. In previous Bethesda games they made a sad balance in between Questing, and Exploration. Some having more quests and less places to go, and others having very few quests and more places to explore. But in Skyrim, there is no shortage of quests, and if you are like myself and just wander around aimlessly, you will stumble into places that just blow your mind. Every time I have replayed this game, I stumbled into something new. For more info i'd very much recommend mods, with mods such as texture packs, difficulty, quests, armor, and weapons, this games replay value is endless. Go through the game once with plain skyrim, then mod the hell out of it. Overall I'd rate this game an EASY 10/10. If you haven't already. Please buy it, give it a little, and I swear you will be hooked.

review: An epic game made all the more epic by the fact that it is so easy to mod and so well supported by the modding community. The Elder Scrolls series has a large following and often you will hear people argue over each new TES game comparing it to the last, but for me each TES game stands on its own merits, and Skyrim is no exception. The story is pretty good and there are plenty of side quests, but what makes Skyrim so great even when not modded is its large and open nature. This is a land you can just pick a direction and with no quest in mind and just explore. You will find danger and excitement on your journey ... and loot. Lots and lots of loot. But once you start modding this game, that is when you unlock the true value that is Skyrim. Potentially thousands more hours content (for free) in a game that can be improved ten thousand different ways from graphics, textures and sounds all the way to game mechanics and user interface changes. You can make the game exactly what you need it to be, and play it for so long you may still be playing when the next game in this series comes out.... and sometimes longer than even that. If you are interested in modding the PC version of the game, be sure to check out my guide for beginners:

review: I was stacking books on a shelf in my house in Whiterun, one of Skyrim's major cities, when I noticed a weapon rack right beside it. I set a sacrificial dagger in one slot, an Orcish mace in the other. They were on display for nobody but me and my computer-controlled housecarl, Lydia, who sat at a table patiently waiting for me to ask her to go questing. The chest upstairs was reserved for excess weapons and armor, the bedside table for smithing ingots and ores, the one next to the Alchemy table for ingredients. I'd meticulously organized my owned virtual property not because I had to, but because tending to the minutia of domestic life is a comforting break from dealing with screaming frost trolls, dragons, a civil war, and job assignments that never seem to go as planned. It's even a sensible thing to do; a seemingly natural component of every day existence in Skyrim, one of the most fully-realized, easily enjoyable, and utterly engrossing role-playing games ever made. Part of what makes it so enjoyable has to do with how legacy Elder Scrolls clutter has been condensed and in some cases eliminated. In Skyrim, there's no more moon-hopping between hilltops with a maxed out Acrobatics skill. That's gone, so is Athletics. The Elder Scrolls V pares down the amount of skills and cuts out attributes like Endurance and Intelligence altogether. There's no time wasted on the character creation screen agonizing over which skills to assign as major. You don't assign major and minor skills at all, but instead pick one of ten races, each with a specific bonus. High Elves can once a day regenerate magicka quickly, Orcs can enter a berserk rage for more effective close-range combat. These abilities are best paired with certain character builds  the High Elf regeneration is useful for a magic user  but don't represent a rigid class choice. Major decisions don't need to be made until you're already out in the world and can try out magic, sneaking and weapon combat, emphasizing first-hand experience over instruction manual study, letting you specialize only when you're ready. It contributes to the thrilling sense of freedom associated with life in Skyrim. Do a quest, kill a dragon, snatch torchbugs from the air, munch on butterfly wings or simply wander while listening to one of the best game soundtracks in recent memory. Despite the enormity of the world and the colossal amount of content contained within, little feels random and useless. Even chewing on a butterfly wing has purpose, as it reveals one of several alchemical parameters later useful in potion making at an alchemy table. Mined ore and scraps of metal from Dwemer ruins can be smelted into ingots and fashioned into armor sets, pelts lifted from slain wildlife can be turned into leather armor sets, and random books plucked from ancient ruins can trigger hidden quest lines that lead to valuable rewards. Skyrim's land mass is absolutely stuffed with content and curiosities, making every step you take, even if it's through what seems like total wilderness, an exciting one, as something unexpected often lies just over the next ridge. Many times the unexpected takes the form of a dragon. Sometimes they're purposefully placed to guard relics, sometimes they swoop over cities and attack at seemingly random times. In the middle of a fight against a camp of bandits a dragon might strike, screaming through the sky and searing foe and friendly alike with frost or flame. Momentarily all on the battlefield unite, directing arrows and magic blasts upward to knock down the creature, creating impromptu moments of camaraderie -- a surprising change from what may have been yet another by-the-numbers bandit camp sweep. Dragons show up often, their presence announced by an ominous flap of broad wings or an otherworldly scream from high above. The scale and startling detail built into each creature's appearance and animations as it circles, stops to attack, circles again and slams to the ground makes encounters thrilling, though their predictable attack patterns lessen the excitement after a few battles. In the long run they're far less irritating than the Oblivion gate equivalent from The Elder Scrolls IV, can be completed in a few minutes, and always offer a useful reward. Killing a dragon yields a soul, which powers Skyrim's new Shout system. These are magical abilities any character can use, you don't have to specialize in spell casting to slow time, throw your voice, change the weather, call in allies, blast out ice and fire, or knock back enemies with a rolling wave of pure force. Even if you favor sword, shield and heavy armor and ignore magic entirely, you'll still be able to take full advantage of these abilities provided you find the proper words  each Shout has three  hidden on Skyrim's high snowy peaks and in the depths of forgotten dungeons, serving as another reason to continue exploring long after you've exhausted the main quest story, joined with the Thieves Guild, fought alongside the Dark Brotherhood, or thrown your support behind one of the factions vying for control of Skyrim. Not only is this land under assault by dragons, long thought to be dead, it's also ripped in two by civil war. You can choose one side or the other, but so much of the allure of Skyrim is how, even outside of the confines of quest lines, the embattled state of the world is evident, and steeped in a rich fictional legacy. Lord of the Rings this is not, but with the release of every Elder Scrolls game, the fiction becomes denser, and the cross-referencing for long-time fans all the more rewarding. Skyrim's residents are all aware of current events. They'll comment on the civil war, some sympathizing with the rebels, others thinking the establishment sold its soul. The peasants complain about the Jarls who control each settlement, the Jarls complain about the rebels or foreign policy, the overprotective College librarian complains when I drop dragon scales all over his floor; many characters feel like whole, distinct personalities instead of vacuous nothings that hand out quests like a downtown greeter hands out flyers for discount jeans. Characters stereotype based on race, they double-cross at even the slightest hint it might be profitable, and they react to your evolving stature within the world. It makes a ridiculous realm, filled with computer-controlled cat people and humanoid reptiles, demon gods and dragons, feel authentic, like a world that existed long before you showed up and will continue to exist long after you leave.

review: After I stopped regularly playing games on the PS2 years ago, I was lucky I could sit down for more than 15 minutes at a time with any game at all. This game shattered that trend entirely and left me glued to my computer desk for days. There's just so much to do and discover that Skyrim always leaves you wanting more. With a seemingly endless supply of adventure, skills, and battle, those easily sidetracked can find themselves a dozen or more hours into the game before ever killing their first dragon in the story quests should they feel so inclined to dally. Even once the story is complete, there is still a tremendous content that can be accessed. When all is said and done, you can always play through with a new character for a different experience thanks to the huge collection of skills, perks, and equipment to compliment whichever race you choose. Between the main quest line, the massive world, the extensive list of sidequests and dungeons, game expansion content, and a huge list of mods to choose from, there's something for nearly everyone.

review: Hands down the biggest, baddest dungeon crawlinest Elder Scrolls game to date. Between modding and the steam workshop, the game has been expanded to include a rediculous amount of updrades to the lighting, textures, AI, NPCs, models, weapons, UI, and some even add entirely new locations and quests for hours of extra gameplay. A must have for anyone who enjoys RPGs.

review: One of the most beautiful, immersive and epic games of all time. In fact, it's THE most. There are no contenders. It almost feels like a waste of time recommending Skyrim, because anyone with a machine capable of playing it is likely to have done so already. Some of the mods are also well worth installing if your setup can run them, including retextures, graphics extenders and more detailed character creation. Goodbye real world, Tamriel is much more appealing!

review: Skyrim - An ocean of possibility, but about as deep as a kiddy pool. For all of the 80 hours (I played with Steam off most of the time) I spent in the game fighting endless waves of Draugr and going through corridors of samey dungeons in the game, I would ask myself; "When will this get good?"The story has no depth whatsoever, every single story quest is simply "go to this dungeon and get this thing", and dragon fights are underwhelmingly easy. This is neither a good RPG or a good adventure game because not only is the skill system inferior to the original stat system of the previous games, but because the combat is  as  with your skill barely having an effect. I admit it will provide decent entertaintment with its interesting lore and the stupid ragdoll effects that occasionally make it look like the enemies are having awkward sexual intercourse with each other. If you manage to look past the many flaws and the shallowness of the quests, story, and characters, then this is a decent game for just filling the gaps with your imagination. Roleplaying is possible but greatly hindered by the fact that your character has instant mastery over weapon he/she picks up, though that can be fixed with mods. However if you're someone who comes straight from Morrowind and Oblivion, you'll appreciate the nice visuals and good animations (for a TES game), but that'll quickly be overlooked by the lackluster character building, the lame black-and-white story about "An ancient evil returns", nothing absolutely happening, an uninteresting Civil War plot, the illusion of choice ("Yes " or "Yeah" in response to a question), and a world utterly devoid of consequence and life. But hey, it's a decent game if you put in mods like Requiem, Morrowloot, Morrowind-style Questing, Combat Overhaul mods and use your imagination. I didn't pour a pretty decent amount of hours for nothing. I'll recommend it only because most mods are really good. By itself though? Hell no. TL;DR: Story sucks, quests suck, combat sucks, stat system sucks, but if you use mods and a lot of imagination it's actually pretty good.

review: One of the best role-playing games I have ever played. Following the footsteps of the previous Elder Scrolls and improving in most aspects of the series, Skyrim has everything you want on a role-playing game. From exploring the world and killing dragons to creating your own house and cooking, the game rarely gets boring as you have a lot to do. Ridiculous amount of quests, gear, cities, landmarks, character builds make the game very enjoyable to play more than once.

You have to see it in order to believe it: massive open world, tons of things to do, magic, politics, bandits, monsters, dragons you name it.

I keep typing and backspacing because I am at a loss for words, because trying to describe this game makes me think about how amazing this game is, and I can't think of what to say. Yep. It's the game of my dreams. The ultimate roleplay experience. Pretty much everything I could wish for in a game. Never a roleplaying game so very long-lasting. Whether you play as a badass, or a simple person existing in the world... you'll still feel awesome. Replayability value is extreeeeeeeemely high. Never a game so beautiful and IMMERSIVE in every way possible too. I always turn the volume way up. I cried even on the main menu because it was so amazing and the music and the awesome. There is not a more amazing game series than the Elder Scrolls. I have played the first four TES games, and this game just sent my fanboy heart and turned it into a Viking.

review: The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim has given me more pleasure in playing a game, than any other game has given me. As soon as you hit start new game, the graphics blow you away, even the loading screen with Alduin sitting on the word wall looks amazing. The dialogue matches them mouth movements, which is alway a plus, and the Voice acting is suberb (even though you tend to hear different characters with the same voice). As I said the graphics of this game are like no other you will see in a game made in 2011, however, the one critique I have is the water textures, as many a time I have come across patches of water that is invisible, but, the majority of the game is spent on land so that tends to not affect your gameplay. The Story is good, but sometimes it lacks a certain quality that you tend to notice. The one major problem I have with the game is the (SPOLIERS) Battle For Whiterun, it is suppossed to be a large scale seige, but it turns out to be 20 Stormcloaks charging at 30 Imperials. The Battle at either Solitude or Windhelm is only slightly better. Despite those problems I believe that Skyrim deserves the title of 2011-2012 game of the year. It extensive lore, its hours of leveling, its interesting (someties) story lines and its massive replay value make this game one of the best Role Playing Games made, you can easily sink 200+ hours into your first play-through without even finishing the main story line.

review: There simply hasn't been a game as anticipated as TES V: Skyrim. The latest entry in the 17 year old series, Skyrim brings the same free form RPG formula the series is known for and brings it into current generation hardware. Skyrim is more than a graphical upgrade, though. By removing the character stats and classes, Skyrim allows true freedom in play style by allowing characters to form based on what actions the player does the most. Any skillup contributes to level progression and a perk system allows players to excel at skills and learn new abilties without the need for stats or classes. Couple this with a world with so much to do and see, and it's easy to see why this game is so loved.

Venture forth as the mighty Dragonborn, crushing your enemies though use of powerful magics, Daedric artifacts, and devastating shouts, or jump on people's dinner tables and make them beat each other up while you steal their stuff! Though advanced gameplay mechanics, you will be able to advance your numerous skills so as to perform amazing feats never before seen to the folk of Skyrim. Advance your destruction skill and repeatedly stunlock your enemies by pressing both mouse buttons with the same spell, forever! Advance your sneak skill, and steal people's pants as they walk down the street! Advance your smithing and alchemy skills, and become almost literally invinvible through use of a complex process that includes potions, enchanting, and exploits! You will encounter a wide variety of intresting characters in your travels in the newest part of Tamriel, including cat people, lizard people, racist elves, drunk people, racist nords, bandits, assassins, murderers, cultists, drug dealers, corrupt bureaucrats, and more! Defeat powerful bosses like dead people, magic dead people, dead people with swords, people that make dead people serve them, a dragon that makes other dragons not dead, more dead people, dead people with shouting powers, flying magic dead people with masks, flying magic dead people without masks, dead people without skin, dead people with skin, vampires that count as un-dead even though they never were dead in the first place, to name a few. This game comes with three DLCs: Dragonborn, Hearthfire, and Dawnguard, which add the ability to fight the champion of Cthul-- er... I mean, Hent... no... oh, yeah: Hermaeus Mora, the first Dragonborn; the ability to get more houses which are occasionally attacked by bandits who kidnap your spouse because you can only build them in the middle of nowhere; and the ability to renact your favorite scenes of Twilight, but with more vampire hunting/human killing and less creepy "romance". Overall, I highly recommend this game. Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to go get some Burger King.

review: I heard someone call this a mile wide and an inch deep once, and that's a perfect way to describe it. Bethesda is utterly amazing at building worlds, but when it comes to putting quests and characters in those worlds they fail, miserably. Take the civil war for instance. Skyrim is caught between the Empire (the good guys) and the stormcloaks (idiots one and all, and the bad guys. If they win, the real big bads, the aldmeri dominion who are basically magical nazi elves get one step closer to wiping out humanity altogether.) You can win the civil war for one side or another, and.... nothing happens. Sure some guards change pants and maybe two or three npc's say a sliiiiiightly different thing now, but that's it. Oh and you win the civil war by doing a fetch quest and then going to a city and killing waves of utterly identical faceless soldiers. four or five times. I guess what I'm saying here is there's no replay value at all. There's one way to do something and that's it. No choosing to do it a different way later in another playthrough because there is no other way. Oh and if you care about sane, coherent plots, DO NOT buy Dawnguard. The only possible way that could make sense is if your character literally becomes temporarily . Full on window licking wearing inflatable waterwings in the bath so you don't drown .

review: Skyrim is the one of the best games to play, able to capture the attention of any that play it, difficult to be fun, but not difficult to be annoying, Plenty of Quests to do as well as just explore the massive expanse that is the world of Skyrim. Makeing the deal of buying the game sweeter, working with Steam Workshop allows you to create a whole new world through the power of mods. Great Game, if get it on sale even better.

You can play anyway you want: Assassin, Mage, Warrior, etc. Have countless hours of fun with side quests, guilds, DLC, or the main story. I would highly recommed this game to anyone who enjoys RPG's or even if its your first one!

review: Do you not already own this?!?! How have you been surviving. Sure you got food, water, and shelter, but THIS, this is a real neccessity. It is an open world ready with secrets to discover and adventures to travel on. Fighting dragons is but a part of your quest to be the best warrior in Skyrim. But only if you want to of course. Being a thief, or assassin is just as amazing for portraying your incredible stealth, unless you plan to be the Archmage of limitless magical powers! Casting fire and lightning on your quest to kill the high king of the land! There is always combinations if you prefer spreading your bard-like knowledge. So go on! Fulfill your quest, and become a true DRAGONBORN!!!!

review: This game is great, but has it's drawbacks. It feels more like an adventure game than an RPG, it's more about doing than filling out level sheets. Which I must say I prefer. I found it tedious in Oblivion to allocate skills into things I ended up not using because I didn't know the plot of the game the first time. It didn't feel like I was playing a game, it felt like homework. Skyrim is simplier, but it's streamlined nature is what makes it so enjoyable to play. I feel like I'm going on an adventure, and getting stronger using skills that come natural to me. The characters look pretty, and the open world is really quite astounding. I found myself simply looking at the scenery, knowing that someone had to envision it. It is probably one of my favorite games, but I don't like to compare it to the other Elder Scrolls games, because it breaks the mold with a new leveling system.

review: This game is totaly worth the money. Gameplay and graphics may not be it's strongest areas but besides that the game is truly one of the best I have played in a lond time. Huge openworld landscape with lots to do and see. All three expancions are great extending the epic adventure that the game has to offer. Plus the game's modding community is one of the richest that I have seen, with thousands of great and new mods comming out daily, from adding new and exiting weapons and races to making an extreme inprovement on both graphics and gameplay. Skyrim is gaurintieed to give you an exiting taste of the TES adventure and give you hours upon hours of an exiting and novel experience. Since the last game skyrim has made tremendous inprovements. In skyrim the UI has been tremendously improved with smarter sorting, new options and overall better looks. Players can now gain a veriaty of new blessings and powers and not to mention, shouts! Shouts are the main new aspect of the game allowing players to absorb the souls of dragons and use their powers against them. One other new inprovement is the dual weild option allowing for players to equip weapons/magic in to the left, right, or both hands making for new and dynamic combat stragities. The game's graphic atmosphere is much more "rugged and dirty" where as Oblivion's was almost cartoonish. Although the new engine is a disapointment it still works fine giving us great graphics that can compare to many modern games. The modding community also brings high resolution texturepacks and encredible HD lighting and shader mods called ENBs. The story, as always, focuses on a prisioner who becomes an emportant person in tamrielic history. In this installment of the TES franchise your charater escpes exicution when the dragon god Aulduin attacks. Later you find out that you are the dragonborn of legend and are destined to save tamriel from the wrath of the dragons. By defeating Aulduin and restoring the peace of skyrim the player will have a great expericnce with this exiting game.

Want more inmersive mechanics like hunger, thirst and hypothermia effects? Want more impressive spells? Want to add ponies instead of dragons!? you got all of this and more!!!

review: November 11, 2011 was a great day, because Bethesda graced us with one of the greatest games every created. Skyrim is the 5th installment of The Elder Scrolls series; and oh boy does it ever take it to the next level. What does Skyrim have you may ask? In depth character development, player housing, kill-able NPCs, anything that isn't nailed to the wall or ground can be stolen, tons of weapons and magic spells, play as a werewolf or vampire, hundreds of quests, an enormous world, and oh yeah DRAGONS! Skyrim is an RPG that has a great main story with tons of side quests that either have nothing to do with the main story arc or have everything to do with it. I couldn't stop playing the game as every corner, every road or just over that mountain had something new to do or experience. And the experiences were increased exponentially with the environmental detail and sound that made you feel like you were in the world itself. Do you want to be a heavy armor wearing archer, a dual wielding wizard, a vampire, or maybe you just want to be an assassin; your choices of character combinations are extensive. Each aspect of your character has a skill tree and actions like merely sneaking around will improve it's skill and unlock a skill point with each passing level that can be used to specialize that ability even more. And after you spend time specializing your character, you have to move on to customizing their gear. Skyrim is a must own for RPG lovers, gamers who enjoy open worlds and if you love DRAGONS; how do you not already have this game? + Beautiful Visuals + Great sounds and music + Detailed and engrossing stories + Great combat + Open world and very customizable character progression - Can be overwhelming for people new to the series - Some glitches during combat (Very Minimal) Score: 10 out of 10

review: We all know this game and how  it was on the consoles. We all agree that this game is 100 times better on PC due to mods and enhancements that can be modified and added. This game is incredible in its own way. Yes, it has a considerable amount of glitches and bugs which can be fixed using Official Patches from the Skyrim Nexus. There are a lot of things you are missing from this game. It has incredible mods that you will never get to experience. Which is a shame since it is one of the biggest workshops on Steam. There are mods that add more killmoves, characters, races, weapons, armours, animals + beasts, immersive mods, enviroments, gameplay aspects, and more. There are ENBs which enhance skyrim IMMENSELY. Literarily, a brain . There are mods that can create better characters that don't look like hobos from downtown. This game is excellent for those who seek adventure, great mods, and roleplaying.

Once you complete most of the game, you can literally download an entirely new game for free on the Workshop. This is a fantastic deal for an awesome game.

Story is good, looks amazing, and the adventures are once in a lifetime experiences. 9.5/10. A definitely purchase!

But this game has earned that place with it's great Graphics (and with mods it really begins to shine!), atmosphere and gameplay. What it lacks in gameplay innovations it makes up with one of the best digital worlds ever crafted. This game is more then the sum of it's parts, it truly excels when you write your own story and be the hero you want to be. This is an escapist dream.

The dawnguard DLC is fun and gives you alot more side quests with a good main quest line. But the best DLC so far has to be the Dragonborn DLC im still going through doing the black books i mean theres alot of stuff to do so you wont get bored with the plot and say "Omg this sucks why did i even buy it" because i love it. Overall the game is great, plus all the mods you can download really gives the game alot of life and stuff to do. I give this game a perfect 10/10 an amazing game please do buy.

game-hours: 117.0
review: Surely a game this massive in scale requires a review of similar proportion. Where do I begin? The graphics? The gameplay? The lore? I'll start at the beginning. First off, this game is nothing like Roller Coaster Tycoon. In fact, Skyrim and RCT are about as far away from each other on the spectrum of gaming as they can be. So if you're looking for a quality theme park building/management simulator (or any theme park building/management simulator), do not look to the Elder Scrolls series. You begin your quest as a lowly prisoner in the back of a wagon. The offense is border hopping, and the punishment is death by axe (sure beats a big ol' wall, huh U.S. government?). On the way to the execution you meet fellow prisoner Roggvir, a key member in a group of rebels called the Stormcloaks, who want to take back Skyrim from the Imperial Legion (the people who are executing you) and put the Nords back in command. When you arrive at the execution...place in Helgen, a guard asks you for your name. Now say what you want about the Imperial Legion, but these people have some patience. I sat there for 45 minutes thinking of a name and rearranging my race, face, and gender to my liking, and they just waited for me to finish. Finally I decided on Jikrel, a magician/juggler inspired by my hero, Penn Jillette. Properly named and pampered, I'm ready to get my head chopped off! Just before the axe comes down, however, a conveniently timed plot device* swoops down and proceeds to burn the city to the ground. It is at this point that the player can decide whether to escape with Roggvir, the handsome rebel with a cause, or someoneelseIforgothisname, a dirty Imperial pig. While the choice doesn't make a difference at this point in the game, it presents the player with the concept of choosing sides in a convoluted, almost entirely pointless side quest involving the great Civil War of Skyrim. Racist rebels or idiotic Imperials? The choice is yours to make (or not). Once you've escaped, you're free to go anywhere in the overworld you desire, do any side quests you want, tackle the main storyline, or just goof around and break the game's A.I. I opted for the latter. Don't get me wrong, there are a lot of things to do in Skyrim, it's just that most of them aren't fun or interesting. I tried to give the main quest a go, but around the seventeenth plot device* and ninth fetch quest or so, I just got sick of it and quit. I had to replace the stock plot device* fighthing music to a pitched-down rendition of Frank Zappa's "No Not Now" just to make it that far. I'm going to be honest here: the most fun I've had playing this game I've had roleplaying a psychopathic serial rap-ist/ene-ma bandit/murderer that slits people's throats, dry humps their still warm corpses and dumps them in the nearest river/crevice/humorous location he can find. What this says about myself, I don't know. But I do know what it says about the game's quests: they're not good. In fact, I found the game's quests were obstructing my overall goal of blindly murdering everything in my path. Ever since Oblivion, Bethesda has felt the need to make certain NPC's that are essential to the game's completion unkillable. I had to download a mod so that I could kill them and thus continue having fun. Oh, and don't get me started on the mods! Nude mods, "better female" mods, "sexy armor" mods, what is this a sick joke?! How horny are you people?! But I digress. To sum it up: Skyrim is worse than Oblivion because it is better than Oblivion. Bethesda don't seem to realize that their games are inherently goofy and are perfect that way. The more they try to make it "badass" or "epic" or the more bad face textures and A.I. bugs they fix the worse it gets. I don't even think the intended audience for these games takes them seriously considering the number of great dumb mods there are out there (Battletoad Rash!) All in all, I'd buy it because it's still a pretty enjoyable experience and I'm sure everybody can find something to do in this massively dumb role-playing action-adventure game. Oh, and the graphics are pretty good I guess. 7/10 *plot device=dragon

review: Ahhh, Skyrim. Returning to the continent of Tamriel after Oblivion, Skyrim is a huge, beautiful, entertaining game that has much of what made Oblivion grand, while changing, omiting or adding to that formula to make the game even more compelling. The crafting and enchanting of items, for example, gives a personal tocuh for those who want to forge their own destiny with their own hand-made tools. The vistas and terrain is nothing short of beautiful, with sprawling ruins, vast mountains, snowy peaks, grassy highlands, wooded areas and even a volcanic/hot springs type area. The main quest is . . . much like any Bethesda Main Quest. Servicable, but not specifically stunning. However, music, visuals, small, personal little legends in dungeons, and those little stories told in the severed outstretched arm reaching for a treasure box, the dungeon specific quests, the little errands that can turn into something sprawling the entire land, books whose information can lead you on a merry chase to adventure and treasure, and last but not least the dragons and the shouts (special powers you gain over time exploring and finding Words of Power-type walls) that are unlocked and empowered by dragon's souls all push this game up to one of my favorite games I've ever played. Nothing compares to the rush of a legendary dragon attacking a settlement, and you rushing to defend it. If you can swing the expansions, you can also build your own houses, sail to a strange and almost alien island, and contend with Skyrim's vampires as well. The house building is the next logical step for anyone who sees the game itself as little more than a reason to craft their own items because they are awesome. The Island of Solstheim is both strange and engaging for me in much the same way the alien realm of the Mad God was in Oblivion. And the Vampires are fun if for no other reason than they've gotten bold enough to attack settlements, leading again to a battle between vamps, you and the city inhabitants. For the uninitiated, though, games like this on the computer run very well with mods, and this is no exception. My favorites of those (I found them on Nexus Mods, I'm not sure how many are on the Steam Workshop as well) are Run For Your Lives (citizens will hide when a dragon attacks), When Vampires Attack (the same but for when vamps attack settlements), Glowing Ore 300 (because otherwise ore is very hard to pick out), WATER (Makes water prettier), Green Water Fix (fixes a problem of not being able to see anything underwater because patches are fun) and finally all the "Unoffical" Patches (because they make the game run smoother). The TL; DR version? For the massive adventure it is, Skyrim is a must have for any adventerous soul. Just note that both mods and the expansions do nothing but enhance the experience. ;)

review: My most played game on steam, by far. Amazing thorough storyline, seemingly infinite side missions (I probably haven't even discovered them all) , and lastly the greatest mod community of all time, allowing you the range of simply tweaking a bow unsheath animation, to turning skyrim into a tropical desert (yes that exists), among THOUSANDS of other examples. The game is so unimaginably detailed it can't be criticized, there is something for EVERYONE in this game, whether it be riding horses in a meadow or sacrificing the unworthy to a demon God, and everything inbetween. Unlike ANY other game out there, price is not to be considered as a factor, you just HAVE to get Skyrim (if there isn't anyone left on Earth that hasn't yet bought it)

review: If you've not played Skyrim yet you are missing out. It's not just another fantasy game, like the games that came before it's an open world exploration game. The goal of the game is not just to finish the main quest line, but to explore the world and see what you can find. Exploration is where the game really shines, you can be lost for hours walking around the world and finding different and unique areas. Brave the crypts full of undead for special loot, walk along the frozen northern coast and maybe you'll find a wrecked ship home to bandits. Just walking through the world is exciting, a blizzard blows in and suddenly you're attacked by a sabretooth tiger, you're running through the blinding snow hoping to find a cave or building you can hide in. Combat is more of a mixed affair, Skyrim has a little bit of everything; melee, magic, archery and stealth, but you may find the lack of options can be slightly boring. There's no combo system, just a few different types of attacks depending on how you're moving and if you hold down the attack button when you're attacking. Combat magic consists of direct attacks, ground attacks, and summoned weapons. Archery consists of holding down your attack button to attack farther away. Stealth is used to get around tough monsters, or combines with archery or melee combat to give bonuses to your attacks Most of the time you won't be jumping into swarms of enemies, but where they do make you jump into swarms of enemies the combat is lacking. You may find yourself surrounded and your only option is to backup while swinging your weapon or casting a spell; Kratos you are not. While combat is lacking I would not say it's a big detriment to the game as the game does not revolve around constant combat. The vast majority of combat is one on one, and when you do come across multiple enemies you can always make your way around with a good use of stealth. The graphics are fairly good. Some textures up close do not look good, while others look amazing. The mountains look particularly good, covered in snow and generally looking imposing. Environmental effects like the aforementioned blizzard look amazing, not because they look like a real weather but because of the feeling they'll give you. When you're in a blizzard you'll feel like you're actually in a blizzard, the cold seems to seep into the room and you'll start to shiver. Weapons, armor and magic effects look great, with weapons and armor having many different unique looks to them. Of course not all is well. In the aforementioned blizzard I came across many people that looked more like they were out for a nice stroll than in the middle of the blizzard. Instead of the expected hunched over for warmth they walk through as though nothing is happening, and it's not just the nords doing it, it's everybody. As already mentioned some of the textures are rather bland, and distant areas can look rather ugly, although Bethesda did their best to avoid long stretches of empty space. Sound is great. There are many different tracks of music that will play during the game, all of which I enjoyed. Dragons roar from far away, the sound echoing through the mountains. Weapons clang, electric magic sounds sound like electricity, flame magic sounds like what you may imagine a flame thrower sounds like. Voice acting is significantly better than Oblivion, with many more voice actors. You'll still come across people that have their voice change though. What really makes the world though is how alive it is. Almost everything is intractable. Walk into a house and steal all the cups, walk through a field and pick flowers or catch butterflies. Every NPC that's not a monster has a schedule they follow, and not just a static schedule, one NPC may be told that during the day they need to just wander about town, while another may be told to find every caliper they can get their hands on. These types of interactions really bring the world alive, and nothing feels as though it's just a facade, everything feels real and alive.

review: Do I really need to say anything about this game? No. The answer is no. That's because every single person and their great-Grandmother has heard of Skyrim, especially how good it is. With good reason, too. It is indeed a very fun game with quite a lot to do, especially since the Steam Workshop integration allows for a whole plethora of different experiences. Want to ride around on a dragon dressed as a Space Marine wielding a lightsaber in one hand and a Chainsword in the other? Then bugger me sideways you're in for a treat. Of course, some people like their games to remain lore friendly. There's plenty of mods like that too, I guess. The main story isn't much to really say about. Go places, do stuff, get rewards such as weapons and shouts and boom, you've got some beastly arsenal to back yourself up with. However you could indeed tell Skyrim to go shove it as you run off to become an assassin instead. Or a thief. Or a Werewolf. Or a Vampire. Hell, the list goes on. As for the mods? -breathes in- Weapon mods, race mods, clothing mods, modded play homes, modded spells, addition mounts, different mechanics, improved graphics, realism mods, location mods, additional enemies, companion mods... Hot damn, this stuff's endless. Really you could just play this game forever and still have stuff to do. I give it a thumbs up.

With a huge world to discover, and plenty of opportunities, just go and explore and play as you enjoy to. Don't make the mistake I did and read too much about how to improve you're character on the forums, or you might get to the point where you'll way more powerful then anything you'll encounter, thus ruining you're game experience. I definitely recommend this game, with all it's expansions, and with all the mods out there, you'll have hundred's of hours to play and still be having new things to do and discover.

review: This game starts out all well and good. It looks decent, the soundtrack is nice, and the intro quest is exciting (the first time). After about 4 hours I started to really notice how shallow it was though. Every quest seemed to involve going into a cave to kill bandits/zombies and retrieve item x to give to person y. You can be good at everything in the world with one character, from the worlds deadliest assassin to the leader of a group of werewolf warriors to the archmage of a college of magic. The combat never strays far from clicking rapidly until your health runs low, downing a few potions, repeat. Harder difficulties only make combat take longer, it doesnt actually make it harder.That being said there is quite an extensive mod community and everything thats "wrong" with the game has been fixed and everything you could ever imagine can be added to your game. tl;dr: Is it fun? Yes (with mods)

review: I love this game. Its simple beauty lies in the amount of control the player has over how they play. Skyrim is a different game for each person, whether you like to play as a mage, a warrior, or a thief. With seemingly never-ending quests and objectives, you'll never grow bored of this game, because even if you can't find anything more to do, creating a new character creates an entirely new game and a new series of adventures. Trust me when I say it's really hard to get tired of this game. To top it off, the graphics are amazing, and Bethesda's new engine is gentle even to some underpowered systems. I can't recommend this game enough.

The graphics coupled with the excellent combat system switching between physical damage and magic seamlessly brings the player to a new level of RPG'ing.

review: This game is awesome! For people who like RPG and dragons, this is one of the must buy games. The greatest part o the game is its system of leveling up and its skill tree that are smartly made by using the character actions as training, and the dungeons are interesting and provide the player a choice to build his own strategic way to do it, according to your character's skill and equipment. The number of items that you can interact with is unbelieveable, just keep in mind that it has some useless itens too. The scenes are greatly made with a lot of details. It worths every penny! But just to be fair there's a point in the game that should've be improved: "The difficult of the puzzles". You won't find any hard logical obstacle to get through, so it's kind an easy game, but still worth playing.

review: Fairly decent game, especially with mods. Has a large open world, however most of the content is the same from dungeon to dungeon. Mods are pretty much a must in my opinion, as they do a number of things, from increasing the difficulty of higher levels, making it look much better, to fixing a number of broken or exploitable mechanics. I would recommend SkyUI at the very least to make the UI much more usable for someone in with a mouse.

review: At the moment of writing this I have over 86 hours played in this game and still I'm not even near 50% of completion. Dragons, swords, bows, magic, being the chosen one in a land full of mistery, I mean, what else do you need in a game? The gameplay is perfect, the graphics are gorgeous - except for the ocassional shadow glitch, but nothing you can't fix with a mod -, and it has Steam Workshop for easy mod installation to make it even longer and better and prettier. Each DLC is worth every single cent, because it expands the gameplay A LOT, and by A LOT, take my word, I mean several hours more for you to spend on this game. Even though it has the bugs you can expect in a game developed by Bethesda - and yes, there are lots of bugs and glitches - you DON'T EVEN CARE because THE GAME IS SO ING AWESOME you'll not be paying attention to the bugs. And the best part is there are several unofficial and official patches in the Workshop that actually fix the bugs, so just browsing the Workshop for a few minutes is enough to get rid of them. A giant map, literally thousands of quests to do, skills to master, monsters to kill, books to read, dragons to slay, spells to learn, and places to explore, from dungeons to towns, a lot of replayability - believe me, you won't finish this game with only one character, you will be creating several to choose every single side possible in each conflict and making each choice you can to learn the whole story -, a magnificent lore, and the amount of mods available, make this game - along with its DLCs and expansions - one of the BEST GAMES EVER and a MUST BUY, from casual to hardcore gamers.

Gosh darnit I bought Skyrim. Then it sat in my library for four months. Until one day I realized that I hadn't played it yet. I brushed off the dust, and opened that game. Mind = BLOWN. I entered a magical land filled with ponies and rainbows and all that happy stuff. No, well, not really. But let's just say that the day I opened the game, I no longer had a life.

review: I was only lv 4. Bow in hand, I was sneaking up on Valtheim Towers. The one bandit guard lazily gazed at a cliff face. I snuck closer. Suddenly, the bandit yells out; "I'm going to enjoy looting your corpse!" My heart stops. Have I been seen? Will she cut me up? She runs away from me. Before I can react, the locked doors burst open. An orc sprints out, sword in hand, and he yells; "I'm going to enjoy counting your coin!" He sprints off in the same direction as the bandit guard. I sneak up on the tower- the doors spread wide open- and peek around the corner out of curiosity. The two bandits are on one side of the river, shouting threats; on the other side, a lone rabbit, busy not caring in the slightest about what's happening. There's a third bandit, an archer, on the ridge above the rabbit. He fires arrow after arrow, missing every time. I slowly sneak into the tower, dismantling every trap and carefully checking for loot. I finally arrive on the bridge. From below, I hear a shouted threat; the rabbit is still alive- but not for long. After a solid ten minutes of being all talk, one of the bandits is finally swimming across the river to finish off the rabbit and take its phat loot. She corners the rabbit, and with a quick slice, it's over. She begins swimming back to her post. I pull out my bow. With the bandit in my sights, I release an arrow. "This is for the bunny..." I whisper. In slow motion, the arrow arcs majestically through the air towards the bandit. Boom, right in the heart. In the middle of the river. Her body floats over a waterfall. 10/10 GOTY

review: I feel the biggest problem with this game is that the primary gameplay feature is exploration, except the world levels up as your character does. This includes the loot that you find as you adventure, so there are very few opportunities to find something interesting as you explore. There are a few locations that yield neat gear, like the Daedric shrines, but overall I find that this is one of the biggest problems with this type of RPG lately: you will always be fighting something your level and they will always drop something level appropriate. This mechanic dissolves the feeling of tension that should be part of exploring the unknown. The story arc also ramps up to epic levels too quickly, denying any feeling of having earned any prestige. I prefer the slow burn of something like Morrowind, where your humble beginnings provide context for your climb to becoming a mythical figure. I also find that there is too little diversity in the types of spells you can cast, and the melee mechanics. For a game that deals so much with swordplay, the melee feels vague and the crash of combat lacks any sense of feedback. The ragdoll physics also feel weightless; bodys are merely hollow forms with no mass that sail through the air before sliding down the rugged landscape like greased sleds. These issues often turn a serious high fantasy adventure into an unintentional comedy. I'm not saying that this is a bad game by any means, in fact I strongly recommend it. However, when I compare the story arc and game mechanics to something like Fallout 3, I feel like alot of the intelligence and pacing was replaced with instant gratification so the game would better appeal to the average joe. In closing, comparing Skyrim to Morrowind feels like comparing Dragon Age: Origins to Baldur's Gate 2. One is visually superior, but all of that visual polish can not make up for removing the features and stoytelling that provide so much richness to the experience.

review: I Believe that the Elder Scrolls: Skyrim is one of the best games I've ever played. This game has An unlimited amount of detail, fun, and story. Even more counting the DLC and the Steam Workshop. This game can easily top many games that will be made in the future that are "supposedly" more advanced. Whenever a new open world RPG is released they just do the same thing that Skyrim does but with less detail. I hope the next sequels of the Elder Scrolls franchise will maintain the Fantastic feel as the one you get playin Skyrim.

review: Well, first of all this is a review, meaning it's my personal, subjective opinion of this game. So please keep that in mind before attempting to make a negative comment with bad language. Thanks. Second to mention, this game is absolutely overrated and overhyped. The Good: - Even on my not-so-leet-machine this game runs pretty good and solid. Only crashed twice in 50+ hours of gameplay. - The game itself, which will serve an insane amount of play hours. - The amount of details (books to read) and things to discover is insane. - The replayability. Dozens, if not hundreds or more combinations to build your character. - For any price below 15 Euro it's worth every penny. - The voice acting and overall presentation is superb. The Bad: - Game seems sometimes a bit unpolished and clunky. But only sometimes. I play with the help of the UESP Wiki which states that a lot of quest can be stuck because of bugs. I personally haven't encountered so far any of those, though. The Ugly and the things that kinda ruins it: - Your actions in Skyrim don't seem to affect anything in any way. No matter what fraction you choose, you'll end up doing all the quests (more to that in the following point), get mediocre equipment and that's it. I hoped to be (in the end) an overpowered thief / assassin after completing the quests from the Thieves' Guild and The Dark Brotherhood? Nada. You don't even get great equipment or stuff. You even can join fractions which are hostile to each other and nobody seems to bother. Killing everything or doing anything, nothing seems to change. RPG? No, more like a game with endless possibilites, only that nothing matters. - The quests are very repetitive and purposely serve to to prolong gameplay time. You always have to (for example) find a item at the complete other side of the map and your actions are not connected, meaning your actions in Skyrim don't matter. And the quests are absolutely dull; for example to get a final achievement for the Thieves Guild, you have to do 125 (!) quests and every single one of them is the same. Steal a thing, place a stolen thing, change numbers in a book. After stealing 20 times in a row the same object you kinda loose it (no pun intended). - The leveling system is WAY to prolonged. I don't mind spending a lot of hours in a game, especially a RPG, but come on, one has to spent a whole eternity to actually become a badass character in even one skill. By the time you're (for example) a 100 level Marskman you've already finished all the fractions you're interested in. - The necessity of mods. I don't know WHAT stuff the developers smoked during testing, but the interface of this game is probably the definitively worst I have ever encountered. Even after installing the mod SkyUI its HORRIBLE and slow as hell. Absolutely horrible. Like I mentioned in the beginning, this game is completely overhyped and overrated in every aspect. In conclusion this game tries to have and be anything, but isn't. It's like jack of all trades, master of none. Still, if you have 15 bucks left, buy it.

review: When I played Skyrim for the first time, I was blown away by the attention to detail, and the vast variety of quests and locations to discover. To those who treat Morrowind like it is the holy game, take those nostalgia goggles off! Seriously, this game has not been dumned down. Skyrim has improved on many features which Morrowind and Oblivion first implemented. My favourite part of the game is interactibility, while my least favourite part of Skyrim are the amount of glitches. Not gamebreaking, just annoying. 9.5/10

review: Skyrim may be the game with most glitches that bethesda has done but that doesn't remove it's beauty and memorable enviroment. My likings of this game wasn't because of the main story nor the sidequests. I like it because it gives you the opportunity to choose whatever you want to be and do. Morrowind did the same and oblivion but they didn't have that detailed enviroment that i crave. Nostalgic elder scrolls gamers hate skyrim because it is light for the gamer and remains easy, i find it easy aswell even on higher difficulties. But let's not forget that you want to have power in a world like this and you want to rule. If you reach level 20 ingame then you are all set for kings road in skyrim. The game offers alot of quests which can give you up to 100+ gameplay depending on how fast you are going through them, of course that's just quest hours aswell. When i play i like to run around and discover the world blindly. I have played through the game 2 times and now i am on my third walkthrough. I have tried going Mage and Warrior and now i am focusing Archery (which is extremely good) and every walkthrough has been an adventure even though i have seen it all before. I have approximately 190+ hours on the game. If you want that beauty and peace in a game then you should get skyrim, it will rock your world! If you are an oldschool gamer that likes challenge and hard work to get things done i recommend Morrowind/Oblivion. Although i didn't find Oblivion that challenging it's definately more challenging than Skyrim and it also has the best dlc ever created (According to myself) "Shivering Isles" where you get to met the prince of madness, Sheogorath! Of course i recommend all 3 games if you are a variety gamer but mostly Oblivion and Skyrim since i am a relaxed gamer that doesn't wanna do too much in order to get my reputation in a game. ;) Hope this review can help you on your purchase! Have a good day.

review: Ever dreamt about a fantasy novel coming alive, without the really cheap plastic weapons and bag cg effects, that is what Skyrim is to me, a world I wish I could live in. We waited a long time for Skyrim but it was worth it, the Elder Scrolls series never fails to take over your life, anyone who games has to play Skyrim, even if they are a FPS monkey it has to be tried.

review: Once all the hype died down and I started replaying Skyrim I noticed a lot of flaws with the game that weren't apparent to me when I initially played it. While the gameplay of Skyrim is a necessary improvement over Oblivion and Fallout it just lacks a lot of depth that even Oblivion had. The lack of classes really makes every character you play as feel similar, and the lack of restrictions or stats means you can play a Thief in heavy armor and justify it by the game just not caring. Indeed the questlines are interesting the first time around but the lack of the ability to fail them or indeed decide an alternate route makes them really tedious the second or third time. It makes them feel very shallow, and it doesn't help there's only maybe 7 of them before you are automatically promoted to the head of the specific guild you joined. The game's pretty great the first time you play it but I really don't look upon Skyrim as well as I used to. The shallow content really rings true once you've tried replaying the game and the interesting dungeon aesthetic only points out how you go in a straight line in all of them.

review: Decent game, but the PC version isn't without console-ridden features that annoy mouse/keyboard users like myself. Hopefully a modder will address this issue. Skyrim in no way threatens Morrowind goty as my all-time favorite Elder Scrolls game. There is some fun to be had in Skyrim but be warned it's very streamlined and built for the masses instead of niche open world RPG lovers specifically. The price at $60 is a bit steep but you can get many hours out of this game, despite bugs and streamlining, and numerous annoying console-esque run-ins with the interface/menu.

review: Oh Skyrim, with your wondrous landscapes and your lovely wildlife and inhabitants. Skyrim is an excellent game with SO much to do. Become a thief, a warrior, anything you wanna be. You can do all the quests you want or go around each town and slaughter everyone. The possibilities are (relatively) endless. My only qualm about the game is the menu system in-game. It seems a little clunky at times and annoying having to scroll through heaps of items sometimes just to get one thing. Luckily there are mods out there for that, and I definitely recommend them should you feel the same way

review: Everyone knows this is the best game ever made and if you think otherwise then you are wrong. This is an open world action RPG, It is my favourite game by far and only the next sequel can ever top it. You start off as a prisoner who's about to be beheaded, from there you create your character from a variety of different races (human or beast) There is endless customization with what you can create and how realistic you character will look if you use mods, you don't have to because without this will still be your favourite game experience ever, but i don't see why not because it's simple to download mods from the nexus with just a few clicks and if you don't want to do that then you can easily browse the workshop from your library and install mods with a click of a button, that's what has kept this game so fun for so long and it will never get boring or old. There's various factions throughout the game you can join and become leader of, you can even become a werewolf or a vampire, the characters are all unique and loveable and you can have followers and even get married to your favourite ones, You can craft armor and weapons, enchant them, upgrade them, you can create potions, you can have your own home in this game, you level up and gain skill points to build the type of character you want, you can make a perk legendary when it get's to 100 so you level endlessely, there's always a rewarding amount of loot in each cave or dungeon you clear, i could go on forever, even just standing in the town enjoying the view of the lake is enjoyable in this game! The possibilitys with this game because of mods are endless, there's no need in other games when this game has EVERYTHING you could think of Seriously you have to buy it, if you want a game you will never get bored of, be easy to go back to whenever you want, never 100% complete because there's to much to do, then buy Skyrim

review: If you need a review to tell you to get this game, this is it. I started on xbox then moved to PC. Skyrim is, well, too much awesome to put in words. It is a masterpiece on its own, and one continually in the making. The reason I say it is continually, is the modding community. The modding community has added so much replay value to an already amazing game. For example, the Unofficial Skyrim patch is a community effort to make all of the official Skyrim and DLC bug-free, and it has fixed tens of thousands of things. Not to mention all the mod choices out there. You can have ones that change gameplay, add spells, armour, weapons, houses, add entirely new stories and quest lines, make the game 4x the quality of the HD DLC, or help you run it on an older machine. There are simply too many to mention here, but if you are looking for something, chances are there is already a mod out there for it. As for DLC, they are all excellent. I recommend them all, but I especially have a love for Dawnguard. Probably because it was the first I owned.

review: What more is there to say? It's Skyrim. Games like this come along only once in a long, long while. Games so vast in scale, so magnificent in their feel, so awe-inspiringly amazing that they define a generation of games, that they revolutionize the way we make, see and play games. This is one of those. One of those games that will be remembered decades from now, recognized and heralded as a true masterpiece of gaming that paved the way and set the bar for all games after it. It's a game that is simply breathtaking. As soon as you enter it feels like an entire world has been wrapped around you. A whole world for you to explore, however you want and whatever path you choose to do so down. Get this game, because no other game will ever match Skyrim for a long, long time.

review: TESV Skyrim is the best open world RPG in gaming to date. The amount of freedom and openness is stunning, and the game is truly stunning if you have a graphics card capable of handling it. The mod community for this game is among the most active thorughout gaming, in spite of Skyrim's age. Mods are constantly being released and updated, allowing for nearly endless replayability. The main storyline is very good, but the sheer amount of dungeons and side quest will almost always attract your attention. You will likely spend hours traversing the wilds while dungeon crawling and hunting for loot. V Very few of the side quests feel like fetch quests. Each side quest has a uniqeness and fun all on its own. In addition to the main story and side missions, there are several unique factions that demand your services, each with its own fully fleshed storyline, characters, and perks. In conclusion, the world, errr Skyrim is your oyster filled to the brim with hundreds of hours of story, loot, and fun.

review: Don't worry, I'm not going to spoil anything here - I'll steer clear of anything story-related beyond the premise. With another game, that would be tricky. With Skyrim, the stories that come from how the game works are often the best ones. It's a frozen nation, just to the north of where the previous game, Oblivion, took place. A pleasantly brief introduction sets up the plot: Skyrim is in the middle of a revolt, you've been sentenced to death, and dragons have just shown up. Good luck! At that point, you emerge from a cave into 40 square kilometres of cold and mountainous country, and that's it. Everything else is up to you. Even after spending hundreds of hours in Morrowind and Oblivion, the sense of freedom in Skyrim is dizzying. The vast mountains in every direction make the landscape seem limitless, and even after exploring it for 55 hours, this world feels huge and unknown on a scale neither of the previous two games did. Not all of the landscape is subzero, and even among the frosty climes there's an exciting variety: ice caverns that tinkle with dripping frost crystals, hulking mountains with curls of snow whipped up by the howling wind, coniferous forests in rocky river valleys. The mountains change everything. Wherever you decide to head, your journey is split between scrambling up treacherous rocks and skidding down heart-stopping slopes. The landscape is a challenge, and travel becomes a game. It's hard to walk for a minute in any direction without encountering an intriguing cave, a lonely shack, some strange stones, a wandering traveller, a haunted fort. These were sparse and quickly repetitive in Oblivion, but they're neither in Skyrim: it's teeming with fascinating places, all distinct. It was 40 hours before I blundered into a dungeon that looked like one I'd seen before, and even then what I was doing there was drastically different. These places are the meat of Skyrim, and they're what makes it feel exciting to explore. You creep through them with your heart in your mouth, your only soundtrack the dull groan of the wind outside, to discover old legends, dead heroes, weird artefacts, dark gods, forgotten depths, underground waterfalls, lost ships, hideous insects and vicious traps. It's the best Indiana Jones game ever made. The dragons don't show up until you do the first few steps of the game's main quest, so it's up to you whether you want them terrorising the world as you wander around. A world where you can crest a mountain to find a 40-foot flying lizard spitting jets of ice at the village below is a much more interesting one to be in. But fighting them never changes much: you can just ignore them until they land, then shoot them from a distance when they do. Your first dragon kill is a profound, weird moment. I rushed to the crashed carcass to loot it, then looked up. The whole town had come out to stand around and stare at the body, a thing as vast and alien to them as a T-rex in a museum. I tried shooting an ice bolt at it, just to demonstrate it was dead, and the force unexpectedly catapulted the whole thing violently into the distance. A beggar looked at me and said, "Oh sure, just throw your trash around." Your character gets better at whatever you do: firing a bow, sneaking up on people, casting healing spells, mixing potions, swinging an axe. There's always been an element of this practice-based system in Elder Scrolls games, but in Skyrim it's unrestricted - you don't have to decide what you're going to focus on when you create your character, you can just let it develop organically. That alone would feel a little too hands-off, but you also level up. When that happens, you get a perk point: something you can spend on a powerful improvement to a skill you particularly like. Every hour, you're making a major decision about your character's abilities. They're dramatic. The first point you put into Destruction magic lets you stream jets of flame from your hands for twice as long as before. As you continue to invest in one skill, you can get more interesting tweaks: I now have an Archery perk that slows down time when I aim my bow, and one for the Sneak skill that lets me do a stealthy forward roll. Again, the freedom is dizzying: every one of 18 skills has a tree of around 15 perks, and the range of heroes you could build is vast. I focused on Sneak to the point of absurdity - now I'm almost invisible, and I get a 3,000% damage bonus for backstabs with daggers. It's the play style I've always wanted in an RPG, but I've never been able to achieve it before. The enemies you encounter are, in some cases, generated by the game to match the level of your character. In Oblivion that sometimes felt like treading water: progress was just a stat increase, and your enemies kept pace. That doesn't apply now that your character is defined more by his or her perks, because the way you play is always changing. Levelled content is also just used less: at level 30, my most common enemies are still bandits with low-level weapons. And I still run into things too dangerous for me to tackle. Taking a narrow mountain path to a quest, something stops me in my tracks: a dragon roar. I check the skies - nothing, but I hear it again three more times before the peak. At the top I find a camp full of bodies, with a large black bear roaring over them. Hah. He's still more than I can handle in straight combat, but as he reaches me I use a Dragon Shout. It befriends any animal instantly, and he saunters casually away. Feeling slightly guilty, I stab him in the back before it wears off. Which is when the dragon lands, with an almighty crash, six feet from my face. I run. A roar of frozen air catches me in the back, but I keep going - over a ridge, down a short drop, and straight into a bandit. I dodge the bandit, straight into a Flame Atronarch. There are five more bandits behind it. The dragon is airborne. I throw myself off the mountain, several hundred metres into the river below. I plummet to the riverbed, and swim until I run out of breath. When I surface, the sky is alight with fireballs and flaming arrows, the dragon is spewing a stream of ice down on the bandits, and I'm laughing. The stealthy character I built in Skyrim would have been less fun in Oblivion. Whether you were detected was a binary and erratic matter. Skyrim cleverly gives you an on-screen indication of how suspicious your enemies are, and where they are as they hunt for you. It makes stealth viable even against large groups: if you're rumbled, you can retreat and hide. And there's a slow, methodical pace to it - long minutes of tension broken by sudden rushes of gratification or panic. Magic, meanwhile, has been given an incredible crackle of raw power. Emperor Palpatine would be a level one mage in Skyrim - unleashing two torrents of thrashing electrical arcs is literally the first trick you learn, and it doesn't even get you tossed into a reactor shaft. One tweak is a huge loss, though: you can't design your own spells. Oblivion's spellmaking opened up so many clever possibilities - now you're mostly restricted to what you can buy in shops. While we're on the negatives, physical combat hasn't improved much. There are cinematic kill moves when your enemy is low on health, but whether they trigger seems to be either random or dependent on whether the pre-canned animation fits into the space you're in. Too much of the time, you wave your weapon around and enemies barely react to the hits.

review: Being a fan of Bethesda games like fallout, and etc. I saw Skyrim instore and decided to give it a go, not having prior knowledge of previous elder scrolls game i jumped in the metaphorical deep end that was Elder scrolls Lore. I was greeted with a carriage ride towards certain death by Imperial dogs and then saved by the Antagonist of the series as he appeared in the nick of time before my head was about to get a swift decapitation. That my friends...As an intro for a video game is one i can respect, having the Antagonist save you and have your Decision to either follow a Stormcloak or an Imperial immediately challenged is really intresting to see how the game can piece it all together. As i said before i had no prior knowledge of Elder scrolls lore so as i played through the game reading the hundreds of books I learnt more about the lore and who i was. The Game itself had really beautiful visuals, the characters don't stare at you anymore like you have a piece of sweetroll left on your mouth and the background moves freely as you speek to NPC's. The story itself keeps you immersed in the world and has you on edge. The DLC's further increase the story with extra weapons, Dragon Shouts, enemies, lands and BLAH BLAH and you learn that Skyrim is just a baby considering the huge land of Tamriel. Long story short Skyrim has a really awesome plot and can keep you addicted for hours, learning all the mechanics of the game, even installing thousands of mods like weapons, armor or Skimpy armor for the female characters (If thats the way you play) or even a magic spell that turns people into chickens is Pardon my french F**ken awesome. The game can get very stale and boring if you play it too much, but the dlc's and mods help to keep the game fresh

review: Skyrim Is probably the most Beautiful Elder Scrolls games ever, and one of the best games ever. The map is fun to explore with many different characters to fall in love with. Its one of the only games I enjoy levelling up my Miscellanious skills (Blacksmithing speech etc.) You Are not a gamer if you never played a tleast one of the Elder scrolls games , so If you haven't, Skyrim is the place to Start. Although, not even a year after buying the game I found that I was heavily relying on different mods and DLC. The story is basically the same no matter what and even though there are some small choices, there isn't a lot for an RPG. The choices all lead to the same out come (just some different dialogue).

review: This is hands down one of the greatest RPG's of all time..... The Elder Scrolls V has proven to still be one of the finest pieces of art Bethesda has published and is still proven to be a masterpeice nearly two years on. Whether you quest for weapons, armour or just seek adventure this game has it all. In terms of gameplay, while the combat may be seen in some eyes as 'crap', there are many mods available on the workshop to tweak your game to perfection. The PC edition runs much quicker than PS3/XBOX and is greatly obtimised. Loading times are minimal and even old computers can run this game fine which is incredible considering the sheer magnitude of the game. Sadly this game is only singleplayer but don't let that get to you. Talking about it with your friends is just as good :) You will never get bored with the simply hundereds of quests to complete. Perhaps you can make personal quests for finding mighty armour or slaying some annoying beasts. Maybe you just want to use a dragon shout to knock a giant off a cliff. Anything is possible. This game has proven to be in my top 3 favourite games ever made (which is saying something. I have A LOT of games). The game is cheaper than ever on steam and has such an amazing community helping out by making and testing mods, giving feedback ect. This game certainly is playable without mods (you are not obliged :D) however, there is something in the workshop for everyone. James Wood-Dedicated Nord with a big sword.

review: An immersive adventure that once you start your journey, you're likely not to stop for a very long time. Your path will be rife with bandits, vampires and their thralls, draugr, and of course; dragons. The fifth installment of The Elder Scrolls series does not disappoint with its sandbox atmosphere and myriads of modding capabilities. There exists a modification for almost every facet of Skyrim, enhancing your medieval experience. Skyrim is one of the crown jewels of my game collection and rightly so. There is so much pure content in this game, it is excusable for the tens of hours that it will take from you. Some may describe it as a timesink, but it is well worth it because for every hour you commit to the game, it takes you further along in your journey and leaves you aching for more. Skyrim is undoubtably one of the best games its generation, setting a precedent for future games that strive to outdo what it achieves. Skyrim is the one to beat. The score for the game is also fantastic, full of astoundingly great work by Jeremy Soule. The music that accompanies the events is very period; it goes perfectly with the atmosphere of Skyrim. Your heart will literally be left pumping as you fight dragons to the sound of One They Fear or Watch The Skies. And the music of Sovngarde gives a perfect tone to the afterlife of the Nords. Overall, Skyrim deserves all of the positive acclaim that it garners. It is setting a standard in the gaming world. And renewing the belief in myself that perhaps there is still hope for storytelling in video games. Pros: + Hours upon hours of gameplay. When you think you're done, you're not. + Customization. Great character customization, and with mods it reinforces this tenfold. + Modability + Skill System + No Classes + Dialogue between NPCs. There are always things going on. Cons: - Initial game physics are a little irritating in places. - At first, it was difficult to find where I was going on the map, but this may have been an individual issue. - So much to do that you don't know what to do. My main gripe. xD

A pleasantly brief introduction sets up the plot: Skyrim is in the middle of a revolt, you've been sentenced to death, and dragons have just shown up. Good luck! At that point, you emerge from a cave into 40 square kilometres of cold and mountainous country, and that's it. Everything else is up to you. Even after spending hundreds of hours in Morrowind and Oblivion, the sense of freedom in Skyrim is dizzying. The vast mountains in every direction make the landscape seem limitless, and even after exploring it for 55 hours, this world feels huge and unknown on a scale neither of the previous two games did. Not all of the landscape is subzero, and even among the frosty climes there's an exciting variety: ice caverns that tinkle with dripping frost crystals, hulking mountains with curls of snow whipped up by the howling wind, coniferous forests in rocky river valleys. The mountains change everything. Wherever you decide to head, your journey is split between scrambling up treacherous rocks and skidding down heart-stopping slopes. The landscape is a challenge, and travel becomes a game. It's hard to walk for a minute in any direction without encountering an intriguing cave, a lonely shack, some strange stones, a wandering traveller, a haunted fort. These were sparse and quickly repetitive in Oblivion, but they're neither in Skyrim: it's teeming with fascinating places, all distinct. It was 40 hours before I blundered into a dungeon that looked like one I'd seen before, and even then what I was doing there was drastically different. These places are the meat of Skyrim, and they're what makes it feel exciting to explore. You creep through them with your heart in your mouth, your only soundtrack the dull groan of the wind outside, to discover old legends, dead heroes, weird artefacts, dark gods, forgotten depths, underground waterfalls, lost ships, hideous insects and vicious traps. It's the best Indiana Jones game ever made. The dragons don't show up until you do the first few steps of the game's main quest, so it's up to you whether you want them terrorising the world as you wander around. A world where you can crest a mountain to find a 40-foot flying lizard spitting jets of ice at the village below is a much more interesting one to be in. But fighting them never changes much: you can just ignore them until they land, then shoot them from a distance when they do. Your first dragon kill is a profound, weird moment. I rushed to the crashed carcass to loot it, then looked up. The whole town had come out to stand around and stare at the body, a thing as vast and alien to them as a T-rex in a museum. I tried shooting an ice bolt at it, just to demonstrate it was dead, and the force unexpectedly catapulted the whole thing violently into the distance. A beggar looked at me and said, "Oh sure, just throw your trash around." Your character gets better at whatever you do: firing a bow, sneaking up on people, casting healing spells, mixing potions, swinging an axe. There's always been an element of this practice-based system in Elder Scrolls games, but in Skyrim it's unrestricted - you don't have to decide what you're going to focus on when you create your character, you can just let it develop organically. That alone would feel a little too hands-off, but you also level up. When that happens, you get a perk point: something you can spend on a powerful improvement to a skill you particularly like. Every hour, you're making a major decision about your character's abilities. They're dramatic. The first point you put into Destruction magic lets you stream jets of flame from your hands for twice as long as before. As you continue to invest in one skill, you can get more interesting tweaks: I now have an Archery perk that slows down time when I aim my bow, and one for the Sneak skill that lets me do a stealthy forward roll. Again, the freedom is dizzying: every one of 18 skills has a tree of around 15 perks, and the range of heroes you could build is vast. I focused on Sneak to the point of absurdity - now I'm almost invisible, and I get a 3,000% damage bonus for backstabs with daggers. It's the play style I've always wanted in an RPG, but I've never been able to achieve it before. The enemies you encounter are, in some cases, generated by the game to match the level of your character. In Oblivion that sometimes felt like treading water: progress was just a stat increase, and your enemies kept pace. That doesn't apply now that your character is defined more by his or her perks, because the way you play is always changing. Levelled content is also just used less: at level 30, my most common enemies are still bandits with low-level weapons. And I still run into things too dangerous for me to tackle. Taking a narrow mountain path to a quest, something stops me in my tracks: a dragon roar. I check the skies - nothing, but I hear it again three more times before the peak. At the top I find a camp full of bodies, with a large black bear roaring over them. Hah. He's still more than I can handle in straight combat, but as he reaches me I use a Dragon Shout. It befriends any animal instantly, and he saunters casually away. Feeling slightly guilty, I stab him in the back before it wears off. Which is when the dragon lands, with an almighty crash, six feet from my face. I run. A roar of frozen air catches me in the back, but I keep going - over a ridge, down a short drop, and straight into a bandit. I dodge the bandit, straight into a Flame Atronarch. There are five more bandits behind it. The dragon is airborne. I throw myself off the mountain, several hundred metres into the river below. I plummet to the riverbed, and swim until I run out of breath. When I surface, the sky is alight with fireballs and flaming arrows, the dragon is spewing a stream of ice down on the bandits, and I'm laughing. The stealthy character I built in Skyrim would have been less fun in Oblivion. Whether you were detected was a binary and erratic matter. Skyrim cleverly gives you an on-screen indication of how suspicious your enemies are, and where they are as they hunt for you. It makes stealth viable even against large groups: if you're rumbled, you can retreat and hide. And there's a slow, methodical pace to it - long minutes of tension broken by sudden rushes of gratification or panic. Magic, meanwhile, has been given an incredible crackle of raw power. Emperor Palpatine would be a level one mage in Skyrim - unleashing two torrents of thrashing electrical arcs is literally the first trick you learn, and it doesn't even get you tossed into a reactor shaft. One tweak is a huge loss, though: you can't design your own spells. Oblivion's spellmaking opened up so many clever possibilities - now you're mostly restricted to what you can buy in shops. While we're on the negatives, physical combat hasn't improved much. There are cinematic kill moves when your enemy is low on health, but whether they trigger seems to be either random or dependent on whether the pre-canned animation fits into the space you're in. Too much of the time, you wave your weapon around and enemies barely react to the hits.

review: One of the most beautiful, immersive and epic games of all time. In fact, it's THE most. There are no contenders. It almost feels like a waste of time recommending Skyrim, because anyone with a machine capable of playing it is likely to have done so already. Some of the mods are also well worth installing if your setup can run them, including retextures, graphics extenders and more detailed character creation. Goodbye real world, Tamriel is much more appealing!

review: This is without hesitation the best game I have ever played. The feeling, the atmosphere, the beauty, the harsh cold, the dragons, the music, everything! It's just a 10/10 game that you can play for years continuously without getting bored because there's so much to do. You can roleplay and do like a village-live sort of thing (my God, do I love doing that), you can be a trading merchant, buy a horse, be an adventurer (which the game is all about, of course), become a vampire, a werewolf, a thief, an assassin. You can go to Sovngarde, where all the nords who died in battle go, slay dragons, you can basically do anything you can imagine in this game. I recommend getting the Dragonborn and Hearthfire DLC for this game aswell as they add alot of really fun and cool stuff to the game. If you are a RPG fan then this game is without a doubt the game for you.

review: Skyrim is probably one of my favorite games of all time. This open-world fantasy game is the fifth installment in the known and loved Elder Scrolls series. After playing Elder Scrolls three and four (Morrowind and Oblivion), I absolutely had to get this game when it first came out. In any case, this game was so amazing that when I got the Elder Scrolls Anthology, I literally made a new steam account for it. Which is this account..... This is now my primary account. There is so much I could talk about with this game, but I wanna focus on these things: The Evolved Combat System This new open world to explore Playing how you want to The Evolved Combat System: Since the previous Elder Scrolls games, the combat system in Skyrim had highly evolved. It sorta ties in with the last topic I wanna hit. This is because of how much freedom is given to the player with the combat system. Skyrim introduced a dual wielding system, this allows the player to use two single-handed weapons at once, as well as two spells, staves, and so on. This brought a huge change and costumization theme to the game. How one wants to fight is now more based on their preferences. I feel like this is a big step up from being locked into a sword and a shield in Oblivion. The only annoying thing about this, is the fact that one cannot wield a spell as well as two other things at one time anymore. I understand why this was done, but it resembles more of a step back than a step forward. Moving on.... Open World Exploration: The world of Skyrim is packed with content, and cannot be completed easily. There is so much to this world. Tundras, Caves, Mountains, Forests, Plains, Volcanoes (Dragonborn DLC), and so on. That's not all. These places are usually packed with careful detail, and are made to be visually appealing. Skyrim is generally a visually appealing game, because of its nice graphics and attention to detail. Anyways, back to the main point. Skyrim is full of quests, factions, and things to do. There is no way to finish all the in-game quests in one play through. Many decisions alter what quests you can recieve, and this makes the game quite replayable. The game also does not punish you for exploring and fooling around on the vast lands of Skyrim. Mods are also available for Skyrim, expanding it quite nicely along with its original content. In any case, this game won't get boring for a while. Play like you want to: Skyrim is one of the only games to truly give a player freedom over many things. In Skyrim, making a character to suit your playstyle is not hard. In fact, player customization is a big part of the game. Being able to choose what you want, and how you want it is one of the things that makes this game a masterpiece. With classes removed, the player doesn't have to pick a certain skill set and stay with it. They can choose what they want and design something customized for themselves. Also changing a character to become a different kind is easy. If you choose to make your character one way, you can still go back and change it whenever you feel like it. The amount of freedom given to the player in this game is far greater than in any other game. It's amazing. Get this game. You won't regret it.

review: Skyrim is glorious. Yes. It is. My first character has logged almost 300 hours into the game. On my first playthrough. I have to admit that this is the first Elder Scrolls game I actually sat through from start to finish and attempted to explore every single cave, location and gather as many books as possible. I love books. A lot. They are great. My entire playthrough was livestreamed on Twitch.tv and looking back there are a lot of fond memories that I have created during my time spent in Skyrim. The storyline is enjoyable, but over too quickly. So being the type of gamer I am, I did as many side quests as I could before progressing further into the game. That way it felt like a longer journey and it wasn't over so fast. That's how I play. Skyrims visuals are standard at this day and age. Mods really do kick up the visuals and make them look beautiful, with ENB, HD retextures and added visual features which highlight the fact that it's the modding community which have made Skyrim what it is today. I played Skyrim on a vanilla playthrough but I realised I could not do without a couple of mods to fix the game in order to make it playable. (Combat music fix, skyrim script extender, Skryim User Interface i.e. SkyUI etc). Anyhow, I digress. The gameplay is very addictive, crafting is enjoyable as is upgrading weapons. Enchantment is BRILLIANT and exploration is a solid 10/10. Yes, I loved exploring Skyrim as the world offers so many new things to see. Please, buy this game. It's always on sale and definitely worth it. The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim along with all of the DLC installed makes this a truly great RPG, one which you will keep coming back to play all the time :)

review: The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim A game with a kickass story that you probably won't get around to finishing until you've finished fooling around with cheese wheel avalanches, sweetroll robberies and a lot of random murders. Yes..random murders. A game where modding addiction is a real serious thing. Seriously. I tried to pick up a spoon at home, subconsciously trying to press E and i realized that i was nowhere near my damn PC and this was the real life. The game alone, how it was made and despite all the bugs, is very enjoyable. You can sink a ton of hours just looking around, exploring, immersing yourself in the skyrim environment and the radiant quests. Character customization is better than it was in Oblivion but can be further enhanced by mods. Basically the whole vanilla experience of Skyrim is superb and it is improved by the addition of mods. The Voice acting cast seems to have expanded as compared to Oblivion. The guards still assume someone stole my sweetroll. There is apparently a sweetroll thief on the loose. There isn't much else to say. Its a great game. If this review isn't enough to convince you to get the game, watch a few playthroughs, read more reviews, ask your friends, ask their friends, ask strangers on the internet and then decide. If that is still not enough or you just don't wanna pay full price (that is completely understandable by the way.) Wait for a good sale but i tell you, it is well worth full retail price. 10/10 I am no longer considered criminal scum. Now I am that which has committed crimes against Skyrim and her people.

review: This game, is a work of art. the minuscule detail gone into this game from the very start. Books containing history of tamriel, exchanges to and from little people. Even the character configuration allows for major tweaking. The map is massive, the combat system easy to master, and the AIs of enemys is amazing. Skyrim, is bethesda at its finest, the sheer content keeps one such as myself entertained for hours, and the DLCs even more. From experience Id recommend hearthfire to begginners. But this is a review of Skyrim, not hearthfire. Id reccommend this game to any RPG player. Even people who play fps games like COD will love this game, and the sheer beauty is overwhelming. In the end, it doesnt matter who you are, teenager, adult or spoilt child with bad parents, YOU WILL LOVE SKYRIM.

review: A game about how Chuck Norris thought it would be great to go back to the Lord of the Ring era and steal all the rings from Smaug and all of Smaug's relatives while killing most of them in the process [minor spoilers]. After he does this for a bit, he then finds himself riding his trusty mammoth whilst being chased by 3 giants who were upset that Chuck killed their brother by punching him in the kneecap. Later in the game, Norris finds himself running at 30 Nordic miles per hour with a mere 567 pounds-worth of swords, bows, and other equipment stored in his pockets when all of the sudden he is attacked by a miniature chicken, which he proceeds to yell at and send it straight into orbit; unfortunately this ticks off all of the mages of the town he is in and when one of the sorcerer's spell is cast slightly incorrectly, Chuck Norris gets sent back into the 80's. After the credits roll you see Chuck Norris talking to Will Smith about his tales and about how his life got turned upside down, but how he didn't really mind it since he became the well-known prince of a moderately-sized rural town known simply as "Bel-Air." Smith later decided (with the help of some producers) to recreate these amazing stories in his well-known show "The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air," which first aired in 1990 and is still held dear by many patriotic Americans due to the deep and meaningful message of the show. 11/10 would witness this glory with Hyper-Realism 4000 (TM) textures again.

review: Aahh.... perhaps a little too late for this game's review but nevertheless. The Elder Scrolls series, a wonder of RPG games in the years. I've started the series with Oblivion when I saw it in a Cyber Cafe a few years back and see all the classic Table Top RPG element inside it. I thoroughly enjoyed the game of course and cannnot wait for Skyrim to come out, which was announced a few month after my discovery of Oblivion. Firstly, I was expecting its mechanism to stay but was a little disappointed in its simplicity instead. Everything is too simplified and for the NPCs.... the only good thing about them is their quests and nothing more, despite their somewhat colourful personalities. The role-playing this time focuses a lot on quests instead of a more broad purpose. It would seem that Skyrim is made for its combat system, which was never a strong part in the Elder Scroll series in my opinion and is not so impressive in here either. Swing, swing, occasional block and such. However, the finishing blow is admittingly the best thing to do in combat. Skyrim's environment however is what really makes it beautiful. To be able to explore the province of Skyrim in its fullest, Fast Travel is almost going to be unused.... almost. All in all, it is a good adventure game despite lacking in its Role-Playing.

review: I was only lv 4. Bow in hand, I was sneaking up on Valtheim Towers. The one bandit guard lazily gazed at a cliff face. I snuck closer. Suddenly, the bandit yells out; "I'm going to enjoy looting your corpse!" My heart stops. Have I been seen? Will she cut me up? She runs away from me. Before I can react, the locked doors burst open. An orc sprints out, sword in hand, and he yells; "I'm going to enjoy counting your coin!" He sprints off in the same direction as the bandit guard. I sneak up on the tower- the doors spread wide open- and peek around the corner out of curiosity. The two bandits are on one side of the river, shouting threats; on the other side, a lone rabbit, busy not caring in the slightest about what's happening. There's a third bandit, an archer, on the ridge above the rabbit. He fires arrow after arrow, missing every time. I slowly sneak into the tower, dismantling every trap and carefully checking for loot. I finally arrive on the bridge. From below, I hear a shouted threat; the rabbit is still alive- but not for long. After a solid ten minutes of being all talk, one of the bandits is finally swimming across the river to finish off the rabbit and take its phat loot. She corners the rabbit, and with a quick slice, it's over. She begins swimming back to her post. I pull out my bow. With the bandit in my sights, I release an arrow. "This is for the bunny..." I whisper. In slow motion, the arrow arcs majestically through the air towards the bandit. Boom, right in the heart. In the middle of the river. Her body floats over a waterfall. 10/10 GOTY

review: I feel the biggest problem with this game is that the primary gameplay feature is exploration, except the world levels up as your character does. This includes the loot that you find as you adventure, so there are very few opportunities to find something interesting as you explore. There are a few locations that yield neat gear, like the Daedric shrines, but overall I find that this is one of the biggest problems with this type of RPG lately: you will always be fighting something your level and they will always drop something level appropriate. This mechanic dissolves the feeling of tension that should be part of exploring the unknown. The story arc also ramps up to epic levels too quickly, denying any feeling of having earned any prestige. I prefer the slow burn of something like Morrowind, where your humble beginnings provide context for your climb to becoming a mythical figure. I also find that there is too little diversity in the types of spells you can cast, and the melee mechanics. For a game that deals so much with swordplay, the melee feels vague and the crash of combat lacks any sense of feedback. The ragdoll physics also feel weightless; bodys are merely hollow forms with no mass that sail through the air before sliding down the rugged landscape like greased sleds. These issues often turn a serious high fantasy adventure into an unintentional comedy. I'm not saying that this is a bad game by any means, in fact I strongly recommend it. However, when I compare the story arc and game mechanics to something like Fallout 3, I feel like alot of the intelligence and pacing was replaced with instant gratification so the game would better appeal to the average joe. In closing, comparing Skyrim to Morrowind feels like comparing Dragon Age: Origins to Baldur's Gate 2. One is visually superior, but all of that visual polish can not make up for removing the features and stoytelling that provide so much richness to the experience.

review: Oh Skyrim, with your wondrous landscapes and your lovely wildlife and inhabitants. Skyrim is an excellent game with SO much to do. Become a thief, a warrior, anything you wanna be. You can do all the quests you want or go around each town and slaughter everyone. The possibilities are (relatively) endless. My only qualm about the game is the menu system in-game. It seems a little clunky at times and annoying having to scroll through heaps of items sometimes just to get one thing. Luckily there are mods out there for that, and I definitely recommend them should you feel the same way

review: Of all the games I play.. this is the one that always has a cozy fire and a hot cup of steaming chocolate ready to welcome me back. It's the game that welcomes me with a big friendly smile and open arms. Even when I keep playing away it says, 'come on home' and gives me a nice warm hug. It must surely be the best game of all time. I don't know if I will ever finish it - but then, I don't really want to. I have it both on PS3 and here on PC. I have restarted it several times playing different characters. It has not dated at all, in no small part due to a large modding community, many HD updates and a friendly community. There must be more mods for this game than there are devious politicians. If you don't already own it you need to correct the error of your ways immediately or expect to be disciplined! You know who you are and you know you want it. Should you get the legendary edition? Look into my eyes, what do you think. Just say "Yes Miss"

Want to eat twenty 10 pound cheese wheels with no ill effects at once... THEN DO It my friends. This is the game for you! For you will get sucked into the world of wonder where you can do so much you wished in your life. Sleep standing?! Posh! WHO needs sleep!! You can run for weeks, and never tire!! You can become a Werewolf or Vampire... Once you destroy the Sun you never have to worry about the pesky burning feeling. FISHING!!!!!!!!!! ITs all in this game.

review: Bethesda is a game company that knows what the f*ck they are doing. In a time where game creators are scrambleing for the newest thing like new hit boxes, new guns, dlc's just to play the game, sh*tty dialoge, stupid plots. Bethesda comes out of the middle of butt f*uck no where and shows them all up. Its like Bethesda actually wants you to have fun in this game They want you to like the story. They want you to get involved with the world that they created. They want you to have fun, because god forebid that new games cant do that! And I am just sitting here with my mouth open in awe at what I am looking at. This game really shows what happens when game creators take time and hell even THOUGHT AND EFFORT into making there game. Ok, now that Ive kissed Bethesda a*s. Lets talk about the game. Skyrim is a game set back in....I dunno. And you start off as a prisoner who has been captured for following a cult who is agianst the system of Skyrim. You escape because a dragon is like," dont worry bro, I got you." and blows up the place right before you get almost get beheaded....I am still going to kill that dragon though. Then the rest is a journey that you decide. What I like about this game: 1.The action is amazing. Everything seems smooth and up to date even though this game came out in like 2012. 2. The story is rich and it just keeps on going and going. 3.There are plenty of missions and hours of gameplay. 4. The characthers sometimes are funny and the voice acting is fairly decent. 5. ITS ONLY 5 GB....HOLY S*IT!!!!!! F*ckin, sleeping dogs is 13 gb and they dont even have half as much of story as this does. 6. I can run it on my sh*tty computer...with the graphics down but whatever. 7. EVERYTHING! Now for the bad things: 1. It glitches from time to time but Bethesda does that with there xbox to computer games. And thats it for the bad. Just please god, if you havent played it. GET IT RIGHT NOW My Gaming Score: 10 SkyrimGasms/ 10. I still like Ride to Hell Retrubution better, though. (jking that game is )

review: Okay I can tell you that if you have played Oblivion you would have most likely gone for this game aswell if you liked it or if you are not sure or want to know what they changed here's what has changed, the oblivion main quest was absoultely brilliant and this one...well it is not as good but there more features and some new creatures at the cost of old ones and there are some satisfying killmoves in the game that make you feel more like you just killed them - you destroyed them! However some of the quests in this are quite bland and far to rewarding for the task E.g spoke to a guy in a bar and started a quest for him to deliver a message or something and the person he wanted it sent to was sat right next to him - no joke - and I got 250 gold for it, in Oblivion you would have to slay a  entire town full of imperial guards (oblivion version) to get that kind of money so half of the time in Oblivion I would become right criminal scum and would try pickpocketing, search barrels for anything to sell and would be over the moon finding 1 gold coin because cave raiding was certain doom for low levels and people of bad equipment in skyrim finding a gold coin is like finding a free potato, you may not need it but will still take it and add to the forgotten pile. What they did right: - made it easier to level up in skyrim (you could only level up on certain skills you picked on oblivion if your alchemy went up but was only a minor skill, well tough  you are staying level 12) - Guards are much easier to defeat (in Oblivion if you stole a potato and didn't have money or want to go to jail then be prepared to be hunted down relentlessly and cut down like the criminal scum they come across daily, also they won't randomly dart at you from a field in the middle of nowhere and question you about it) - fighting things are easier (oblivion had some really tough battles in them and at least once you would have to run away from a fight and would die at least several times if not then you are a god at Oblivion and I salute you) - civil war, choose a side and fight to the death ( gotta love getting revenge on those imperial guards if you played oblivion) - the graphics are really good ( and better with some mods) What was wrong? - The main quest is just quite bad to other titles in TES (in Oblivion you were protecting the cities from huge gates and hellish creatures and retaking cities from the evil with the town guard which feels like an achievement on its own) - There isn't as good factions or faction quests (oblivion had some really good faction quests especially with the dark brotherhood not gonna spoil but things keep flipping and so much drama happens there was also the fighters guild and mages guild and there was an arcane college but you had to get recommendations from all the guild halls in all the cities to get in which made it feel so much more challenging than just casting a spell to the woman outside.) all-in-all this game is great I have fun using a bow and other inventory I would suggest getting legendary editon for more quests and armors Etc. at the end of the day this is my opinion of the game and I find it great to play and have so much freedom to do what I want in it but try it for yourself.

review: You will get tired of this game, and eventually forget about it for a while to play others, but you will always come back. There is always something you want to do and you can't help but play a little bit here and there. Complete quests you've done half a hundred times, just because you enjoyed them, run around in your favourite dungeons and get hungry by staring at the brightly coloured food you cooked. Then you'll shout Lydia off High Hrothgar again and quit for a while longer. But you know you'll come back. You'll always come back.

It's got the lush landscapes ranging from Snowy ice caps to heated boggs, It's got the emmense gameplay that keeps you hanging on wanting to see more, and it even has the traditional Elder scrolls lag after you've downloaded too many CBBE mods. I simply love this game, and can't wait to see what else Bethesda can crap all over us to make money. Although, I'd rather play Super Mario brothers 2.

review: This game is a unbelieveable adventure, even if you haven't played the older Elders Scrolls games it doesn't matter. There are some inside jokes, that you might not understand unless you have played the older ones (Mai'q I'm looking at you). With the addition of Steam Workshop you can mod this game very easily to increase the graphical fidelity, or add more quests, although the main quest, is already excellent and the sidequest are great. The graphics on their own are good, but not great. But remember we're looking at a 2 year old game so the graphics, aren't at 2013 level. With the addition of Dawnguard and Dragonborn you can add two whole new questlines which both you can affect like the main games quests. Pros: Quests are great. Even after completing the main quest line, you will have a lot of interesting side quests. The attention to detail is amazing. The world levels with you, after you break a certain level you will see new enemies. Cons: Voice acting isn't the strongest part of this game; the same voice actors are recycled from character to character. The graphics aren't the best, but remember, we're looking at a 2011 years game.

review: Perhaps one of the most amazing games I've ever played in my life. As a lover of the sword n' shield era, I always find myself jumping head-first into Bethseda's Elder Scrolls series. The story is immense but it doesn't rush you; This game demands that you explore every crevice it has to offer. The creation-workshop mechanic is very well made, you could literally be anything, fight anything and nearly have no limits; But challenging as it should be. An extrordinary piece of work that you should not miss out on!

review: Skyrim is second only to Oblivion, and that's only because of one aspect that will probably surpass it at some time. The mods for Skyrim are good, some are even fairly amazing and world making, but it's still NOTHING compared to the amount of mods and the quality of mods for Oblivion. Skyrim is overall amazing, save for the combat (though that can be modded to a degree) and the main story lacking in any real substance besides "Kill X to make sure world doesn't end". I got my money's worth out of it, especially with the DLC (my favorite being Dawnguard). 7.5/10, would buy and play again.

review: Beautilful, Unique, and Charming... Skyrim provides better experience of this RPG open-world series. Beside the main quest and radiant sidequest which can surprise you in different events. Pretty genuis scripts and storyline lead you to new places, new conflicts, and dragons as random encounter. The level system is not new, but it has improvement and design. Places are full of mysteries, activites, and NPCs, lifefull indeed. Smithing and enchanting are deep and impact to your combat as magics and shouts are balanced and provide new tactics. I could say I'm in love with this fifth series. Even some people may face with minor bugs (For me, it just minor graphic bugs now.) Inventory system is hard to track (Fix by using Skyrim UI Mod) and problem in AI direction. All I say it just common thing in this kind of game which cant interrupt you from amazing experience. Totally worthy in every dollar/baht you paid. Whatever you are fan of series or not. Try once in your owned. :)

review: One of my favorite games of all time. The modding community is great, but the game doesn't even need it. It is a very immersive game, that doesnt restrict you on what to do when to do it. If you dont want to do a quest, you can simple ignore it. You are Dovahkiin(Dragonborn), you find that out after you fight your first dragon. The story is rather short it makes up for it in the countless hours on shenanigans and lollygagging. Your character seems unrealisticly special throughout the game. What I mean by that is you become the top of every class and yet you are still just another adventurer. The game is beautiful, and just worth your time. This game was release 11-11-11 and it still is one of the best games of the decade. The game is a must buy, even if you don't like RPG's genre. I am sure you may come out of your shell and let your inter nerd come out and become all powerful! Youre going to try to sell me something. Well, I aint interested. Olda 10/10

On PC, you can get the HD texture pack if you have a good graphics card, and turn the settings up. It looks great, and plays well. Also, there's console commands, so if you're in trouble, you can get yourself out of it. Controls in combat are a bit odd, because weapons are inverted for your mouse buttons, but i swapped them. Takes a bit of getting used to, but it's much better. You can explore and discover new places, and fight bandits in dungeons. You can create potions and armor, buy a house to store your stuff in, and take on many different quests. You can join different factions as well, even become a werewolf. Great game, would buy. If you don't have 30 bucks, wait up until it's on sale and grab legendary edition.

review: I had not played Pokemon games before--I was under the wrong impression that they were just for children and then there was a lot of media attention on Fire Red and Leaf Green--I was going on a long trip so I got Fire Red. It takes a lot of memorization skills to play Pokemon games WELL so adults can enjoy these games, in my opinion. For those who haven't played before, Pokemon are actually VERY intricate and there are different TYPES of Pokemon so you have to remember their abilities and what types can easily beat other types and you switch Pokemon in battle depending on their strengths and abilities. Of course the graphics on this game are very, very good. What I liked best was the ability to get ingame help and for some reason it just really tickles me to see the little hand pick up my Pokemon and move them to or from the storage boxes. I also like the fact that when I turn the game on it rehashes the last few things I did before stopping gameplay last time. This is really good for me because I don't get to play everyday and if too much time goes by, I do forget my last "moves". I also have Pokemon Crystal for GBC and, I think it is a little easier...so if you'd like to try Pokemon, maybe that is a better game to learn first...Both have been very fun and entertaining for this adult gamer. Gotta catch 'em all...

review: Everyone knows this is the best game ever made and if you think otherwise then you are wrong. This is an open world action RPG, It is my favourite game by far and only the next sequel can ever top it. You start off as a prisoner who's about to be beheaded, from there you create your character from a variety of different races (human or beast) There is endless customization with what you can create and how realistic you character will look if you use mods, you don't have to because without this will still be your favourite game experience ever, but i don't see why not because it's simple to download mods from the nexus with just a few clicks and if you don't want to do that then you can easily browse the workshop from your library and install mods with a click of a button, that's what has kept this game so fun for so long and it will never get boring or old. There's various factions throughout the game you can join and become leader of, you can even become a werewolf or a vampire, the characters are all unique and loveable and you can have followers and even get married to your favourite ones, You can craft armor and weapons, enchant them, upgrade them, you can create potions, you can have your own home in this game, you level up and gain skill points to build the type of character you want, you can make a perk legendary when it get's to 100 so you level endlessely, there's always a rewarding amount of loot in each cave or dungeon you clear, i could go on forever, even just standing in the town enjoying the view of the lake is enjoyable in this game! The possibilitys with this game because of mods are endless, there's no need in other games when this game has EVERYTHING you could think of Seriously you have to buy it, if you want a game you will never get bored of, be easy to go back to whenever you want, never 100% complete because there's to much to do, then buy Skyrim

review: I was stacking books on a shelf in my house in Whiterun, one of Skyrim's major cities, when I noticed a weapon rack right beside it. I set a sacrificial dagger in one slot, an Orcish mace in the other. They were on display for nobody but me and my computer-controlled housecarl, Lydia, who sat at a table patiently waiting for me to ask her to go questing. The chest upstairs was reserved for excess weapons and armor, the bedside table for smithing ingots and ores, the one next to the Alchemy table for ingredients. I'd meticulously organized my owned virtual property not because I had to, but because tending to the minutia of domestic life is a comforting break from dealing with screaming frost trolls, dragons, a civil war, and job assignments that never seem to go as planned. It's even a sensible thing to do; a seemingly natural component of every day existence in Skyrim, one of the most fully-realized, easily enjoyable, and utterly engrossing role-playing games ever made. Part of what makes it so enjoyable has to do with how legacy Elder Scrolls clutter has been condensed and in some cases eliminated. In Skyrim, there's no more moon-hopping between hilltops with a maxed out Acrobatics skill. That's gone, so is Athletics. The Elder Scrolls V pares down the amount of skills and cuts out attributes like Endurance and Intelligence altogether. There's no time wasted on the character creation screen agonizing over which skills to assign as major. You don't assign major and minor skills at all, but instead pick one of ten races, each with a specific bonus. High Elves can once a day regenerate magicka quickly, Orcs can enter a berserk rage for more effective close-range combat. These abilities are best paired with certain character builds  the High Elf regeneration is useful for a magic user  but don't represent a rigid class choice. Major decisions don't need to be made until you're already out in the world and can try out magic, sneaking and weapon combat, emphasizing first-hand experience over instruction manual study, letting you specialize only when you're ready. It contributes to the thrilling sense of freedom associated with life in Skyrim. Do a quest, kill a dragon, snatch torchbugs from the air, munch on butterfly wings or simply wander while listening to one of the best game soundtracks in recent memory. Despite the enormity of the world and the colossal amount of content contained within, little feels random and useless. Even chewing on a butterfly wing has purpose, as it reveals one of several alchemical parameters later useful in potion making at an alchemy table. Mined ore and scraps of metal from Dwemer ruins can be smelted into ingots and fashioned into armor sets, pelts lifted from slain wildlife can be turned into leather armor sets, and random books plucked from ancient ruins can trigger hidden quest lines that lead to valuable rewards. Skyrim's land mass is absolutely stuffed with content and curiosities, making every step you take, even if it's through what seems like total wilderness, an exciting one, as something unexpected often lies just over the next ridge. Many times the unexpected takes the form of a dragon. Sometimes they're purposefully placed to guard relics, sometimes they swoop over cities and attack at seemingly random times. In the middle of a fight against a camp of bandits a dragon might strike, screaming through the sky and searing foe and friendly alike with frost or flame. Momentarily all on the battlefield unite, directing arrows and magic blasts upward to knock down the creature, creating impromptu moments of camaraderie -- a surprising change from what may have been yet another by-the-numbers bandit camp sweep. Dragons show up often, their presence announced by an ominous flap of broad wings or an otherworldly scream from high above. The scale and startling detail built into each creature's appearance and animations as it circles, stops to attack, circles again and slams to the ground makes encounters thrilling, though their predictable attack patterns lessen the excitement after a few battles. In the long run they're far less irritating than the Oblivion gate equivalent from The Elder Scrolls IV, can be completed in a few minutes, and always offer a useful reward. Killing a dragon yields a soul, which powers Skyrim's new Shout system. These are magical abilities any character can use, you don't have to specialize in spell casting to slow time, throw your voice, change the weather, call in allies, blast out ice and fire, or knock back enemies with a rolling wave of pure force. Even if you favor sword, shield and heavy armor and ignore magic entirely, you'll still be able to take full advantage of these abilities provided you find the proper words  each Shout has three  hidden on Skyrim's high snowy peaks and in the depths of forgotten dungeons, serving as another reason to continue exploring long after you've exhausted the main quest story, joined with the Thieves Guild, fought alongside the Dark Brotherhood, or thrown your support behind one of the factions vying for control of Skyrim. Not only is this land under assault by dragons, long thought to be dead, it's also ripped in two by civil war. You can choose one side or the other, but so much of the allure of Skyrim is how, even outside of the confines of quest lines, the embattled state of the world is evident, and steeped in a rich fictional legacy. Lord of the Rings this is not, but with the release of every Elder Scrolls game, the fiction becomes denser, and the cross-referencing for long-time fans all the more rewarding. Skyrim's residents are all aware of current events. They'll comment on the civil war, some sympathizing with the rebels, others thinking the establishment sold its soul. The peasants complain about the Jarls who control each settlement, the Jarls complain about the rebels or foreign policy, the overprotective College librarian complains when I drop dragon scales all over his floor; many characters feel like whole, distinct personalities instead of vacuous nothings that hand out quests like a downtown greeter hands out flyers for discount jeans. Characters stereotype based on race, they double-cross at even the slightest hint it might be profitable, and they react to your evolving stature within the world. It makes a ridiculous realm, filled with computer-controlled cat people and humanoid reptiles, demon gods and dragons, feel authentic, like a world that existed long before you showed up and will continue to exist long after you leave. 10/10 frome me lads :)

It has a brilliant setup in the map layout, leveling system,a and much more! No two save files are alike. With about 10 different races to play as, there are many kinds of gameplay. And there's hundred's of side quests to do and an ENORMOUS map, It's so hard to get bored! So if you don't have this game GET IT, you're missing out.

review: So I started my latest game of Skyrim with the aim to try every single type of combat, try smithing, enchanting, alchemy and as many quests as I could find. I was going to absorb everything this game had to offer. Then my girlfriend got involved.... She decided she liked this game full of dragons, magic, swords and being a badass who could destroy it all. I was hopeful that I had finally found a game we could both play and talk about. NOPE. Her idea of playing has become sitting on the second computer chair, browsing facebook and ordering me to kill people at random. I can no longer enter any of the cities without being molestered by several angry guards and I'm pretty sure I have lost a lot of minor quest characters. This game no longer has any meaning to me. I will play again when I have rid myself of my real world companion... So that I may return in peace to my Skyrim ones

review: I've lost way too much of my life to this game. That said, I'd absolutely suggest that everyone else should do the same. Skyrim spent quite a while in production, and it shows. The world is absolutely beautiful, and the gameplay is just awesome. If you're hesitant to spend the money, I assure you that it's worth it; there are hours upon hours of content, and I'd say that it also has a good replay value.

review: Absolutely fantastic game - if it should even be refered to as a "game". A masterpiece in terms of graphic design, beautiful landscapes and carefully tinkered dungeons are just around the corner, no matter where you are. Above everything else, this game will take up so much of your time; not because of frustrating moments, but the sheer amount of gameplay that's been put into this game. Apart from the main questline, there's hundreds of other sidequests to take part in. The imersion of natrual beauty is incredible, however little can be said about NPC realism. NPCs aren't very quote "smart", as they tend to repeat the same lines continuously and grow to be quite annoying. That's just one of the few downsides about this game however, next to the glitches and awkward combat system. All in all, very great 3D RPG, to anyone who doesn't have it: get it NOW!

review: hmm Khajiit thinks Obilvion was better............. Anyhow Skyrim is still a great game plus a great modding community. Compared to the previous 2 games Skyrim is a little lacking in quest writing, varienty in enemies, bright vibrant colour scheeme is gone. I prefer the leveling system of say Fallout or Oblivion more but there is nothing wrong with it works well. The main quest is alright was never really that excited about any of the quests in it though and that brings me to my next point. Many quests are dull in this game usually go get this or go kill that same with most other rpgs but there are no variety in eneimes to go kill or items you go get and the diolauge makes me not even want to help these people. The diolauge in this game is something to be desired you will find that most people are  in Skyrim. Most conversations and quest givers other than the main quest or faction quests are just dull, and leave me not wanting to help these people except for the reward. In comparison to Oblivion where I accually wanted to help these quest givers out because the diolauge was written like they needed the help badly in some cases. The items you go get are usually just the same model of sword or weapon already in the game like iron, or steel etc. just with a different name. The faction quests are pretty good wish they were longer and more drawn out. Joining the Companions and being harbrindger one week later seems kind of unrealstic and breaks the immersion I tad bit. A better system would be like Oblvions where you had 2 quest givers in different cities and you had to wait sometime inbetween a quest for both of them and a larger quest from someone higher up in the guild. The civil war questline is meh. Its fun for maybe the first seige but its the same thing over and over again go take this fort. and after it is over does not really change anything except jarls. A joinable thalmor faction could be really fun (as Khajiit and High Elves are my two favorite races I like the Thalmor) but both factions play the exact same and its the same fort taking mission over and over again not that great. Dragons! The most wanted feature in a TES game well they are cool at first. They will quickly become a nusince as you progress and beat the mainquest. When you beat the main quest dragon spawns are at their highest spawning. People who walk everywhere will quickly start to fast travel as stopping every 5 minutes to fight the same dragon battle over and over again. Dragon battles provide little diversity in between dragons except how stong they are or if they breathe fire or ice. but they all behave the same. I eventually just downloaded passive dragons mod and only faught the dragons I wanted to/had to. Level Design is better in most areas I did not find that the cities to be that fun to explore but thats manly because poeple are dull to talk to. The cities look very good and are fine even if some are rather small. In caves and other dungeons the alternate exits usually hidden but not hard to find are nice to save from backtracking. The caves are sort of linear not going to aruge that its bad the ones in prvious games were also pretty linear. Dwemer ruins are not linear however, they are massive and easy to get lost in I know I have and as the level map leaves something to be desired It is sometimes easy to get lost. Combat is the concept of all all Modern TES games hack and slash. My only issue with combat is that it is easy. I hardly ever died on my first playthrough on normal its just not hard. I know play on Master with a more hardcore combat mod and that provides an adquit challenge in some parts. On the plus side combat is a lot more balanced for the user if you want to be an all caster or mage guy you can do it if you want to be an archer you can in skyrim. In oblvion do to what I think was a more difficult game It was hard to just be a mage or an archer. none of my only magic classes ever worked out as they are just to weak when eneimes get close. Archer can work later on when stealth is up there in level. In skyrim I found that magic is more excesible for most spells. Spells are lacking though there is not near close to amount of spells in skyrim as there was in oblivion (not that you could cast many of these spells) and morrowind. which is sad but they were not really needed. Stealth is just as overpowered as Oblvion haha. When your stealh gets past 50 you will hardly ever have to fight again if you so choose. In my opinion stealth should be more realistic with higher damage done to enimies but if you shoot someone they should always be on alert and be actvily looking for you, since their buddy just got shot they are not going to say must have been hearing things and get back to their normal activites. I get that this is not a stealth game it was just a suggestion to make stealth more interesting and challenging. Leveling. Leveling is streamlined in skyirm. you no longer have skills like willpower strength endurance, and the others from oblvion. Instead you have health staimnia or magicka.kind of dummed down but it works. Than you have your skills like one handed, two handed, archery, light armour, heavy armour, stealth, crafting, enchanting and there is more. every time you level you get one point to spend in any of these trees to unlock new ablities. The problem with this system is that some skill trees are just useless. I have never put a point in enchanting, pickpocketing, whatever that persuaion speechcraft one is. There is just no use since I have never enchanted an item in skyrim in all my hours of playnig it. Enchanting could be usefull if combined with spellcrafting. Spellcrafting is gone from oblivion. Spellcrafting wasnt very usefll except for creating spells that do nothing to power level your charaters magic ablities. But it was fun and a good feature to try to find the right combination of spell the problem with it in oblivion was soul gem limitation though. With skyrims better magic system or more powerfull magic system that feature could have shined. I am still mixed on the magic takes hands to use for mage charaters I do not have a problem with it but you have to hotkey your shield or the spell so you can go back to blocking if you say were healing yourself, which is a little inconvientient on the difficulty I play on but it works amazingly for casting spells the dual wielding spells is just fun and the fact that it makes the spell even more powerfull or combining two spells is a really great feautre. DLC The DLC expansions are great they both offer more weapons and armour, quests, and more eneimes to slay. Hearthfire is a little lacking but for the price it sales at its not bad. Its cool building your house ingame but as have used the Construction set to build houses or castles before It is not needed for me. Otherwise good DLC in the way DLC should be released as expansions that add alot of good content not tiny little packs of say a weapon set. In summery the lesser diolauge, poor quest writing, less varitey, and other minor gripes makes in my opinion Oblivion to be the better game. in my opinion enviroments look better in Oblivion while not high texture the bright and vibrant colours makes Oblivion just more fun for me to explore. While not game breaking to skyrim the dark colour scheme that many games today are adopting is just dull with a greyish tint. Sure mods fix this but this was a review or vanilla game. Skyrim is still a good game with 300 plus hours I still have not done everything the game and the DLCs have to offer. And with close 170 mods installed it adds even more content for me to enjoy and for everyone to enjoy. really big thanks to bethesda for continuing the excelent mod support. The construction set is great and easy to use, and I thank you for that. 9/10

review: I love this game. Its simple beauty lies in the amount of control the player has over how they play. Skyrim is a different game for each person, whether you like to play as a mage, a warrior, or a thief. With seemingly never-ending quests and objectives, you'll never grow bored of this game, because even if you can't find anything more to do, creating a new character creates an entirely new game and a new series of adventures. Trust me when I say it's really hard to get tired of this game. To top it off, the graphics are amazing, and Bethesda's new engine is gentle even to some underpowered systems. I can't recommend this game enough.

review: I can kill gods and demons that have lived for millenia with nothing more than a spoon that I stole from an elderly couple, but I can't kill the scantily-clad woman that works at the mill with the most powerful greatsword in existence. Though I must admit, no satisfaction is equal to the feeling of achievement when you lure a Draugr Death Overlord to the edge of a cliff and subsequently yell at them; causing the Death Overlord to be catapulted to their splattery death hundreds of meters below. Or perhaps when you sneak up behind a merchant, carefully reach into their back pocket and pull out the person's skull and heart, only to then sell said organs back to the merchant because they're a merchant. 10/10 best shouting simulator in Tamriel.

review: This game is a unbelieveable adventure, even if you haven't played the older Elders Scrolls games it doesn't matter. There are some inside jokes, that you might not understand unless you have played the older ones (Mai'q I'm looking at you). With the addition of Steam Workshop you can mod this game very easily to increase the graphical fidelity, or add more quests, although the main quest, is already excellent and the sidequest are great. The graphics on their own are good, but not great. But remember we're looking at a 2 year old game so the graphics, aren't at 2013 level. With the addition of Dawnguard and Dragonborn you can add two whole new questlines which both you can affect like the main games quests. Pros: Quests are great. Even after completing the main quest line, you will have a lot of interesting side quests. The attention to detail is amazing. The world levels with you, after you break a certain level you will see new enemies. Cons: Voice acting isn't the strongest part of this game; the same voice actors are recycled from character to character. The graphics aren't the best, but remember, we're looking at a 2011 years game.

review: I first played this game on xbox 360 and completed the entire game and DLC. I then purchased it on my computer and have had an absolutely wonderful experience on my second play through. I have over 200 hours of game time into modding alone and still havent finished the main quest. The modding community has put the game into the beyond ps4 era if you have the hardware. I have nothing but good remarks and can honestly say this may be my favorite game of all time (Zelda is a close second). If your on the fence with this one, delve into Skyrim because you can make this game better than anything that will come out in the next five years if you have the patience and determination. Don't believe it, check out my screenshots.

review: Still one of the best RPG's you can get! Got a total playtime of over 600h and still can't get enough of it. Graphic is with the HD Textures and mods amazing. The Mod community is just great and if the normal game bores you, you can always get some amazing mods and the game will be as amazing like when you played it for the first time!

review: Ever dreamt about a fantasy novel coming alive, without the really cheap plastic weapons and bag cg effects, that is what Skyrim is to me, a world I wish I could live in. We waited a long time for Skyrim but it was worth it, the Elder Scrolls series never fails to take over your life, anyone who games has to play Skyrim, even if they are a FPS monkey it has to be tried.

review: Once all the hype died down and I started replaying Skyrim I noticed a lot of flaws with the game that weren't apparent to me when I initially played it. While the gameplay of Skyrim is a necessary improvement over Oblivion and Fallout it just lacks a lot of depth that even Oblivion had. The lack of classes really makes every character you play as feel similar, and the lack of restrictions or stats means you can play a Thief in heavy armor and justify it by the game just not caring. Indeed the questlines are interesting the first time around but the lack of the ability to fail them or indeed decide an alternate route makes them really tedious the second or third time. It makes them feel very shallow, and it doesn't help there's only maybe 7 of them before you are automatically promoted to the head of the specific guild you joined. The game's pretty great the first time you play it but I really don't look upon Skyrim as well as I used to. The shallow content really rings true once you've tried replaying the game and the interesting dungeon aesthetic only points out how you go in a straight line in all of them.

review: Although I only recently purchased skyrim, I must thank a good friend of mine to give me his copy. I accumulated over 600hrs since 2012, and I had to buy the game for myself. Skyrim is not without its flaws, suffering from a bland main plot and some bugs. But this is one of those games that you will never put down. Like all other Elder Scrolls games, the world and lore is giant and immersive. After completed the main storyline quickly, I was a little disappointed. The main storyline leaves much to be desired, but that is not what kept me playing Skyrim. There are multiple story arcs that you may complete that do not necessarily contribute to the main storyline, some are great, others are tetius. I only put maybe 30hrs into the main storyline, and after that is when Skyrim really begins to shine. Exploring Skyrim is amazing, reading lore, discovering dwemer ruins, participating in a civil war, it never gets old. At this point, modding is a great idea. Installing an ENB makes it look better than some games released in late 2013, mods that add quests and expand on the world, with mods the game is truly endless. I will never stop playing Skyrim. 9.5 Near Perfect.

review: I Believe that the Elder Scrolls: Skyrim is one of the best games I've ever played. This game has An unlimited amount of detail, fun, and story. Even more counting the DLC and the Steam Workshop. This game can easily top many games that will be made in the future that are "supposedly" more advanced. Whenever a new open world RPG is released they just do the same thing that Skyrim does but with less detail. I hope the next sequels of the Elder Scrolls franchise will maintain the Fantastic feel as the one you get playin Skyrim.

review: Well, first of all this is a review, meaning it's my personal, subjective opinion of this game. So please keep that in mind before attempting to make a negative comment with bad language. Thanks. Second to mention, this game is absolutely overrated and overhyped. The Good: - Even on my not-so-leet-machine this game runs pretty good and solid. Only crashed twice in 50+ hours of gameplay. - The game itself, which will serve an insane amount of play hours. - The amount of details (books to read) and things to discover is insane. - The replayability. Dozens, if not hundreds or more combinations to build your character. - For any price below 15 Euro it's worth every penny. - The voice acting and overall presentation is superb. The Bad: - Game seems sometimes a bit unpolished and clunky. But only sometimes. I play with the help of the UESP Wiki which states that a lot of quest can be stuck because of bugs. I personally haven't encountered so far any of those, though. The Ugly and the things that kinda ruins it: - Your actions in Skyrim don't seem to affect anything in any way. No matter what fraction you choose, you'll end up doing all the quests (more to that in the following point), get mediocre equipment and that's it. I hoped to be (in the end) an overpowered thief / assassin after completing the quests from the Thieves' Guild and The Dark Brotherhood? Nada. You don't even get great equipment or stuff. You even can join fractions which are hostile to each other and nobody seems to bother. Killing everything or doing anything, nothing seems to change. RPG? No, more like a game with endless possibilites, only that nothing matters. - The quests are very repetitive and purposely serve to to prolong gameplay time. You always have to (for example) find a item at the complete other side of the map and your actions are not connected, meaning your actions in Skyrim don't matter. And the quests are absolutely dull; for example to get a final achievement for the Thieves Guild, you have to do 125 (!) quests and every single one of them is the same. Steal a thing, place a stolen thing, change numbers in a book. After stealing 20 times in a row the same object you kinda loose it (no pun intended). - The leveling system is WAY to prolonged. I don't mind spending a lot of hours in a game, especially a RPG, but come on, one has to spent a whole eternity to actually become a badass character in even one skill. By the time you're (for example) a 100 level Marskman you've already finished all the fractions you're interested in. - The necessity of mods. I don't know WHAT stuff the developers smoked during testing, but the interface of this game is probably the definitively worst I have ever encountered. Even after installing the mod SkyUI its HORRIBLE and slow as hell. Absolutely horrible. Like I mentioned in the beginning, this game is completely overhyped and overrated in every aspect. In conclusion this game tries to have and be anything, but isn't. It's like jack of all trades, master of none. Still, if you have 15 bucks left, buy it.

review: When I played Skyrim for the first time, I was blown away by the attention to detail, and the vast variety of quests and locations to discover. To those who treat Morrowind like it is the holy game, take those nostalgia goggles off! Seriously, this game has not been dumned down. Skyrim has improved on many features which Morrowind and Oblivion first implemented. My favourite part of the game is interactibility, while my least favourite part of Skyrim are the amount of glitches. Not gamebreaking, just annoying. 9.5/10

review: The Elder Scrolls V Skyrim legt grafisch und spiel technisch einiges drauf als sein Vorgnger Oblivion. Wer sich gerne lange in ein Spiel verbeist wird viel Spa an Skyrim haben denn es ist nicht verpflichtent sofort alle Hauptquests zu erledigen, im gegenteil der Spieler hat die Freiheit zu whlen ob Haupt- oder Nebenaufgaben. Dazu ist Skyrim auch ein Open World Spiel. Dawnguard: Erste Erweiterung bringt den Skillbaum fr den Werwolf wie auch fr den Vampirmeister. Man whlt eine Seite (Gegen oder fr die Vampire) und zieht dem entsprechend los. Eine lohnesweter Erweiterung. Heartfire: Wer gerne Sims spielt oder Huser baut wird sich hier wohl finden. Es kommen neue Vorkommen und neue Gegenstnde vor. Man kann sich ein Grundstck kaufen, ein Haus bauen und dieses dan verdeitigen gegen Gegner. Eine nette gnstige Erweiterung fr jeden der etwas neues mchte. Dragonborn: Man geht auf eine Insel in Morrowide ... und was bekommt man? Richtig, viele neue Gegner, neue Rstungen/Waffen und viel neues in Skyrim. Auch die Storyline in dieser Erweiterung ist fesselnd! Alles im ganzen ist Skyrim ohne Erweiterungen ein groes fesselndes und grandioses Spiel, mit Erweiterungen noch grer,grandioser und fesselnder als zuvor.

It is all the elder scrolls goodness wrapped up into one neat modern package and it would be a shame if you didn't at least try it!

review: I have recommended this game because it is indeed a fun game. I sank hours into it on my Xbox and at least one hundred more with mods and the like on PC. I do also, however, advise that if you are a fan of The Elder Scrolls past games, that you consider not buying, or at least, relying heavily on mods after you do buy this game. This game is not really for past TES fans. It does what it does well enough, which is to throw you into the familiar world of Vikingland - I mean uh, Skyrim - and let you do whatever the hell you please, whether that be kill hordes of bandits or search for treasure. But, as I've said, this game is not for TES fans past. It is for the new age of gamers, who just want to play a game and not have a worry in the world. This is not so much an RPG as it is an action game with some slight focus on RPG elements like crafting and raising and acquiring skills. There are quests, yes, but they are repetitive. There is a story, but it is very basic. You wouldn't think to look at it, but Skyrim is in its own newer category of semi-RPGs. And therein lies the problem. The Elder Scrolls was always about being who you wanted, creating a deep character with an interesting story, having awesome quests to do and plenty of unique treasures to be uncovered. Sadly, depth is all but gone in this game. Its paper-thin at best. There are mods for that, but you shouldn't have to use mods to add something so standard to RPGs to this game. Combat is completely reliant on your skill, not your character's like in previous games. The perks make a difference only much later. If you have ANY kind of ranged damage available to you, you win. Essentially that is how combat works. If my archery skill actually mattered, I would slowly begin to see an increase in how much weight I could put into my shots or maybe higher chances to cause bleeding effects with my arrows. You see my point? Perks eliminate the purpose of your character's actual skill. They do add a sense of "bettering" yourself, but at what cost? Simplifying combat and removing depth in the sense of your character's skills actually making a tiny difference in terms of gameplay. Character development? Forget about it. All characters in Skyrim are essentially copy-pasted NPCs, and boy are they generic. Sexy Nord females abound. Oh yeah, and tons of guards that say the same things to you with sub-par voice acting, no less. Granted, some features such as the option to marry are welcomed, but they do not fill the void that most TES fans might be looking for. What this game does have going for it, though, is exploration and discovery. It feels good to explore the map, and if you want the best reward, don't fast travel. It seriously ruins any explorative tendencies in the game. But yes, it does feel good to explore, and discovering dungeons and caves is really fun at times. If only all the dungeons didn't feel the same, it would be even better. While I may have many gripes with the game, it is enjoyable. If you want hours of mindless adventuring and hordes of mods to improve the experience overall, then get the game. If that isn't what you want, and you want the original Elder Scrolls experience, than you probably already have that with Morrowind, or Oblivion. tl;dr This is a good game, but it is not a good RPG. Recommended to adventuring fans, not recommended for Elder Scrolls fans that want the experience they love.

review: A friend of mine got me into this game a while ago and it's free roaming gameplay, and general ability to craft almost anything reeled me in. Then the ability to mod the game came in and I was hooked even more. With every DLC the game kept growing. Even after being out for years now this game just keeps going. People love it and I know why they do. With all that people contribute to making the game more than it was released as, it has become a people's game made by Bethesda but shaped by the players into whatever vision each of us may have. It has become a huge way for so many to express ideas and share them with countless others. As a modder for this game the happiness my work and the work of so many others brings to people is priceless...and better than any amount of $.

review: Very good game. While the story may not be as good as in previous Elder Scrolls games, it's still a epic game. The fact that you play as a Dragonborn is a nice change, which brings me to the Shouts. They were a very good addition to the game, and they can be pretty fun, for example Unrelenting Force (A.K.A. the popular FUS RO DAH). Graphics wise, it's not the best there is in terms of textures (theres also shadow striping in some spots), but graphics aren't always the main priority of a game. There are bugs, and stuff that should have been in the game, but the DLC's add extra questlines and content which are really great (my favorite is Dragonborn, but you may have different opinions). Dragonborn and Dawnguard add extra questlines and places, and Hearthfire gives you the ability to build your own home in 3 places. Even so, if you want the game to be PERFECT, then get the mods you want and your experience will be very great. Score: 9/10 (by itself) 9.4/10 (with DLC) 10/10 (with DLC and mods)

A lot of people will say Oblivion was better, and in a lot of ways it was, but with the Steam Workshop and the Nexus at your fingertips, Skyrim easily becomes one of the funnest and most immersive RPG's out there. Vanilla Skyrim is fine, but the mods make it what it is. Definitely recommend it.

review: I would not have recommended this game three years ago. However the mod community, lowered price and *excellent* expansion pack content make Skyrim a must-own, and not for the vanilla experience. I will stand by my opinion that Oblivion was better, especilly in the uniqueness of the quests it offered as opposed to "find x in cave full of draugr", and don't get me started on the BS "but the combat is better in Skyrim" argument since the same bad combat system is just hid behind fancy execution moves. But the expansion pack content is genuinely interesting and through modding I've made my game a hardcore and fast-paced experience that feels not unlike Diablo, (to clarify that's in pure intensity and not literally like a dungeon-crawler). It's disappointing to have to merely say "the mods make this game" but that's the harsh reality in this case. The expansion content however, as I've stated twice already, is high-quality and only emphasises how mediocre the vanilla game is. Edit: Also I would highly recommend playing this game with a controller. The character feels more weighty to me that way, although that could be personal preference - you WILL have trouble playing an archer that way.

review: During my first run through Skyrim, I played as an Argonian battle mage. I know this seems strange, but things were going well. When I played the main quest "Diplomatic Immunity" and I went to the Thalmor Embassy, I forgot armor. I was a naked Argonian, fighting mages who used frost spells... As you can imagine I was unable to continue, and I had no saves before I gave my gear to Malborn (I also forgot I was a Werewolf lel). This frustrated me to the point where I was up late one night, contemplating of greater things, my final decision was to delete my character forever. I was crushed that this was the only way, so I had a huge falling out with Skyrim, I started playing other games, such as Call of Duty. Call of Duty was filling the whole in my emotional roof that Skyrim had left, but there was still a leak. I realized that Skyrim was always there for me, through thick and thin, we were a team. That's when I rushed to the store, bought a new copy of Skyrim for myself, and 50 others to give out to strangers on the street. Now I am a happy man, do yourself a favor, buy this game, and buy a second copy to give to your future spouse, so when you inevitably divorce them to be with Skyrim, they too can have a copy to love and cherish. Happy Thanksgiving everyone!

review: Ah, Skyrim, what a wonderful game. Time and time again I have found myself returning to the snowy, beautiful landscape that is this game's portrayal of Tamriel, each time making a new character, and finding new ways to play. What can I say about this game? A lot, actually. First of all, the game looks astounding. The dark feel creates an atmosphere like none other, but it somehow remains silly with all of the bugs never fixed (I'm looking at you, movement approximation.) The enemies are unique, not so much in their abilities, but in their style. In the open landscapes you'll find necromancers and wolves, but in dungeons and caves you'll Draugr (the equivalent of zombies), skeletons, and sometimes machines made by the ancient race called the Dwemer. Things like this make environments special and interestingly varied. The one complaint I have with the beauty is that the great mountains you can see in the distance throughout your travels aren't always so spectacular. When trying to traverse the countryside, the mountains usually just get in the way. Travelling around them is the easiest option, but by using the aforementioned bugs you can run up vertical slopes and clear them, if not entirely easily. The Elder Scrolls series is praised for its customization, and Skyrim offers the same amount as any other. Each type of weapon has its own skill tree, and cambining certain powers can make the game exceedingly fun. An assassin is not limited to blades, oh no. There is a school of magic that can aid in sneaking, and can come in handy when difficult situations present themselves. Or, you can be a battleaxe weilding mage if you so desire, using Conjuration and Alteration magic can grant defense and weapons without the toll on your inventory that real armor takes. More examples exist, and playing the game can reveal them. Quests are more fun in this game than most others I feel. While in many RPG's quests are there just for the sake of having them, Skyrim was built around them. Bethesda got voice actors to record lines for dozens of questlines, and the quests themselves consist of more than "Kill that thing," or "Get that other thing." They have plots and unique impacts on the world. making them much more substancial feeling than those of, say, Quest of Dungeons' quests, which are essentially fetch quests. Skyrim is not a perfect game by any stretch of the imagination, but whether you're looking for an RPG to get involved in, or just a time waster, this game has something to satisfy everone. 87/100 Buy it, dumbutt.

review: Excellent, open world RPG. In my opinion, not as pretty as Oblivion, and far easier than Oblivion - thus more accessible. Immersive, beautiful title, play your own way. Can easily log hundreds of hours just exploring side quests. DLC are fun, though not as good as Oblivion DLC (horse armour aside!). Played extensively and completed on XBox.

review: Utterly beautiful graphics, vastly more content than you can shake a hundred sticks at, visceral combat, awesome dragons and absolutely worth playing. However, it's not without some significant flaws. If you're familiar with the magic system from the previous Elder Scrolls games, prepare for disappointment. The range of effects is vastly reduced (there are only three types of Destruction, for instance), and there's no spellmaking. Although you have the awesome ability to cast two spells at once (one from either hand), they completely missed the opportunity to make spell combinations. It all feels generic, dumbed-down and consoley. Though there's a million and thirty side-quests, they're pretty much all identical: go to X dungeon and kill a bunch of identical undead. The thieves' guild quest doesn't actually require you to steal things. People treat you exactly the same when you're level 1 as they do when you're master of all the guilds and wearing a dead dragon on your shoulders. Definitely get it - but be prepared to get a little jaded faster than you might have imagined.

review: An excellent game for trying out different styles of combat and really getting involved in the world. My personal favorite is archery -- taking pot shots at Draugr from across the catacomb and actually hitting them is the best feeling in the world! The game is apt to bore you after a while, but that's often only because you're not in the right mindset to play it. It's not for fooling around in; you'll get the most out of it by actually exploring the world and being your character.

review: A wonderful game and a true testament to the Elder Scrolls Series. Not as big as my beloved Daggerfall or Arena, but complete immersion into the environment is still possible. An easy to use skill system (though I do miss the in-depth ones of old) and a great character generation system make the game easy to play your way. Above all I love the customizability of the game itself, leaving it to the end-user to shape the game as they see fit. A great and immersive set of stories to go through, with DLC expanding it to many hours of enjoyable fun. This is by far one of the greatest games that I have ever played, and continue to play!

review: Skyrim is one of those games you could play constantly for weeks, or even months and it's still fun. Then even after you get bored of it you can return months later, start a new adventure and have just as much fun as last time, if not more. Throw mods on top of it, the game just gets even better. The open world exploration is fantastic and there is always something new to discover, it's truly an adventure game and I recommend it for anyone who likes fantasy games and open world games.

review: I very first started with a barbaric Nord who weilded 2-handers and dawned heavy armor and completely smashed everything in sight. I next played a Redguard Conjuration Mage Thief who dual wielded conjured weapons. And now I'm an Orc Werewolf Archer who is really good at pick pocketing. There is really no end to the amount of customization this game gives you. The player has complete and full control of who and what they want their character to be. I've played through this game so many times (originally had it for 360) and I STILL find all new areas to explore. I've never had so much fun with a game. 10/10 for a game after 3 years since it's release and still holds my attention for long periods of time.

review: This game can be very..very..very..long if your OCD for sidequests like I am..(i dont even know if i have the main story in my quests) and worried about walking into the infinate looping sidequests. The game has a few bugs in but its nothing game breaking, its enjoyable to RPG fans and obviously to elder scrolls fans. The 1st dragon kill can be very satisifiying but after like 10 of them it just feels like a normal enemy since the random spawn is so common.

review: Skyrim is the open world RPG game. It is the fifth installment in The Elder Scrolls series developed by Bethseda Softworks. You play as the Dragonborn destined to save Skyrim as well as the world of Nirn from annihilation from an evil in the form of an ancient dragon named Alduin. You travel across the province of Skyrim progressing in power, engaging in side quests, joining guilds or picking a side in the civil war that rages the land. Your character is very customizable through the many classes and races. The main story is rather short but makes up for it through the myriad side quests. But most of the game, you spend exploring the unfathomably vast landscape. The combat system is rather stiff but weapons are very diverse due to enchantments. The skill tree is nice allowing you to customize your character in specific skills from the points you gain when leveling up. The graphics of the game are quite stunning for its time and Jeremy Soule has created a masterpiece to your ears which fits the tone of the game. The game has a realistic feel through the lore and the environment. Bethseda took the time and made books adding to the realism. Everything seems to fit and comprehendable lorewise. The replay value of the game is increase due to the fantastic community. You can add mod from the Steam Workshop as well as the Skyrim Nexus adding to the fun of the game. Bethseda has released 3 DLCs where can expand on the story through vampires and the first Dragonborn as well as making your own family. This game is simply breathtaking and one of the best if not the best RPG I have experienced. Rating: 98/100

review: It's pretty late to write a review for Skyrim, but here goes anyway. Skyrim is a game where you are a person/creature called the Dragonborn, and hunt down dragons. The Dragonborn can absorb the souls of dragons, killing them permanently, and using the knowledge from that soul for your own strength. You learn different "Shouts" (Powers) from ancient walls with dragon language on them. These powers are the main element of the game. As for the options, you can be a powerful mage, a mighty warrior, a sneaky thief, a skilled craftsman, an alchemist, or a mixture of everything! You can take on huge side quests, such as joining a guild of thieves or assassins, a tea party with a madman, visiting a museum, or ending the current war going on. There are several ruins to delve into, bounties to collect, cities to live in, and trolls to kill. Of course, you will need a decent computer for this to run smoothly. There are quite a few bugs, but never enough to break the immersion. Hours upon hours of gameplay, but as far as the Main Quest, is lacking. There's just not enough. But all the other things you can do, make up for it. The possibilities with this game are endless! Final score: 9.5/10

If you have just bought Skyrim, I encourage you to finish the main questline at your own pace, not right away. Anways, the game is great, totally worth the money.

review: I drink to my youth, to the weeks come and gone, For my hours of Skyrim are just about done. I fought off the Stormcloaks, ran Imperials through - As an Arch-Mage and werewolf and Guildmaster, too. Long live Ulfric! Or kill him or whatever. I've fought the war twice and not one side is better. I'm the hero of Skyrim; everyone's in my debt - But if I kill a chicken, they'll all want me dead. Now it's Alduin time, and I'm finally prepared, My friends have all left me, but I simply don't care. (10/10, would rhyme again)

review: OH what a game!!! So many choices, so many things to do. Follow the quest, run off on sidequests, or just wander aimlessly to your heart's content... It's all in there. Focus on magic, be the best mage you can be: favor destroying stuff, become a Destructionist mage and burn, freeze, zap everything in your way. Like to protect yourself, specialize in the Alteration school. There are other schools as well; something for everyone. Or, just do a little bit of everything. Doesn't matter, you can tailor your playthrough to the way you want to play it. Fancy yourself a sneaky type? Focus on stealth, put everything in powerful daggers and level up backstabbing, and nothing will stand in your way. Want to snipe enemies from the shadows? Just start putting experience into bows and enchanting and take down targets' health, stamina, or magicka level from a distance so that one or two hits from your dagger or sword will make short work of them. Find or craft you a soul-trapping weapon and you can gather an infinite supply of souls to recharge your magical bows or melee weapons to keep doing massive amounts of damage. Burly warrior or wily agile fighter... you pick. The sky's the limit as you can basically do anything or be anything you want to be. Spend hours, days, months even, just exploring. Make a career out of hunting wild animals and gathering their pelts to sell for money so you can afford your own place, so you can even get married and adopt some kids. Just wander, if you want, as there are thousands of places (towns, villages, lone cottages, caves, mines, and mills) to enjoy, interact with, take on a job just about any place. I don't see how this game could get any better or do it better so that you can enjoy playing it your way... Oh wait, there are literally thousands of mods that do just that: from hundreds of new weapons, armor types, loot, potions, poisons, capes...it's just endless. And then there are all the mods for improving the low-quality objects found in the vanilla game, texture enhancements, gameplay enhancements, crafting overhauls, hundreds of new followers, creature types... it's just incredible what you can do. I don't see how anyone could NOT like this game. It's phenomenal.

review: --------BREAKING NEWS----------- I am bringing this report from various sources stating that Bethesda Game Studios have accidently released a product that has become so addictive that people are refusing to leave their computers. Persons having used this product have reported that they only played 30 mins but have awoken to a different day altogether. Reports of 3 -4 hour warp times are common with some users experiencing what seems to be a 6 hour jump in time. It seems after use, players become severely disorientated greatly yearning for sleep. However we have confirmed reports that this product is also quite addictive with reports from players seeking to finish one more quest but then relapsing into exploring this land that people have dubbed Skyrim. Experts are warning against the overuse of this product however it seems there is no stopping people wanting to experience more of this product as supposedly people have been experiencing a high when they find about stronger equipment in this game. Indecisive people are strongly warned about its addictive nature with one expert claiming that modded with ENB and other files found in the workshop and Nexus, the potency of this product can be extremely addictive with time jumps of 24 hours. Thats all from me today, back to the studio.

review: Skyrim is second only to Oblivion, and that's only because of one aspect that will probably surpass it at some time. The mods for Skyrim are good, some are even fairly amazing and world making, but it's still NOTHING compared to the amount of mods and the quality of mods for Oblivion. Skyrim is overall amazing, save for the combat (though that can be modded to a degree) and the main story lacking in any real substance besides "Kill X to make sure world doesn't end". I got my money's worth out of it, especially with the DLC (my favorite being Dawnguard). 7.5/10, would buy and play again.

review: Skyrim - An ocean of possibility, but about as deep as a kiddy pool. For all of the 80 hours (I played with Steam off most of the time) I spent in the game fighting endless waves of Draugr and going through corridors of samey dungeons in the game, I would ask myself; "When will this get good?"The story has no depth whatsoever, every single story quest is simply "go to this dungeon and get this thing", and dragon fights are underwhelmingly easy. This is neither a good RPG or a good adventure game because not only is the skill system inferior to the original stat system of the previous games, but because the combat is  as  with your skill barely having an effect. I admit it will provide decent entertaintment with its interesting lore and the stupid ragdoll effects that occasionally make it look like the enemies are having awkward sexual intercourse with each other. If you manage to look past the many flaws and the shallowness of the quests, story, and characters, then this is a decent game for just filling the gaps with your imagination. Roleplaying is possible but greatly hindered by the fact that your character has instant mastery over weapon he/she picks up, though that can be fixed with mods. However if you're someone who comes straight from Morrowind and Oblivion, you'll appreciate the nice visuals and good animations (for a TES game), but that'll quickly be overlooked by the lackluster character building, the lame black-and-white story about "An ancient evil returns", nothing absolutely happening, an uninteresting Civil War plot, the illusion of choice ("Yes " or "Yeah" in response to a question), and a world utterly devoid of consequence and life. But hey, it's a decent game if you put in mods like Requiem, Morrowloot, Morrowind-style Questing, Combat Overhaul mods and use your imagination. I didn't pour a pretty decent amount of hours for nothing. I'll recommend it only because most mods are really good. By itself though? Hell no. TL;DR: Story sucks, quests suck, combat sucks, stat system sucks, but if you use mods and a lot of imagination it's actually pretty good.

review: Buy this game for the engine, then download gazillion mods for optimal experience. Overall a fairly enjoyable game with many technical improvements over previous TES, but vanilla Skyrim is nowhere as wide open or offer enough freedom and content as its predecessors. Oh, and what a nice console port--be sure enjoy the terribly limited consolized menus for inventory and combat as well as the watered down graphics. Does Bethesda really expect the community to provide HD textures for every damn thing? /tsundere

review: This is one of the best game I have ever played. The only reason I have not played it more, is beacuse of the fact it`s not 2 player, or online. If you love RPG games, get Skyrim. But the possibility that you love RPGs and have not bought skyrim yet, is very low. Recommended on the highest!

review: I have to say i liked some thing's about Oblivion more, it just had something that Skyrim lack's. Not really something you can discribe to someone, however this is still a great game and more then worthy of the Elder scrolls name (looks at redguard adventure). You start out as a prisoner in true ES fashion, right before you are killed by an axe a dragon destroy's the town and you are able to make your escape. From there you learn that you are "Dragonborn" a rare skin disease where you whole body grow scale's and horn's, making you the only one who can sneek up on a dragon and kill it while it is confused about what you are. All in all a great game :>

review: My reaction when I first played Skyrim: Wow. Not even wow- I was speechless. I had never played a video game so immersive, complex, and interesting before. The motto of the series, "you are what you play", definitely holds true with the balanced races and playstyles. Want to play as one of the Khajiit, but don't want to deal with ridiculously pointless racial boots? Don't worry, it doesn't really affect your gameplay in the long run. A legend among RPGs, great for long-time fans of the genre, or someone completely new to RPGs. One of the best games since the N64. 10/10.

I suppose everyone has their own tastes, but if you don't like some of the quests, or the quality of graphics, go to Steamworkshop! They have grass, water, snow, ember, fire and general foliage improvements, as well as dozens of quests and new areas, items and followers. The game in itself is stunning, and I should really play it more often. Edit- hahahahahaha it's all i play

review: A masterpiece from the XX century: great graphics and music, huge map and variety of quests, interesting storyline and a big amount of weapons, armor, potions, enchantments, etc. Almost the same game style as Fallout 3 (being that it was made by the same company), but instead of guns, we have medieval weapons: swords, knifes, axes, bows, even a big amount of magic spells. The level up system works not just by killing people and creatures, but by performing different actions, such as sneak by, selling stuff, archery, different magic schools, theft, alchemy and more. Even though the game looks like a FPS, I think it's a fair game when it comes to battles and it has the posibility to change camera views. What it makes it unique from the other sequels is that the main enemies are dragons which you have to fight and defeat throughout the game. A fully recommended game which takes quite a lot hours to be beat and another amazing game from Bethesda Softworks.

review: The closest thing we have to a fully fledged duck simulator! Embark on the most vivid 300x300 reseloution treasure hunt you could ever imagine! Perfect for gamers who never want to lose , Skyrim offers a vast land of snow for you to have snowball fights with dragons and other foes! And for you sneaky fellows out there, Skyrim sneak realism is incredible, you will be able to live out all your dreams of being completley invisible! Boasts a gigantic cast of 3 voice actors, guiding you through this incredible tale of god versus the little lizards trying to end the world. Skyrim also takes the cake for the most snow in a video game ever! FIlled with rediculously fun quests and activities that make you say "What a terrefic game, it is not easy at all and very rewarding , also i think the sneak system is very balanced and realistic and not op, oh and the winged salamanders are challenging with fun mechanics" The vast arsenal of weapons and tools provided for the player is almost on par with bad rats, simply incredible. In conclusion IGN rated this game a 9.5/10, but i think they are wrong this game deserves a solid 10/10 and should be in every household, it has achevied classic status nearly instantly with its griping sneak mechanics , incredible stealth and flawless sneak mechanics making it the game of the year for every year. P.S The best part about the game is the fact that the blonde haired blue eyed people are incredibly racist, and sneak

Can't say I regret ever having bought this game. Everything is worth checking out. The DLC is amazing, and brings new things that help improve the game even more. I would advise checking out mods. This game has replayability and definitely a chance to get your moneys worth from it. I still have a hard time believing I invested 1,300 some odd hours of my life into this game. Aside from that, some negatives is probably the fact it is older, and may not meet new standards of graphics for some people who are all about pretty pictures, but if that is not a problem for you, as it isn't for me at all, you will love this game.

review: If you don't mind a little tinkering, this game can be one of your all-time favourite purchases. Any Elder Scrolls game wouldn't be complete without a massive modding community, helping you to twist the game to any of your fancies. Want to make the game better looking? Mods. Want to have more realistic in-depth lore while you explore the land? Mods. Want to bash your enemies with a Captain America shield and a squeaky toy while using a dragon shout to call forth Thomas the Tank Engine? Mods. No seriously, there are mods for that last one.

review: I put alot of time into this game, and I have to say it is one the greatest games I have ever played. Skyrim takes to a snow covered kingdom torn by civil war and a new threat, Dragons. You play as the Dragonborn, a mystic being capable of speaking in dragon langauge and using the power of your voice to produce a th'um or a shout. By now i would assume that people already know about the internet famous, FUS RO DAH shout that pushes enemies back. On the subject of enemies, Skyrim offers a wide variety of enemies that you can face. You want dragons, you got dragons, you want skeletons with shrouds who can shoot magic from thier hands, you got that too. The game also has a leveling systen so when you level up the enemies will get slighty stronger and have better equipment. Not to mention the almost endless variety of mods you can use with your game. "But Dy-no, what if i like Call of Duty?" Don't fret, they have guns. MEDIVAL GUNS. with the all new dawnguard add-on you can have crossbows. Yet again not to mention the modding community makes some pretty sick flintlock pistols. the game also has longbows and shortbows. "But Dy-no, what if I wanna set someone on fire?" Well, now you can with the all new skyrim the video game that has a magic system that rivials that of oblivion. You can set someone on fire, frezze the  out of them, or turn them into a lightbulb that has to much electricity. "But Dy-no, i'm a 13 year old boy, what if i wanna be a girl?"  LOGIC, in the first mission of the game, you hope off a carriage and a man askes who you are, then a plastic surgeon who is played by you, must make you character as deformed or as astheicly pleaseing as possible. There is no time limit so you can spend hours and hours trying to find the find the right shade of brown to go right below your cat person left  cheek. Also being the plastic surgeon you are, you can make your cat person a man or a woman in the click of a button. "But Dy-no, what if i want to play with my friends?" Well little timmy, you can't. this game has no co-op of any kind. except you do have followers that follow you around the whole map like a fat guy looking for his piece of pizza that slid into his fat rolls. "But Dy-no, what if i want to have sex with a person, in this game?" NO, you can't because those es who were working buy the whiterun stables got narked out.  DA POLICE. "But Dy-no, what if i hate awesome games that let you kill stuff?" Then you go back to Call of Duty and don't buy this game. "Last question, what if i want to kill a chicken?" NO, YOU CAN'T HARM THE GOD DAMED CHICKENS BECAUSE THEY ARE PRICELESS AND EVERY GUARD IN EVERY HOLD WILL BE GRIDDING ON YOUR  BECAUSE YOU ACCIDENTLY LIT A CHICKEN ON FIRE. 10/10 GOTY

review: This game is probably one of the best I've played. Although my opinion is very bias with me favoring sandbox games, it's one of the most immersful. Starting out you get countless different playstyles. You can be a barbaric tank, rogue, mage, or many more. The talent trees that you get choose from to enhance your experience are very diverse and straightforward. The game in the very beginning itself is made to fit your personal style, and then you'll soon find out so are the quests. You don't need to complete all of the quests in skyrim to complete the main storyline, therefore skipping the ones you don't/ wouldn't enjoy. If you prefer the theive's approach, you might like the dark brotherhood or theives guild. Or say instead you picked a mage, you might like the college of winterhold's quests. The quests themselves are amazing. There is so much lore and storytelling behind everything. What makes it even more unique is that there are often conflicting factions. You get to play and hear both sides of the story. The only people I wouldn't recommend this game to are people who don't like straightforward combat. It may get repetative over time, but that all just depends on the player. After all, the game was meant to have a more realisitic combat style. Or if you're someone who doesn't like sandbox games, don't play it. This game has a few minor bugs and glitches (like any other game) but honestly, it doesn't matter with how well developed this game is. I'd highly recommend it to anyone.

Sure there's one driving story, but all stories together make for fantastic adventures. I'm around 90 hours in and I think I've only just grazed the surface of this epic tale. There are times where I just sat back at looked at a vista and how the sun cast shadows. If you have heart, you'll want this game. If you don't, don't worry. The game has more than enough heart for you.

Once you complete most of the game, you can literally download an entirely new game for free on the Workshop. This is a fantastic deal for an awesome game.

review: Hi everyone! Please check out my profile for more reviews! This was clearly a massive breakthrough for Bethesda and the begginings for the Elder Scrolls series. This is the RPG that finally took open world fun over the top. Clearly, I am very happy with this game, which is quite rare for me. The first person gameplay again freakin' dragons really make the gameplay intense. The graphics are fantastic. Also, there is a free DLC available for better graphics and textures. It truly sets a great speed for the memory it takes up. Really, that is one of the only things I have to say about this game that I dislike. The memory space for it, especially if you download the DLC's, is kind of nasty. But if you have a computer that's built for gaming (like mine) then I'm sure we can handle a couple seconds of bad RAM. Refering to the earlier comments on the DLC, they have four of them (including the free bit). The majority of the DLC's only affect the gameplay, enemies, and spells that you can use. It's very suprising that this game is twenty bucks. I received it on a sale for five dollars! My brother had been showing me the gameplay on his Xbox (the first Xbox game I played) and got me hooked onto the serious in which I played the second and fourth (and obviously fifth) games of the Elder Scrolls series. I was super excited when I played it for the first time. Note, please, that I was young at the time, and never really had any magnificent experiences on video games. At the time, the only really big systems were the Gamecube, Wii, and DS (Was I a big fan of Nintendo? Yes). So you couldn't imagine my excitement when I purchased it for such a low price. Be thankful that this game is sometimes lower than five bucks, and they have sales for it quite often. The Workshop is quite fun. You have alot of crap you can do and some overpowered deeds you can commit to. Of course, as we all know, when you play a game, the last thing you want to do is die quickly. In this case, at the beggining, you have collected some stuff that you can use to your advantage from the original Elder Scrolls, like the destruction, healing, and other useful things. The spawns amoung the forests and mountains are very well done.

You will always find a new cave, new enemy, new quests, new things to do, etc. If you are a fan of Lord of the Rings, you MUST get this game. Even if you dont like Lord of the Rings, you should get it. The story is so engaging and nothing feels tacked on or out of place. Everything has a purpose and everything has a reason for being there with their own story. Its Great! I have no idea why you would not get this game. Oh side note, the DLC for the game is GREAT even though I don't own it yet. I have played it on my friend's computer and they add even more content to an aready content LOADED game.

I have played almost 500 hours on console, but I love the game so much I also brought it on steam, just to be able to play it when my family uses the console. And I must say, it was one of the best descisions of my life. The community is one of the best in gaming, there are so many user-created drawings and mods, that when you start playing again, Skyrim is a whole new world, tailored to your liking. And the game in itself - devoid of any mods- is the single greatest gaming adventure I have ever had the honor of experiencing. I will most definitely come back to this game, time and time again.

review: Definately one of the most fantastic games i have ever played, I put off buying the PC version for over a year, instead playing the Xbox 360 version every once in a while, i must say, the PC version far surpasses that of the console, what with the upped graphics and mod support, this is a must have for ANY PC gamer. The game in itself is truly amazing, you could play for days and still stumble upon some old crypt that, before then, you had no idea existed. The game is huge, and the vast ammount of user created content availlable is, beyond awe inspiring. Skyrim is a must have - the storyline, world, lore, and everything to do with it is beyond anything seen in any other game ever.

review: I played this on the console for a ton of hours and had a blast, didn't buy it on PC because my pc couldn't handle it, got a new pc now, Installed skyrim and a whole bunch of mods and it's like i'm playing a brand new game! (Even though i advise you to play without mods first and then mod the **** out of it) New armours, weapons, awesome questlines made by awesome people, even if you play Vanilla, if you didn't play it before, BUY IT! What are you waiting for! i bought it on sales and it was the best decision i've ever made after dipping fries in ice cream. Great replayablity , Beautiful Graphics (That can be even more beautiful with mods (a bit like makeup! ) ), Amazing Gameplay and storyline. Overall this is a great game and in my opinion one of the best rpg's of all time 9/10 because nobody's perfect If this review didn't convince you to buy the game just remember you can Make dragons become trains and make bears play the lute

review: Another quality Bethesda Game. In my 200+ hours so far in this game I have not even covered everything in the vanilla game. Add in mods, and the DLC I have yet to get, I could easily see myself putting in another 100-200 more hours. This is a wonderful game that may only be surpassed by Elder Scrolls VI.

review: Well I have only spent a few hours on the game ok ok a little over 200 hours ! I really should not have to say anything more than that but this such a fanastic game I have to share. This game is all about role playing if you enjoy being immersed within a game you will love this game. Once you play the core story line hell there is many core storylines to the game but once you have got into them your can use the workshop to add even more. Not that it is needed but I believe this is a fantastic way to build a game just for you. In the game you can do the following : Adopt Children Get Married Ride Horses Ride Dragons change the way look throughout the game. Change gender Go on quest Indulge your OCD (There is even homes that are mods perfect for this) Make potions Make armour Enchant Items ......Well to be honest I could be here all day telling you what is available for 10 which you can buy it for less in the sale I have had way ove 300 hours play time since I also played it on another account before this one. Where can you get value for money like that elsewhere. And not only that the workshop then provides you with so much more free just download it and that is so easy to do. Find a mod you like subscribe to it in the workshop and then just make sure it loads before you hit play for the 2nd time. I can't make you buy the game I just know once you have you will not be sorry on doing so. Before buying this game I played World of Warcraft for some 3 years plus since getting this I have let my subscription slide not needing it, So what it would cost me for one months play I have had many months of play and really enjoyed myself doing so. If after all my ranting you are still on the fence if you want this game wait till the sales cheapskate ...... lol For 10 you really will not get so much within a game that you do with skyrim in fact I waited for the sales and got all the DLC also for very little too although with all the mods out you can add new DLC free every week some mods do however require you to have already got the official content also to work within your game so always read the information given with each mod. Happy Gaming in Skyrim Just a note I thought about after you can also wait for DLC to be on sale think I got both for about 6 or even less so even that is worth it for an extra 30 or so hours of play or more to be honest if you want to do all quest in that area. Again Happy Gaming x

review: This game, is a game of massive preportions. As is a game that I've invested over 1k hours into, not only for it's content in the landscape or terrain, rather its sense of "I haven't done everything yet" or "I've done everything, mabye I'll do it again". This game has consumed a majority of my life, and I can't say I'm against that, it truely is a game to buy, play, complete, then mod to oblivion. Speaking of which, buy oblivion too.

review: I do believe it's obvious to say that anyone that is a fan of The Elder Scrolls won't be too disapointed by what Skyrim has to offer. From discovering unmarked caves and forts, to the game's storyline, even to the odd things we've come to expect in games by Bethesda (NPCs walking in the air, projectiles launching people thirty feet away, placing NPC bodies in awkward positions), the game will give you the chance to kill a couple of hours. And lets not forget the modding commuity. Those people never fail to disappoint, and kudos to them all for the work they do. From the Unofficial Skyrim patches for bug fixes, to new and immersive weapons/armors, to ai adjustments and value tweeks to make the game a challenge for even the the most experienced and well-geared player, or even just to make the game even more amazing to look at, the work they do easily adds countless hours of additional gameplay that'll help you milk more enjoyment out of the game than Steam sales milk money out of your wallet. Edit: Not responsible for any problems that may occur with the game if you decide to try out manually installing mods to improve your gameplay experience. Remember, Google is your friend in instances like this.

review: People tell me to enjoy life you have to stop and smell the flowers. Well, people, its kind of hard to do that when even the flowers are spurting consumerism all over your face in a strangely suggestive manner. The hype surrounding the release of Skyrim was the truest example of this and I dont think Ive ever seen so many nerds swoon at one time. The game will see you as a prisoner again (these guards really have to stop arresting the worlds greatest heroes) when youre freed by a reptilian anger management escapee; a story for the ages for sure. Finally, after choosing to follow your death penalty chum or the man that nearly turned you into the next Eugene Armstrong, you are let loose upon the unsuspecting land of Skyrim. At this point youre left to your own devices and by all means you can follow the ever present arrow to the following plot point or you can jog off, find a shop, put a cooking pot on the shopkeepers head and steal all his goods assuming you play the PC version, if not you can suck on my dragon bone. However, there are situations the game randomly drops you in. I fondly look upon the time I killed a blacksmith and received money from her will even though that was the first time I met her. Of course then her boyfriend caught on and hired mercenaries to kill me, but ended up killing an innocent bystander, who I then also received money from, suckers! I bet youre expecting an ending statement here, but Im afraid the reptile had an aneurism and burned it up. By the way, I know you'll get the nude and killable children mods.

review: Bethesda is a game company that knows what the f*ck they are doing. In a time where game creators are scrambleing for the newest thing like new hit boxes, new guns, dlc's just to play the game, sh*tty dialoge, stupid plots. Bethesda comes out of the middle of butt f*uck no where and shows them all up. Its like Bethesda actually wants you to have fun in this game They want you to like the story. They want you to get involved with the world that they created. They want you to have fun, because god forebid that new games cant do that! And I am just sitting here with my mouth open in awe at what I am looking at. This game really shows what happens when game creators take time and hell even THOUGHT AND EFFORT into making there game. Ok, now that Ive kissed Bethesda a*s. Lets talk about the game. Skyrim is a game set back in....I dunno. And you start off as a prisoner who has been captured for following a cult who is agianst the system of Skyrim. You escape because a dragon is like," dont worry bro, I got you." and blows up the place right before you get almost get beheaded....I am still going to kill that dragon though. Then the rest is a journey that you decide. What I like about this game: 1.The action is amazing. Everything seems smooth and up to date even though this game came out in like 2012. 2. The story is rich and it just keeps on going and going. 3.There are plenty of missions and hours of gameplay. 4. The characthers sometimes are funny and the voice acting is fairly decent. 5. ITS ONLY 5 GB....HOLY S*IT!!!!!! F*ckin, sleeping dogs is 13 gb and they dont even have half as much of story as this does. 6. I can run it on my sh*tty computer...with the graphics down but whatever. 7. EVERYTHING! Now for the bad things: 1. It glitches from time to time but Bethesda does that with there xbox to computer games. And thats it for the bad. Just please god, if you havent played it. GET IT RIGHT NOW My Gaming Score: 10 SkyrimGasms/ 10. I still like Ride to Hell Retrubution better, though. (jking that game is )

review: Probably my least favorite TES that I have played, though that doesn't mean its horrible, it has a lot of copy and pasted content (Castles, Crypts, Caves). For a 3D game it still focuses more on stats then skill which is a bit of a problem but mods like Duel or Ace can fix combat and the AI performance to make it a little more fun and bearable. There is a lot to do in this game though its a lot of the same thing over and over again, it has a few stand out quests/dungeons and has a fun and intriguing main storyline though the civil war campaign is garbage and most of the things in the game get very repetative. The puzzles in this game are incredibly easy (and the same over and over again much like the combat and stealth). - AI - The AI in the game aren't very good when it comes to combat (or common sense for that matter). A lot of the AI have cool personalities and some of them even have very unique backgrounds. As I said earlier mods like Duel, Ace can improve AI combat performance. - Stealth - The stealth system is almost completely stat based, it requires at low levels you will be detected fairly easily but after leveling up your stealth (perks or not) you become almost impossible to detect. - Combat - As I implied earlier the combat in this game is very generic and easy. Fighting as a warrior all you have to do is kite, attacking then running back over and over. Fighting as an archer (stealth or not) is just about draining as many arrows as you can in them before they get close to you. It is hard to miss as an archer because of the crosshair (which you can disable) (<-- I did) but at very distant ranges it can become a bit challenging. Mages in this game are bad and boring to put it simply, they don't do much damage until they are very high levels and even then you feel more like a glass rifle then a glass cannon. - Wrap-up - This game feels like it is just trying to make dumb people feel like badasses rather then challenging the players in any way (I feel Morrowind made players think and put effort forth to figure things out a majority of the time). The game is good for one vanilla playthrough since the stupid level up system they put in this game enables you to not have to choose a playstyle and stick with it (the game does that a lot in different ways giving you many chances to back out of a choice after you learned the consequences). The level up system makes replaying the game practically pointless (if you are looking to have different playthrough experiences) since there are almost no choices in the game that have any real impact on anything. 6/10 as a standalone game. 5/10 as a TES game. 1/10 required intelligence level (MOST OF THE THINGS I SAID THAT WERE WRONG WITH THIS GAME CAN BE IMPROVED WITH MODS THOUGH THAT SHOULD NOT BE AN EXCUSE TO SAY THE GAME IS GOOD. MY RATING IS BASED OFF OF THE VANILLA GAME EXPERIENCE.)

review: [warning, this review was originally posted on 12 Aug, 2012 and when done none of the existing DLCs were out, nore most of the mods available for this game atm] Ok so after i think i've done absolutely everything there was to do in teh original game (cos ofc there are a bazillion mods out there). I managed to do every single non radiant quest there is in uesp's Skyrim list, and tried most radiants i could do before getting bored of them. Checked all skills, others maxed by natual game play (Archery) others by cheating (Alchemy omfg). Achievements all done (hellz yeah) And after a really really long time have passed since my last review. There's so much to say about Skyrim and still this feels like a very tinny opinion analysis to what i would feel like writing hehe The time came and I think it's time to say a few words for this game.. Oh and... pardon my crazy grammar.. u gonna have your eyes poped [warning given] :p The following does not include information about specific mods, neither DLC. OK...so... Skyrim; The fifth game in the Elder Scrolls series. A game taking place 200 years after "The Great Anguish" (the war between Daedra and the people of Tamriel). Lets take this in parts as i often love to do in my reviews. Graphics Bethesda did quite a good job with the graphics. The difference is noticable moving from Oblivion to Skyrim. But some times it feels like it's not good enough. My rig is not a really strong one. Core2Duo at 2.13 and a GTS250 the strongest i could find from all the series at that time. I was pretty happy to see that Skyrim was actually runable in pretty high specs. not ultra. But the frame rate was still hanging there after spawning 200 guards and 4 dragons over a vilage letting me sit back and watch the show. So after my experiece and after watching reviews on youtube with tests with a lot better GPUs out there, i have to admit that Bethesda could have done better. It took a noticable number of mods on order to make Skyrim run in HD textures, better lighting and shading, better fire and magic effects, better mapping, better geometries etc. And most of them out right a couple of months after the game was released. Why? Why is a game that comes out near the end of 2011 needs so many mods to have it's graphics perform better just a few months after release while teh game itself took so long to come out? And why is peoples' and animals' hair and fur so.. sticky and not-so-well rendered? Don't get me wrong there. My whinning entrance shall not deceive you about the graphics of the game. The engine is still brilliant. Offers unlimited possibilities. Super vast enironment, very well designed nature and animals. The nature.... God the natire is godlike. I felt like walking through the entire map than fasttraveling. I could stare at the trees, the flowers, the desert, the rivers and the waterfalls. I felt like i could fall in love with the scandinavian culture and the history of teh vikings. I literaly spent hours just staring views and details from all over the places. Also the characters are fascinating. Very realistic face designs. Great animation. The job done is amazing. But just not that perfect. When Morrowind came, graphics seemed centuries ahead from Daggerfall. When Oblivion came, graphics seemed centuries ahead from Morrowind. When Skyrim came.... graphics seemed like 6 years ahead from Oblivion.... just like how it literally was (maybe got too subjective there) Scripting and AI The AI is very good. Some enemies can find cheaky ways to hurt you like using spells from large distances with hit and run tactics. The dialogues are very good, the impact of your decisions won't bring great changes in teh world, but they will influence the average way your character acts and reacts during dialogue and also how people like you and stuff or even how characters from around the map will react at your presence. Can't say there was something really extraordinary. Most things were as expected. Companions are always fun (and even mroe fun with mods). Marriege system was a good idea (but also took some moding to get to be more interesting). Also a word about characters. All NPCs have very natural and realistic actions and reactions furing quests and/or interractions. Also great to see their daily occupations. Each NPC has a routine. Wether if it's a guard or a hunter, a shopkeeper or a fisherman. There's some really great effort put there. Scripting issues will become a matter of daily routine once of start checking out mods. Collisions are some times imminent even while using special tools like Wrye Bash. Quests A bunch of quests. Radiant and non-radiant quests. Stories. Guilds (most of what we've already seen from Oblivion). Chances to help or kill people. Choosing your way through. Gaining special items. Finding rare kickass gear. Getting and house. Doing "jobs". (also completing some nice achievements). Training. Tons of stuff to do. And of cource, a super cool main story to follow. HOWEVER. Quest lines are in average short. You can be easily done with most guilds in a matter of few hours (except the thieves guild if you want that achievement). Where did all the storytelling go? Yes, everything is cool and fine, but sometimes it literally takes half the time to complete a guild's quest line that what it took you to do the same guild's questline in Oblivion. For example, Oblivion's mages guild had me doing quests for days while in Skyrim the mages guild was a matter of a few hours. Even if my memory is bad on this, the feeling of short storylines is strong. the whole feeling about guild quests; Very enjoyable. But kinda short. Bugs Bugs in games. Can't do with them. Can't do without them... Skyrim has enough bug reports from around the communities. But i for once can across a very very few of them during the original game. In particular only 2, during 2 different questlines which i had to overcome by using the console to move the next quest stage after verifying the nature of the bug. I've seen funny stuff about bugs through the net. I guess I was a damn lucky bstd i gotta admit that Music Still missing the awesomeness of some tracks from Morrowing, maybe a few from Oblivion. Skyrim stands alone with its own character. Sure the elder scrolls nature is noticable in most themes. You know, the usual epic music, orchestra styled tunes, some calm nature backround noice. However still Skyrim's tunes is a bit unique. It doesn't connect with TESIII and TESIV. There is this whole viking and gothic(no, not the modern goth thing, im talkign about the ancient middle northern european goth war cultur and nature of things) nothern feeling in everything around the music. A stronger epicness, a war rythm, a sound with a serious and raw character in it. I actually kinda liked that a LOT. Gameplay Absolutely awesome. Little things to say. You just have to play teh game to see for yourself. Dual dual wield in weapons and magic. Some awesome and epic slow motion or cut scenes in battles. Interacting it absolutelly ing e-v-e-r-y-t-h-i-n-g around you. Gazillion of items to use and interact with. From weapons and armor, to flowers and butterflies and bugs (yes, you can even catch and collect butterflies!) Value through time Bethesda may not have given their best for this game, but they know what they are doing. Mods will add years in the game. Skyrim is still an awesome piece of The Elder Scrolls series. However i fear it won't last as long as Oblivion did. A percentage of the fanbase did compain a lot. And you can see that their studios could have put more work on the game while they didn't (maybe because they wanted to work on the future MMORPG title[?]) I personaly fear that the game will be left without many additions. The Elder Scrolls had shaped a "culture" of bringing tones of awesome things v

review: Ive played every single game of the Elder Scrolls Franchise for many hundred hours and Skyrim is no exception here. Although I loved especially Morrowind too, I can honestly say that this is my favourite RPG so far and i can hardly imagine that even an Elder Scrolls VI can kick this from my throne. Skyrim, the part of Tamriel this game is about, is wonderful desined, very large and filled with hundreds of locations and thousands of quests. I have dozens of characters ranging from level 20 to over level 1000, have explored every location and cleared most of the quests many times, but however even after that amount of hours played, when i just stumble through the beautiful wilderness I often find some secret, amazing place, easter egg or just an interesting NPC i`ve never seen before. That gives an example of the amount of passion the developers had when designing this game. While the vanilla game itself will enjoy you for hundreds of hours, the thing that differences Skyrim from the large amount of other good RPGs is the modifiability. There are hundreds of thousands mods out there, nearly every sword and armor ever used in a video game or movie is available here. But then there are greater things like mods that add entire towns with dozens of new quests and stuff to explore. And then there are giant mod projects, like "Skywind", which adds the entire gameworld from "The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind" with all quests, towns, dungeons and NPCs to your Skyrim game. You can also change the entire game concept to what you like to play, I really enjoyed modding skyrim to a Fantasy-Survival-RPG with hunger, thirst, temperature status you must take care of and permadeath on legendary difficulty. The Goal? Simply look how long you`re able to survive and which level you can reach. Very enjoyale! To come to an end here, I can highly recommend this amazing game without any doubt.

review: Okay. This is the greatest game I've ever played. Just getting that out. In the uninspired craphole of Call of Duty and Battlefield, this game is a massive breathe of fresh air. Everthing is virtually PERFECT The Visuals The Music The Combat The Item System EVERYTHING IS IMMACULATE This is the first fantasy game in YEARS to feel like a fantasy game. Everything feels so unique and well done. The NPC's feel real, the visuals immerse you so quickly you'll be completely unaware of anything going on around you. At first the story seems very cliche but it works incredibley. The story mode is the perfect length. It's not as depressingly short as Batman: Arkham City yet not as annoying long as Portal 2. Even if the story doesn't quite quench your thirst for adventure, there are hundreds of side quests and side quest lines to keep you occupied The levelling system is smooth, and you actually have to practice to level up in any given skill tree. Want to level One-Handed combat? Grab a One-Handed Sword, head into the wilds and start slaughtering. Want to level illusion spells? Equip some, find some test subjects and see what your spells can do. I have this game on Xbox 360 and PC, and I honestly prefer the Xbox version BUT, there is one thing the PC can do that consoles can't. MODS There are thousands of mods that can do anything from adding a huge arena to the vast game world, to making NPC's run indoors when a dragon attacks a village. Mods can help you iron out the few imperfections this game has. The game world is vast, sprawling and beautiful. Anything from a shack inhabited by a little old lady who turns out be an evil and powerful witch, to huge and active cities full of lootable shops, houses that can all be broken into and individual and interesting NPC's that interact with you in different ways depending on how you act. With unique and hand-crafted temples and dungeons, villages deep in the mountains, lairs inhabited by sleeping dragons and secret crypts that all somehow link to a quest. Saying this game has "good graphics" is a massive understatement. The textures look a little low-res when you get up close but the world never fails to immerse you with it's beauty and realism There are 3 basic ways to go in this game: The Warrior, The Thief and The Mage. If you choose the path of the warrior you will be responible for levelling thing like One-Handed, Two-Handed, Blocking and Heavy Armour, which eventually allows you to pulverize any enemy who dare stand in your way. If you choose the Path of the Thief (like I did) You will have to level skill like Lockpicking, Pickpocketing (my personal favourite) and Sneak, which allows you to slither through any nook and cranny silently and maybe doing some looting If you choose the Path of the Mage, you will have to level skills such as Illusion, Destruction, Conjuration and Restoration, which allow you to apply paralysis, poisoning and enslavement on any and all NPC's. Restoration, however, allows you to heal the wounds of you and your allies. The DLC packs for this game include in order: Dawnguard, Hearthfire and Dragonborn. Dawnguard is my favourite of the 3. In it, you are told of a vampire hunting group called the Dawnguard. If you visit Fort Dawnguard, you will be sent to Castle Volkhier, were you will meet, you guessed it, VAMPIRES!!! At this point you're given the choice to join the Vampires and reek havok OR Get the hell out of there and return to Fort Dawnguard and become a vampire hunter. I won't spoil anything but it's definately worth what it costs. Hearthfire is rather simple. This expansion pack allows you to purchase land, build a home and start a family. It's nice but building a house is hard work, which I enjoy, but you need a lot of patience. Finally, Dragonborn. I didn't like Dragonborn that much, but it was a fun expansion and definately worth it. Tip: If you stand atop the highest southern mountain on a clear day, you can see Whitegold Tower in Cyrodil, from Oblivion! How cool is that!?!? Bethesda has created the perfect western RPG and one I will compare future WRPG's to in the future. It may sound like I'm kissing Bethesda's  here, but they deserve nothing less after this masterpiece. If you were a fan of any Elder Scrolls game before this, you WILL enjoy the hell out of Skyrim. The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim easily earns the score of 10/10. PERFECT If you've bothered to read this far without running off and buying the game, do it. NOW. You can't realize what a good game is until you play this game.

review: ===Edited as of January 2nd, 2015=== It's not as good as Morrowind or Oblivion if we start talking about storytelling and immersion, but Skyrim is a hell of a game, and it won Game of The Year back in 2011 for an obvious reason: It's great, and I know it really is, when after 230 hours of game I still dicovering new places and things about it. Even now in 2015, if you ask me if you should buy it, I would say yes without thinking twice, it's a must-play along with the rest of The Elder Scrolls series, and just like any other Bethesda game, when you start heavilly modding it, it'll become another game, and then another game, and then another game again, and in the end it'll be like you have bought a pack with at least 5 games, and not just one.

review: Really nice open world RPG with gorgeous nordic landscapes. The biggest downside is that quests and the charracters are a bit "flat". I wish I would care when I kill some random farmer in the world, so I guess the immersion is lacking here. But you get distracted enough by other things that you kind of forget it. If you've played past Elder Scrolls game, expect the same experience, for some people it's good, for other it isn't. Most important thing : Mod it, mod it, mod it. This game is day and night with mods and it fixes a ton of issues Bethesda did not care to fix.

review: Best RPG in my opinion. Large range of modifications from new player homes to better graphics. The original game however is still beautiful, fun and huge open world with dragons, thieves, giants and even seals. Storyline is perfect and can be very cheap when on special. DLC worth having a look at when on special. Large variety of weapons, clothing, enemies, NPC's and locations. Quests are plentiful and trading cards and achievments exist as well. 9.8/10

review: Skyrim is an AMAZING game. I've put 109 hours into this masterpiece and do not regret it. The story is a bit short IMO but the side missions and the open world bring you a whole lot of stuff to do. Run up mountains. Enter dungeons / Caves. Ride a horse. Kill a dragon. Buy a house. Get married. etc. And btw, 10/10 for using consolecommands and changing my name into Jesus and flying up to the skies. EDIT: Played a bit of Skyrim last night, went on a horse.

Got legendary on pc, testing the limits of modding and console commands is really making this more exciting than the last 2 play-throughs. Especially finding the room that has 1 of everything that you can console command coc to, I've done all these f'n quests before, it's great to be able to just go grab all the game's keys and super special items so you can just enjoy your play-through without trivial bs. Also, thomas the truck.  yeah. Oh, one more thing, it looked good on 360. it looked great on ps3. It loads a billion times faster and plays WAY smoother on PC. Got my ps3 controller wirelessly hooked up with motionjoy and this is the best skyrim experience I've ever had.

review: Skyrim is one of those games that have a very poor storyline the truth is that it takes only about an hours to finish skyrim main storyline. And if you play for good storyline dont buy skyrim get a different game. Skyrim is that kind of game where every dungeon will look the same each side quest will be generic and similar, however what makes skyrim a game I will recommend to others is the ability to do what you want as a player. Skyrim allows you to freeroam in a huge open world, as well as ability to mod the game. Modding this game is what it means to play skyrim download 30+ mods and explore endless possibilities. If you like to mess around with games and you wouldnt mind to spend few minutes to understand how to add mods to your game then pick skyrim because I could play this game for days with no sleep as long as I find a good pack of mods. However without the mods this game can only keep one interested for 10hours or so.

review: Skyrim is no doubt one of the best games I have ever played. I got hooked once I got into the game. It'll take you up to a dozen hours just to fully explore and get to know the world of Skyrim. Despite the few bug and glitches, I have spent up to 100 hours on this game and absoutley loved it. The graphics are absoutely stunning and the vast amount of variety in this game is amazing. Combat and character progression are just one side of the game. Traveling the world and completing quests is the other, and this is the heart and soul of Skyrim. The world is a snow-covered land full of mountains, rivers, waterfalls, tiny villages, deep caves, and huge cities. While there might not be a lot of diversity in the look of outdoor areas, the environments and views are still breathtaking. Players could spend hours just wandering around the vast terrain and still not find everything, as there are lot of hidden locations and treasures. Simply veering off the beaten path to explore some mysterious ruins might open up a whole new quest line. Thankfully, it is easy to get around in Skyrim, as fast-travel is still available along with horses to ride and carriages that move between all of the major cities in the game. The main quest of Skyrim is woven so seamlessly into the overall world that it is almost indistinguishable. Players take on the role of a Dragonborn, one prophesied to return to the land at a time when dragons are returning in order to stand against them. While there are not a lot of gut-wrenching, role-playing decisions to be made, the experience of simply visiting all the locations and meeting those who live within it is more than adequate. Regardless of the choices that are made, NPCs rarely respond to the main character any differently, so unless players go on a killing spree, no one takes notice. The atmosphere and setting of Skyrim is fantastic. The graphical process at work here is impressive, but the new game engine's impact mostly shows in the world at large, as its characters are still fairly expressionless. That aside, the graphical detail for even those dead-faced characters looks considerably better than any prior Bethesda offering and is all the better for it. Despite taking place in a rugged snowy area, locations are highly detailed and do an amazing job of really shaping the world into what one would expect from an area like this. The game's soundtrack further adds to this atmosphere, as music fades in and out to complement the presence or absence of dramatic moments. The visuals, music, and high-quality voice acting all add up to a very immersive experience. Side note : HAGRAVENS SCARE THE S H I T OUTTA ME .

review: Bought this game 3 times,first on console then to PC for normal edition and now Legendary edition cuz obviously the almighty Gaben will give good deals. Spent over a few hundred hours on my Xbox and now with my PC. Definitely the best game to invest on before your exams, Altogether, the story is immersive and mods on pc makes it a bloody good game. Wasting lives since 2011 - 10/10 IGN

review: First, let me start off by saying that I have 750+ hours on this game. I started on my Xbox 360 long ago, bought it on steam once I joined the glorious PC master race, and migrated my saves with a flash drive. And then I said, "Screw that", and started all over again. Anyway, let's get into this incredible game I wasted so many hours of my life on. GRAPHICS: It all depends on your specs, and if you mod it. -Low Resolution, no mods: It's essentially a large N64 game, polygons EVERYWHERE. -Med Resolution, no mods: Looks very good, water and shadows are rought, and large models may repeat patterns, but still looks great. -High Resolution, no mods: Probably the most beautiful game you'll ever see, if you have the capabilities to run it. Everything looks great, the water, shadows, trees, even that angry Nord hitting you in the face with a battleaxe. -High Resolution, with mods: Naked people,  arrows, and bondage slaves everywhere. Be careful with skyrim mods, with resolution packs, the game looks incredibly lifelike, but theres some... strange ones out there (MLP: Friendship is Murder Mod Pack) -Graphics: 10/10 (It all depends on your specs) Story: The great thing about Skyrim is that, while the main quest is short, and fairly easy to complete, theres an INSANE amount of quests and alternate storylines! It goes from delivering a sword literally 100 feet away from where you're standing, to stopping a midget symbolic representation from getting beaten up by a normal sized symbolic representation, to waking up after getting black-out drunk with a god and fondling a religious statue, to SO MUCH MORE. And with all the radiant quests and random encounters, you'll never finish it all. Storyline/Quests: 9/10 (A lot of them repeat) AI/NPCs: Whoo, boy. This is where Skyrim (And really almost all Bethesda/Zenimax games) meet some kind of downfall. Updates have fixed them a lot since the release, but many, MANY times has a follower died because they walked straight into my own spell/sword swing, or repeated the same line over and over, or got stuck. Recently, it's been much better, but its still not very good. The characters themselves, however, are all very good. They all have backstories, and motives, and are all unique. AI/NPCS: 7.5/10 Lore: Theres hundreds of books, and character dialogue, and quests all to tell you the story of Tamriel and individual characters. The tiniest things have their own mention. Even if you've never played a single Elder Scrolls game before this, you'll pick it up easily. But, that being said, it can be overwhelming when you first start, and everything revolves around past lore. Lore: 9/10 Overview: Pros: -Great graphics -Good combat system -Skill trees let you become whatever you want -Story is incredible -Nearly no end to the amount of quests -Easy to mod, and a massive modding community -Hail Sithis Cons: -ING AI -High specs needed to run at full potential -Mods and DLC can be wonky with existing saves -No lollygaggin' Overview: 9/10 What, did someone steal your sweetroll?

The dawnguard DLC is fun and gives you alot more side quests with a good main quest line. But the best DLC so far has to be the Dragonborn DLC im still going through doing the black books i mean theres alot of stuff to do so you wont get bored with the plot and say "Omg this sucks why did i even buy it" because i love it.

The world of Skyrim is beautiful and has a really good atmosphere including an awesome soundtrack. In Skyrim you are a Dragonborn and you must stop the invasion of dragons and defeat the legendary dragon Alduin. You can customzie your character pretty well and you can defeat your enemies in many ways, ranging from seperating their heads from the rest of the body to incinerating them to nothingness.

review: This is the game the never, ever ends. I picked this game up thinking I wouldn't like it having never played a previous TES game before. Sat in my Library untouched for about a month or two, and finally took the plunge. I was wrong. I was so very, very wrong. This is probably the best purchase I've ever made on steam. Add in the unlimited potential of modding, and it's an adventure that continues forever. I've probably restarted over a hundred times by now with a new character, and still only have beaten Alduin once. ONCE. There's still so much more do to and explore that I'm still discovering quests and areas and little hidden things. I still can't believe how much there is to do and I'm still finding more. At it stands I'll probably wake up one day having lost all touch with reality and actually start seeing the world as Skyrim with how much I've played. And I'm totally ok with that.

review: If I had to choose between this game, and my girlfriend. I'd pick this game. EDIT: I'm single now ON A MORE SERIOUS NOTE: This game is the best in its genre. In previous Bethesda games they made a sad balance in between Questing, and Exploration. Some having more quests and less places to go, and others having very few quests and more places to explore. But in Skyrim, there is no shortage of quests, and if you are like myself and just wander around aimlessly, you will stumble into places that just blow your mind. Every time I have replayed this game, I stumbled into something new. For more info i'd very much recommend mods, with mods such as texture packs, difficulty, quests, armor, and weapons, this games replay value is endless. Go through the game once with plain skyrim, then mod the hell out of it. Overall I'd rate this game an EASY 10/10. If you haven't already. Please buy it, give it a little, and I swear you will be hooked.

review: An epic game made all the more epic by the fact that it is so easy to mod and so well supported by the modding community. The Elder Scrolls series has a large following and often you will hear people argue over each new TES game comparing it to the last, but for me each TES game stands on its own merits, and Skyrim is no exception. The story is pretty good and there are plenty of side quests, but what makes Skyrim so great even when not modded is its large and open nature. This is a land you can just pick a direction and with no quest in mind and just explore. You will find danger and excitement on your journey ... and loot. Lots and lots of loot. But once you start modding this game, that is when you unlock the true value that is Skyrim. Potentially thousands more hours content (for free) in a game that can be improved ten thousand different ways from graphics, textures and sounds all the way to game mechanics and user interface changes. You can make the game exactly what you need it to be, and play it for so long you may still be playing when the next game in this series comes out.... and sometimes longer than even that. If you are interested in modding the PC version of the game, be sure to check out my guide for beginners:

review: I was stacking books on a shelf in my house in Whiterun, one of Skyrim's major cities, when I noticed a weapon rack right beside it. I set a sacrificial dagger in one slot, an Orcish mace in the other. They were on display for nobody but me and my computer-controlled housecarl, Lydia, who sat at a table patiently waiting for me to ask her to go questing. The chest upstairs was reserved for excess weapons and armor, the bedside table for smithing ingots and ores, the one next to the Alchemy table for ingredients. I'd meticulously organized my owned virtual property not because I had to, but because tending to the minutia of domestic life is a comforting break from dealing with screaming frost trolls, dragons, a civil war, and job assignments that never seem to go as planned. It's even a sensible thing to do; a seemingly natural component of every day existence in Skyrim, one of the most fully-realized, easily enjoyable, and utterly engrossing role-playing games ever made. Part of what makes it so enjoyable has to do with how legacy Elder Scrolls clutter has been condensed and in some cases eliminated. In Skyrim, there's no more moon-hopping between hilltops with a maxed out Acrobatics skill. That's gone, so is Athletics. The Elder Scrolls V pares down the amount of skills and cuts out attributes like Endurance and Intelligence altogether. There's no time wasted on the character creation screen agonizing over which skills to assign as major. You don't assign major and minor skills at all, but instead pick one of ten races, each with a specific bonus. High Elves can once a day regenerate magicka quickly, Orcs can enter a berserk rage for more effective close-range combat. These abilities are best paired with certain character builds  the High Elf regeneration is useful for a magic user  but don't represent a rigid class choice. Major decisions don't need to be made until you're already out in the world and can try out magic, sneaking and weapon combat, emphasizing first-hand experience over instruction manual study, letting you specialize only when you're ready. It contributes to the thrilling sense of freedom associated with life in Skyrim. Do a quest, kill a dragon, snatch torchbugs from the air, munch on butterfly wings or simply wander while listening to one of the best game soundtracks in recent memory. Despite the enormity of the world and the colossal amount of content contained within, little feels random and useless. Even chewing on a butterfly wing has purpose, as it reveals one of several alchemical parameters later useful in potion making at an alchemy table. Mined ore and scraps of metal from Dwemer ruins can be smelted into ingots and fashioned into armor sets, pelts lifted from slain wildlife can be turned into leather armor sets, and random books plucked from ancient ruins can trigger hidden quest lines that lead to valuable rewards. Skyrim's land mass is absolutely stuffed with content and curiosities, making every step you take, even if it's through what seems like total wilderness, an exciting one, as something unexpected often lies just over the next ridge. Many times the unexpected takes the form of a dragon. Sometimes they're purposefully placed to guard relics, sometimes they swoop over cities and attack at seemingly random times. In the middle of a fight against a camp of bandits a dragon might strike, screaming through the sky and searing foe and friendly alike with frost or flame. Momentarily all on the battlefield unite, directing arrows and magic blasts upward to knock down the creature, creating impromptu moments of camaraderie -- a surprising change from what may have been yet another by-the-numbers bandit camp sweep. Dragons show up often, their presence announced by an ominous flap of broad wings or an otherworldly scream from high above. The scale and startling detail built into each creature's appearance and animations as it circles, stops to attack, circles again and slams to the ground makes encounters thrilling, though their predictable attack patterns lessen the excitement after a few battles. In the long run they're far less irritating than the Oblivion gate equivalent from The Elder Scrolls IV, can be completed in a few minutes, and always offer a useful reward. Killing a dragon yields a soul, which powers Skyrim's new Shout system. These are magical abilities any character can use, you don't have to specialize in spell casting to slow time, throw your voice, change the weather, call in allies, blast out ice and fire, or knock back enemies with a rolling wave of pure force. Even if you favor sword, shield and heavy armor and ignore magic entirely, you'll still be able to take full advantage of these abilities provided you find the proper words  each Shout has three  hidden on Skyrim's high snowy peaks and in the depths of forgotten dungeons, serving as another reason to continue exploring long after you've exhausted the main quest story, joined with the Thieves Guild, fought alongside the Dark Brotherhood, or thrown your support behind one of the factions vying for control of Skyrim. Not only is this land under assault by dragons, long thought to be dead, it's also ripped in two by civil war. You can choose one side or the other, but so much of the allure of Skyrim is how, even outside of the confines of quest lines, the embattled state of the world is evident, and steeped in a rich fictional legacy. Lord of the Rings this is not, but with the release of every Elder Scrolls game, the fiction becomes denser, and the cross-referencing for long-time fans all the more rewarding. Skyrim's residents are all aware of current events. They'll comment on the civil war, some sympathizing with the rebels, others thinking the establishment sold its soul. The peasants complain about the Jarls who control each settlement, the Jarls complain about the rebels or foreign policy, the overprotective College librarian complains when I drop dragon scales all over his floor; many characters feel like whole, distinct personalities instead of vacuous nothings that hand out quests like a downtown greeter hands out flyers for discount jeans. Characters stereotype based on race, they double-cross at even the slightest hint it might be profitable, and they react to your evolving stature within the world. It makes a ridiculous realm, filled with computer-controlled cat people and humanoid reptiles, demon gods and dragons, feel authentic, like a world that existed long before you showed up and will continue to exist long after you leave.

review: Perhaps one of the most amazing games I've ever played in my life. As a lover of the sword n' shield era, I always find myself jumping head-first into Bethseda's Elder Scrolls series. The story is immense but it doesn't rush you; This game demands that you explore every crevice it has to offer. The creation-workshop mechanic is very well made, you could literally be anything, fight anything and nearly have no limits; But challenging as it should be. An extrordinary piece of work that you should not miss out on!

Nearly endless in it's vanilla form, if you mod it out, it really is the fantasy world that never ends. Gaming, storytelling and immersion doesn't get much better than this. Buy it. Wait for the Legendary Edition to go on sale and pick it up for a song. Mod it. There are endless possibilities and it is much easier than you think.

review: A superb game, with many hours of story, faction and miscellaneous quests. Lots of locations & landmarks to find and explore from ancient dwarven cities, caves outfitted by bandits to ritual sites inhabited by necromancers or simply the local wildlife. With skill trees that you can shape, and an array of weapons and/or spells to use, you can customize your character how you like. Single or dual weapon/magic wielding or even a combination of both further allow you to personalize the playing experience, as well as providing countless setups of hostile & allied NCP alike, All providing different experiences on consecutive playthroughs. The Dawnguard & Dragonborn DLCs are a must have addition to the game, adding new armor, weapons & clothes to the game [even if only to make your character look even more awesome] as well as new locations & enthralling story lines. The only thing I miss from the Oblivion days, is the ability to create my own spells, but as Skyrim as a nation generally dislike magic I can see why it was left out. But ... with the steam workshop this and anything else you just did quite like can be added, changed or removed. New cities, more crowded cities, new quests, greater detailed trees, or a simple as a re-skin for your favourite armor, its all in there, somewhere. But I would urge you to play through without mods at least once. A must get game that I am so glad to have played and even though I have at this point I will probably spent 100s more hours playing. 10/10

Well, with Skyrim you can, Skyrim is a typical Bethesda game, where you get to create your own character using the games many customization features, you'll then be able to play the game however you want in an almost limit less world filled with skeletons, zombies, wizards and other kinds of monsters. Once you've completed the main game you'll be able to add more quests, followers, houses, overhauls, pets, textures, weapons, armor and so much more via some of the many mods that the community creates. Skyrim is an amazing singleplayer RPG, with endless possiblitys because of the amout of mods created by the awesome community.

review: In my mind the game is a masterpiece, the game looks amazing, and is in my mind very well made, as for the storyline, I adore it. There are of course a few minor things in the game, for example the horses, they move very weird and they are quite slow compared to walking. The game itself is a fantastic experience with superb gameplay, beautiful graphics, and majestic music. The fun part is you can get mods installed easily on the game through the workshop on steam, its fun to mod the game with several mods and make it after your own liking. The game over all gets a 9.5 out of 10, as its a superb and amazing game with a fantastic storyline.

review: It seems long ago now, looking back, when this game was first released. I had played Morrowind, I have played Oblivion, loved both, and I was left eagerly awaiting Skyrim. And I was not disappointed. Bethesda again reminds me of what true quality is. In short, this game is amazing. But more that that, it gives everyone who would give it a chance, everyone that would allow themselves to gently fall into it's landscape, a fantastical escape from the occasional blandness of life. We all need escapes, time away from the coffee and the concrete, and Skyrim provides a window. It's not a replacement for anything, it's merely an avenue to get lost in your own imagination. Those who can't let go, can't dream of fantasy, should avoid Skyrim. For everyone else, I high recommend you give this game a try and give yourself a chance to get lost in its wonder.

With so many different ways to play the vanilla game how can you not become enmeshed in the grandeur and spectacle that is Tamriel? And just when you think you are done someone makes a mod that you have to try and then the cycle begins anew. It's not real but the feelings are.

review: The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is a game where you play as a soulless serial  who tries to suck the souls out of innocent dragons. This game is absolutely stunning on low graphics, and you have to play it on low graphics or your game will crash from entering a building. The combat system has REDEFINED the Elder Scrolls series, as it is changed to a right-click to block, and a left-click to hit. The entire modding community of The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is made up of 40-year-old perverts who sit in there mother's basements and try to make graphically enhancing mods for nude characters that have visible neck seams. I would rate The Elder Scrolls V: Skyman a 12/10.

These days I remember Skyrim for all the times I've been screwed over by bugs and glitches that would hinder me in completing quests. But those 200+ hours were not completely wasted, partially but not completely. Also don't buy the dlc unless they are on 99 % sale or something... Considering they cost more than the base game and add maybe 5 hours extra content and a few useless items for gear that is not even better than the crap you farmed for a hundred hours in the vanilla game!!!!!!!"#!#!" 8/10 - Oblivion was better (don't kill chickens)

review: [warning, this review was originally posted on 12 Aug, 2012 and when done none of the existing DLCs were out, nore most of the mods available for this game atm] Ok so after i think i've done absolutely everything there was to do in teh original game (cos ofc there are a bazillion mods out there). I managed to do every single non radiant quest there is in uesp's Skyrim list, and tried most radiants i could do before getting bored of them. Checked all skills, others maxed by natual game play (Archery) others by cheating (Alchemy omfg). Achievements all done (hellz yeah) And after a really really long time have passed since my last review. There's so much to say about Skyrim and still this feels like a very tinny opinion analysis to what i would feel like writing hehe The time came and I think it's time to say a few words for this game.. Oh and... pardon my crazy grammar.. u gonna have your eyes poped [warning given] :p The following does not include information about specific mods, neither DLC. OK...so... Skyrim; The fifth game in the Elder Scrolls series. A game taking place 200 years after "The Great Anguish" (the war between Daedra and the people of Tamriel). Lets take this in parts as i often love to do in my reviews. Graphics Bethesda did quite a good job with the graphics. The difference is noticable moving from Oblivion to Skyrim. But some times it feels like it's not good enough. My rig is not a really strong one. Core2Duo at 2.13 and a GTS250 the strongest i could find from all the series at that time. I was pretty happy to see that Skyrim was actually runable in pretty high specs. not ultra. But the frame rate was still hanging there after spawning 200 guards and 4 dragons over a vilage letting me sit back and watch the show. So after my experiece and after watching reviews on youtube with tests with a lot better GPUs out there, i have to admit that Bethesda could have done better. It took a noticable number of mods on order to make Skyrim run in HD textures, better lighting and shading, better fire and magic effects, better mapping, better geometries etc. And most of them out right a couple of months after the game was released. Why? Why is a game that comes out near the end of 2011 needs so many mods to have it's graphics perform better just a few months after release while teh game itself took so long to come out? And why is peoples' and animals' hair and fur so.. sticky and not-so-well rendered? Don't get me wrong there. My whinning entrance shall not deceive you about the graphics of the game. The engine is still brilliant. Offers unlimited possibilities. Super vast enironment, very well designed nature and animals. The nature.... God the natire is godlike. I felt like walking through the entire map than fasttraveling. I could stare at the trees, the flowers, the desert, the rivers and the waterfalls. I felt like i could fall in love with the scandinavian culture and the history of teh vikings. I literaly spent hours just staring views and details from all over the places. Also the characters are fascinating. Very realistic face designs. Great animation. The job done is amazing. But just not that perfect. When Morrowind came, graphics seemed centuries ahead from Daggerfall. When Oblivion came, graphics seemed centuries ahead from Morrowind. When Skyrim came.... graphics seemed like 6 years ahead from Oblivion.... just like how it literally was (maybe got too subjective there) Scripting and AI The AI is very good. Some enemies can find cheaky ways to hurt you like using spells from large distances with hit and run tactics. The dialogues are very good, the impact of your decisions won't bring great changes in teh world, but they will influence the average way your character acts and reacts during dialogue and also how people like you and stuff or even how characters from around the map will react at your presence. Can't say there was something really extraordinary. Most things were as expected. Companions are always fun (and even mroe fun with mods). Marriege system was a good idea (but also took some moding to get to be more interesting). Also a word about characters. All NPCs have very natural and realistic actions and reactions furing quests and/or interractions. Also great to see their daily occupations. Each NPC has a routine. Wether if it's a guard or a hunter, a shopkeeper or a fisherman. There's some really great effort put there. Scripting issues will become a matter of daily routine once of start checking out mods. Collisions are some times imminent even while using special tools like Wrye Bash. Quests A bunch of quests. Radiant and non-radiant quests. Stories. Guilds (most of what we've already seen from Oblivion). Chances to help or kill people. Choosing your way through. Gaining special items. Finding rare kickass gear. Getting and house. Doing "jobs". (also completing some nice achievements). Training. Tons of stuff to do. And of cource, a super cool main story to follow. HOWEVER. Quest lines are in average short. You can be easily done with most guilds in a matter of few hours (except the thieves guild if you want that achievement). Where did all the storytelling go? Yes, everything is cool and fine, but sometimes it literally takes half the time to complete a guild's quest line that what it took you to do the same guild's questline in Oblivion. For example, Oblivion's mages guild had me doing quests for days while in Skyrim the mages guild was a matter of a few hours. Even if my memory is bad on this, the feeling of short storylines is strong. the whole feeling about guild quests; Very enjoyable. But kinda short. Bugs Bugs in games. Can't do with them. Can't do without them... Skyrim has enough bug reports from around the communities. But i for once can across a very very few of them during the original game. In particular only 2, during 2 different questlines which i had to overcome by using the console to move the next quest stage after verifying the nature of the bug. I've seen funny stuff about bugs through the net. I guess I was a damn lucky bstd i gotta admit that Music Still missing the awesomeness of some tracks from Morrowing, maybe a few from Oblivion. Skyrim stands alone with its own character. Sure the elder scrolls nature is noticable in most themes. You know, the usual epic music, orchestra styled tunes, some calm nature backround noice. However still Skyrim's tunes is a bit unique. It doesn't connect with TESIII and TESIV. There is this whole viking and gothic(no, not the modern goth thing, im talkign about the ancient middle northern european goth war cultur and nature of things) nothern feeling in everything around the music. A stronger epicness, a war rythm, a sound with a serious and raw character in it. I actually kinda liked that a LOT. Gameplay Absolutely awesome. Little things to say. You just have to play teh game to see for yourself. Dual dual wield in weapons and magic. Some awesome and epic slow motion or cut scenes in battles. Interacting it absolutelly ing e-v-e-r-y-t-h-i-n-g around you. Gazillion of items to use and interact with. From weapons and armor, to flowers and butterflies and bugs (yes, you can even catch and collect butterflies!) Value through time Bethesda may not have given their best for this game, but they know what they are doing. Mods will add years in the game. Skyrim is still an awesome piece of The Elder Scrolls series. However i fear it won't last as long as Oblivion did. A percentage of the fanbase did compain a lot. And you can see that their studios could have put more work on the game while they didn't (maybe because they wanted to work on the future MMORPG title[?]) I personaly fear that the game will be left without many additions. The Elder Scrolls had shaped a "culture" of bringing tones of awesome things v

review: Ive played every single game of the Elder Scrolls Franchise for many hundred hours and Skyrim is no exception here. Although I loved especially Morrowind too, I can honestly say that this is my favourite RPG so far and i can hardly imagine that even an Elder Scrolls VI can kick this from my throne. Skyrim, the part of Tamriel this game is about, is wonderful desined, very large and filled with hundreds of locations and thousands of quests. I have dozens of characters ranging from level 20 to over level 1000, have explored every location and cleared most of the quests many times, but however even after that amount of hours played, when i just stumble through the beautiful wilderness I often find some secret, amazing place, easter egg or just an interesting NPC i`ve never seen before. That gives an example of the amount of passion the developers had when designing this game. While the vanilla game itself will enjoy you for hundreds of hours, the thing that differences Skyrim from the large amount of other good RPGs is the modifiability. There are hundreds of thousands mods out there, nearly every sword and armor ever used in a video game or movie is available here. But then there are greater things like mods that add entire towns with dozens of new quests and stuff to explore. And then there are giant mod projects, like "Skywind", which adds the entire gameworld from "The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind" with all quests, towns, dungeons and NPCs to your Skyrim game. You can also change the entire game concept to what you like to play, I really enjoyed modding skyrim to a Fantasy-Survival-RPG with hunger, thirst, temperature status you must take care of and permadeath on legendary difficulty. The Goal? Simply look how long you`re able to survive and which level you can reach. Very enjoyale! To come to an end here, I can highly recommend this amazing game without any doubt.

review: Safe to say this is one of the best games out there if you like adventure and magical storytelling. I loaded this with mods like Climates of Tamriel, Vanilla Nights, Real Rain, HD textures and Purewater. Its stunning on ultra!! Allthough im not a fan of medieval kind of games, Skyrim really sucked me in and i love to explore this game. It only gets better and better :) You should play this!

review: I would not have recommended this game three years ago. However the mod community, lowered price and *excellent* expansion pack content make Skyrim a must-own, and not for the vanilla experience. I will stand by my opinion that Oblivion was better, especilly in the uniqueness of the quests it offered as opposed to "find x in cave full of draugr", and don't get me started on the BS "but the combat is better in Skyrim" argument since the same bad combat system is just hid behind fancy execution moves. But the expansion pack content is genuinely interesting and through modding I've made my game a hardcore and fast-paced experience that feels not unlike Diablo, (to clarify that's in pure intensity and not literally like a dungeon-crawler). It's disappointing to have to merely say "the mods make this game" but that's the harsh reality in this case. The expansion content however, as I've stated twice already, is high-quality and only emphasises how mediocre the vanilla game is. Edit: Also I would highly recommend playing this game with a controller. The character feels more weighty to me that way, although that could be personal preference - you WILL have trouble playing an archer that way.

review: Skyrim is by far one of my most treasured and favourite games released out there! It's vast/open world gvies you an over-abundance of freedom to do what you please! Skyrim provides a great element of choice as you have the freedom to be who YOU want to be, and some of your choies may influence alternate paths to a story once foretold. You can choose to be the hero, or the villain. You have been bestoed a gift from the gods, in the dragons tounge "Dovakhiin" you have the power of your voice, and by destiny the dragonborn is the only mortal who can slay and rid the world from the awakining of the dragons. As Quoted - "The Empire of Tamriel is on the edge. The High King of Skyrim has been murdered. Alliances form as claims to the throne are made. In the midst of this conflict, a far more dangerous, ancient evil is awakened. Dragons, long lost to the passages of the Elder Scrolls, have returned to Tamriel. The future of Skyrim, even the Empire itself, hangs in the balance as they wait for the prophesized Dragonborn to come; a hero born with the power of The Voice, and the only one who can stand amongst the dragons" - Written by Bethesda Game Studios TracGod's Meta Score - 95/100

review: Skyrim was the first Elder Scrolls game that I bought, and I must say that it did not disappoint. The amount of depth to the quests and the world in general is unreal. Even after playing through the storyline once or twenty times, it feels like a new experience when you start a new game. I highly recommend it to just about everyone. My only complaint is that the dungeons sometimes start to feel repititive, but it still makes up for it by adding unique storylines to each. In summary, this game gets a 11/10.

review: Farengar secret-fire thought he was a boss, sending thugs after a vampire thief assassin. All was well for him besides the occassional feeding on him in his sleep (unbeknownst to him), until came the creation of a wizard. Now, this was no ordinary wizard, it was a wizard of the undead variety known as a lich. As anyone can tell you, a lich is a being of pure hatred and despair, doing as he pleases with anything or anyone unlucky enough to cross paths with one. Having heard of this wannabe "wizard", the lich set his sights on the jarl of Whiteruns' home of Dragonsreach. It was late that night when the lich hovered silently through the doors of the halls of Dragonsreach sensing Farengar nearby. He found Farengar asleep in his bed, not knowing the terror that hovered over his slumbering form. The Lich raised his hand as he awoke and tried fleeing in terror, but he knew there was no escape. The Lich banished him to the realm of nightmares that changes itself with each lightning strike making it a worse existance than before, known as the realm of Quagmire. He wont be sending thugs after anybody else. 10/10 would banish annoying wizard to nightmare dimension again.

The quests though can be interesting to try and complete when you do not get detailed directions. I have had to look up some of the quests now and then because the directions given in game were not in depth enough. Regardless though it is a fun game.

review: Skyrim is an open world action/adventure game. You can climb the tallest mountains (to a certain point then you can't go any further up), swim across massive lakes, fight dragons, explore dungeons, kill anyone(some poeple just faint then get back up). Basically you are free to do whatever you want, but what you choose to do affects what will happen. Can you forge armor? Make weapons?? You bet you can! Personally I think it is one of the best games I've ever played! I highly recommend it to anyone and everyone!

review: Alright, I must admit. I wasn't going to write a review but I've met a lot of people who don't believe that this game is good. Truly, it's a fantastic game that anyone can enjoy. The graphics by themself are ok, but you can get the free HD texture pack and it comes alive. Or just set graphics on high. Either way, weather it's graphics or story line you prefer, Skyrim offers both plus a million other things you didn't know you could love. It's the tiny details that leave us happy when we finally beat that giant or that bandit leader. The leveling system is brilliant and amazing. I've tried Oblivion after playing this game and so far both of them are incredible, but Skyrim stands out as the best. There are infinite options and infinite challenges that almost leave you wanting more. So if you doubt this game, don't play this game at work when you want a quick 30 minute break to try a new game. You'll need to call in sick because you'll be glued to this game all day. It will take over your life and you will thank Bethesda for it.

review: Im writing this reveiw to tell everyone to buy this game. This is one of the best games I have ever played. I have played it on xbox for over 500 hours and on pc. If you do not have this game then I would highly recomend buying this game. In this game you can be a warrior, mage, theif, vampire, warewolf and much more. The quest line is an amazing experience if you like action adventure games then you must buy it. After finishing the main missions there are a wide range of things to do and I dought you could get bored playing this game. Modding in this game is easy and makes the game even more fun to play. The only down side to this game is that it is not multiplayer. If they did bring out multiplayer for this game it would be the best game ever made. *Dont listen to the people that do not recommend the game, they know nothing of what they can do in this game. This game can go above the line with mods and is just amazing. The graphics are pretty good. Its can run on almost any pc but to play this game and you have a 75hz, 100hz, 120hz, 144hz monitor then you need to go into your settings and change it to 60hz. This game can only run at 60hz which does not change the graphics. WARNING IF YOU DO PLAY AT 60HZ+ THEN YOUR PROPS IN THE GAME ARE GOING TO GO CRAZY, SUCH AS CARRAGES ARE GOING TO FLY. You have been warned.* Thank you for reading my opinion on Skyrim. Hope you buy it and enjoy the endless fun.

review: Having already 533 hours now, I thought it was time to write a review. First of all, I'm a huge fan of the Elder Scrolls series. I played every one of them, and loved them all. Some more than others. However, I'll start by saying TES V is not my favorite in terms of story or characters. Almost none of the characters are really interesting, and the story was pretty bald. In RPG the story matters to me the most, but Skyrim had such beautiful locations and great gameplay, that I couldn't possibly dislike it. The graphics in Skyrim are beautiful, even without mods. And the locations are a huge improvement. Morrowind and the other games are pretty outdated, but they had different locations. Most locations in Oblivion were copy-pasted. However, Skyrim takes the best of both worlds. A lot of different, beautiful and interesting locations. Skyrim really encourages exploring because you might find loot or a very nice view. The soundtrack is as in every TES game, amazing. The voice actors did a great job, even though some actors seem to be re-used a lot. The gameplay was also a huge improvement. However, unlike previous games, magic seems pretty useless. The combat is fun, but might get boring after a while. It's not as hard as it was in Morrowind, but it depends if you find this good or not. Even after completing this game, the fun never stops. Skyrim has a very active modding community, with lots of different mods that make this game even nicer, and add tons of extra hours to the gameplay. If you're still not sure if you want this buy this game, you really should. It is really worth the price.

It's a great game, perfect for a medieval setting like Mount and Blade: Warband, except it has more fantasy in it, such as magic and the dragons. Either way, I would recommend this.

review: It seems long ago now, looking back, when this game was first released. I had played Morrowind, I have played Oblivion, loved both, and I was left eagerly awaiting Skyrim. And I was not disappointed. Bethesda again reminds me of what true quality is. In short, this game is amazing. But more that that, it gives everyone who would give it a chance, everyone that would allow themselves to gently fall into it's landscape, a fantastical escape from the occasional blandness of life. We all need escapes, time away from the coffee and the concrete, and Skyrim provides a window. It's not a replacement for anything, it's merely an avenue to get lost in your own imagination. Those who can't let go, can't dream of fantasy, should avoid Skyrim. For everyone else, I high recommend you give this game a try and give yourself a chance to get lost in its wonder.

review: The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is a game where you play as a soulless serial  who tries to suck the souls out of innocent dragons. This game is absolutely stunning on low graphics, and you have to play it on low graphics or your game will crash from entering a building. The combat system has REDEFINED the Elder Scrolls series, as it is changed to a right-click to block, and a left-click to hit. The entire modding community of The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is made up of 40-year-old perverts who sit in there mother's basements and try to make graphically enhancing mods for nude characters that have visible neck seams. I would rate The Elder Scrolls V: Skyman a 12/10.

review: I actually have a ton of hours on this. I got it retail a long time ago, only recently added it to my steam list, and that was after I got the addons. So I figured I should add my review to the multitude of thousands saying this is one of the best ES games. I have played them all, sadly I was part of the ESO fiasco right from the start, that has left me feeling so bad about it I dont think I ll go back to it. But I digress, Skyrim, get it, play it, love it.

review: When I first entered the world of Skyrim, I was immersed in a fantasy setting where I was quickly thrust into a position of power and entrusted with the responsibility to save the world. This is where the fantasy stops. Similarly to any human suddenly gifted with immesurable power I proceeded disregard the responsibilities of my newfound abilities and proceeded to instead enact horrible deeds on the city's guards and townsfolk. It begins to become painfully clear that Skyrim is not as much of a fantasy game as it is a digital exression of the depravity of humans when given the means to enact their deep and twisted desires. An excellent existential simulator questioning the depth of vileness to which a human soul can delve into, Skyrim poses many deep philosophical points such as tyrrany, racism and the uselessness of having a %based pickpocket system if you have quicksave and quickload and reaching the ultimate conclusion of 'f*ck it, if you kill dragons you must be right'.

review: Skyrim oh glorius skyrim. This game could be my favorite of all time. I must have made 20+ characters playing this game because I was so curios as to the different options to choose from. Going in to it I had no idea the lore or universe of the scrolls franchise but immediatley delved in. The lore is intereting and makes sense. The universe of the game feels somewhat freindly as you step into the open wilds of the tundra but talk to npc's and as you complete quests you begin to notice really how many insane problems Skyrim has. The game invites you to be a strong nordic viking, a stealthy theiving cat, or an expert mage. In all honesty though it encourages you to mix and match and do whatever you want. For example like being an elf who wears heavy armor or a nord who slits throats with dual daggers. It dosent really have many boundraies unlike some of bethesdas other games like fallout which is also one of my favorites despite bugs or flaws. I dont have a counter but I've put a lot of hours into this game(if you look at steam playtime it might be realtivley small because I used to play on 360). There are a number of things you can do like: -Finish the main quest -Get the best weapons and armor through smithing(very tedious) -Complete the companions quest line and other spoilers that I will not say -Complete the mages guild quest line -Complete the theives guild quest line -Complete the dark brotherhood quest line or destroy it by talking to Commander Caius -Choose sides in the great war and complete the quests to restore order for your chosen faction -Investigate the forsworn consipacy -If you have Dawnguard, Dragonborn, or hearthfire dlcs defintley do all you can in them -Do quests for the many daedric lords -Fufill side quests for the trobuled people in skyrim -Get as many Thu'um shouts as you can and kill as many dragons as you can -If you can get mods GET THEM the modding community has very talented people in it -And most inportantly have fun in the world and FusRoDah any guard that says he took an arrow in the knee 10/10

review: I highly recommend Skyrim. I have played the game for 102 hours now and I have still not completed all the achievments and I wish to play the game for a second time through, the story line is immersive and the scenery is picturesque. The game limitations are endless due to mods, making the game theoritcally impossible to complete. This game was revolutionary and unique, I mean in what other game can you kill a childs parents and then adopt that same child?

System and gameplay is so much in depth, more when you like something and suddenly you discover it has more "features" if you look deeper. I know it's blah blah blah but that how I found this system xD Storyline is one of the best! 50h isn't enough to finish the story.. Well, not for me specially when you give me RPG to play. Lel. Graphics.. Even though I'm running the game on Ultra with very nice and smooth fps, I had to downloaded the HighTextures and other graphics enhancment mods so I'd enjoy my moment in-game .. Jungle xD This game is sick! I couldn't drop it for a little so i'd finish Persona Q .. Which I just played the first 15min T.T Best of luck lol.

review: If you've played previous Elder Scrolls games, glitches and oddities don't come as a surprise. Nevertheless, Skyrim feature tighter combat, fewer bugs, improved graphics and so on. If there is anything to complain about in this game, it would be the user interface, inventory taking up A LOT of useless items, SOME bad acting, as you level up, the creatures you fight take FOREVER to kill by hitting them 30-40 times, and finally its replayability value. Creating characters is nice (even though it takes a very long time to get what you want done). Finding and completing quests is solid. I said all I disliked. The game succeeds in comparison to Elder Scrolls IV, and I am addicted to this game like a... person... playing games! Replayability value is hard to get back to though if you leave the game for a month or more. Anyways, great work on the game, this is more than I expected it to be with little to no struggle to get "used to". Postives: +Tons of content +Fun combat +Huge open world to explore +Modding tools +Deep character creation tools +A lot of side missions and long/endless gameplay +A lot of ways to improve graphics Negatives: Bug-free Horrible voice acting Poor character animations Overall: 9/10

review: This game is so excellent that I don't even feel worthy enough to review it. Suffice it to say that "the bar" in terms of Role Playing Games is just a plaything for Bethesda Game Studios.

review: Honestly, this is one of the best games I have ever played, it's up there on my lst with the Legend of Zelda games like OoT and LttP. Enough with that, back to the acutal review. If you ever loved Medivaeavl Fantasy as a kid, or still do (like I do), you will love this game. You can do whatever you want in this game. The stories are not tight like many other games I've played. You can turn from a Mage to Warrior in a blink of an eye, and back agian. Also, my 300 hours of playing this game doesn't give this review much justice as I first played on my Xbox 360 when it came out, but eventually bought it on the PC for mods, and it is sooo much better, In the end, we won't see a game as good as this in awhile, at least untill Bethesda makes Fallout 4 and/or The Elder Scrolls VI. (Or if Valve makes Half Life 3..) Last thing I would like to say is that Famitsu, a highly revered review magizine gave Skyrim a perfect 40/40 score, it was the first western game to get the perfect score, Grand Theft Auto 5 being the second.

review: In my time Skyrim has been one of the best games I've ever played.It has all you need for an indulging play. If you like medievil, dragon age, steel clashing things then I suggest Skyrim. I like skyrim for the freedom and the fact you dont need to choose a class you can make one be it, ranger, mage, battle-mage, warrior, swordsman, theif, assasin etc. its your choice. DLCs are a good addon but they are quiet pricey so the cheapest and the best(in my view) is Hearthfire, the others yea, killing fighting but hearthfire is one of my favourite. You can build your own house which I think is pretty cool and raise a familiy. So yes I suggest Skyrim I think its a great game and you should play it.

review: Quite possibly the greatest game to end the Xbox 360/Playstation 3 era. There is so much to do in this game - if you had 20 dollars to spare and you could only purchase one game in the next 4 years, this would be the game to buy. I have about 1000 hours collectively put into this game from 2011. I bought this game when it first came out (a few months after my high school graduation). I used to pirate games but thanks to this game, I now purchase games legitimately. Why? Because I realized that developers like this need that financial support. The amount of love that the development team put into this game is legendary. You can tell that they truly cared about creating a place that would forever last in your memories. I've beaten the game's main stories only twice, but there is still a crap-ton of stuff you can do afterwards. The game simply never ends. I often crave for the game's viking theme and it truly feels like a new game each time. Anyways, if you haven't purchased the game already, you truly NEED this game in your library. You cannot call yourself a gamer and NOT have played this game. Greatest game of all time (so far) 10/10.

Skyrim is so addictingly fun and extravagantly beautiful it ceases to amaze me. The modding community makes it all the better allowing you to expand the game to what it always felt like it wanted to be, but Bethesda couldn't manage to achieve.

review: 900 hours after a rude awakening in a rickety cart, a moment to reminisce on all that Life in Skyrim had to throw at you: * escape imminent death from beheading * escape imminent death from dragons, spiders, bears, wolves, trolls, vampires, elves, giants, dwarves * escape imminent death from soldiers, bandits, guards, vendors, bartenders, maids, bards, cooks, mages, farmers * escape imminent death from rockfalls, sinkholes, spikes, flamethrowers, waterfalls, slicers * escape imminent death from carrying too much, carrying too little, having everything but That One Thing(tm), having too many of That One Thing(tm), having the correct amount of That One Thing(tm) but at the wrong time, underdressing, overdressing, stepping on something, NOT stepping on something. shouting, not shouting, bribing, not bribing * escape imminent death from rushing, lingering, picking up books, being illiterate, pulling levers, ignoring levers All the while your wardrobe is a function of whatever you just looted off that last dead guy (or girl, or creature!) until in the midst of cheating death you discover you can actually learn to make your own stuff, if you manage to escape imminent death while hunting, gathering or mining. You start getting more confident as your wardrobe and your sharp or blunt implements grow in sophistication, only to discover there is also magic in this world, and imminent death can come out of shadows, or darkness, or distance, or other dimensions, in any combination of freezing, burning, electrifying, infecting, poisoning, or afflicting ways. So you learn to savour the sparse moments you can stop to replenish your strength, and experience the joys of numerous things to eat and drink that turn out to be imminent death in bite-sized portions. You discover that sleep, besides imminent death, also brings inter-dimensional travel. You stop and pick the flowers (mind the bees and firebugs), you take in the panoramic views from atop majestic mountains (mind your step), you woo the fair damsels (mind their temper and/or concealed dagger), you sing and drink and brawl (mind whose toes you step on). You travel and fight, talk and laugh with varying companions, sometimes human, sometimes not, sometimes they save you, sometimes you save them, sometimes they betray you, sometimes you betray them. You shout at people. You blow off steam with automatons. You talk with dogs. You dance with wolves. You trot with horses. You chat with bats. You roll with trolls. You parlor with dragons. You buy, and sell, but mostly you 'borrow'. You rent, or acquire, or build. You marry the wench of your dreams, and a dragon drops in, causing her to leave you at the altar. You adopt cute little orphans, to watch them spend hours every day honing their dagger skills while you desperately try not to fall asleep. Eventually, you realize you worked your way through many a death-defying career: * you were an adventurer (like me), and saved the world from a dragon. * you joined a group of liberal hippies that spend their life shouting at the skies * you negotiated a truce in a civil war * you took sides and massacred the others * you joined a group of assassins * you joined a group of thieves * you joined a group of mages * you joined a pack of werewolves * you joined a flock of vampires * you collected other-dimensional trophies * you did every quest * you killed every boss (some of them twice) * you visited every dungeon * you explored the length and breadth of the lands, the darkest reaches of the earth, the highest peaks, the deepest seas, the strangest planes of existence, and every single inn (because, we need to test the mead). In this one moment of self-congratulatory awe at the completeness of your own achievements, you hear a displaced voice whisper.... "Dude, you didn't even mod yet?". It is then you realize that these past 900 hours were really just the tutorial, the intro, the prelude, the awakening. You're never leaving this place. Ever. So speaketh The Voice. Unless of course, imminent death. (*) (*: Actually, death turns out to lead to singing and drinking mead and slaying dragons and then being sent back to keep doing some more imminent dying. Sorry. On the bright side, jiggling: it's real.)

review: Awesome game with nice graphics, the gameplay is amazing. Even though bethesda has got a reputation of releasing buggy and glitchy games, there are no real gamebreaking bugs. The two DLC's are amazing and the combat and magic system have seen a great improvement from The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion. And the leveling system is also very well thought out. There are only some complaints that aren't even worth mentioning, exept that the AI can be really bad sometimes. The heartfire DLC gives you the oppertunity to built a house and have childeren. While Dawnguard DLC and the Dragonborn DLC give you new locations and 2 brand new storylines with both amazing and fun quests. Worth the money and you will play this for hours of time. 10/10!

review: Skyrim. It's an Elder Scrolls game, which means you're going to have a huge world to explore again and that really is the main feature of the base game. The combat system, if you want to call it that, is unimpressive and magic feels more limited than it did in previous Elder Scrolls installments and the main storyline is acceptable but not great by any standards. However what Bethesda did do right is the creation of the world all this happens in. Dungeons and ruins are more varied compared to what they were like in Oblivion and the outside world is huge in its own right and allows for days worth of exploration. So despite its flaws I'd strongly recommend this game. There is however a lot of snow. You probably should be looking at an other title if you have a phobia for snow.

review: Skyrim is a game i would recommend to all players it has amazing graphics a good story and plenty of fun and dangerous quests to play through. The beggining is no different from most Elder Scrolls since once again the story starts with you being in prison or arrested. But past that Skyrim opens you to a new world full of caves,dungeons,cities,camps,and houses all throughout the world. But I also have problems with the game since th PC version is very glitchy. I sometimes take armor off a armor stand and put new armor on it then come back to see the old armor has duplicated replacing the armor I had put on there. You might think oh you now can give that armor to your followers or sell it! But this happens nearly everytime you leave your house and it is very frustrating. The game also glitches on quests causing me to go back to previous game files which is bad and is something that needs to be fixed. But in all Skyrim will always be one of the best games to ever be made. I have never seen any game like it and never will. 9/10

review: Must own for RPG fans, or dragon fans... or any fans... or anyone with a computer, Xbox360, or PlayStation 3... Update 3/1/2015: Just beat the Dragonborn DLC... This is the second (?) time you go to Solsteim (I didn't spell it right) off of Morrowind, as you also go there in TES 3: Morrowind as DLC. The characters were fleshed out, while maybe not emotional, but you could develop a slight bond with. The new island you can visit is awesome and the new Shout is bada$$. Worth $20.00.

review: The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is one of the most enjoyable RPG's I have ever played. The world is rich with detail, there are always quests to be completed, and you really can become immersed in the experience. Each town is chock full of things to do, be it brew some potions or poisons, craft your own weapons and armor, or bind enchantments to your gear. The dungeons have each been hand crafted with plenty of detail, and are full of secrets, traps, dangers, and rewards. While Skyrim's main quest may not be the best Bethesda has ever created, there are dozens of sidequests, and many of those I could really get involved in. The 4 guilds of Skyrim have their own perks and benefits to joining each; the magic uses of the College of Winterhold, the noble warriors of Jorrvaskr, the opportunistic theives of Riften, or the infamous Dark Brotherhood. The Civil War allows players to participate in the fight for either Skyrim's freedom, or its re-unification, however I thought that the war seemed too scripted, you cannot lose whichever side you fight for. However, I think that Skyrim's quests are one of its stronger suits. As is expected, Skyrim is the best looking Elder Scrolls game to date. Even without the use of any mods, the landscape is breathtaking, large, and diverse. The towns maintain a large feel to them, without bombarding the player with massive ammounts of content. Each has its own unique style and feeling, and were fun to explore. Skyrim has 2 major DLC's and one minor one. Dawnguard lets players fight against a growing vampire menace, terrorizing the towns of Skyrim in an effort to permanently block out the sun, or join the Dawnguard, and destroy the vampires once and for all. Dragonborn returns players to the island of Solstheim, previously visited in The Elder Scrolls 3: Bloodmoon. The island was created with care, and the main quest was one of the most enjoyable of the game. The inhabitants of Solstheim have plenty of tasks that they need you to do. Hearthfire allows players to construct their own house at 3 different locations, and have a full family by adopting up to 2 children. The best part of Skyrim is its huge community of modders. Whether it be on the Steam Workshop or the Skyrim Nexus, there are thousands of mods for skyrim, and many that have been made with extreme care, and feel as though they could have been in the base game, without feelings cheaty in any way. The replay value with mods is absolutely huge, and keeps Skyrim feeling fresh even 2 years after the release. I would encourage anyone who is willing to make a small investment for hours upon hours of fun, enjoyable gameplay, that keeps them coming back for more. Overall, I would rate Skyrim 9.2/10

review: great game. 200 hours in and I have finished the theives guild questline, dark brotherhood questline, and the college of winterhold questline, and have close to 50,000 gold. along with the quests, the DLCs are also worth the money. words of wisdom: Dragonborn DLC is not a good idea to purchase before level 40-50. I tried at level 5, kept on dying, tried again at 20, also kept on dying, and once again at level 45 and let me tell you, even then it is still pretty hard. The hearthfire DLC is pretty cool, you get to build a house, adopt kids, move in with your wife etc. The only problem is; be prepared to spend a lot of gold and collect a lot of recources, because you have to build EVERYTHING in your house. I mean EVERYTHING. Unless you want to spend 10,000 gold to have your housecarl (you can move people like lydia into your house) and have them decorate for you. overall, the game is very time consuming, fun, and well put together. 10/10

review: Some tips if you buy this game: 1. Kill the horse and driver that's driving you with the console at the start of the game (restart after sitting there for about 10 minutes). 2. Spawn in 20 bandits on top of a cliff and shout at them. 3. Type in the console "player.placeatme 00064b33 1000" (don't actually do this... unless you want to). 4. NEVER type "caqs" in the console. Just don't. 5. Download mods. A lot of them. 6. I mean it when I say don't type in "caqs" in the console. 7. pls dont type it in. srsly. 8. I ran out of ideas. 9. Just play the game. Welcome to Skyrim on the PC. P.S. Type "caqs" in the console.

review: When I first entered the world of Skyrim, I was immersed in a fantasy setting where I was quickly thrust into a position of power and entrusted with the responsibility to save the world. This is where the fantasy stops. Similarly to any human suddenly gifted with immesurable power I proceeded disregard the responsibilities of my newfound abilities and proceeded to instead enact horrible deeds on the city's guards and townsfolk. It begins to become painfully clear that Skyrim is not as much of a fantasy game as it is a digital exression of the depravity of humans when given the means to enact their deep and twisted desires. An excellent existential simulator questioning the depth of vileness to which a human soul can delve into, Skyrim poses many deep philosophical points such as tyrrany, racism and the uselessness of having a %based pickpocket system if you have quicksave and quickload and reaching the ultimate conclusion of 'f*ck it, if you kill dragons you must be right'.

review: Skyrim oh glorius skyrim. This game could be my favorite of all time. I must have made 20+ characters playing this game because I was so curios as to the different options to choose from. Going in to it I had no idea the lore or universe of the scrolls franchise but immediatley delved in. The lore is intereting and makes sense. The universe of the game feels somewhat freindly as you step into the open wilds of the tundra but talk to npc's and as you complete quests you begin to notice really how many insane problems Skyrim has. The game invites you to be a strong nordic viking, a stealthy theiving cat, or an expert mage. In all honesty though it encourages you to mix and match and do whatever you want. For example like being an elf who wears heavy armor or a nord who slits throats with dual daggers. It dosent really have many boundraies unlike some of bethesdas other games like fallout which is also one of my favorites despite bugs or flaws. I dont have a counter but I've put a lot of hours into this game(if you look at steam playtime it might be realtivley small because I used to play on 360). There are a number of things you can do like: -Finish the main quest -Get the best weapons and armor through smithing(very tedious) -Complete the companions quest line and other spoilers that I will not say -Complete the mages guild quest line -Complete the theives guild quest line -Complete the dark brotherhood quest line or destroy it by talking to Commander Caius -Choose sides in the great war and complete the quests to restore order for your chosen faction -Investigate the forsworn consipacy -If you have Dawnguard, Dragonborn, or hearthfire dlcs defintley do all you can in them -Do quests for the many daedric lords -Fufill side quests for the trobuled people in skyrim -Get as many Thu'um shouts as you can and kill as many dragons as you can -If you can get mods GET THEM the modding community has very talented people in it -And most inportantly have fun in the world and FusRoDah any guard that says he took an arrow in the knee 10/10

review: This game NEVER ENDS. In most games, that wouldn't be a very complimentary feature, but in this game the gameplay is phenomenal, the graphics are great, the level system is smooth, and you can do almost whatever you want. It has hours upon hours of playability, with the main story line, the DLC story lines, the playermade DLCs on the workshop, and then on top of that, every playthrough can be different because of the vast collection of player made mods. Plus it was only $7.50 during the Christmas sale. I would recommend this game to anyone.

review: IMPORTANT: Do yourself a favor and buy the Legendary Version of Skyrim instead. There are a LOT of good mods that require all the DLC's and it would be a shame if you wouldn't be able to use it because you don't have the dlc's. The legendary edition is definitely worth it especially during sales. Alone without mods? It's one of those games that you pick up and enjoy, get tired of, and then never come back to. With mods? All of a sudden, this game has become an easy candidate for the best game of ALL TIME. You will be able to tweak whatever gameplay settings that bothered you from the original game. You can have new buildings/characters/weapons/quests from mods without having to buy DLC. You can change the entire landscape of Skyrim with graphical enhancements. Oblivion and Morrowind simply cannot compare to this game in the mods department. I used a lot of Lord of the Rings Weapons mods, as well as some star wars mods. If you have a good computer, there are lots of graphic overhauls.

Easily hundreds of hours of game-play. After 2 years, I still come back to play a night every few weeks. One of my all time favorite games.

review: Skyrim... I don't really think there's much that I can say about this game that hasn't already been said! I've played hundreds of hours on this game (I initially played on console) and I've loved every minute! Skyrim is one of those games that just never gets old, you can always come back to it and there'll be new stuff to find. And that's just Vanilla without mods; the modding community for this game is fantastic, and if you can't find what you want on the Steam Workshop there are thousands of mods on the Skyrim Nexus. From things as simple as retextures to make your game beautiful, all the way up to entirely new worlds, there are mods out there that will completely change your experience. And that's what I lovwe about this game, it never plays the same twice! I highly recommend this game to anyone, even if you're not a big RPG fan, this game is still a masterpiece! At such a low price now, this game is an absolute steal!

review: Skyrim. It's an Elder Scrolls game, which means you're going to have a huge world to explore again and that really is the main feature of the base game. The combat system, if you want to call it that, is unimpressive and magic feels more limited than it did in previous Elder Scrolls installments and the main storyline is acceptable but not great by any standards. However what Bethesda did do right is the creation of the world all this happens in. Dungeons and ruins are more varied compared to what they were like in Oblivion and the outside world is huge in its own right and allows for days worth of exploration. So despite its flaws I'd strongly recommend this game. There is however a lot of snow. You probably should be looking at an other title if you have a phobia for snow.

review: 3 and a half years after its release, Skyrim is still more captivating than any RPG I've ever played. The modding community is dedicated, quirky, and practical. The game is very much tailored by personal experience and values, not only in the selection of guilds, but in the character development as well. You will find yourself debating whether or not to let a man live based upon the actions of his peers, be they bandits, Thalmor, Stormcloaks, Imperials, etc. The social dynamics of the game are often overlooked in favor of the graphic quality, questlines, and combat, but it is the dialogues and familial nature of Skyrim that has truly made this an excellent experience- one I'd say every game enthusiast ought to appreciate. 10/10.

review: The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is personally, my favorite story-based game. The many classes you can be enriches the game, and you can defeat the ultimate dragon in numerous ways according to your chosen warrior. Not only do you play the storyline, but you can choose to freely roam Skyrim at any point in the game, and obtain the best gear in the game. The huge variety of enemies and monsters to defeat in the game creates an endless fun experience. Getting the DLC for the game enhances the game in many ways. 11/10

review: This isn't just a game, this is life! No really, I do not know of what one could dislike about this game. Whilst it does scream "like me" as a game title, you can't help but love it as much as it wants you too. The storyline in Skyrim is amazingly immersive the first time you play through it. While I played through it I felt a since of Urgency to stop Alduin and save Tamerial from him. The only real downside to this game is that there's not really the ability to be an evil character per example, why not rule beside Alduin instead of killing him? Why not kill the greybeards once you've the ability to or kill all the jarl's and declare yourself King of Skyrim? The lack of options in those specific area's are a downside to it. However there's so much content here that you'd be an idiot not to buy it. This game is to me, the definition of perfection easily the best game I've played through and then it gets even better with mods. Case closed this is a 10 out of 10.

It's fit more for console gamers, but this is still an awesome game, I actually like playing this game with a controller to be honest. If you want a more in depht, complicated Elder Scrolls game, buy Oblivion or Morrowind. I also like the fact that this game has a Steam Workshop where you can download mods for your game to alter your experience, whether it'd be graphics, new hair styles, weapons, quests, just about anything you want to add to your game. Definitely a must have if you're a fan of Open World fantasy games that let you do or go wherever you wish.

review: Skyrim, oh where to start. I got the game for the Xbox 360 christmas 2011 (yes I was a console peasent back then) and was instantly dragged into a fanboy state. I remember the opening cutscene playing and I just sat there squeling like a little girl. After powering through the tutorial I was faced with the massive worldspace and the hours of exploring, questing and fighting that lied ahead. As I slowly walked towards the town of riverwood, I saw the amazing variety of landscapes that sprawled out across the world and stood in awe wondering where to begin. On the subject of gameplay, despite a few minor bugs (which have mostly been patched by mods like the unofficial skyrim patch and Bethesda's own patches) it's extremely fun and engaging. The way the combat feels is amazing (expecially the archery) and the more tedious tasks (crafting, enchanting and alchemy for example) are fun and rewarding in their own way. The story was exciting (if a little bit predictable) and the characters were interesting. However there are (as with all games) some downsides. You can find yourself forced down a few paths and sometimes you'll experience game breaking issues (like one of the master spell quests was bugged for me) but it doesn't take away from what a truely great experience Skyrim is.

review: A brilliant RPG set in a beautifully created world. Dragons, ogres and bandits run amok and you can easily lose yourself in the game doing the near infinite amount of quests. Be a stealthy assassin or powerful mage and discover the power of the Dragonborn while fight for the Imperial Empire or Stormcloak Rebellion... if you want to. There is so much to this game that you can spend over 100 hours in it and never touch the main quests and when you're done, it has an extensive modding community to offer new creatures, weapons and entire quests to keep your adventure going.

There are lots of weapons and spells to fight beings and dragons. Oh wait i forgot to say it has FREAKING DRAGONS. If you wonder if this game is worth it, well it is. The graphics look next gen, but the game was made in 2011. That is impressive.

review: This game is all about choice, the story about a man named Commander Shepard. When he was thirteen years old he heard about "pegging." This is when a guy gets banged up the butt with a banana. Stimulate the prostate gland hard enough, and the rumor is you can have explosive hands-free org asms. At that age, this friend's a little sex maniac. He's always jonesing for a better way to get his rocks off. He goes out to buy a carrot and some peanut butter jelly. To conduct a little private research. Then he pictures how it's going to look at the supermarket checkstand, the lonely carrot and petroleum jelly rolling down the conveyer belt toward the grocery store cashier. All the shoppers waiting in line, watching. Everyone seeing the big evening he has planned. John buys milk and eggs and sugar and a carrot, all the ingredients for a carrot cake. And Vaseline, awaiting the Reapers to Collect his beautiful Battle . Like he's going home to stick a carrot cake up his butt. At home, he whittles the carrot into a blunt tool. He slathers it with grease and grinds his  down on it. Then, nothing. No . Nothing happens except it hurts. Commander Shepard dies trying to save Liara's beautiful tentacle/hentai hair that he would love to stick up his butt. But no luck for Commander Shepard. 10/10 - It's descent

review: One of those games you will remember and perhaps play 5-10 years after it came out. Skyrim shines by very early on letting you into a vast open world where you can go anywhere. You can pick a direction and go. Along the way you will find all sorts of interesting quests, NPC's, treasure, etc. The game is an RPG where you level up based on the Skills you use. The more skills/talents you use, the more exp you gain. You gain perk points upon leveling up to increase skill trees related to almost anything you can think of in an RPG (Warrior, thief, lockpicking, armor, etc). Combat is a little simple, but still fun. There are vast amounts of weapons to choose from, you can use magic, you can use quick or heavy attacks, you can block, and parry to stun. First and 3rd person cameras are available. I could spend pages describing the different weapons and spells. Its got a great story, good graphics, and almost infinite gameplay. The real magic comes from the modders. There are so many amazing mods out there for this game. From the quality of life changes like SKY-UI, to graphical encancement mods (ENB), to full new areas and quests added you can find almost anything you want. The game is all about the adventure YOU create for yourself. My only negatives to note would be the combat. Its fun, but I just wish it was a little deeper in strategy. I still enjoy it, but if there was one area the game is lacking a little its the combat (just a little bit lacking). A must own game and a MUST MOD game. Just remember use Skyrim nexus and not Steam workshop. Nexus does not censor any content, most big amazing mods are only on the Nexus, and their mod manager is very useful.

review: I guess I like playing this game, I enjoy how the cows look real woolen, almost like a wooly cow, or a wooly rhino. Plus there are lots of goats in this game, but I dont think there are any sheep, which doesnt make sense... where would the cows get the wool from in the first place? It's the small questions like that one which make the game for me. I mean what other game out there right now has woolen cows in it? I cant think of a single one, not even farming simulator 2012 has cows made of wool in it so why does that game even get so much credit in the first place? I dont get it. If a game doesn't have woolen sheep and does have woolen cows, then tell me where the cows get the in wool from, all these unanswered questions are what make this game so great, and better than its competitors such as checkers or Big 2.

Also don't drink anything but Nord Mead in their presence, because they'll probably toss you back to Cyrodil, or to Black Marsh, Hammerfel, Morrowind, or wherever the hell you're from. If you dare to drink Skooma, or other vile drink that is not Nord Mead, well.... consider yourself warned Dragonborn.

review: Skyrim continues the epic saga of the Elder Scrolls. The High King of Skyrim has been murdered and a civil-war has broken out, for the right to the throne. And if that wasn't enough, the dragons has once again awaken to terrorize the empire. You play the Dragonborn, a hero blessed with special powers that makes you able to fight the dragons. Now it's up to you to find a way to defeat the dragon god, Alduin, because he is prophesized to destroy the whole world. Skyrim is an open world role-playing game where you're free to explore the world at your own pace and leisure. You decide what to do, where to go and the world changes based on those decisions. The open world also means that has both a weather-system and a day-night cycle and that affects the gameplay. You can interact with NPCs and get homes in the different towns you visits. And as always you can adjust your character to fit the way you like to play, with hundreds of weapons, spells and other abilities at your hands to pick and choose from. Even when you aren't pursuing story quests, though, the core narrative dogs you as you trot across the land on foot or on horseback. You might travel to a quaint hamlet only to discover that it's under siege by a hovering beast. The townspeople join you, aiming their arrows and fireballs upward, and not all of them may survive the encounter. These battles impress upon you the terror in which the populace lives, and thus give you a reason to be a hero to them. But plenty of narrative delights have nothing to do with dragons, and some of them could have formed the main story of a lesser RPG. Following an early lead takes you to a lonely house occupied by a single child with a disturbing request. The story that unravels has you acting as a predator and eavesdropping from an unimaginably sinister hiding place. Other story threads embrace the element of choice. You can take sides in the ongoing conflict between Imperial forces and the rebellious Stormcloaks, and then assault enemy camps and rescue prisoners jailed by the enemy. And in one memorable if minor quest line, you can kill a creepy cannibal--or join her and her cohorts at the table. It's impressive enough that there's so much to do; it's even more impressive that most of it is wonderful. Not every dungeon is a joy to explore. Stone-turning puzzles occasionally bring the fun to a halt, and a few repeated cave designs could dampen your spirits. But overall, every task has an excellent sense of context, and surprises lurk around many a turn. Searching for a lost dog turns into a grander quest than you could have guessed--and witty writing and voice acting shine some light into this somber world. Even a simple "go there, kill that" bounty can be a thrill. After all, how often do you face a towering giant and a couple of woolly mammoths? It's too bad that as you approach the giant's camp, one of those mammoths might spawn 100 feet in the air and fall to its death, or land on another mammoth and ride on its back for a few seconds before sliding off.

review: This has to be one of the best single-player games I've ever played, and with all mods available it's only sky the limit of what you can do here. I would call this even the medieval version of GTA 5, since it's a sandbox open-world RPG where you can customize your character in any way you like and interact with almost every pixel in your surrounding. (picking up items etc.) It also has tons of skills to level up, crafting skills, weapon skills, and a HUGE world to explore with a day/night cycle. Your actions take effect against other NPC's and you can become liked or an enemy. The quests are endless, and there is voice added to every character speech. I would give this game even a better score than metascore, guess i'm gonna give it 96 or 98/100. It's close to perfect. Perfectism. The menu, the graphics, the gameplay, the movement, the enviroment, the key-pointer and inventory is pitch clear. They got it all right. Bravo! I hope other games can learn from this simplistic feeling. The community has a great amount of mods for your customization for adding in-game stuff to changing the graphics and effects. (top notch game!) My steam score 9.5/10 I would recommend this to anyone, and if you can get it for $5,00 or lower, it's a bargain. Note: Best Elder Scrolls game I played so far. (havn't tried TESO yet)

review: *VERY LONG READ* This is the best fantasy, action, open-world rpg anyone could ask for. Btw I probably have over 400 hours because I used to play it a lot on my ps3. So many different mechanics to it- smithing, (crafting) alchemy, lockpicking, enchanting. Not to mention that it has playstyles for any player. Agressive players can use heavy armor and two-handed weapons. Players who want to be quick and agile can use light armor, one-handed weapons and a shield. Or if they want to be sneaky they can use light armor and a bow and arrow. It also has magic for people who prefer not to use man-made weapons. For attacking a person can use destruction magic, (magic that involves frost, fire, or shock) or they can summon helpers with conjuration, and boost health or upgrade armor rating by using the other three areas of magic the game offers: restoration, illusion, and alteration. If you prefer to be somewhere in the middle of how you play, (magic and combat) you can easily become a spellsword. Combine forces with a bow and arrow and conjuration- or just become a warrior that can restore health by magic means with restoration. The combinations of playstyles are literally endless. And, like a perfect open-world game should, there is not just one storyline. Sure, you have the main storyline- every game needs that. But there are various storylines beyond that- ones that have you assisting the people of skyrim- other storylines do the opposite. You can even get married, adopt children, and buy multiple homes. The graphics are amazing already, so no one has to worry about bad graphics. But even if you don't like the graphics, there are MODS to make it better. Just go look at some of the damn screenshots in the community and you'll see that the graphics are amazing. Skyrim is completely moddable. Mods found on the steam workshop and nexus are easily installed. There are endless possibilities as to how you want to mod your game. If you want an extra storyline, install a mod! (The most famous mod of that category being Falskaar.) If you want weapon packs, install a mod! If you want new NPCs, install a mod! If you want new buildings, install a mod! And if you want to make your own mod, go right ahead and do it! On top of the already great game, the view is spectacular. Sometimes you just have to sit back, relax, and enjoy the scenery the Elder Scrolls V: Skryim has to offer. The player can also commit crimes and go to jail! Possible crimes include pickpocketing, breaking into a house and stealing the stuff in the house, forging business ledgers, assault, murder, tresspassing, and running up to the execution block when the player first enters the city of Solitude will also get them arrested. And don't think that the crimes are pointless because you would just end up in jail for them- the player can do it so it is not seen, and also get perks to get away with crimes more easily. And if they don't want to go to jail... they can slaughter an entire town. Every person you kill can be looted, along with every creature. And they stay there dead in the same spot forever. They don't disappear. Small immersive actions are available in the game as well. For example, any chair can be sat in, you can sit at bars and drink, rent out a room from an inn for a day, eat food, and sleep. There is even a quest that allows the player to get drunk- and also mods that allow the player to get drunk from any drinking instance. (Well what about if I finish the game?) Finsihed all the storylines? There are countless side quests and other objectives you can do. Finish all those? Oh wait you can't do that- the miscellaneous objectives are LITERALLY ENDLESS. I'm serious. The game will keep giving you objectives as long as you keep doing them. To justify the last paragraph, a while ago I started a third playthrough of the game, and found two entire questlines that I didn't know existed and had never encountered before. I looked the both up on a wiki and they were both there, just to confirm that they weren't mods. And to go over skill tree there is: Two-Handed: The player learns how to use two-handed weapons (which can be either a greatsword, battleaxe, or warhammer) more effectively. That includes the ability to do more damage, break blocks easier, and unlock effects of the power attacks. One-Handed: The player learns how to use one-handed weapons (which can be either a sword, waraxe, or mace) more effectively. Increase damage of one handed weapons, learn the art of dual-wielding one-handed weapons, and unlock different kinds of power attacks. Heavy Armor: The player learns how to use heavy armor more effectively. Take less damage from physical attacks, (which means attacks other than magical attacks) make it so heavy armor does not weigh as much, heavy armor depletes less stamina while sprinting, make less noise with heavy armor, and learn the way of punching oppenents to death. <---- Yes, I'm serious about that one. Light Armor: The player learns how to use light armor more effectively. Take less damage from physical attacks, make it so light armor does not weigh as much, and pretty much every other kind of thing you can learn from heavy armor. Except you can't learn how to punch oppenents to death with light armor. Block: A self-explanatory skill tree- block more effectively with shields. As an added bonus, the player can cause their opponents to bleed if they use the shield bash. Archery: Use the bow more effectively in combat. Do more damage, slow down time when you draw an arrow, cause paralysis with your arrows occasionally, get critical hits from arrows more often, and make critical hits even more effective than they already are. Smithing: Smithing is one branch of three skill trees that involve crafting. Smithing focuses on being able to craft all sorts of armor and weapons, and being able to improve them better. Enchanting: Also a branch of crafting. Enchanting allows the player to enchant weapons and armor more effectively, and once the player is advanced enough at enchanting, they can put two effects on one item instead of only one effect. Alchemy: The final branch of crafting. Alchemy allows the player to create very effective potions or poisons available for use in combat. Sneak: The player can get out of any npc's sight easier, do more damage with sneak attacks, learn to execute silent forward rolls while sneaking, and if the player gets amazingly good at sneaking, they are then able to start sneaking in the middle of battle, but instead of it being pointless the enemies would actually lose sight of the player. Lockpicking: The player learns to pick locks easier and do it without being seen. Nothing else to say here. Pickpocketing: The player learns to pick pockets and get away with it more frequently, and also becomes able to pick a greater variety of items from the unsuspecting npc's pockets. *I know, this already seems like a lot of skill trees, but there are still all the magic skill trees.* LOL ILLusion: The player learns to be able to alter how an npc is thinking. For example, in the middle of battle, the player can learn to cast spells that calms enemies down temporarily, stopping combat and enabling the player to run away before the enemies go back to normal. The opposite can also be done, as in the player can use illusion magic to make their enemies angry at EVERYBODY. For example, if the player casted a spell of that kind on a bandit, that bandit will start attacking their fellow bandits, thus leaving the player with less enemies to fight. Restoration: The player learns to be able to heal or support themselves better via magic. There is really not anything else to say about this skill tree. I would go on about destruction, alteration, and conjuration, but I literally ran out of characters LOL so just believe me, and buy the god damn game! :D Perfect 10/10.

review: I feel that once modified to your personal taste, this game comes pretty close to what one could consider the "ultimate" game. It has a little bit of everything to keep it interesting and has a lot of replay value. It could use more dialogue choices for an honorable character, but it does it's job adequately. The only thing I really wish it had is a co-op option to play with a friend or two. Hell no, not an MMORPG. It has great main/side quests, decent unlimited quests, excellent enviroments, and fun exploration. Combat is decent enough, and the ability to play at your own pace is also nice. The experience when it all comes together is great. If the base game and DLC aren't enough for you, you can modify it with mods to do pretty much anything you could think of. I highly recommend modding it. Also the game isn't very difficult by default, but mods and difficulty sliders can help with this. I should leave a warning though. Playing this is like falling unconscious, and waking up wondering where the time went. Time flies playing it.

review: Skyrim is probably one of the most amazing, and wonderful games ever to be created. There are very little things to fault about it. The graphics are top-notch amazing, the gameplay, skill levelling, levelling and all that other fun stuff is so fantastic. You can be a race of so many things and each of them have a better ability or skill than a different race. You can choose to be a: Thief Mage Warrior (Vampire if you have the DLC: Dawnguard) There are clans you can join such as: Companions (mostly for warriors) Thieves Guild (for thieves) Dark Brotherhood (thieves and sneaky players) These classes and clans are fun to be involved in and complete the quest-line. You are a very special individual with dragon-like abilites, which is called in Skyrim terms; "Dragonborn". Every time you kill a dragon you get awarded a "Dragon Soul" which you spend on shouts, the shouts are very important in Skyrim because they are useful in combat. PC bonuses: For the PC you can use console/PC commands which is done by pressing the " ` " key. (check YouTube, IGN etc for console commands) Elder Scrolls Online: (ESO) This is apparently coming out in April of 2014, it will be different from the actual Skyrim single player, but it's still fun to play with friends and do other random and comedic stuff.

review: Worthy addition to the series. Oblivion was a letdown and Skyrim returns to Morrowinds unique feel and personality, though it can not fully match it. Skyrim is still a must play for Elder Scrolls fan and any player who enjoys adventure and exploration. The game becomes phenomenal with mods, you can feel and live through every moment, every battle and encounter. Best way to play skyrim is to roleplay your character, commit to its personality and view the world through its eyes. You can really fire up your imagination, break free of scripted dialogues and storyline and live through your own story and adventures. This will open up whole new way for you to play and enjoy games, no longer a mindless consumer addicted to snippets of pre-writen script pieces, you can forge your own story with every step you make. Better yet, start a journal or video series describing and documenting your adventures, get off your read only stasis and start being creative. Open world, Sandbox, Free adventuring are endless fun and possibilities. Stop being silly puppet unable to think something fun up without explicit designer instructions, would you kindly? For mods you can check this great thread.

review: TL;DR: Great for wasting time and chilling First off, if you want a game to quickly waste a lot of your time on, this is for you. I spent about 400+ hours on PS3 and now over 50 hours on PC and I still haven't 'finished' the game yet. The reason I put finished between quotation marks is because there is actually no real end to this game. The game contains countless main, side and miscellaneous quests to do, some of which you can keep redoing. There are hundreds of locations to visit, tons of skills to perfect and you can even reset the skills and start all over again, which is great. There is a great diversity in the palces you visit, the animals you hunt, the enemies you kill and best of all: there is so much loot you won't even know what to do with. And all that is without mods, if you visit the Steam Workshop you'll see that there is so much stuff you can put in your game that there is not a single possibility you can do everything. All in all, I would r8 this game 8/8, one of my favorite (if not THE favorite) game I will ever play.

review: Enjoy hundreds upon hundreds of copy-pasted dungeons, boring enemies, uninteresting skills, basic spells, fetch quests, glitches and bugs. Take in the breath takingly small Skyrim (If this is a country then how big is the planet.) as you click on draugrs, click on bandits, click on falmers, click on spiders, click on wizards, and click on dragons. Watch as your hero cinematically kills the easiest enemies in any game ever, and when you turn up the difficulty, the game lazily only increases the enemy health and damage. Feel like you haven't gotten any stronger due to the amazing scaling enemies. But people keep telling me that this is the best game ever so I guess they're right. I give this game a 10/10.

Cons - Yes I've been to the cloud district. - Mum Lydia went missing again. - The Giant Space Program Foundation. - Bland Story. - Bland Quest. ( Exception to some of the Faction or Daedric Quest ) The Overall long as f*** my opinion : Skyrim is bland, the story that is. It's like the generic "YOU GOT DA POWAZ, NOW KILL DIZ DRAGON AND LOOK LIEK A BADASS". And it does well to make you look like a f****** badass. The World is very, very large. And most of the time you'll be finding yourself doing some dungeon looting or killing some bandits that's holed up in a cave. There are some places that are very beautiful within the game. The combat in the vanilla game is well kinda clunky for me but it get the jobs done. Now onto the serious stuff. Mods. It's been 3 years and 4 month since it's release and it's still one of the top played game on Steam. The mods that are ranging from basic UI mod to complicated roleplay RPG-esque mod such as Requiem. Immersion mod like Real Needs and Disease including Frostfall which make the game harder than it already is. Also graphical enhancement such as ENB and SweetFX. ENB = Taxing on CPU + GPU. | SweetFX = Not much impact on the game framerates. This game has like infinite replayability. Like I don't even remember how much time I delete all the save files and play it over, and over and over again. It's just that addictive and good. And please for the love of god if it goes on sale get the Skyrim : Legendary Edition that includes all the DLC. I guess that's pretty much it. Oh wait the soundtrack, it's great. Sometimes you just felt like you really are there taking a stroll on the way to Riften before a Bear came rushing to you and give you Ataxia and in the process a bandit group showed up aswell along with an Elder Dragon. Extra info about the mod. Most of them can be found on Nexus, and or G.E.M.S which provide the highlights of what kind of mods that's loved and used by the community. Check those sites out. Remember this is a Fantasy game. You can make it the super duper sexy skimpy  mode or you can make the Oh god this axe is gonna chop my head in two mode. Endless possibilities, so many contents by the community for you to try. I'd give this game a 8.79 out of 10. Why 8.79? Because there's some bugs and glitches that make me go F*CK THIS,F*CK THAT,F*CK EVERYTHING. But overall that's just my opinions and I hope it found you helpful.

review: I played Skyrim 2 years late, and you know what I say? 2 years of wasted time. This game is the epitome of an RPG/Action-Adventure game. Presentation: 9.5/10 - Everything just comes together. It just works. Graphics: 10/10 - Some of the best graphics you've likely ever seen. Especially with the right mods and ENB's. Sound: 10/10 - The soundtrack is the most beautiful I have heard in a video game. It really gives you that sense of exploration, or whatever it is you may be doing. The music during dragon fights is just mind blowing. Gameplay: 9.5/10 - The combat is fantastic, there isn't much that could be done better here in my opinion. It isn't "perfect" but it comes close enough that you can forgive the very tiny things that you may, (or may not,) notice after playing for many, many hours. Lasting Appeal: 10/10 - This game will always be one that will draw me back, with it's infinite possibilites and storyline that will be different every time you play through it. Get this game, you may think you don't like it, but you do. Trust me, you do.

review: Without a doubt or exaggeration, ONE OF THE greatest games I have ever had the privilege of playing. After 9999+ hours of gameplay, I haven't been bored for even a moment yet. That's saying something about the kind of game this is. The world is huge, and if you take the time not to fast travel everywhere, you'll discover vast mountains, flowing rivers, open plains, and everything else that makes Skyrim feel so real. Nearly everything is done right. RPG Anxiety, as I like to call it, is eliminated by the elimination of classes entirely. You don't have to specialize your character until you actually get out into the world and get to try out every style of combat for yourself. You literally are who you play. If you fight with a bow, you'll slowly get better at it. Same goes for the different schools of magic. The amount of content in Skyrim is also ridiculous. Even if you spent a lifetime in Skyrim's magical world, I doubt you'd ever finish everything the game has to offer.

review: This is the game the never, ever ends. I picked this game up thinking I wouldn't like it having never played a previous TES game before. Sat in my Library untouched for about a month or two, and finally took the plunge. I was wrong. I was so very, very wrong. This is probably the best purchase I've ever made on steam. Add in the unlimited potential of modding, and it's an adventure that continues forever. I've probably restarted over a hundred times by now with a new character, and still only have beaten Alduin once. ONCE. There's still so much more do to and explore that I'm still discovering quests and areas and little hidden things. I still can't believe how much there is to do and I'm still finding more. At it stands I'll probably wake up one day having lost all touch with reality and actually start seeing the world as Skyrim with how much I've played. And I'm totally ok with that.

review: If I had to choose between this game, and my girlfriend. I'd pick this game. EDIT: I'm single now ON A MORE SERIOUS NOTE: This game is the best in its genre. In previous Bethesda games they made a sad balance in between Questing, and Exploration. Some having more quests and less places to go, and others having very few quests and more places to explore. But in Skyrim, there is no shortage of quests, and if you are like myself and just wander around aimlessly, you will stumble into places that just blow your mind. Every time I have replayed this game, I stumbled into something new. For more info i'd very much recommend mods, with mods such as texture packs, difficulty, quests, armor, and weapons, this games replay value is endless. Go through the game once with plain skyrim, then mod the hell out of it. Overall I'd rate this game an EASY 10/10. If you haven't already. Please buy it, give it a little, and I swear you will be hooked.

review: An epic game made all the more epic by the fact that it is so easy to mod and so well supported by the modding community. The Elder Scrolls series has a large following and often you will hear people argue over each new TES game comparing it to the last, but for me each TES game stands on its own merits, and Skyrim is no exception. The story is pretty good and there are plenty of side quests, but what makes Skyrim so great even when not modded is its large and open nature. This is a land you can just pick a direction and with no quest in mind and just explore. You will find danger and excitement on your journey ... and loot. Lots and lots of loot. But once you start modding this game, that is when you unlock the true value that is Skyrim. Potentially thousands more hours content (for free) in a game that can be improved ten thousand different ways from graphics, textures and sounds all the way to game mechanics and user interface changes. You can make the game exactly what you need it to be, and play it for so long you may still be playing when the next game in this series comes out.... and sometimes longer than even that. If you are interested in modding the PC version of the game, be sure to check out my guide for beginners:

review: I was stacking books on a shelf in my house in Whiterun, one of Skyrim's major cities, when I noticed a weapon rack right beside it. I set a sacrificial dagger in one slot, an Orcish mace in the other. They were on display for nobody but me and my computer-controlled housecarl, Lydia, who sat at a table patiently waiting for me to ask her to go questing. The chest upstairs was reserved for excess weapons and armor, the bedside table for smithing ingots and ores, the one next to the Alchemy table for ingredients. I'd meticulously organized my owned virtual property not because I had to, but because tending to the minutia of domestic life is a comforting break from dealing with screaming frost trolls, dragons, a civil war, and job assignments that never seem to go as planned. It's even a sensible thing to do; a seemingly natural component of every day existence in Skyrim, one of the most fully-realized, easily enjoyable, and utterly engrossing role-playing games ever made. Part of what makes it so enjoyable has to do with how legacy Elder Scrolls clutter has been condensed and in some cases eliminated. In Skyrim, there's no more moon-hopping between hilltops with a maxed out Acrobatics skill. That's gone, so is Athletics. The Elder Scrolls V pares down the amount of skills and cuts out attributes like Endurance and Intelligence altogether. There's no time wasted on the character creation screen agonizing over which skills to assign as major. You don't assign major and minor skills at all, but instead pick one of ten races, each with a specific bonus. High Elves can once a day regenerate magicka quickly, Orcs can enter a berserk rage for more effective close-range combat. These abilities are best paired with certain character builds  the High Elf regeneration is useful for a magic user  but don't represent a rigid class choice. Major decisions don't need to be made until you're already out in the world and can try out magic, sneaking and weapon combat, emphasizing first-hand experience over instruction manual study, letting you specialize only when you're ready. It contributes to the thrilling sense of freedom associated with life in Skyrim. Do a quest, kill a dragon, snatch torchbugs from the air, munch on butterfly wings or simply wander while listening to one of the best game soundtracks in recent memory. Despite the enormity of the world and the colossal amount of content contained within, little feels random and useless. Even chewing on a butterfly wing has purpose, as it reveals one of several alchemical parameters later useful in potion making at an alchemy table. Mined ore and scraps of metal from Dwemer ruins can be smelted into ingots and fashioned into armor sets, pelts lifted from slain wildlife can be turned into leather armor sets, and random books plucked from ancient ruins can trigger hidden quest lines that lead to valuable rewards. Skyrim's land mass is absolutely stuffed with content and curiosities, making every step you take, even if it's through what seems like total wilderness, an exciting one, as something unexpected often lies just over the next ridge. Many times the unexpected takes the form of a dragon. Sometimes they're purposefully placed to guard relics, sometimes they swoop over cities and attack at seemingly random times. In the middle of a fight against a camp of bandits a dragon might strike, screaming through the sky and searing foe and friendly alike with frost or flame. Momentarily all on the battlefield unite, directing arrows and magic blasts upward to knock down the creature, creating impromptu moments of camaraderie -- a surprising change from what may have been yet another by-the-numbers bandit camp sweep. Dragons show up often, their presence announced by an ominous flap of broad wings or an otherworldly scream from high above. The scale and startling detail built into each creature's appearance and animations as it circles, stops to attack, circles again and slams to the ground makes encounters thrilling, though their predictable attack patterns lessen the excitement after a few battles. In the long run they're far less irritating than the Oblivion gate equivalent from The Elder Scrolls IV, can be completed in a few minutes, and always offer a useful reward. Killing a dragon yields a soul, which powers Skyrim's new Shout system. These are magical abilities any character can use, you don't have to specialize in spell casting to slow time, throw your voice, change the weather, call in allies, blast out ice and fire, or knock back enemies with a rolling wave of pure force. Even if you favor sword, shield and heavy armor and ignore magic entirely, you'll still be able to take full advantage of these abilities provided you find the proper words  each Shout has three  hidden on Skyrim's high snowy peaks and in the depths of forgotten dungeons, serving as another reason to continue exploring long after you've exhausted the main quest story, joined with the Thieves Guild, fought alongside the Dark Brotherhood, or thrown your support behind one of the factions vying for control of Skyrim. Not only is this land under assault by dragons, long thought to be dead, it's also ripped in two by civil war. You can choose one side or the other, but so much of the allure of Skyrim is how, even outside of the confines of quest lines, the embattled state of the world is evident, and steeped in a rich fictional legacy. Lord of the Rings this is not, but with the release of every Elder Scrolls game, the fiction becomes denser, and the cross-referencing for long-time fans all the more rewarding. Skyrim's residents are all aware of current events. They'll comment on the civil war, some sympathizing with the rebels, others thinking the establishment sold its soul. The peasants complain about the Jarls who control each settlement, the Jarls complain about the rebels or foreign policy, the overprotective College librarian complains when I drop dragon scales all over his floor; many characters feel like whole, distinct personalities instead of vacuous nothings that hand out quests like a downtown greeter hands out flyers for discount jeans. Characters stereotype based on race, they double-cross at even the slightest hint it might be profitable, and they react to your evolving stature within the world. It makes a ridiculous realm, filled with computer-controlled cat people and humanoid reptiles, demon gods and dragons, feel authentic, like a world that existed long before you showed up and will continue to exist long after you leave.

review: , I had a great time. But listen, we need to talk. There's an alarming amount of bad and bittersweet in this game. The world is larger and more realized than in previous games, and obviously the graphics are a lot more detailed, but the stat game is a watered down wreck where making and leveling a character lacks depth and decision and all of that great stuff we saw in Oblivion and Morrowind. Even the questlines are simplified, with less choices in dialog, and with boring and samesy objectives compared to previous games where the different guilds really stood apart both in gameplay and flavor. If this iteration is setting a trend for a possible VI, Skyrim could be the last TES game I play.

review: Bethesda's rpg's really are their own thing. You create your own story in a virtual world as open as digital virtual world's get circa 2012. Hard not to like. SKYUI and Favourites Categoriser mods essential.(Otherwise you will spend most of the game "scrolling" through the terrible user interface) Bethesda, just improve the writing , character interaction and variation of voice actors.

review: In Skyrim, you take the role of the legendary Dragonborn. The dragons have awoken in Skyrim, and all of the dragons from the days of old are being resurrected by the father of all dragons, Alduin. The only way a dragon can die for good is for the Dragonborn to absorb its soul soon after it dies. However, in Skyrim, there are unlimited dragons. You can kill a dragon that's attacking a village, absorb its soul, and then his identical twin brother will attack a different village a few days later. No matter how many dragons you kill, more will just keep spawning. You can even kill Alduin, the one resurrecting the dragons, and they'll keep on spawning. That is how little impact you have on the game world. Yes, you can join the Dark Brotherhood and assassinate a bunch of people, and then you can join the Thieves guild that has a very strict rule about not killing people, and no one will care. Yes, you can become a mage at the College of Winterhold, and then join The Companions, even though they despise mages. You can even use magic to kill people while you're working for them, and they won't care. Yes, you can run into a group of twenty bandits, get down to a sliver of health, pause the game, eat twenty cheese wheels, and be right as rain. Yes, you can slaughter entire villages of innocent people, pay the fine to the guard and get off scott free. I recommend this game to everyone that enjoys mindless exploration, doesn't mind not having meaningful choices, or to people that enjoy spending hours upon hours reading books. You spend a lot of time reading books in this game.

review: Skyrim is a big and a good rpg/sandbox game, nice graphic and MANY stuff to do ( i dont get it why people urgently needs mods ) the quests are different from each other, some are funny too, the dungeons are interesting (but sometimes they look like the same) Now the bad side, imean a game likey skyrim have bugs and its ok, but i ALWAYS get any bosses or enemys who "onehit" me, i get a stronger armor and they still just "onehit" me, the dragons are easy at the start A CHILD can defeat one, after time i get strong weapons and armor and hey what a surprise now the dragons, ALWAYS, KILL ME, WITH ONE HIT. Theres a scream called "Dragonfall" to bring the dragons to landing, sounds good... if it would work, i use the scream and the dragons always still flying for minutes and landing JUST for SECONDS, or they ignor the scream complete. Or it happens that a trader get killed and you cant buy no more stuff in this town from him/her. Or the COMPASS says the target is in this one direction, the map says i run complete wrong. Or the shops are open always at different time in the towns. (open at 8AM i cant buy anything, so i must wait, at 8PM i still cant buy anything and between this times, i still cant buy) I dont want to make the game bad i just share my experience, maybe (for sure) other players are better in rpgs or skyrim itselfs and they doenst have the problem with the overpowered enemys. If i oversee the bugs and the overpowered enemys, it IS a good game, when i get not killed 50times from an dragon, it have it moments.

review: What in the name of Talos did you just say to me, you milk drinker? I'll have you know I am the Dragonborn, and I've been on numerous raids on dragons and I have over 300 dragon souls. I am trained in the Thu'um and I'm the top archer in the entire Imperial Legion. You are nothing to me but just another enemy. I will kill you with arrows the likes of which has never been seen before on Nirn, mark my words. You think you can just say that to me over the webs created by the Dwemer? Think again, milk drinker. As we speak I am contacting my Dark Brotherhood assassins across Tamriel and your hold is being traced right now so you better prepare for the Call Storm shout, milk drinker. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call Mundus. You are going to be sent to Aetherius, milk drinker. I can be at any hold, any time, and can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that's just with my Thu'um. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the Imperial Legion and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable  off the face of Mundus, you milk drinker. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little "clever" opinionated statement was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your tongue. But you couldn't, you didn't, and now you're paying the price, you fool. I will shout fury all over you and you will drown in it. You're dead, milk drinker.

review: This game is pure fun. The quests are indepth so you won't run of things to do or unlock anytime soon. Also there is full player customization so who wouldn't want to be a fu**ing mage or a killer dressed like a crazy jester. You can kill anyone you want who isn't essiential to the story line for example you can kill a city guard but not the jarl of whiterun. Also you can retire from adventure by buying a house and marrying someone or you can go out and make a name for your self in a good or bad way. 10/10

review: Sir Frankenberry, Esquire visits the city of Solitude for the first time. It's a business trip, but there's much to see in this relative metropolis. The matter of business is attending a wedding reception, but that will go on all night. Let her live a bit longer. Sir Frankenberry, Esquire has time to be distracted. He comes across a clothing store, something else the warrior has never encountered. Non-protective outer chest coverings? How unusual. How... impractical. The shop's owner, Taarie, is as intrigued by the sight of an orcish customer as Sir Frankenberry, Esquire is by the mere existence of the shop. The owner's curiosity bubbles over. She energetically requests that Sir Frankenberry, Esquire model one of her signature garments for Solitude's mayor. The unspoken but understood reason being that if her clothes can make this monster look appealing... Sir Frankenberry, Esquire sees several steps beyond this thinly veiled insult and into the payoff. He would be honored. Taarie passes a formal hip-length tunic to Sir Frankenberry, Esquire and wishes him a good evening. Once out of sight of the shop, Sir Frankenberry, Esquire forces the shirt on over the top of his full plate armor. It stretches, but in credit to its craftsmanship, does not burst. Refusing to smile, Sir Frankenberry, Esquire heads off towards the reception. Solitude's mayor has already arrived, of course. She has predictably positioned herself adjacent to the bride, where the evening's attention will be perpetually centered. A fully armed and armored 7 foot high orc approaches. His face is hidden by an enclosed helmet. The warhammer strapped to his back runs nearly the full length of his massive frame. A strained and battered wrap of cotton fabric clings about his chest. The mayor maintains composure. "DO YOU LIKE MY SHIRT?" "I'm sorry. Hello... your shirt?" "YES. DO YOU LIKE IT?" "Oh. My. It's positively astounding. I do." "TAARIE MADE IT FOR ME. SHE OWNS A CLOTHING STORE IN TOWN." "Taarie did? That's... great. I should visit her later on..." "SHE MADE IT FOR ME TO WEAR FOR YOU TONIGHT." The mayor was on the brink of betraying an emotion of discomfort. But before an eyebrow could be raised, Sir Frankenberry, Esquire's warhammer was lifted overhead, then brought down through the body of the nearby bride. The weapon's weight was more than that of the target. The swiftness of the action combined with the unrecognizable result meant that several seconds passed before anyone knew exactly what had occurred. Anyone except the orc, of course, who was already sprinting towards the city gates. "TAARIE MADE IT FOR ME! SHE MADE IT FOR ME TO WEAR FOR YOU TONIGHT!" Sir Frankenberry, Esquire permitted himself a smile.

review: Wow, can't begin to descibe how good this game is.... When I first heard about people talking about this game I automatically assumed they were nerds, but playing this doesn't make you feel like you are playing dungeons and dragons, or WoW. It feels like you are another person, choosing your own path; slaughtering innocent townspeople, becoming a hero who wants to protect all that is right, or even becoming a master vampire and living out in the marsh with a house you built (DLC required). The landscapes are stunning, the AI is, I can't say the best, but compared to games like Just Cause 2 and and ArmA 2, they are much better. I spent 250 hours playing vanilla, and still have not completed the Dawnguard questline as a Dawnguard member, or finished the companion questline (I hate the companions if you buy the game hopefully you will agree with me), and still am doing quests. Need cash and love killing? Join the Dark Brotherhood, a ancient organization which carries out assinations. want to be a master wizard (you get to zap people with lightning and )? Join the mage College of Winterhold. After 250 hours I got mods which made the game so much better. Buy it. Stop wasting your time trying to find out if its good, because IT IS.

review: What can I say about this game... Don't know where to start. The possibilites of what you can do in this game is near endless. You can be whatever you want to be, side with whoever you want to, & even after the Main quest is over, you're still hooked with all the seemingly endless side-quests. The map is decently large, but contains so many hidden caves, caverns, towns, outposts, etc. that you never know what you might come across taking a unusual route. I've even heard of people discovering new locations after playing since 4 years! Imagine that! The vanilla game itself feels so real. Most of the choices you do might have far fetching consequences. If you're a Nord (like my 2 characters), then other races that have been opressed by Nords might comment on their initial distaste of you, based on your race. Some might not even speak to you! You can do so many things. Buy your own house, & you can buy improvements for the inside, make alliances with people & groups & you may get gifts from them containing weapons, armor, etc., some may then allow you to do other things, they may offer you jobs, or (in case of Thieves guild) fence stolen items for you. The whole game feels like a alternate life that you are living, that lives on whether you're there or not. The mods for the game are excellent. And I highly recommend you check them out (Not Steam Workshop, but Google: Skyrim Nexus). Even if you don't like mods, you'll still find something that you will like a lot. From unofficial patches; to lore-friendly items, followers, buildings; to various gameplay enhancements that make you hungry/thirsty, make thunderstorms & blizzards have consiquences (less vision, etc.); to Graphical improvements, ENBs, High-res roads, buildings, NPCs; to clothes, armor, spells, entirely new maps, new quests, enchanced combat; & a lot, lot more. Personally, I would say the mods are what got me back into the game (& made me crazy about it), out of my (current) 90hr play time, more than 70hrs has been since I started installing mods a few weeks back. I don't know what this game has done to me, I don't even feel like playing any other game anymore. Just want to play Skyrim all the time! TL;DR - Great RPG game, lots of things to do, feels just like how it would feel if it was real life. Highly recommend checking out mods (Google: Skyrim Nexus. Also check out G.E.M.S. - Gameplay Enhancement Mods for Skyrim).

But more so now we have the workshop for downloadable mods & ends to raise the possibility of more gameplay hours on skyrim. Quests, killing stuff.. Shouting at poor helpless defenseless non-hostile animals, shouting at people, shouting at enemies, my god.. And ontop of that with the ammount of spells and skill building you'd have to do just to get somewhere. This game is by far addictive, and I love it to end. I suggested it to my wife, and the same thing happened to her. Get this game, get other people to get this game, it simply asks for worldwide dominance!

review: For someone who played all of the Elder Scrolls series I think Skyrim is my second best game out of all of them. I just think that Morrowind was someone more magical and the atmosphere of the land was much more unique to what Skyrim has. Of course the graphics compared to Morrowind are 1000 times better but i still think that sometimes its better to have weaker graphics but better story. Overall i still think what Skyrim story tells us is a very interesting story but maybe its missing that "spark" to get me more into it. I am glad that i went into midnight release to get this and the money i spent i dont regret....just a shame that next game of the series will be MMORPG :( nevertheles this game is fantastic!

review: Skyrim was a pleasant surprise for me after the disappointment of Oblivion. As a long time TES fan I was vehemently opposed to what I saw as the "consolification" of the series. In my eyes Oblivion was a travesty. After playing Skyrim though I have reconsidered. Why? Because, unlike Oblivion, Skyrim doesn't try to second guess its philosophy and as a result it does this "consolification" thing totally right. Is it a watered-down streamlined, or as some would say distilled, offspring of Daggerfall/Morrowind? Well yes it is. But at the same time it's a highly entertaining game with a rich world and mechanics that work. If you are an old-school cRPG-fan keep an open mind and try this. If you are more of a console-style gamer, meh you probably own this already. TL;DR Highly recommended.

review: One of my favourite games of all time. Have you played Elder Scrolls before? No problem. Skyrim is full of fun references to earlier games. It's a little different from Morrowind and Oblivion but still extremely good. I don't feel like I've wasted any money buying this, nor do I feel like I've wasted a single hour. The game is beautiful - I can stop in my tracks and just admire the world. There is so much to do, so many quests: main quests, faction quests, side qeusts, misc quests - you'll never be bored. You don't like being bound by quests? No problem. There's no obligation to follow any quests, it's possible to just explore and live the world. The levelling is easy and the game offers many different ways to play - rogue, warrior or mage to name a few.

The world look amazing, much to see and do. And the mods is the cherry on top and that cherry is big and red with awesome thing. The modding community is so good i think its the best modding community! I don't think this game can get old with how much great mods that are out there! 9.7/10. But there are some bad things with Skyrim here i will spot out the pros and cons. PROS: Much to do, awesome soundtrack, lots of quests! (maybe to much), intresting places and people. And an awesome modding community! CONS: Animation is clanky and bad, Quests can get really repititve with too many quest with you fetching thing for people like a dog, Bad voice acting with voice acters being reused for many people. And combat can get boring and its kinda dull all you do is swing your sword like a mad man! Thank you if you read all of this! :D

review: Always have loved RPGs but never have the time for them but after picking this game up during the steam summer sale I was surprised at how much fun it is and enthralling it is. Basically do you want to become a clepto / hoarder thief or a mage that ends up using amazing spells or just a warrior that rushes in to flee from bears but not from dragons? The answer is yes and just the amount of backstory and lore inside of this game can keep you entertained for many playthroughs and I still have yet too finish the game but the amount of quests and just exploring Skyrim in its entirety keeps you excited what can I find in this cave oh a bunch of bandits whats this switch at the end of the cave woah I opened a Dwemer passage into some ruins. I recommend this game if anything I mentioned is what you like in a game this game is perfect for you. And as of yet I have not purchased any DLC but I am planning onto and will update this review further down the road.

review: This game is simply amazing. I can't say enough good about it. If there's any console game that has truly stolen my heart and really lured me back in to playing it, it's definitely Skyrim. With beautiful graphics, a great storyline, and the fact that the entire game is a massive open world, there's not a whole lot of bad you can say about it if you like those things in a video game. The fighting system is great, and you can play however you like, at any pace you choose. Like being a brute? Play a warrior character. If you think magic is cool, Skyrim has that for you as well. Maybe you like being sneaky, and assassin-like. There are definitely sneaky characters waiting to be played by you ninjas out there. I've invested almost 1000 hours of gameplay into this and I still haven't gotten bored of it. With all the storylines in the game itself, the 3 DLC packs(I recommend buying the Legendary Edition so you get all of the DLC with the game.), and all the mods available, it's nearly impossible to do everything that can be done. This game is extremely addicting, but I wouldn't see it as crazy World of Warcraft addicting. I sometimes stop playing for a while, but I always end up coming back to play more. I love it.

review: This game is insane, if you want to waste away days of your life, buy Skyrim. The immense volume of content featured, like with every Elder Scrolls game is, well, immense. between my hours played on the PS3 and PC is some ridiculous amount. And the sheer amount of mods you can add to the game is great. Probably one of my favorite games on the record.

review: What I love most about this game is the pure openness. To be able to actually escape into a world where I'm not required to act on any specific quest line, I'm not requried to choose a side or be forced into a black and white, good versus evil mentality. The freedom of this game, letting me be anything from Lawful Good to Chaotic Evil, Warrior and Mage, just whatever I feel like being. That is what I find amazing.

review: The dream of every RPG fan. Hundreds of hours to keep you busy and exploring and leveling up. Customizable characters that you choose how to develop. Great graphics, sounds, environment, enemies, effect... perfect. Only drawback is how steam sales the game. I own the game from before and in each sale the DLCs cost more than the package of DLCs along with the game. I should not have purchased the game so as to get a better deal... that's new!

review: Always good to play, for 5 min or for 5 hours skyrim delievers epicness. The Elder Scrolls series is an amazing single player RPG questing, killing and all around full of goodies. Skyrim is no exception with lots to do and explore, i must say the only thing i didnt like was the slower pace of the game. Other then that definately recommend playing Skyrim and letting your inner beast out.

review: This is probably my favorite game of all-time. It centers around my favorite province of Tamriel-Skyrim, my favorite race to play-Nords, and my favorite creatures-the Dragons. I was enchanted by Morrowind on the X-Box, and had a blast playing Oblivion on the 360, so I was estatic when Skryim came out on the PC in 2011. I had just bought a brand new computer with some beefed up specs and was eager to try it out on this beautiful looking game. There is a reason why this game was so hyped, scored so many rewards, was talked about on the internet so much (I took an arrow in the knee jokes) , and sold so many units. Skyrim delivered. This game has some of the most beautiful scenery I've ever seen. Skyrim is sparsely populated, so there are miles of forrests, snowy mountains, lakes, green plains, rolling hills, rocky cliffs, swamps, dwemer ruins, draugr tombs, hidden grottos, caves filled with dangerous creatures, and the endless sea. If this place were real, I'd like to live there. Also the DLC includes the island of Solstheim which is a sweet return to the giant-mushroom and ash-filled Morrowind. Jeremy Soule returns again bringing another great orchestral soundtrack. The main theme "Dragonborn" is a more raw and primal take on the Morrowind them "Nerevar Rising". Included in the DLC on Solstheim is the overworld theme "The Road Most Travelled", which is a sweet nostalgic trip down memory lane for anyone who has played Morrowind. Gameplay is much the same as previous TES games, with a few minor changes (such as the Shout system, which I find minorly disappointing). There are hundreds of side-quests including the Mages, Thieves, Warrior Guilds, etc. and many more. There's also numerous dungeons with random loot and encounters to explore. The majority of the skill sets such as destruction magic, restoration, sneaking, heavy armor, etc. are still here and the leveling system is centered around increasing those skills by using them often, and being able to select perks from a tree each time you level. The class system has been eliminated which many TES fans have raged against, but in all actuality you don't need a class to limit you to a specific set of skills. All skills are able to be leveled to 100 with use, and the legendary system allows you to reset the skill after 100 and keep your perk points. If you like being a cloak-wearing illusion mage, then you will use those skills and level based off of that. If you like being an armored axe-wielding barbarian, then you will level up those skills. You can be a heavily armored magic-casting archer if you want. You play according to your play style. One disappointment though is that the previous spell-making system is gone. You are limited in the spells you cast by the spell tomes you find to learn spells. (though there are mods that add more spells). DLC lets you build your own houses, adopt kids, and ride dragons! ...and like the other TES games that are large in scope, there are several bugs and glitches in this game. Many are hilarious (like the giants sending you hurtling through the sky), and many are very frustrating (infamous random crash-to-desktop bug). The mod community however has been vigilant in releasing "unofficial bug fixes". Now what makes this game really great is the mod community, and the fact that Bethesda not only allows modding but encourages it. They include the Creation Kit allowing you to play around with the programmable aspects of the game. With the release of Skyrim came the Steam Workshop and launched a community of mods similar to the Nexus. This is why I have played this game over and over. I love going back and starting over playing with magicka sabers (lightsaber mod), more dragons mods, custom weapons and equipment mods, follower mods, new destination mods, town modification mods, etc. The possibilities are truly endless. No playthrough has ever been exactly the same. If you are NOT an Elder Scrolls fan, you will HATE this game. If you do NOT like open-world sandbox style RPG's, you will HATE this game. If you were captivated by Morrowind and Oblivion you will probably love this game. There is much nerd debate reminiscent of FFVI vs FFVII on which is better (FFVI is the best :p) - Morrowind or Skyrim. I personally choose Skyrim and wholeheartedly recommend this game to anyone and everyone to at least try once.

review: One of the deepest RPG experiences ever and does the Elder Scrolls franchise justice, The story is creative and unique and excellent. combat isn't as deep as games like Witcher 2 however its easy combat system allows for the game to be accessible to all. The modding community & scene within the game is amazing, if you are looking for a way to change the dynamic of the game or just a aesthetic change there will most likely be a mod for it, weapons, armor, quests its all there. the Graphics are still quite good especially with the HD texture pack and combined with a ENB the game looks glorious. its a MUST BUY.

review: Does this game really even need recommendations? No. Of the sandbox RPG's I've played in my life, including MMORPG's such as Ultima Online, this is likely the best... of those in a sword-and-shield universe. I'd still rank Fallout: New Vegas as my top sandbox RPG, but I know that that's probably just me and a small number of folks. Really, Skyrim is a masterpiece of not just sandbox RPG design, but of videogames in general. Graphics, music, lore, customizations, combat, crafting, and so forth, are all top-notch. Even the stability and technical aspects are masterful, and are the one area where Skyrim beats FO:NV hands-down, even in my book. My only real gripe is that the new skill-based system is not quite ideal. While I prefer this system over Morrowwind's (Elder Scrolls III), that's only because Morrowwind had a very silly requirement that you could only raise attribute points that had had related skills raised a level prior to the over-all leveling up of the character. Skyrim isn't as convoluted as that... but it's maybe too far the other way. Now, it's just a bunch of skills that have various perks that can be chosen, with only 3 attributes: strength (which affects health), stamina, and mana. While I think the simplification is quite useful, it's a bit of an over-simplification when I think to how much more fun FO:NV is with its seven attributes (Strength, Perception, Endurance, Charisma, Intelligence, Agility, Luck). Overall, though, this is as an iconic game as Super Mario Brothers, Doom, Command & Conquer, Pac-Man, Pong, and Madden games all are, and is obviously one of my top 20 videogames ever made. Which is really saying something, because aside from Skyrim, only Everquest, Ultima Online, and Fallout: New Vegas are on the list for RPGs. I prefer strategy and shooters far above RPGs. An A+ game that will live on for some time.

You can play however you want, but then you can add tons of mods which changes the game completely and makes it even better.

review: I am aware of the number of reviewes already published, but I believe I have played this game (as well as the other TES titles) enough to give my imput. I would be brief and simply point out pros and cons rather than an emotional review about the past games and melancholic memories they recall. PRO - Immersive and non-repeatable gameplay: whether you choose to be a brave warrior, a sneaky assassin or a wise mage, there is no standard option or guide to obtain the perfect character! As in the other TES titles, you can really get yourself into a variety of classes (even though there is no actual standard class) that influence the gameplay and the advance of the story (it is fun how the NPCs around Skyrim wil lrecognise you not simply as a Dragonborn, but also in various ways depending on your quests) - Lore: TES lore has always been the most fascinating thing in my opinion, and in Skyrim it will hugely affect your experience! You will find all the old lore as well as new local one. - Different difficulties for different challenges: You can be new to the genre as well as a veteran, the different difficulties make Skyrim a game perfect for every kind of player! - Great storyline: besides the Dragonborn quest line (which is already great despite some too "obvious" points), all the side quests and storylines create a fully interactive world with its problems and issues. I find the Civil War storyline the most interesting! - Great DLC: despite many other games, DLCs are definitely worth having! Dawnguard adds an involving storyline to some new great and spectacular abilities, Dragonborn, with its brand new location, offers hours of wonderful gameplay, storyline, abilities and easter eggs, Hearthfire, even if can seem quite useless offers an interesting alterantive gameplay. - Stunning graphic: being a title released in the 2011, we must admit it..even the most powerful PC still have little problems in dealing with the max graphic settings! The visual impact of the world is simply amazing, and the Workshop elements can only make your experience even better! CON - Perk system vs Old level up: I am a huge Morrowind fan, and when I firstly saw the perk I was quite disappointed. It doesn't allow the huge customize possibility as the old title did. - Repetitive dialogues: as the game progresses you will find a number of standard dialogues being repeated over and over, the arrow in the knee joke will not be fun anymoe when every guard will repeat it. - Easy enemies: as your abilities gets stronger, you will find that enemies will be easier to kill. Normally it would be a positive aspect (hey, I level up to be stronger, not weaker!), but when a Draugr is more challenging than a Dragon, than you may be quite disappointed. Overall I would DEFINITELY recommend this game and if someone still has to purchase it...do it, before Jurgen WIndcaller himself Fus Ro Dah you!

Joking aside, to me it's only worth playing if you switch to Master or Legendary difficulty since the game is too easy on the other levels. The difference is that on all the others you'd slay a dragon with no problem and on Legendary you'll run for your life. :D

Because it's better and better every time and if you like RPG.... ....I can't find any better game for you than Skyrim. But when I think about it now... ... There is just one little thing that I enjoyed in Oblivion more than in Skyrim. Because the testing hall in Skyrim is really boring. And that's all. I can't see anything worse than that. And if you don't like cheats... ... well then it's a perfect game for you. I love it. Buy it. :-D

review: Skyrim in a nut shell is one of the greatest free roam , RPG style games I have ever encountered. After playing Oblivion and playing it until I dropped dead I had high hopes for this game and thankfully they were met. Skyrim gives variety of weapons, character custimization, quests, factions, and more to keep the player occupied for hours to come. The amount of change between the Elder Scrolls games keeps me hoping for more.

review: This game is amazing. It has great story, environment, exploration, and immersion. The combat is fun, though not overly crazy. Pretty much consists of two buttons if you're melee, but caster and stealth characters require a lot more thought. Extremely moddable and replayable. Levels exist but there are no classes and your character gets good at what you do (each skill has it's own level). Probably the best single player game I can think of.

review: My first intro to The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim (TesVS) was August of last year. My friend John (call name: jacnutco) told me about it. Bought it and have played it almost every day since then. TesVS is the best Role Playing Game (RPG) I've ever played. The game includes several thousand quests and last count yesterday, over 21,000 mods to compliment game play. As part of the game, mods (created by fellow players) may include new & better armor and weapons outright or with a quest to find them. Mods may also contain books, equipment, artifacts, potions, enchantments, followers (companions to assist you in gameplay), & a horse, just to name a few. I can talk forever so I'll close by listing some great things about TesVS: - armor & weapons, - artifacts, - battles, - character creation, - characters of Skyrim, - character homes, - creatures and monsters, - enchanting & unenchanting process, - flying & ridable dragons, - followers of every race, animal or monster, - graphics, - hours & hours of game play, - maps, - potions & spells, - quests (4 sure), - training books, - trainers, - unenchanted gear (that can be enchanted to players specs), - visibility & invisibility, - waterwalking & waterbreating. - Xena the warrior Princess is one of the mods, - you're really gonna like this game, - Zorro, if not already included can "be" included if you want to create the mod. If you read this far, i hope you liked the review. i definitely recommend this game.

review: Thanks for Skyrim! But seriously this is an elder scrolls game. Some might say its been dumbed down. I'd like to think of it as streamlined. The DLC are are a bit meh. Hearthfire adding buildable/customizable houses. Dragonborn adding a new questline and island with the possibilty to respec Perks and such at the cost of dragon souls. . Dawnguard adding a supernatural questline. But its well worth it.

review: One of the best games I've ever played. This earns a spot on my top five list, hands down. Graphics are terrific, even on a terrible computer like mine. It's fun to play, and has so, so, so much content in it. Several hundred hours of gameplay are to be found here. The voice acting is spot on. Replay value is sort of meh, but I'm not sure how you would be able to replay this, considering it takes about a few months to complete enough quests to feel like you're done with it. Also, Derkeethus. My follower. My bae. My LIFE. He is the best. I think this tops Oblivion, but give Oblivion a shot, too. Both are terrific games.

review: What I like about Skyrim...what I like about Skyrim...if I told you everything, we'd be here for awhile. Short version all I can say is that If you have yet to buy this game, then you have wasted your money on other games! The Elder Scolls V: Skyrim is perhaps the best game I've ever laid eyes upon! The graphics, the gameplay, the characters, and the potential mods! The story plot could use some work, but reguardless, you will enjoy this game. I've made over 10+ characters playing this game alone and served 600+ hours on this game. I originally bought it for Xbox 360, AND AGAIN on the pc. If you get a little bored, you'll always find yourself coming back. There is even a huge modding community dedicated to adding more content to the game for free! Why are you still reading this, why aren't you playing Skyrim! I'm not just saying this points or anything, I specifically chose this game because everyone should have a copy, I can assure you, the money is well spent playing this game.

review: I Recommend this game to anyone who likes rpg's, immersive gameplay, and a well crafted open world experience. I got this game when it first came out and I am still playing it today. This is mostly due to the exellent modding community that constantly realeses mods that could keep almost anyone playing this game for a very long time. In the world of skyrim you craft your own story and make your own reputation. You could be a master theif,a swordmaster, The strongest of mages, the bringer of chaos, and much much more. The ineresting main quest is only a small part of Skyrim's huge collection of things to do. If you're into lore, Skyrim is filled with loads of books and stories to find throughout you're adventure. It remains true to the previous elder scrolls games aswell. Although Skyrim has it's issues they are usually not noticable and you will most likely only find them if you look very closely. Skyrim also has a good leveling system. The more you use an item such as a one handed steel sword the more you are trained in that catagory of weapons or spells and the more skills you can gain allowing you to earn unique perks. The mods will fix the mostly outdated graphics and the easy AI. Mods are most likely what will keep you going through a number of years. Not only is Skyrim a very good game with loads and loads of interesting side quests but it is also the most replayable game I have ever played before. I probably have around five acounts each with a different goal and each with their own immersive experience. This is why Skyrim is my most played and favourite game of all time and why I strongly recommmend it.

review: ***DISCLAIMER: I see a very select few negative reviews for the game, and the majority are by people who are butthurt about glitches that somehow miraculously make the game unplayable only for them, as the vast majority of us have found our way around them or they have been fixed long since, so do not let those negative reviews deter you, most are just trolling and stand out for the contrary persons they are, and would probably just as soon not recommend you wear a parachute to go skydiving. The current version of the game, expansion packs and all, contains very few bugs so far as I have encountered on both PC and Xbox360 versions. THIS REVIEW WAS MADE IN A SPOILER-FREE ENVIROMENT (but may contain peanuts)*** Now... I have this to say about this game: there is "life before The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim", then there is "life after The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim". If you have not played the Legendary Edition of The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim you simply have not, in my opinion, played one of the two best videogames ever made. This game is a MONUMENT. If you like to explore vast, fantastic landscapes, find treasure and swing swords, welcome to paradise. In response to some people complaining about it for some reason, yes, it will play like a shooter to some, and I have seen some of the trolls claim that its combat system is mindless and clunky hack and slash, that the combat lacks diversity, or that it plays like Call of Duty with a bow and arrow. I beg the question: compared to what other fps rpg?... First off, there are plenty of ways to go about combat, be it with the many magic spells at your disposal, stealthy assassinations, direct brute force, picking people off shooter-style with a bow or ranged spells, or a wide variety of entertaining "shout" skills to employ. Backstab, disgorging fatalities and lopping off heads are some of my personal favorites, as is shouting someone at the proper angle for maximum trajectory or off a lofty precipe for maximum airborne enjoyment. Yes, it plays like a shooter because it is meant to be an fps rpg... forgive me if I fail to see the downside in this. If you find it too easy using one method, you have the freedom to use an alternate approach or different gear to go about it - fact is, the game isn't meant to be an fps skill clinic, though it holds up as well action-wise as most of the fps games out there - it's meant to be an exploration and story-driven rpg aimed at those who enjoy questing in an open world environment, and the difficulty level will be more based on how you challenge yourself playing it. This should be considered a merit, as it has the flexibility of appealing to players with varying levels of fps skill. Then, beyond combat, there's the living, breathing feel of the open world offered up for you to run amock in, complete with hunting and gathering, crafting, homemaking, puzzles, dialogue, companion npcs, and npcs throughout with their own agendas and routines who you can watch go about their daily business if you please (note: it is difficult to say whether the routines of the npcs in Skyrim are as elaborate as some of the things I recall seeing of the npcs' routines in The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, another similarly great title also by Bethesda, but they are there to a sufficient extent to make the world feel populated - npcs will sleep, go to the inn, converse with each other, sit down to eat, gather, hunt, etc...). The game serves up a wide variety of content, especially with the expansions, and, as one should expect, isn't going to do any one thing as well as perhaps some other games might do individually, but certainly doesn't shortchange anything it attempts either. This is to say, yes, the Mass Effect games excel a little more in terms of the cinematic quality of player dialogues, yes, the Crysis games are more agile in terms of fps combat and combat ai, and yes, you can have more fun with homemaking and relationships in Sims 3, but I can't think of one other title that brings as many different gameplay aspects together in a game as well as this one to create a three-dimensional fps world in which to immerse yourself (other than perhaps previous Bethesda titles such as The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion or Fallout 3). As a bonus to all that, the game respawns creatures, dungeons and randomly generated side-quests from various npcs, so there's no limit to how long you can enjoy running around the world and hoarding stuff beyond the very epic main quests. And, last, but not least, the game is pleasing to the eye, and plays VERY smoothly even on some very modest systems (it even runs fairly well with low-medium settings on a Core 2 Duo 2.2ghz with 533mhz ram and a single 8800 GTS 512 MB I still have kicking around). Even as I update this review right now a couple of years after initial release I still enjoy the graphics style nearly as well as any other title I can think of (maybe I'm not very fussy?), and even so, if that doesn't satisfy you, there is a world of modifications of every kind (including graphics and character models) offered by a massive community that simply adores the game (I, personally, am a purist of sorts when it comes to play-throughs, so this review is based entirely on the game and its expansions straight out of the box). I have seen someone complain about animations, referring to the dragons in particular... 1. that's seriously nitpicking, 2. compared to what other game that does anything on the same scale? and 3. the dragons look great to me. Bethesda did a spectacular job with capturing their concept art in-game while not sacrificing any perfomance, and the colour palette and model styles are consistent throughout, giving its vast, open world a feeling of continuity over the span of its substantial expansion packs. This is a game I would score a perfect "10" alongside only one other game in all my 20+ years of hardcore gaming and over 200+ games finished**: Deus Ex. In my opinion, among all the many different forms of entertainment I know of in the world, this is the single best way to spend 30$ in terms of "bang for the buck" (...OK, true that, I have never been to Thailand...) *Please note: I strongly recommend you go directly for the Legendary Edition as it helps round out the content of the game very nicely. **(hours played in Steam on this profile do not reflect my actual hours played for most titles on the account for the following reasons: multiple Steam accounts, multiple consoles/systems, majority of games were hard copies, some of which were added to Steam later, some played on Origin, Windows Live or Uplay, etc., and, as you can see, I refer to my experiences with several games that do not appear here, including my beloved Deus Ex - which, if you are into oldschool games with 3D graphics, I highly recommend, alongside the terrific mod for it called The Nameless Mod, which I am not sure how to install with the Steam version of Deus Ex as I still use the original hard copy)

Didn't think I'd be interested in a game like this as it seems a little too nerdy for me (I'm usually into FPS types of games and survival games) but it turned out to be one of my favourite games.

review: This is probably my favorite game of all-time. It centers around my favorite province of Tamriel-Skyrim, my favorite race to play-Nords, and my favorite creatures-the Dragons. I was enchanted by Morrowind on the X-Box, and had a blast playing Oblivion on the 360, so I was estatic when Skryim came out on the PC in 2011. I had just bought a brand new computer with some beefed up specs and was eager to try it out on this beautiful looking game. There is a reason why this game was so hyped, scored so many rewards, was talked about on the internet so much (I took an arrow in the knee jokes) , and sold so many units. Skyrim delivered. This game has some of the most beautiful scenery I've ever seen. Skyrim is sparsely populated, so there are miles of forrests, snowy mountains, lakes, green plains, rolling hills, rocky cliffs, swamps, dwemer ruins, draugr tombs, hidden grottos, caves filled with dangerous creatures, and the endless sea. If this place were real, I'd like to live there. Also the DLC includes the island of Solstheim which is a sweet return to the giant-mushroom and ash-filled Morrowind. Jeremy Soule returns again bringing another great orchestral soundtrack. The main theme "Dragonborn" is a more raw and primal take on the Morrowind them "Nerevar Rising". Included in the DLC on Solstheim is the overworld theme "The Road Most Travelled", which is a sweet nostalgic trip down memory lane for anyone who has played Morrowind. Gameplay is much the same as previous TES games, with a few minor changes (such as the Shout system, which I find minorly disappointing). There are hundreds of side-quests including the Mages, Thieves, Warrior Guilds, etc. and many more. There's also numerous dungeons with random loot and encounters to explore. The majority of the skill sets such as destruction magic, restoration, sneaking, heavy armor, etc. are still here and the leveling system is centered around increasing those skills by using them often, and being able to select perks from a tree each time you level. The class system has been eliminated which many TES fans have raged against, but in all actuality you don't need a class to limit you to a specific set of skills. All skills are able to be leveled to 100 with use, and the legendary system allows you to reset the skill after 100 and keep your perk points. If you like being a cloak-wearing illusion mage, then you will use those skills and level based off of that. If you like being an armored axe-wielding barbarian, then you will level up those skills. You can be a heavily armored magic-casting archer if you want. You play according to your play style. One disappointment though is that the previous spell-making system is gone. You are limited in the spells you cast by the spell tomes you find to learn spells. (though there are mods that add more spells). DLC lets you build your own houses, adopt kids, and ride dragons! ...and like the other TES games that are large in scope, there are several bugs and glitches in this game. Many are hilarious (like the giants sending you hurtling through the sky), and many are very frustrating (infamous random crash-to-desktop bug). The mod community however has been vigilant in releasing "unofficial bug fixes". Now what makes this game really great is the mod community, and the fact that Bethesda not only allows modding but encourages it. They include the Creation Kit allowing you to play around with the programmable aspects of the game. With the release of Skyrim came the Steam Workshop and launched a community of mods similar to the Nexus. This is why I have played this game over and over. I love going back and starting over playing with magicka sabers (lightsaber mod), more dragons mods, custom weapons and equipment mods, follower mods, new destination mods, town modification mods, etc. The possibilities are truly endless. No playthrough has ever been exactly the same. If you are NOT an Elder Scrolls fan, you will HATE this game. If you do NOT like open-world sandbox style RPG's, you will HATE this game. If you were captivated by Morrowind and Oblivion you will probably love this game. There is much nerd debate reminiscent of FFVI vs FFVII on which is better (FFVI is the best :p) - Morrowind or Skyrim. I personally choose Skyrim and wholeheartedly recommend this game to anyone and everyone to at least try once.

The story of Skyrim may not be groundbreaking or something to remember that doesn't mean the game is not fun. I definitely recommend this game to anybody who likes RPG's or anybody who's a fan of the previous Elder Scrolls games. The modding community is something everyone should be part of, every day it keeps growing to make Skyrim even better and with workshop integration it makes it even easier.

Theres WAY!!! more stuff to do if you buy this game (which you should). Will reccomend this to all my friends and will also reccomend playing the legendary edition, but i you just want to play the regular version of Skyrim, then do it. This could possibly be the greatest rpg ever and the greatest singleplayer game i've ever played. Well what are you waiting for, buy the freaking game for crying out loud!!!

review: Being a player, who loved Morrowind and couldn't stand Oblivion, I was surprised how much time I actually spend playing Skyrim. What is more, the main plots (main quest and mages in my case) were actually quite uncomplicated, most of the time predictable and player choices lacked depth. Yet, enjoyed this game very much. That was due to two main factors - extremely smooth gameplay, and what is even more valuable, the amazing atmosphere of the region built by every thing you walk through - the tombs, the marshes, mountain passages, rivers, totally unique, yet still down from scale (same as Oblivion and Morrowind) cities, and the NPCs you meet. Skyrim is a harsh and unfriendly land and you often have to stick your nose out of some places and even being the legendary hero - run from dragons. I especially recommend the assasin (Dark Brotherhood) storyline and of course the Dragonborn extension, which is also surprisingly good with the recreated - known from Bloodmoon addon for Morrowind - island Soltsheim. Comparing these two you'll get much less quests to complete, but they're still worth the time with even better atmosphere which got some TES III nostalgia and really well created mage character Neloth. Just simply don't expect from Skyrim choice and roleplay depth, you won't get it. Yet the land is worth of trying out, exploring, enjoying the view, killing thousand of draugrs and meeting very well crafted NPCs.

review: Had this game since it came out on Xbox probably have well over a few thousand hours, but only recently started playing on PC but still. Love this game to pieces. Just when you think you had explored everything you can, suddenly a trail of bandits attack you from a new Camp that always leads to treasures at the end. Learning all the plot about the previous Daedric princes is magnificent also, if you ever played any game by bethasda (excluding that Home Alone game they made, oh lord no) you'll know it will be fun packed. If you love medevial/fantasy games, get it. It's even on sale right now! How could you not

review: While not as truly free as Morrowind and lacking the interesting quests from Oblivion, Skyrim isn't as good(or as bad) as a lot of people seem to think, in my humble opinion. Enjoyable, but quite a few features were removed and streamlined from previous entries and like Oblivion, I think Bethsesda was banking on the modding community fixing several bugs and making overall improvements. An improvement from Oblivion, minus the quests, and downgrade from Morrowind(exlcuding graphics and a few other improvements that have come from recent technology), still a solid Elder Scrolls title.

review: Okay, so here I start. Graphical and environmental Graphically, Skyrim does it most utter best. Being a late 2011 game, Skyrim shows a beautiful picture to your eyes when you don't pay much attention to details. But there is where it falls short. Being large as Skyrim is, the amount of detail can't be very high, which is very notiable once one goes on a graphics-quest. For example, ropes around poles are hexagrams and candlelights have a rather peculiar shape. Yet this is not something that someone quickly notices, let alone it being troublesome. Skyrim has an amazing large world. It offers both harsh, cold weather as well as dense forests and rocky mountains. Yet the world feels very empty. The capital city only offers like 30 NPC, not counting the "lifeless" guards. I often ask myself why there is a civil war. To fight for those 100 other inhabitants of your immense playground? Events and quests Skyrim quests are very linear. There are very few choices to be made: you almost always have to follow someone's instructions. Yet the diversity is hidden inside the overall questline. You can often choose to either help or fight against a certain faction. Once you made that choice, it's merely a completion of continuous questlines with almost no freedom or choice. Yet the questlines do not feel boring at all. You really get involved in the story, giving you the option as if you're able to deny a quest. yet still, the game turns it in that way that you still have to follow what you've been told, or you're just a real jerk (Can you resist helping an old lady fetch some food? I bet you can't). Freedom and choice Aside from the quests, the game offers all kinds of freedom. MUCH FREEDOM. Make and design your own house. Choose your armor types (Prefer the hack 'n slash guy? Maybe a supportive mage that watches from the side while his summonings slaughter his enemies? Or do you like the kind of person that sneaky stabs two daggers in someones back? Your choice!). Unimportant quests that do not alter the gameplay can easily be denied, or played as someone wants. Don't want to help that jerk? Simply don't! (Y'know, maybe, when noone is looking, that dagger you found lately, eh, it eh, fits perfectly in his, you know, his back, hehe) I definately recommend this game. I really, really, really do. Really, when you don't like it, I'll personally give you your money back! (Or not :p)

review: Easily scores on my top 10 games of all time, a brilliant Action RPG that provides a true nonlinear experience. The game does not give a sh*t when sully your reputation. Friendly fire exists and even crucial plot members can die or hate you. This gives you amazing opporunities to be a complete  or a god send to the people of skyrim. That gets to my next point on how good the NPC system is. Coming back to my last point in how you can sully your reputation, you can buy simply talking to them, thats right, many of the NPC's have multiple pathways of chatter, this allows an even bigger nonlinear feel than it already has. Let us not forget about the epic battles as well. They, are, EPIC, to avoid spoiling anything thats all im going to say.So overall we have one of the most nonlinear RPG of all time, a somewhat challenging auhority (early game) unlike other open world games I know *cough* gta *cough*. This holds a solid spot of #7 on my top 10 best games of all time.

review: When I first played Skyrim on the Xbox, I was hooked into the world of The Elder Scrolls instantly. However, when I later decided to buy the Legendary Edition of Skyrim on Steam, I found myself in a whole new world. The world I found myself in was the ultimate modding community, which consisted mainly of the Steam Workshop and Skyrim Nexus. There are endless amounts of mods you can add into your game to make Skyrim seem like a whole new game entirely. Even if you own a console version of TESV: Skyrim, you should own the PC version just because of the mods. With mods, you can make Skyrim look like a game that came out yesterday with multiple enchancements of gameplay, graphics, and even sounds. Overall, I recommend this game to anyone with a love for gaming.

review: I love this game enough to not quit it even when it break my characters with the various bugs occuring if you download a mod interfering with the game. ...and that says I either got a problem or the game is just too good. Joking aside, to me it's only worth playing if you switch to Master or Legendary difficulty since the game is too easy on the other levels. The difference is that on all the others you'd slay a dragon with no problem and on Legendary you'll run for your life. :D

review: I have tried Morrowind and Oblivion before, but they never really caught my attention and so at first I wasn't really that interested in the game [Skyrim]. Then I saw a few friends play it and also saw some mods and thought why not [bought Legendary pack from the start] and I was good to go. The game in itself is pretty good with a few exception of course thats why modding exists. But there was something that felt slightly rushed in the game some of the story(ies). For example the war between the Empire and Stormcloaks, it was to bare and to fast. It didn't feel like a civil war, it felt like a conquest map in Battlefield without the reinforcements and you being some big badass killing everyone and winning the battles. There was no tactic no manuvering on the battlefield, just go follow the path and you will eventually get there oh and hack and slash or pyroblast anyone in the way [whatever the weapon(s) of choice you had]. Thank the modding community for the mods otherwise I would not have played the game for this long, I would probably have finished all the stories and quests [aside from the repeatables like go kill this and that and get 100 gold each time <--- glad I could mod that too]. Seriously Bethesda? 100 gold for killing a damn dragon?! or cleaning a Giant camp?! I could let the bandit camp slide for 100 gold in the beginning, but they didn't get easier and I still only got 100 gold not trying to be greedy here or anything. But those Chiefs are like some Raid boss in some MMORPG especially if played on Legendary. The bounty should be equivalent to the risk. Anyhow the game in itself is bare, it doesn't have the specialization Morrowind and Oblivion had. All I have to say yes the game felt and was rushed in a lot of things. I am not going to rant about them here, but the game is worth trying even though you will probably spend more time finding all the appopriate mods to make the game better than actually playing the game. The game is worth it if you get the whole Legendary pack and get it on sale! [Shh! Don't tell anyone I told you that *winks*] You can spend a lot of time in the game even without mods, but in the end you will mod it unless you are here merely for the story and thats it then you are done with the game. Yeah give the game a try but do mod it if you wish for a better experience G.E.M.S have perfect mods that will make the game more immersive.

review: This game is only bested by the third installment in the series: Morrowind. I love both games but the magical possibilities of Morrowind makes it better to me... Being able to levitate for instance is something that Skyrim lacks in comparison to its older brother! With more than 200 hours played, I'd say that this is one of my favorite games of all time in the First person RPG category!

review: Gameplay: It's classic TES Gameplay, search, explore, kill with swords, magic and bows or a mixture. Character builds are gone; just use the skill to level it up. Dragons are powerful and epic and combat is, again not the best but classic TES. There must be close to 1000 or in Todd's words infinity quests for the player to do, he right you know too :) Story: Predictable but gripping and fun all the way. The main story has gotten rid of tedious missions and left only the raw and great missions. That said though it still look me 26 hours to complete the main storyline over 3 days and im not even close to the surface of the game. Graphics: TES has not boasted about the graphics but on Ultra High i was admiring the detail in every nook and cranny of the game, characters look realistic, everything just look's amazing!. Easily in the top 5 best looking games ever. The game does suffer from a few bugs but a small price to pay. Almost picture perfect 9.8/10 :D - Dean "Buy this game, GOTY"

review: MY EXPERIENCE: ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- "As i lift my Daedric bow from my belt and take aim at a unsuspecting deer, the feeling of adrenaline pumping through my veins, power up my shot but then all of a sudden a gigantic roar from the mountains erupt and my prey flees. As i turn around i cannot help but release a groan as i witness the sight of a frost dragon, flying in circles. all i can think to myself, What have i gotten myself into" MY OPINION ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Skyrim is an open world game full of twists and turns that are thrown out to you in the blue. Bethesda really have amazed me with this title and i know this review is 2 years too late but it was possibly game of the year 2011, What i like about the game is the movement the main plot gives you and the detailed graphics into somethings that aren't even real in the non-gaming world. MY VERDICT ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- My overall verdict of this game is that if you are a fantasy RPG gamer and love anything that bethesda have done then you will love this game but if you have never heard about this game where have you been under a rock? MY RATING ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Rating 9/10 - A Game with good gameplay and a moving plot, will slice hours out of your free time.

review: Having never played an Elder Scrolls game before, I had no idea to expect. My friends were telling me to play this left and right. All I knew about it was: Dragons. It sat in my library played only once for a half-hour for about 6 months, before I decided to start over. And, let me tell you, that was one of the best decisions I have made about a video game. In this game, you start off as a prisoner, on your way to an unknown location, next to a bandit, a soldier of a rebellion (the Stormcloaks), and the leader of the Stormcloaks, Ulfic, Jarl of windhelm. After seeing the rebel beheaded, it is now your turn to be killed at the block. But, just as the axeman is about to bring down the axe, a dragon, unseen for thousands of years, comes down to attack the city. After this comes a long adventure to really test your might. One new addition to this game that was not in any previous Elder Scrolls game, is the Dragons. A powerful adversary, they can only be truly defeated by you, the Dragonborn, or Dovahkiin. Each time you defeat a dragon, its soul is absorbed and can be used to learn that dragon's knowlege about a word of power of your choice. Gain 3 words of power in one "tree", and you get a powerful Thu'um, or shout. Each Thu'um can be different legnths, like 1, 2, or 3 words. Words of power can be learned from word walls at the end of dungeons, and unlocked using dragon souls. Speaking of Dragons, the dragon language, or Dovahzuhl, is a full language, that can be used to talk in a normal conversation. Cool, but not practical. This "shout system" uses no mana, but instead a cooldown bar at the top of the screen. This is so that it does not interfere with your magic casting. Even if you prefer physical weapons over magic, the shout can be used to great advantage. Like all Elder Scrolls games, the main quest is not even the longest part of the game. There are side quests that can take hours to complete, even though it seems like mere minutes. And somehow, these quests show that you are a once in a lifetime person. It seems that only you are capable of doinng whatever needs to be done, and that you eventually become the leader of everything. The DLC adds hours of additional gameplay, and tons of new enimies, followers, quests, and gear. It is very much worth getting the Legendary Edition, instead of getting the DLC separate (it'll cost you 25 more US dollars. A mistake I made). If you have never played a TEH game, that is fine. You need no previous knowledge of previous games' storyline. The "Oblivion Crisis" is mentioned a feew times, but is not important. If you want to get into the modern RPG/Elder Scrolls series, this is a great place to start. This game kinda makes you wish you were a Dovahkiin in all the games, including the hopefully soon Elder Scrolls VI. Also, to make your guy even more special, if you read to the end of "The book of the Dragonborn", there is a prophecy, which states. "The World-Eater will wake, and the wheel will turn to face the last Dragonborn". Saying that you, are the last dragonborn to exist.

review: When you have a game where you go to check the time and it's six hours later, you know you made an excellent choice. Bethesda delivered as expected. A truly advanced RPG that honestly lets you play a role howeer you want. Whatever the price may be, it's worth it. Many games today can be six ot twelve hours (even less) and beluieve they justify the $60 release price. Here's a game that gives and gives and gives. You can expect a minimum of 90 hours of gameplay; 200+ if you care to search every shadow of this cold yet breathtaking world. And then when you factor in the DLC along with the mod community, the amount of time you can invest is exponential. Buy it. You won't regret it.

And Less time loading, I just think Oblivion is MUCH better than Skyrim,I can't tell you about morrowind because I have Not Played that,Skyrim Got most of it's fame from just being an open World RPG,Oblivion had much more Better Looking landscape,But Yes I know Skyrim is set in the land of the nords in the north so it's gotta be dark and snowy,Overall I think Oblivion Had Much More time put into it by Bethesda! But I think you should play Oblivion first Then Skyrim! I hope this helps! -ApeX

review: Skyrim is one of the best RPG out there right now. You can have countless hours of fun in the game and that is not counting the DLC. When you think you have done everything you can still find new things to do or if you do not think you will find that new thing you can add tuns of new stuff made by other players. Some mods out there add dozens of hours of new content and sont get me wrong some of that sontent is like AWESOME. If you out AWESOME game like Skyrim add even more AWESOME content in the form of DLC and then mod this game with textures new mechanics and content you will be in this game playing and enjoying it for hundreds of hours like i did :D

review: I've had this game since it was released 11th November 2011. I've had it on PS3, Xbox360 and now PC. I've had over 25 playthroughs At an estimate I've played around 600 hours. (I know there's people with even more) I can't remember ever feeling bored or not having anything to do. WatchDogs is a brilliant game I played WatchDogs for 5 days, completed all the story and most of the side missions. I got bored. I'm now playing Skyrim again. I wasn't going to rate Skyrim because, for it to be believable, I would need to find something wrong with it. So 9.9999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999/10 bye-bye ;)

review: Ive recently transfered from console gaming to PC, and I can say I do not regret it, Consoles have there own way of being beautiful with there exclusive's and there own predetermined fixed graphics output, but getting my new Computer and playing skyrim on it is like nothing Ive ever experienced before, I feel like a part of me that has always loved PC's has finally awaken from a deep slumber and seeing skyrims beauty and endless about of fun is nothing compare to what I could have experienced on console, There are plenty of ways to inhance your enjoyment of the game to the max, including, Fun and awesome console commands, Halarious, cool, and enjoying community mods, and especially being able to make any guard who said "I use to be an adventurer like you, and then I took and arrow in the knee" disappear into thin air, or Kill him with a snap, Or perhaps just download the mod preventing NPC's to say that dialoge. either way, with the vast amazing beautiful game of skyrim, and its endless amounts of fun available I would rate Skyrim a 8/10 Although there are many fun quests to do and this game furfills a lust for adventure, some of the quests feel a little unfinished or unsatisfactory when completed leaving the player confused as to what is going to happen now, Or leaving the player finding him or her self a little ripped off after spending there time completing the quest

review: This is a wonderful world to get lost in. It is very much a story driven narrative, and you aren't required to play Oblivion to understand what is going on, though it will help. Great music by Jeremy Soule adds to a wonderful atmosphere. Wandering around and finding dungeons and camps and cities makes for an in-depth experience... for the first 2 or 3 times. There comes a point where you start running around naked punching mudcrabs because you can, because the dragons really don't matter eventually. The DLC is fantatsic, though the boss fights for DLC and main game are lackluster. It feels like you are helped along too much, or that you are too limited in the world. The side quests are the biggest portion of the game, and some of them are fantastic, others just seem strung along for no purpose other than to add time. I would buy this game again, in fact I did on 360 and now on PC. After the first few playthroughs, go to the mod section and go wild, because that will keep you entertaiend for ages. Praise to be the Dovahkiin!

review: I wasn't going to buy this game at first because I only meet the minimum requirements, but then on the Summer Sale it went down to 3.74 Euros so I figured that I could buy it and play it when I buy my new PC. Nevertheless the game plays quite smoothly on my PC (lowest graphics of course), but I don't mind at all. The gameplay and combat is fantastic and the sheer immersion of the game makes it awesome! I can't speak for the graphics of course, but I would definetly recommend it to everyone and not only RPG fans.

review: At the start of the game i ended getting stripped by a bunch of  bandits then an imperial guard gave me some pants and i fled. By the time i reached a nearby town, I tried cross-breeding a dragon with a rabbit. The rabbit kept leaping out of the dragons  so i just effed the rabbit up doggy style. I saw a man sleeping in his comfy bed, but i had the urge to break into his butt. Guards caught me and i was brought into this court full of as bandits. They said told me that thy were gonna allow this violation as long as i were to  inside. that sums my skyrim life story up 10/10 game of the century!!!!

review: Awesome game! Open world, choose and craft your story by completing quests the way you see best fits! Magic, dragons, and many other creatures and lifeforms to fight and interact with as you travel across the lands of Tamriel! Hone skills that you want to master and aqquire a deadly skillset to decemate your foes! Large weapon varieties as well as a decent amount of clothing to choose from make for an even more immersive experience as you really feel connected to your character, so dress your character as you choose. Also, along side a few mods, skyrim just never ends, mods adding in new questlines, creatures, characts, weapons and armor, as well as graphical improvements to make your game look as beautiful as you wish! All in all this game will provide you with hours of enjoyment and you will notice time flies when you play as the lust to complete quests and slay your enemies grows after each quest, you complete one quest which leads to another and so on, Highly reccomend this game for anyone who enjoys medieval settings and combat styles, myths and so on. 10/10 :)

review: The first time I played Skyrim, I played it on a crappy machine that could barely run it with the lowest settings. Even on low, the graphics were still very impressive. Even today as I play it again, I am mesmerized by the pure scenery as I travel across Skyrim. The game runs flawlessly on my new desktop and I couldn't be happier. The mods available for it are well and plenty and it's top notch from Bethesda.

review: This is by far the best game I've ever played. Just when you think you're done, you get pulled back in. Mabye I should play a mage, or a warrior, or a thief. The lore is so expansive you just get lost in it, even now im just barely grasping the big picture of it. you're adventure as the Dovahkiin (or not) will go on forever. The mods are so much fun, they add upon everything, from quests to cities to followers and armors there is a mod for it. 20/10 would ruin my life again.

review: Skyrim... The point with no return. Once you started to play you'll never quit, you'll never forget. The most epic game of all game epicness. Buy the bloody game. Play the bloody game. It's one of a kind. And for each and every minor flaw (for the most part technical issues and bugs) there are updates and bloody mods perfectly executed to enhance even more the game experience. You shall burn and you will relish it.

review: I got this first on the 360. To be quite honest, this game can be real engrossing depending on how you play it. At first, it felt empty to me once I finished the main storyline back on 360, but now that I'm playing it again on PC, starting fresh, I'm absorbed by it like when I first played it on 360. This is one of THE SP RPGs out there that'll take up a lot of your time.

review: Hundreds or even thousands of hours can be invested into this awesome game. I've been playing it since it was released, and I can guarantee that this game will consume all of your time even without mods. It features so many questlines involving the return of the dragons, assassinating people, being a thief, researching a mysterious magical orb, and even join a clan of werewolves. The game leaves you open to create your own unique and creative backstory while also keeping the beginning of the game interesting. If there is anything you don't like about the game, mods can likely change it.

review: Some of my favorite things about this game was that even when you were to finish the main story line there are side quests so you dont get bored. Then another thing was the hug amount of mods that you can use because I have not seen a lot of other games with a huge amounts of mods. I would think only about 15 other games have more or close to the amount this game hold. But some of the things i don't like is how its not online and its only single player. I usally play online games but i saw a mod recently today for online where you can trade chat and other things its seems interseting but I have to go find it agian. If i were to rate this game i would say 8.5 because mods and for the amount of freedom that is in this game.

review: I found Skyrim to be immensely enjoyable. Right from the word go you are able to make a character from multiple races and alter their appearance as you wish. After the tutorial you are released into the vast, beautiful world of Skyrim. As you travel around the land you will experience breathtaking scenery, from snow-covered peaks to glowing caverns, and many unique caves/dungeons/ruins which contain a multitude of enemies from spiders to dragons. You can spend your time mastering the many skills available or completing quests, which there are a ridiculous amount available. In doing so you can gather equipment to allow you to create any kind of character imaginable. If you enjoy an RPG with freedom of creativity, dynamic combat and awesome scenery the Skyrim is for you.

review: The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is my favourite game of all time. For potential buyers, Skyrim is an open-world RPG that positions you as the dragonborn. Your quest is to save the world from imminent destruction by slaying dragons. However, you're also free to do as you like. From trading with caravans, killing the undead draugr or even jsut cooking, there is a lot to do. Despite the large amount of glitches, as Bethesda games often have, they won't take away from your experience. On top of this, they're also quite generous with DLC by providing entirely new weapons, skills and playable areas. This is just vanilla Skyrim! Once you use mods, anything can happen! I cannot recommend Skyrim enough.

review: Well what is there to say about this game... lots to be fair. This game is massive! You can be playing it for hunderds of hours. I know this because between playing it on the Xbox 360 and my PC I've amounted somewhere in the region of 350 hours spanning 3 or 4 different characters. The best reason to even consider getting this game though is the ability to download mods. The number of mods is truely unbelievable ranging from weapons and armours to massive DLC sized quest lines of which there are plenty which can add many more enjoyable hours of play. In short this is a truely great game if you like to play games and amazing if you're a fan of RPG's. A must buy!

review: This game is just to amazing not to play, especially if you like a very good rpg with a great story and action to it. The game is has alot of content in the regular campaign and in the DLC content you can buy with it, you will never really get board of the game because the massive amount of mods and I mean massive. The mods for this game very's from funny mods like a playable chicken character to very cool player homes and etc. So if you have 20$ on your steam and you have no ideas what to get I recomend The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim to you

game-hours: 612.7
review: I would like to preface this review with a little bit of transparancy: I am not a huge Elder Scrolls player. I tried playing Oblivion, and just could not get into the story, even though I thought the graphics were good and the gameplay had some unique elements that I really enjoyed. Then I came across Skyrim. A friend told me about this game, and I wasn't sure I was going to enjoy trying it. Oh, I was wrong. Just so wrong. Skyrim sucked me in from the moment the dragon Alduin seals his fate, freeing you from the executioner's chopping block. Exposition was delivered in a much more cinematic way, compared to previous Elder Scrolls installments, and it really made it feel as though I was playing in a fantasy epic, similar to Beowolf or The Lord of the Rings. The scenery was gorgeous - and mods can make it moreso - and the unique skill and character levelling systems are ones that I really enjoy playing with to create a unique character within the game. I also enjoy how they allow me to really create my character. Bethesda is unique in this respect. The attitude your character has to completing side quests - or the main quest - is completely up to you, the player. You're not playing someone predetermined by the game developer, you're really playing whoever you want to, whether it's a dragonslaying, vengeful Blade, a Dark Brotherhood assassin with no moral compunctions about theft, forgery and killing, or even a stoic mage who just wants to be kept out of the politics of the world. The ability to modify the game through Steam's workshop or Nexus makes this game infinitely more enjoyable. In mid-game play, it can be difficult to keep levelling up as a thief or a mage, due to a slight lack of balance. However, mods can help re-balance the game, as well as improve the number of craftable items, if you're like me and want to be a crafting machine. You can add more enemies, quests, even audio sounds for the wilderness or towns. You can use mods to begin the game in a different place, such as a guild hall or city, but I'm not certain I recommend this; the enemies you come up against in the long tutorial quest are specifically tailored to your beginning level, and help you gain skill levels in the skills you plan to use throughout gameplay. If you start at another point in the map, you run the risk of finding a creature that's too high of a level for you to be able to defeat, and can one-shot kill you. If you enjoy a game that's self-directed (meaning the choices come from you as a player as to how the story plays out), with dragons and werewolves and abominations (oh my!), The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is the game for you.

review: As you can tell, I really enjoy Skyrim. Skyrim is a an RPG for the regular player, as it has some RPG elements, but anyone can pick up this game. Another thing that stands out about this game is the great modding community. With thousands of mods, there's something good for everyone. TES:V is three years old, but with the amazing modding community, it's still fresh. Skyrim also has a great soundtrack by Jeremy Soule, and the four CD soundtrack is worth the price. However, there are some downsides. Skyrim crashes, quite a bit. But if you can fix it using mods or just sticking to the normal game, its fantastic. 98/100.

review: Hundreds or even thousands of hours can be invested into this awesome game. I've been playing it since it was released, and I can guarantee that this game will consume all of your time even without mods. It features so many questlines involving the return of the dragons, assassinating people, being a thief, researching a mysterious magical orb, and even join a clan of werewolves. The game leaves you open to create your own unique and creative backstory while also keeping the beginning of the game interesting. If there is anything you don't like about the game, mods can likely change it.

review: WONDERFUL ADDITION TO THE SERIES Bethesda Softworks fifth game of the Elder Scrolls series delivers dungeon diving, dragon killing, thieving, and so much more that you would normally expect from an Elder Scrolls game. Shouts that can make enemies fly back off a mountain, ores in which you can mine, several guilds to join, and countless enemies to battle are all included in this game. Although all these wonderous additions are existent in Skyrim, there are some minor setbacks. The "essential characters" as they are called in game are invincible beings that are important quest characters. They can't be killed, they are human (or elf/orc/lizard/cat), and they break the immersion that many players play the Elder Scrolls for. Also the quests are impossible to fail unless they are a misc. quest. The integration of Steam Workshop made mods accessable and easy to use which can increase/decrease immersion depending on the mod and increase replay value as well as hours your spend playing the game. Overall The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is an excellent addition to your game library and is definitely worth $30 despite its flaws.

review: Well the first time i played Skyrim was way back in 2011, about 2 weeks before my year 12 exams. But furtunatly for me i was able to show some restraint and managed to fit some time in to study. The first thing i noticed when i started playing was how far the graphics has stepped up from the 2 previous games morrowind and oblivion. After several hours of gameplay, the changes to the leveling sistem, as well as the more divers fighting styles and smoother gameplay, Skyrim started to grow on me. so i would defenatly recomentd it to other players :)

review: EXTREMELY AWESOME GAME!!!! XD All my friends definitely better get this game or you're not my friend! lol jk Graphics visuals are incredible! and you don't even need a super high-end PC to play it on. I've seen someone play it on 3-4 year-old hardware. Game can work on DX9, DX10, or DX11 rigs. Played for over 100 hours and not even near done yet. I'm waiting to continue where I am with the major storyline unitl after I'm as high I can go with all the major guilds/faction first. There are so many different ways to play, is so much to do & the game has so many places to explore. I'm just awe-struck everytime I enter the world of Skyrim. The Elder Scrolls series gets better & better with each new game release - and I've been with the series since The Elder Scrolls II: Daggerfall (around 1997-98). TES V: Skyrim = PHENOMINAL!!!!!!!!!!! Get it!!! ;)

This guy has the balls to yell at dragons while Daenerys just sits around crying about how hers refuse to listen. Who would you rather have on the iron throne? A simple girl who can't even rule a peasant city or a Dovahkiin who can tear down your blue skies with a simple whisper? GGnoRE Dovahkiin. GGnoRE.

review: If you've played Skyrim on console, you'll know how good a game it is. Well, moving across to PC just pushes it up to a whole new tier of awesomness. Two reasons - 1. Better graphics (especially with the HD textures DLC); 2. Mods, but Nexus has a better variety than Steam so work there except for exclusives. In all you should definitely get this game, even if you've already completed it on console - there's so much more to do. For mods, I'd recommend Frostfall and Skyrim Redone to revolutionise your Skyrim experience (honourable mention to Realistic Neads and Diseases if you want to make it super hardcore!) In the words of Gopher, have fun!!!

It's a bit ridiculous to master the thief guilds or mage story line as pure warrior but in the end I am happy that I am able to. With so many games to play there's simply no time (for me) to replay games like Skyrim with different characters just to see all the questlines.

review: It's getting a little long in the tooth these days, but it's still a beautiful game. Mods and graphics enhancements from the Steam Workshop only make it moreso. Even 200 hours in, I'm still finding new places and people and quests. The replay value of this game is astounding. I can't recommend it enough. Unless you want a life away from the computer, in which case you really shouldn't play this game at all.

review: Skyrim is probably the best RPG I have ever played. Ive waited for the game for at least a year for it to come out. Got it on 11-11-11, and just recently bought it on steam for my PC. The game with mods is so fun you can make the game to however you want to play it. The game on its own though is amazing. If you are a fan of RPGs buy this game now! You will not regret it. If you ever played Oblivion you know how much fun that was and skyrim's experince was 10x better. I 100% recommend this game.

review: Skyrim! It's amazing! Ok so you probably want more detail so here goes. Well at the very start I do enjoy the customization of both races as well as the appearence changes you have at your fingertips, I've at times wanted to change some features on my current dovahkiin and there is a meaning of such a character that can help you do so. Of course thought it won't be able to help you change your race. In terms of the battle system I like the free form of battle you have. Use advantages like tree cover or any form of cover you have around you to dodge archers but be ready to take a shield in one hand and a sword at the ready in the other! Of course if you want to be Rocky then you don't need no weapons and can punch till you are victorious! There is also choice of mage class. Anything from healing and curing illnesses you may have caught from being bitten by certain creatures, to firing fireballs and rain lightning upon your foes. Sometimes you fine treasures upon your travels and depending on what you go for (Mana, health, stamina) then you can carry more loot or if you have a companion then he/she will take the weight helping you to carry more weight for more shiny treasures. The details is breath taking! I would look up at the sky when northern lights come about or the planets are showing and be like, " Ohhh! Ahhhh! " But then suddenly assassin! And so my time is then consumed on fighting him to the very death of one or the other! It's story line is certainly great and with the DLC's it has widened the choice of missions much further. Now you can become a werewolf or a vampire! There are major advantages to this but as is the way in life, there are also disadvantages. But this is all explained in the game as you progress. If you haven't already grabbed a copy of this then watch a few let's plays and see for yourself what this game has to offer. It's rank in my top 3 of all time fav games ever played. 8/10 rating

review: Skyrim is an Elder Scrolls game so of course it is amazing. A brilliant immersive RPG. You can choose so many different ways to play it, like a stealthy thief character, a destructive magic wielding mage, an archer, or a brutal warrior. And because of this it has a massive replay value. There are so many quest lines available, that you probably won't finish them all in one play through. I've only got a few hours on pc, as I mainly play on xbox. The graphics on a half decent pc are a lot better than the xbox though.

review: While more focused than previous games in the series, this is still the premiere open world fantasy RPG experience - one that continues to elevate the RPG genre in the pop gaming collective consciousness. Elder Scrolls games typically promise a first-person free-roam sandbox monster of a ride, and Skyrim somberly shoulders the burden of that expectation. This time around the setting is Skyrim, a bleak, northern Nordic-inspired wilderness; albeit one with a variety of visually distinctive areas. The series is still going backwards in terms of features (spears and levitation next time, please?), skill and spell categories are again pared-down, and many mechanics have been further streamlined. Some would even say console-ized, but that is what mods are for. Skyrim does add some new wrinkles to classic TES gameplay like shouts, a specialized type of spell with its own button. This somehat mollifies the purging of spell variety and spellcrafting. Also new are kill cams, dual wielding and of course, dragons. The skills, although somewhat slimmed in term of number, gained perk lines in a evolution of Oblivion's system. Really, though, Elder Scrolls games are just a host world for all the wonderful and amazing mods that breathe new life into every new playthrough. Get it, mod it, go out and chase butterflies. By the time you've been eaten by your first angry beast, you will have been hooked.

review: I would like to preface this review with a little bit of transparancy: I am not a huge Elder Scrolls player. I tried playing Oblivion, and just could not get into the story, even though I thought the graphics were good and the gameplay had some unique elements that I really enjoyed. Then I came across Skyrim. A friend told me about this game, and I wasn't sure I was going to enjoy trying it. Oh, I was wrong. Just so wrong. Skyrim sucked me in from the moment the dragon Alduin seals his fate, freeing you from the executioner's chopping block. Exposition was delivered in a much more cinematic way, compared to previous Elder Scrolls installments, and it really made it feel as though I was playing in a fantasy epic, similar to Beowolf or The Lord of the Rings. The scenery was gorgeous - and mods can make it moreso - and the unique skill and character levelling systems are ones that I really enjoy playing with to create a unique character within the game. I also enjoy how they allow me to really create my character. Bethesda is unique in this respect. The attitude your character has to completing side quests - or the main quest - is completely up to you, the player. You're not playing someone predetermined by the game developer, you're really playing whoever you want to, whether it's a dragonslaying, vengeful Blade, a Dark Brotherhood assassin with no moral compunctions about theft, forgery and killing, or even a stoic mage who just wants to be kept out of the politics of the world. The ability to modify the game through Steam's workshop or Nexus makes this game infinitely more enjoyable. In mid-game play, it can be difficult to keep levelling up as a thief or a mage, due to a slight lack of balance. However, mods can help re-balance the game, as well as improve the number of craftable items, if you're like me and want to be a crafting machine. You can add more enemies, quests, even audio sounds for the wilderness or towns. You can use mods to begin the game in a different place, such as a guild hall or city, but I'm not certain I recommend this; the enemies you come up against in the long tutorial quest are specifically tailored to your beginning level, and help you gain skill levels in the skills you plan to use throughout gameplay. If you start at another point in the map, you run the risk of finding a creature that's too high of a level for you to be able to defeat, and can one-shot kill you. If you enjoy a game that's self-directed (meaning the choices come from you as a player as to how the story plays out), with dragons and werewolves and abominations (oh my!), The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is the game for you.

The game always has something to do and if you enjoy exploring and enjoying the world in which you are emersed and having a free scneario to do anything you please, this game always delivers, and the franchise will go down as one of my all time favorites.

review: Skyrim in general is amazing. Skyrim on PC is the best  you'll ever buy. If you've played it on console, you will feel like it is an RPG, but on PC it's a puzzle game, you barely have time to actually play because you mod and you mod your game, making it more and more awesome, then when you feel "Oh hey, now it's perfect" it'll CTD. You start looking through your mods to see which one is the troublemaker, but you can't find it. So you reinstall skyrim, install a better mod manager, install all your mods (now only with the ones you feel are necessary, but that won't last long) and you jump on, play for 30 minutes and then CRASH. Now you have an idea of which mods are the culprits, so you uninstall them. Hop back on and play for a day or so, then install more mods and rinse and repeat. 10/10 amazing simulator for dragging and dropping files.

review: I went into the game on the back of rave previews which probably overhyped it for me. I'm a social gamer and I found the Skyrim experience lonely and repetitive. It's a massive leap forward for open world RPGs for the casual console gamer but coming from a background of MMOs where the world is bigger, there are people everywhere to play with and teamwork actually exists... I was disappointed. Even as an avid lover of classic RPGs with stories that tug on the heartstrings, I found little to lose myself in with Skyrim. I'd recommend it for those that want to experience gaming as someone new to the medium, or even as a solid experience for an avid gamer. However, if you want something you'll be playing for years... try an MMO. If you want a story/experience you'll remember for the rest of your life... there are far better alternatives.

review: I was attacked by a dragon before I even reached Riverwood, before it blew fire at me it said "Ima need about tree fiddy." Now it was about this time that I realized what I thought was a dragon was an 8 story tall crustacian from the Paleozoic era. I yelled to it "I AIN'T GIVIN' YOU NO TREE FIDDY YOU DAMN MONSTER!" and it then retreated into the wilderness, never to be seen again. 11/10 would Paleozoic era again.

review: I am not good at writing game reviews but here goes! This game is absolutely amazing so much to do in it and so many places to visit, even if you finish the main quest in this game there is a lot of side quest to complete and many dungeons to search. The gameplay in this game is good very responsive and simple, the way I like it. Story in this game is very interesting and because of it being interesting you can't stop completing quest 'cause you wanna know what is going to happen next. Graphics are also really good and beatiful IMO. This game is also well optimized for pc because even I can play it on high settings without lagging and I have a average laptop. The final ratings for this game is 5/5, I just simply can't make anything bad about this game to decrease the score. If you want a good fantasy rpg experience then this game is for you!

review: Skyrim alone is a great game. It's a really fun, sandbox Action RPG with a ton of content that tells a great story.

This is different from any other game I've ever played (I don't ploay first-person games, and my husband sat with me for those first 10 hours to help me). Now I'm over 240 hours in, and I'm not done! The crafting system is addictive. All the expansions are fun!

review: Overall a good game. It's great when it comes to quantity but I keep getting the feeling they are trying to adapt the game to a younger crowd when I believe they would benefit more from making it towards a more mature crowd. There are some real immersion breaking things in the game which is what keeps me away from playing it more. Compared to the older games in the series this is worse when it comes to those things in my opinion. This obviously doesn't mean the game is bad, it's great and you will have certainly atleast 100 hours of fun with it, probably more if you take your time and find the appropriate mods to tailor the game completely after your own taste. I would not expect too much from the vanilla game however if you truly wish to immerse yourself in the universe. An example is the guards telling you to "keep you dirty hands to yourself thief" when I barely even used pickpocketing, it's just somewhat medium skilled because the character is high level. That's something which completely breaks immersion for me personally, luckily it can be fixed through mods though but it should still be mentioned in a review.

review: A lot of fun! In the world of Skyrim I've had time for all the activities you expect out of any decent game! Sometimes the game gave me headaches like when you meet a dragon halfway through a hard mission, it usually went this way: 1. Have a dragon interrupt you in the middle of an important mission 2. Get killed by said dragon multiple times 3. Kill the dragon 4. Pack your backpack with the dragons skin and bones 5. Walk increadibly slow towards nearest town because you're "Carrying to much weight" 6. Sell his skin and bones 7. Profit 8. Remember you had a mission in the former area 9. Go back 10. Meet dragon 11/10 would love to play again

review: I love this game for so many reasons. I started out with the reg version, but after seeing all it had to offer. I believed it was worth the investment to get the DLC's. You can explore for hours, do side quests, do the main story, hunt craft all sorts of items (even more can be crafted with workshop content), get trading cards, get workshop items for just about everything you could think of. and you will still find more stuff to do. I'm 100 hours in and theres still so much to explore and do. It's so worth the money. Espically the ledgendary which adds the wonderful DLC's.

review: The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is the best game I've ever played. The amount of detail and care put into making this game it's insane! I've put Close to 800 hours into it and im STILL finding new places, people, and quest. Once you finish one quest line, you just move on to the next. From killing dragons and taking their souls, to casting a Firestorm spell to wipe out huge amounts of enemys this game has it. The world is yours in this game, and they're no accidents. Be who YOU wanna be weather it be elf, beast, or man. Overall this game is amazing. There are still a few bugs present but just save often and you should be fine. If you want the RPG game of the decade, and hours of dragon slaying and shouting words of power to freeze or burn your foes, then this is it. FUS RO DAH!

review: A very expansive game, Skyrim's vast map is, if not the best, one of the best virtual world ever created. The map is full of things to do, prey to be hunted, ingredients to be collected, enemies to kill. Not to mention the random creature spawn that makes the world of Skyrim feels alive, not just scripted by the development team. When you turn that corner, there maybe some random NPC giving you quest, some guy walking along the road that can train you in your way to become a Speechcraft Master, or an old Orc warrior who seeks an honorable way to die. So much things to do, so much variety, which makes pouring hours upon hours on this amazing world feels exciting every single time. The main quest is epic, but compared to the many side quests in the world feels kinda dull. The freedom to build your own character is so liberating, particularly because of many strong arguments from many types of play. Add to that many amazing mods which has already been created, makes this a truly living game which always evolve with new content. Truly a great experience.

review: This is the game the never, ever ends. I picked this game up thinking I wouldn't like it having never played a previous TES game before. Sat in my Library untouched for about a month or two, and finally took the plunge. I was wrong. I was so very, very wrong. This is probably the best purchase I've ever made on steam. Add in the unlimited potential of modding, and it's an adventure that continues forever. I've probably restarted over a hundred times by now with a new character, and still only have beaten Alduin once. ONCE. There's still so much more do to and explore that I'm still discovering quests and areas and little hidden things. I still can't believe how much there is to do and I'm still finding more. At it stands I'll probably wake up one day having lost all touch with reality and actually start seeing the world as Skyrim with how much I've played. And I'm totally ok with that.

review: If I had to choose between this game, and my girlfriend. I'd pick this game. EDIT: I'm single now ON A MORE SERIOUS NOTE: This game is the best in its genre. In previous Bethesda games they made a sad balance in between Questing, and Exploration. Some having more quests and less places to go, and others having very few quests and more places to explore. But in Skyrim, there is no shortage of quests, and if you are like myself and just wander around aimlessly, you will stumble into places that just blow your mind. Every time I have replayed this game, I stumbled into something new. For more info i'd very much recommend mods, with mods such as texture packs, difficulty, quests, armor, and weapons, this games replay value is endless. Go through the game once with plain skyrim, then mod the hell out of it. Overall I'd rate this game an EASY 10/10. If you haven't already. Please buy it, give it a little, and I swear you will be hooked.

review: An epic game made all the more epic by the fact that it is so easy to mod and so well supported by the modding community. The Elder Scrolls series has a large following and often you will hear people argue over each new TES game comparing it to the last, but for me each TES game stands on its own merits, and Skyrim is no exception. The story is pretty good and there are plenty of side quests, but what makes Skyrim so great even when not modded is its large and open nature. This is a land you can just pick a direction and with no quest in mind and just explore. You will find danger and excitement on your journey ... and loot. Lots and lots of loot. But once you start modding this game, that is when you unlock the true value that is Skyrim. Potentially thousands more hours content (for free) in a game that can be improved ten thousand different ways from graphics, textures and sounds all the way to game mechanics and user interface changes. You can make the game exactly what you need it to be, and play it for so long you may still be playing when the next game in this series comes out.... and sometimes longer than even that. If you are interested in modding the PC version of the game, be sure to check out my guide for beginners:

review: I was stacking books on a shelf in my house in Whiterun, one of Skyrim's major cities, when I noticed a weapon rack right beside it. I set a sacrificial dagger in one slot, an Orcish mace in the other. They were on display for nobody but me and my computer-controlled housecarl, Lydia, who sat at a table patiently waiting for me to ask her to go questing. The chest upstairs was reserved for excess weapons and armor, the bedside table for smithing ingots and ores, the one next to the Alchemy table for ingredients. I'd meticulously organized my owned virtual property not because I had to, but because tending to the minutia of domestic life is a comforting break from dealing with screaming frost trolls, dragons, a civil war, and job assignments that never seem to go as planned. It's even a sensible thing to do; a seemingly natural component of every day existence in Skyrim, one of the most fully-realized, easily enjoyable, and utterly engrossing role-playing games ever made. Part of what makes it so enjoyable has to do with how legacy Elder Scrolls clutter has been condensed and in some cases eliminated. In Skyrim, there's no more moon-hopping between hilltops with a maxed out Acrobatics skill. That's gone, so is Athletics. The Elder Scrolls V pares down the amount of skills and cuts out attributes like Endurance and Intelligence altogether. There's no time wasted on the character creation screen agonizing over which skills to assign as major. You don't assign major and minor skills at all, but instead pick one of ten races, each with a specific bonus. High Elves can once a day regenerate magicka quickly, Orcs can enter a berserk rage for more effective close-range combat. These abilities are best paired with certain character builds  the High Elf regeneration is useful for a magic user  but don't represent a rigid class choice. Major decisions don't need to be made until you're already out in the world and can try out magic, sneaking and weapon combat, emphasizing first-hand experience over instruction manual study, letting you specialize only when you're ready. It contributes to the thrilling sense of freedom associated with life in Skyrim. Do a quest, kill a dragon, snatch torchbugs from the air, munch on butterfly wings or simply wander while listening to one of the best game soundtracks in recent memory. Despite the enormity of the world and the colossal amount of content contained within, little feels random and useless. Even chewing on a butterfly wing has purpose, as it reveals one of several alchemical parameters later useful in potion making at an alchemy table. Mined ore and scraps of metal from Dwemer ruins can be smelted into ingots and fashioned into armor sets, pelts lifted from slain wildlife can be turned into leather armor sets, and random books plucked from ancient ruins can trigger hidden quest lines that lead to valuable rewards. Skyrim's land mass is absolutely stuffed with content and curiosities, making every step you take, even if it's through what seems like total wilderness, an exciting one, as something unexpected often lies just over the next ridge. Many times the unexpected takes the form of a dragon. Sometimes they're purposefully placed to guard relics, sometimes they swoop over cities and attack at seemingly random times. In the middle of a fight against a camp of bandits a dragon might strike, screaming through the sky and searing foe and friendly alike with frost or flame. Momentarily all on the battlefield unite, directing arrows and magic blasts upward to knock down the creature, creating impromptu moments of camaraderie -- a surprising change from what may have been yet another by-the-numbers bandit camp sweep. Dragons show up often, their presence announced by an ominous flap of broad wings or an otherworldly scream from high above. The scale and startling detail built into each creature's appearance and animations as it circles, stops to attack, circles again and slams to the ground makes encounters thrilling, though their predictable attack patterns lessen the excitement after a few battles. In the long run they're far less irritating than the Oblivion gate equivalent from The Elder Scrolls IV, can be completed in a few minutes, and always offer a useful reward. Killing a dragon yields a soul, which powers Skyrim's new Shout system. These are magical abilities any character can use, you don't have to specialize in spell casting to slow time, throw your voice, change the weather, call in allies, blast out ice and fire, or knock back enemies with a rolling wave of pure force. Even if you favor sword, shield and heavy armor and ignore magic entirely, you'll still be able to take full advantage of these abilities provided you find the proper words  each Shout has three  hidden on Skyrim's high snowy peaks and in the depths of forgotten dungeons, serving as another reason to continue exploring long after you've exhausted the main quest story, joined with the Thieves Guild, fought alongside the Dark Brotherhood, or thrown your support behind one of the factions vying for control of Skyrim. Not only is this land under assault by dragons, long thought to be dead, it's also ripped in two by civil war. You can choose one side or the other, but so much of the allure of Skyrim is how, even outside of the confines of quest lines, the embattled state of the world is evident, and steeped in a rich fictional legacy. Lord of the Rings this is not, but with the release of every Elder Scrolls game, the fiction becomes denser, and the cross-referencing for long-time fans all the more rewarding. Skyrim's residents are all aware of current events. They'll comment on the civil war, some sympathizing with the rebels, others thinking the establishment sold its soul. The peasants complain about the Jarls who control each settlement, the Jarls complain about the rebels or foreign policy, the overprotective College librarian complains when I drop dragon scales all over his floor; many characters feel like whole, distinct personalities instead of vacuous nothings that hand out quests like a downtown greeter hands out flyers for discount jeans. Characters stereotype based on race, they double-cross at even the slightest hint it might be profitable, and they react to your evolving stature within the world. It makes a ridiculous realm, filled with computer-controlled cat people and humanoid reptiles, demon gods and dragons, feel authentic, like a world that existed long before you showed up and will continue to exist long after you leave.

review: This is one of the best games in my steam library, and I have some pretty good games. Lets get the worst out of the way first. (Theres not much) It can get a little repetitive when it comes to dungen raiding, but thats only if you never change your play style. Some of the animations are a little sketchy, but thats only compared to todays games. Now that thats out of the way, lets get to the good stuff. This game is amazing. The world is HUGE and has so many places for you to explore. Its got all of the things you need to RP if thats your style. (inns, carriges, fancy clothes, random items, ect.) It is a full on RPG with a skill tree for everything you could think of. (pickpocketing, lockpicking, archery, 2 handed, 1 handed, BEING A GOD**MN WEREWOLF, ect.) Its got so many quests that you probibly wont ever find them all without using a guide. The playtime on this game is the longest on any game I have ever played excluding MMOs. It seems the only thing this game is missing is online multiplayer. If ALL OF THAT is not enough for you, there is also a HUGE selection of mods in the steam workshop for you to add to your game and make it EVEN MORE EXTENSIVE. There is everything from Lord of the Rings weapons to Flaming horses to THOMAS THE TRAIN DRAGONS in the workshop. WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR!? BUY THIS GAME! 10/10 would write a super long review again.

review: Skyrim without mods is like water without a drinking glass. I highly recomend this game but there are few mods that should always be ran in it. Recomend you get Nexus Mod Manager and get your mods from Nexus. There are alot of mods that improve how the game looks. None of those are on my list below, so you can look for those if you have a PC that will run them all it looks like a next gen game. Here are the ones I recomend for game play. Core Mods: 1. SKSE - Extends the capability of mods created, Needed for many of the other mods 2. SkyUI - Redoes the UI so it no longer sucks on a PC. Much better. 3. The 4 Unofficial Patch Mods (Skyrim, Harthfire, Dragonborn, Dawngaurd) they fix hundreds of bug. 4. Immersive Patrols - Makes everything better as you run into patrols from all the factions as you move about. 5. Immersive Armors - Expands armors in the game 6. Immersive Weapons - Expands Weapons in the game 7. Immersive Creatrues - Adds more creature types, expands the ones that are in game and makes them stronger 8. Cloaks of Skyrim - No cloaks in the base game, can you believe it? This adds them. 9. Bellyaches New Dragon Species and Ohdaviing Replacer - Nice looking Dragons, and more varrieties 10. Deadly Dragons - Makes Dragons stronger. Configurable, make them as strong as you like. 11. VioLens - A kill move mod. If you want to adjust frequence and type of kill moves. 12. OBIS - A Bandit modification that makes bandits harder to kill and more unique. Quest Mods: 1. Helgen Reborn - Adds a quest line to rebuild Helgen 2. The Paarthurnax Dilemma - Adds options to part of the main quest, and lets you play more your way. 3. Moon & Stars - Perhaps the best additional quest line developed. 4. Dreadmyst Hollow - Very good Vampire/Horror Campaign 5. Wormstooth - Adds a small new land area and a really good campaign 6. The Shadow of Meresis - Really cool mod that has a kinda dumb ending. Still very worth playing. For a Touch of Oblivian in Skyrim add these, both great mods. 1. The Oblivion Realms Serie - The Gate of Solitude 2. The Oblivion Realms Serie - Morthal Pain Additional Follower Mods 1. Arissa - The Wandering Rogue 2. Sofia - The Funny Fully Voiced Follower (Note some comments from her are adult in nature) 3. INIGO - One of the coolest followers I have ever used. 4. Enhanced Skyrim Followers - Aela the Huntress: Not a new follower but makes Aela very cool and quest aware. Put those in and Skyrim will be twice the game (in play time) the base game was. THere are also many more good mods out there. I picked some of the ones I liked the best to list. This is a great game and a lot of fun to play again with a different selection of mods installed.

review: Skyrim has one of the best graphics of the games fron 2011 in my opinion. This game is not like the most games. You don't have to follow the mainstory, you can do other quests if you want, you can make yourself stronger. It's up to you what you do with your character. I really like that. It's refreshing. There is so much to do in this game, many choices. You can become the great hero, a very skilled thief, an assassin, you can become the greatest warrior and you can even marry someone. I would recommend this, just because of the nice landscape and the stories.
game-hours: 200.1
review: One of the best games i've ever played! You can put so many hours into this game without knowing. I recomend just starting off with no DLC or mods until you feel you know enough about the game (not story wise, but gameplay wise, because some mods can affect it). As for DLC, i would get Dawnguard and work through that, then get Dragonborn because Dragonborn can mess things up a little (i may have killed all of Riverwood because of some damn cultists). It doesn't really matter WHEN you get Hearthfire, but get it as it adds the nice touch of adopting some kids and making a hom for you and your family. Enjoy :D (i know you will)

review: The game is just ok. This game has so many bugs in it it's ridiculous. This is the only game i know of where if I am looking at its wikipedia site, i specifically go to the bug section to see if what happened or what I want to do is a bug or not. I told myself I'd beat this game when i started(not just the main questline but all quests) and I'm close enough to completion (non dlc) that I'm done. I felt that i was bored throughout the whole 100+ hours it took me to complete it. I would tell myself "Just keep going and get it over with so i can move onto the next game" I tried mods but it didn't make it any better(except for skyui)

review: As most people already know, this game is amazing. The vast amount of content is unbelievable. I have put in over 100 hours, and feel like I am only half way through. As much as I like this game, I want to point the issues that I have faced. - This game is not optimized for quad core processors. My rig can run most new games on max settings at a smooth framerate. Skyrim pushes my system to its limits. Even at medium settings, I experience hiccups and frame drops. - There is a large amount of loading in this game. Whenever you fast travel or enter/exit a city, you must endure a lengthy load screen. Although the screens are pretty, it gets annoying. I do not have a SSD, if you do, this may not be as much of an issue. Despite these two annoyances, I HIGHLY recommend this game. This game is a steal at $20 and if you get it on sale, you should be put in cuffs.

If you are someone like me who suffers from alt-itis and remakes character after character to try new things, this game offers a myriad amount of ways to play. The abilit to mod the game only adds to its replay value and the Steam Workshop makes it very easy for people who have never modded a game before. Skyrim will always be an interesting place to visit.

review: The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is a magnificant video game which really is different to most games that have been made, if not that then all games. The game takes you back to old Norse Scandinavia through to Celtic England. Playing through this game shall make you witness an accurate life of a Nordic Viking or a Redheaded Celt. The main questline is resolved around ancient Dragons that roam Skyrim and learning that you are not just an ordinary creature in this world but a Dragonborn. However, that is not even a quarter of the game. The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim also features ability for many mods and plugins for the PC users. Now for the nature. The game provides a large mixture of weathers that are all different and can be rare to come across in real life. From the usual clear skies to the Devil's thunder and lightning, then to the Northern light's of Scandinavia then fades away as the godlike sunlight shines on all life in the game. Not only is the Northern Light's feature spectacular but even the stars show at night and you can sometimes see other planets, the developers have put alot of thought into making this game unique and a truely unforgettable RPG experience. You cannot go wrong with the Skyrim soundtrack! the overall OST lasts about 4 hours. The music really does make you feel like you are actually in the game and that you were once a real Celtic Viking that spoke a Dragon language. Now what are the downfalls of this game? simple, NONE! Skyrim is not for the typical mainstream gamer that plays what everyone else is up to! If you like adventure, a game that can truely make your soul feel a thousand years old and experience fantastic music and landscape, then Skyrim is your dream come true. I have never felt so alive before, this game really did unleash my inner Viking. You can forget 10/10, Skyrim deserves infinity/infinity!

review: Out of all the Elder Scroll games in the series, I highly recommend this one. Ranging from the high snow-capped, blizzard raging mountain tops, to the lowest boundries of Skyrim that feel like your on Hell's doorstep, this game has it all. Monsters and Mythical creatures dwell in this land, along with many fun but dangerous quests that lead you to be one of Skyrim's greatest, the Dragonborn. When your feeling a bit lonely with all your amazing treasures and vast amounts of money, you can start your own family. Become really close friends with someone, and see if they'll marry you. With your new soul mate till the end, you can start thinking about where to live. With the HearthFire DLC (Downloadable Content), you can build your own house, or if you want to save the time and resources, buy a house in a City and raise your own children. Your travels then take you to the Island of Solstheim in the DragonBorn DLC, where you face off the world's most feared menace, the first Dragonborn. Learn new shout's, along with making new allies while in effort to thwart the corrupted Dovahkiin's evil plans, while befriending dragons yourself. After you return home to your family, you then hear more and more about vampire attacks around Skyrim in the new DawnGuard DLC. You seek out on what you can do to stop it, and learn about the DawnGuard, an ancient organiziation that was known for keeping malicious vampires at bay. With the DawnGuard DLC, you can either choose to be a good Samaratin and stop the evil plans of the dreaded vampire, or you can join the ancient order Volkihar to become a Vampire Lord. The choice is up to you. In the end, you have to face your greatest enemy yet, the World Eater, Alduin the dragon. Skyrim overall is a game mostly abaout dragons, you are too part dragon. I recommend The Elder Scrolls: V - Skyrim, to anyone who likes fun RPG's, that has a unique and intracit plot and storyline. I give this game a 10 out of 10 rating. I have been playing it since it first came out, and i'm still enjoying it to this day. Please consider getting this for your Xbox 360, PlayStation 3 or Pc. Try it, and see what adventures YOU'LL discover.

review: Shout at dragons. Play without mods for a fantastic casual RPG, with a large open world and many things to do. TES: V/10 Play with mods for the best possible gaming experience you can currently achieve on a PC. /10 There are no limits to how much you can modify the game. The only restrictions are your own technical skill levels, and hardware performance. Anything you want to do, you can do. Most mods you'd want already exist somewhere but if for some reason one doesn't then you can easily make it yourself. The Creation Kit is easy to use and writing custom scripts (to use with a script extender) is not much harder. Really this game is only as good as it is because of its modability and modding community. Without the mods I wouldn't even recommend this game to anyone.

review: The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is critically acclaimed, and for good reason; it's a very solid open-world RPG, but is notably simpler and more 'casual' than its predecessor, Oblivion (which in turn was more 'casual' than Morrowind). However, while Skyrim is a good game on it's own, installing mods is a MUST, and with a collection as large as the Steam Workshop, the game can be modified to look as good as next-gen (as long as your computer can handle it), and the mechanics can be vastly improved or even overhauled. TL;DR: Skyrim is good, but Skyrim with mods is amazing. Play this game if you enjoy fantasy RPG's with large and detailed worlds.

review: Pros: Story/guild branches, magic system, open world, quest variety, graphics Cons: Bugs (CTD, graphical glitches), limited spell selection This is, in short, the best RPG I've played. For those unaccustomed to Elder Scrolls games: huge world, lots of character options & skills, epic story, great graphics, awesome community mods. Skyrim is a continuation of this trend, but better than Morrowind [and Oblivion]. For those who love Morrowind as much as I do: Skyrim is a bit better, it really is. AI is better, magic is INFINITELY more awesome, companions!, dragon fights, voice acting, etc. I expect great things when the Construction Kit is released. -- My roommate's also a huge Morrowind fan, and he loves this. We have radically different playstyles, and the great thing about Skyrim: they both work. We've each spent ~70 hours in-game so far. (Sorry, Daggerfall crashed too much back in ye olden times for me to play it substantially) This is the best game I've ever played.

review: I highly recommend this game for anyone who likes RPGs with action, magic and ING DRAGONS. The content is almost endless. (I've played almost 200 hours and I haven't finished everything.) The dlcs are really fun aswell. Although they are a powercreep, they still add a lot to the game. Lots of new areas, items, monsters. But most importantly you can ride dragons. :D

review: This game is always exiting, beautiful, challenging and all around amazing. I beleive that Skyrim has set a new standard for all RPGs, even though it is over two years old now. And with the massive community of modders, it will only continue to thrive. Skyrim is without a doubt one of the best games I've ever played. 2/10 Would not bang.

review: Pretty well known game, latest entry in the Elder Scrolls. Lots of bugs have been patched up and some new features added, which makes it fun. Gameplay is good, but the graphics are lackluster given the time period it was released in. By itself, a good game. With the DLC, a better game. With mods, an absolutely great game.

review: The Next chapter in the sprawling Elder Scrolls series, for this we head to the land of the Nords a cold and unforgiving place, you start as a prisoner your destiny sealed, only for fate to intervene Much like every other game in the series, you have literally hours of gameplay ahead of you, plus the controls and combat system have been refined to feel more fluid, want to be a pure warrior smiting things with a hammer sure, fancy combining elements of magic and archery go for it While the main quest is fun, when the game really shines is in the amount of other stuff you can do, this is a completionists nightmare, there's so many side quests and mini games you could spend more than 40 hours trying to finish all those and still only be a quarter of the way through So install, enjoy and let bethesda take you on a sprawling journey of swords and sorcery, will you be a hero or a villian or maybe a little of both, the choice is entirely yours.

review: This is one of the buggiest, most broken, most unfinished-feeling games I have seen in a long time. It would take a very special game to make me look past all the (really glaring) issues and still have fun, and Skyrim is one of those games. It captures the feeling of adventure, of exploration, of excitement over the smallest things, more than most any games I've ever played. Wouldnt call it a masterpiece, but its most definitely worth your time and money. (plus the game is extremely moddable, so you're getting a potentially limitless amount of playthroughs without it feeling stale, not even mentioning the entirely new games people have made with the engine. Bumps up the value quite considerably, in my opinion.)

review: This game is soooooo coool,that it will keep you occupied n the first 100-200 hrs,but doing this without boring ya.This game is...awesome....just like....a.......GTA V MEDIEVAL EDITION!!!TYou can marry,have a child,be semi-naked,be over-armored,kill unknown people,corrupt guards,change the Jarls,take part of the civil war,make quests(I love this game cuz you get money if you make quests,not experience.This is cool because,let-s say that you are blocked on a mission.And what do you do to level up?Go kill some chickens!)You can also know the date and the hour.It rains,snows,you can see more aurora-borealis,maybe the sun even make you blind(for some secs).You can be the normal man,the civilian,who does have a house,a family and a job.You can be the dragon-slayer that searches for beasts of the wild with his arrows and his axe.You can be the madman that kills everyone in his path,whenever it is good or bad. You can be the warrior with you armory and followers.Or,maybe you like the mage.Some magic will harm anyone.Or,if you do not like to be violent,you can just steal.

review: Abandon all hope ye who enter. While this may appear to be a simple game about killing dragons, it is actually the programming embodiment of Cthulhu... It will ensnare you with the tentacles of exploration and crafting, and pull you in deeper and deeper to the detriment of your life. Soon you will be spending thousands of dollars on new computer equipment in an attempt to have more realistic water. This is due to the dark horrifying truth... Once you start, this becomes your life, and everything else is merely a gut-wrenching distration designed to keep you away from the real world. If you have any hope of living a real life, getting married, having kids, etc; for the love of all that is good, turn back now, and leave this door shut...

Mods are out standing and plentiful. when world of warcraft server was down i could always fall back on skyrim, no log in required, no password no internet just launch and continue where you left off....no cloud to deal with, no strain on system resources, no third party app to deal with. prior elder scroll games are the same....just do it if you love hack and slash, magic and dragons in your face first person or third person style....your choice.

review: Skyrim is a good RPG, but not a great one. I have been an avid fan of the Elder Scrolls series since Morrowind back when I was a wee lad playing that lovely dirt-colored game on my brother's original Xbox back in 2003-2005. Anyways, I was expecting this game to be a more refined version of Oblivion, which has a special place in this Cuban's heart, but Skyrim was different. It felt targeted for a broader audience, not one the typical Bethsesda RPG fan like me and many others. Forgive the word, but Skyrim is the epitome of a casual RPG. If my brother, the same brother who bought Morrowind for me and my other brother back in 2003 but hated it, can sink hours into this game like it was Call of Duty, then it definitely is a casual RPG. Does that make it bad? God no! Skyrim is an extremely pretty game that I would love to indulge myself in if I had more time to. I just feel like if anyone can pick, swing a sword, and kill  in an RPG, it is casual. Try doing that in Oblivion against some tougher creatures and your  will become mudcrab food along the shores of that bloom covered and colorful land.

review: Ok, I have played this game through multiple times, and I have played more hours than Steam shows because at first I was only playing it on the Xbox 360. Then I realized how much better the PC version of the game was! So since that realization I have been exploring the land of Skyrim on PC only. Now, on the PC you get access to extras like high resolution textures and many many mods. Modding makes the game almost endless. So if you want a great looking game that is also a great playing game then I recommend Skyrim. There is so much to do & different ways to do it each time, and its one of the games I return to when I get bored with the other 120+ games on my account.

review: This is the game the never, ever ends. I picked this game up thinking I wouldn't like it having never played a previous TES game before. Sat in my Library untouched for about a month or two, and finally took the plunge. I was wrong. I was so very, very wrong. This is probably the best purchase I've ever made on steam. Add in the unlimited potential of modding, and it's an adventure that continues forever. I've probably restarted over a hundred times by now with a new character, and still only have beaten Alduin once. ONCE. There's still so much more do to and explore that I'm still discovering quests and areas and little hidden things. I still can't believe how much there is to do and I'm still finding more. At it stands I'll probably wake up one day having lost all touch with reality and actually start seeing the world as Skyrim with how much I've played. And I'm totally ok with that.

review: If I had to choose between this game, and my girlfriend. I'd pick this game. EDIT: I'm single now ON A MORE SERIOUS NOTE: This game is the best in its genre. In previous Bethesda games they made a sad balance in between Questing, and Exploration. Some having more quests and less places to go, and others having very few quests and more places to explore. But in Skyrim, there is no shortage of quests, and if you are like myself and just wander around aimlessly, you will stumble into places that just blow your mind. Every time I have replayed this game, I stumbled into something new. For more info i'd very much recommend mods, with mods such as texture packs, difficulty, quests, armor, and weapons, this games replay value is endless. Go through the game once with plain skyrim, then mod the hell out of it. Overall I'd rate this game an EASY 10/10. If you haven't already. Please buy it, give it a little, and I swear you will be hooked.

review: An epic game made all the more epic by the fact that it is so easy to mod and so well supported by the modding community. The Elder Scrolls series has a large following and often you will hear people argue over each new TES game comparing it to the last, but for me each TES game stands on its own merits, and Skyrim is no exception. The story is pretty good and there are plenty of side quests, but what makes Skyrim so great even when not modded is its large and open nature. This is a land you can just pick a direction and with no quest in mind and just explore. You will find danger and excitement on your journey ... and loot. Lots and lots of loot. But once you start modding this game, that is when you unlock the true value that is Skyrim. Potentially thousands more hours content (for free) in a game that can be improved ten thousand different ways from graphics, textures and sounds all the way to game mechanics and user interface changes. You can make the game exactly what you need it to be, and play it for so long you may still be playing when the next game in this series comes out.... and sometimes longer than even that. If you are interested in modding the PC version of the game, be sure to check out my guide for beginners:

review: I was stacking books on a shelf in my house in Whiterun, one of Skyrim's major cities, when I noticed a weapon rack right beside it. I set a sacrificial dagger in one slot, an Orcish mace in the other. They were on display for nobody but me and my computer-controlled housecarl, Lydia, who sat at a table patiently waiting for me to ask her to go questing. The chest upstairs was reserved for excess weapons and armor, the bedside table for smithing ingots and ores, the one next to the Alchemy table for ingredients. I'd meticulously organized my owned virtual property not because I had to, but because tending to the minutia of domestic life is a comforting break from dealing with screaming frost trolls, dragons, a civil war, and job assignments that never seem to go as planned. It's even a sensible thing to do; a seemingly natural component of every day existence in Skyrim, one of the most fully-realized, easily enjoyable, and utterly engrossing role-playing games ever made. Part of what makes it so enjoyable has to do with how legacy Elder Scrolls clutter has been condensed and in some cases eliminated. In Skyrim, there's no more moon-hopping between hilltops with a maxed out Acrobatics skill. That's gone, so is Athletics. The Elder Scrolls V pares down the amount of skills and cuts out attributes like Endurance and Intelligence altogether. There's no time wasted on the character creation screen agonizing over which skills to assign as major. You don't assign major and minor skills at all, but instead pick one of ten races, each with a specific bonus. High Elves can once a day regenerate magicka quickly, Orcs can enter a berserk rage for more effective close-range combat. These abilities are best paired with certain character builds  the High Elf regeneration is useful for a magic user  but don't represent a rigid class choice. Major decisions don't need to be made until you're already out in the world and can try out magic, sneaking and weapon combat, emphasizing first-hand experience over instruction manual study, letting you specialize only when you're ready. It contributes to the thrilling sense of freedom associated with life in Skyrim. Do a quest, kill a dragon, snatch torchbugs from the air, munch on butterfly wings or simply wander while listening to one of the best game soundtracks in recent memory. Despite the enormity of the world and the colossal amount of content contained within, little feels random and useless. Even chewing on a butterfly wing has purpose, as it reveals one of several alchemical parameters later useful in potion making at an alchemy table. Mined ore and scraps of metal from Dwemer ruins can be smelted into ingots and fashioned into armor sets, pelts lifted from slain wildlife can be turned into leather armor sets, and random books plucked from ancient ruins can trigger hidden quest lines that lead to valuable rewards. Skyrim's land mass is absolutely stuffed with content and curiosities, making every step you take, even if it's through what seems like total wilderness, an exciting one, as something unexpected often lies just over the next ridge. Many times the unexpected takes the form of a dragon. Sometimes they're purposefully placed to guard relics, sometimes they swoop over cities and attack at seemingly random times. In the middle of a fight against a camp of bandits a dragon might strike, screaming through the sky and searing foe and friendly alike with frost or flame. Momentarily all on the battlefield unite, directing arrows and magic blasts upward to knock down the creature, creating impromptu moments of camaraderie -- a surprising change from what may have been yet another by-the-numbers bandit camp sweep. Dragons show up often, their presence announced by an ominous flap of broad wings or an otherworldly scream from high above. The scale and startling detail built into each creature's appearance and animations as it circles, stops to attack, circles again and slams to the ground makes encounters thrilling, though their predictable attack patterns lessen the excitement after a few battles. In the long run they're far less irritating than the Oblivion gate equivalent from The Elder Scrolls IV, can be completed in a few minutes, and always offer a useful reward. Killing a dragon yields a soul, which powers Skyrim's new Shout system. These are magical abilities any character can use, you don't have to specialize in spell casting to slow time, throw your voice, change the weather, call in allies, blast out ice and fire, or knock back enemies with a rolling wave of pure force. Even if you favor sword, shield and heavy armor and ignore magic entirely, you'll still be able to take full advantage of these abilities provided you find the proper words  each Shout has three  hidden on Skyrim's high snowy peaks and in the depths of forgotten dungeons, serving as another reason to continue exploring long after you've exhausted the main quest story, joined with the Thieves Guild, fought alongside the Dark Brotherhood, or thrown your support behind one of the factions vying for control of Skyrim. Not only is this land under assault by dragons, long thought to be dead, it's also ripped in two by civil war. You can choose one side or the other, but so much of the allure of Skyrim is how, even outside of the confines of quest lines, the embattled state of the world is evident, and steeped in a rich fictional legacy. Lord of the Rings this is not, but with the release of every Elder Scrolls game, the fiction becomes denser, and the cross-referencing for long-time fans all the more rewarding. Skyrim's residents are all aware of current events. They'll comment on the civil war, some sympathizing with the rebels, others thinking the establishment sold its soul. The peasants complain about the Jarls who control each settlement, the Jarls complain about the rebels or foreign policy, the overprotective College librarian complains when I drop dragon scales all over his floor; many characters feel like whole, distinct personalities instead of vacuous nothings that hand out quests like a downtown greeter hands out flyers for discount jeans. Characters stereotype based on race, they double-cross at even the slightest hint it might be profitable, and they react to your evolving stature within the world. It makes a ridiculous realm, filled with computer-controlled cat people and humanoid reptiles, demon gods and dragons, feel authentic, like a world that existed long before you showed up and will continue to exist long after you leave.

review: The legend that is Elder Scrolls V. It would be impossible to fit in all the amazing things Skyrim has to offer, even to list the basic features and mechanics of the game would create a review lasting pages and pages. The game has an amazing story that is revealed to you depending how much you put in. You start the game, sandbox style you can follow the suggested story or head off and do your own thing, filling your knowledge with the history of the world, races and characters the story becomes more and more clear to you. Dangerously immersive, hundreds of hours worth of gameplay, perhaps easily the game of the decade, century even. Only bad point, why didn't they hire more voice actors?

review: This game is TRULY great. 1. Free Roam RPG: Not much video games are like this, especially with the WONDERFUL graphics Skyrim has to offer 2. Creation Kit: A tool that comes with Skyrim. SUCH AS... If you were getting tired of the game and you are ABSOLUTELY Over Powered, you can create your own NPCs, Dungeons, and Items and customize them. Once you are done, you can upload them to the Steam Workshop to show other people your newest creation / mod. 3. Choices: You can have an AMAZING amount of choices in Skyrim. You can become a mage, warrior, theif etc... and with that, you can apply your skills in-game and play IN the game 4. Add-ons (DLC) Hearthfire: You can get married, ADOPT children and Freaking MAKE YOUR OWN HOUSE! Dawnguard: You can become a vampire, learn about Skyrim's history and uncover amazing ancient artifacts Dragonborn: You can learn more about Ancient Nords, the Dragons and Dragonborn in this game. Dawnguard lets you travel to different places that were unaccessable before installing the content. (Same with Dragonborn DLC) 5. Abilities: In Skyrim you can cast magic (Destruction spells, Conjuration Spells - my favorite- and more), have recreational skills (Speech, Smithing, etc...) or Fighting Skills (Archery, One-handed weapons, Two-handed weapons etc...) This game is truly REMARKABLE. You should really consider buying it.

review: Bought this game years after its release yet this is already a classic that will survive time, with a neverending set of mods to improve quality at this pace this game may have decent modern graphics for a the next decade. For the price steam sales have been making this huge game is a steal. This game will keep you hooked for days, weeks, months exploring the gorgeous landscapes of the huge world full of little secrets here and there. The only negative point is that you may not have time for your own life, seriously play it during some holidays or something because this game may absorb you.

review: Incredible game, astonishing immersion and epic storyline. I played this for more than two years and I got to say I still feel like I could do more. If you get bored, there is a ton of mods, which are, in my opinion, the best part of the game. I used to think mods are useless and bad for the game until I tried in this one.

review: Overall: The Elder Scrolls: Skyrim is an action RPG by Bethesda Game Studios and was published by Bethesda Softworks, it is the fifth instalment in the Elder Scroll series. Noteable: You cannot choose a class in Skyrim, it allows for a more diverse gameplay, this game is about freedom of choice. Visual: The game looks very good but like any open world game it cannot compete with most other high- visual fidelity games. The point however where TES:Skyrim exceeds is the way the world feels. Skyrim feels and is massive and I can guarantee that your first hours in-game will feel extra awesome due to the impressive mountains and vast plains. Combat: The combat is a big part of the game and it too feels quite good. The hit-boxes have been improved and you can feel a little bit more impact when you hit someone in the face with the mace of Molag-Bal. The use of magic had me personaly impressed when I played it for the first time but it is outdated compared to some newer titles like TES:O. Sadly compared to the rest of the game the combat seems average, like in the previous titles it looks like you are hitting the air most of the time, it has become better and the finishers help too but nevertheless it's still not perfect. Sound: The sound design is great, beside the plainly awesome music, the timing for it is well put too. Voice acting also sounds fitting most of time. The combat sounds aren't as great as the rest but not bad either. Story: The main story and quests lack some variety at some points but they are nothing you'd get bored of quickly. The game is set in a world that feels alive and the quests reflect that. Options: There is a fairly good selection of options for Skyrim as it is expected from a PC game. Everything that you can't do is probably possible through using the (PC exclusive)console or (the also PC exclusive)mods. Conclusion: Better looking, better sounding and more accesible, I consider The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim to be the best RPG known to me despite some problems. NOTE: No, I haven't played Morrowind.

review: Skyrim is a very great game. To start off it has a great story. Your a prisoner thats going to get executed. You were captured by Imperials. The Imperials are in a giant war with the Stormcloacks because the Stormcloacks claim that Skyrim is their home. Anyways back to being a prisoner, you're about to be executed but., then a dragon appears giving you time to escape and to realize that dragons are coming back. Not only that but, you also find out that you are dragonborn. Someone who can absorb dragon souls and stop the dragons for good. Gameplay is very addicting. You have skill levels that increase the more you use them. Each skill level helps with a certain type of warrior. Assassins benefit from alchemy and sneak. Knights and barbarians benefit from heavy armor and 2 or 1 handed. Mages benefit from enchanting or destruction magic. This helps you maintain the character that you want to make giving you a lot of choices. This game is filled to the brim with quests whether they be mundane or very important. There are plenty of guilds to choose from that help you build the type of character you want. AI in this game can be stupid sometimes, especially the followers. There are also a lot of NPC's that use the same voice actor but, overall skyrim deserves a 10/10 Get it, Duct tape your  to your chair and play it.

review: Unless you've never played a game before, you'd probably heard that Skyrim is a great game and one of the best there is. People have been playing this ish since 2011 and this game is still going stronger than some AAA games released in 2014. Get it. PS: The people I've seen unimpressed by Skyrim seem to have gotten the idea that it's the GTA verson of the middle ages, honestly that's more related to the open world aspect and not the fast-paced fighting. Skyrim is more skewed towards exploration and adventure than combat. That being said, combat is still p sweet as far as I'm concerned.

review: Best game I've played in the past 7 years. Better than Oblivion and probably the best elder scrolls game made to date. They hit this one out of the park. Its quite possibly one of the top 5 games I have ever played in the past 30 years of gaming and I am hard to please. In a world where games are more hype than substance, this is one of the rare titles that not only lives up to the hype but most likely exceeded it. If you only buy one game from now untill you die.....make it this one. They need to stop making elder scrolls games because they won't top this one.

review: Skyrim has been around for quite a while now, but in any case it is just as fun as the day it was released. I originally played hundreds of hours of Skyrim for xbox, but when I got into pc gaming I knew Skyrim was a title worth buying again just for the mods. 11/10 just based on the amazing mods out there.
game-hours: 29.7
review: This might possibly be one of the greatest RPG's of all time. I would buy this in a heartbeat and I'm sure some of you agree. This game will always be remembered. The modding community has kept this game alive and still going strong for nearly five years. If you want an open world RPG that's immersive, has an amazing soundtrack, and want to be lost in the large amounts of lore this series has to offer, get it. It's the game for you. You can also expand your experience with the DLC's. Unlike its console ports, TESV features an unprecidented amount of mods that can add hours and hours to the total play time. I took a moment on plenty of occassions to take in the views from Throat of the World. It's on of the only games that has a truly beatiful (and mod-able) skybox, with stars and moons giving light at night, along with nice shadows cast in the trees down in Falkreath. I also killed Braith, hiding her body on a building ("hiding") 10/10- "Like Far Cry 3 with bows -IGN

I LOVE THIS GAME!! I believe that this is one of the greatest games that I have ever played. I Didn't expect to play as much as I have. In a flash I had reached 100 Hours of play time.

We bought 2 copies, only to find out that even on the lowest quality setting, the movement was jerky and horrible, making combat nearly impossible. Just a warning... it seems like you're computer has to be a lot better than the listed requirements. The game itself, though... AMAZING! Even with all the glitches, I've put more than 500 hours into it.

This game does a great job at immersing you into this world and keeping you there. It has dragons, werewolves, magic, vampires, otherworld gods, dark elves, mystery, "robots", tragedy, humor, awesome loot, and epicness. What you experience is based on how far you want to venture into this world and on top of all that, you have the steam workshop to add even more.

I was actually sad when I had nothing but the main quest left and couldn't be bothered finishing it there. But that was still 80 hours running around, reading books, meeting people, getting involved in weird little quests. Just, bleh on the main story. But who really just does the main story in these?

I love how I can literally go ANYWHERE and even after playing this game for about a year, I'm still learning new things.

Though I just really wish I can kill Braith, the little brat in Whiterun, with my bare hoofs.

review: 300+ hours of playtime later I can certainly say that Skyrim has quite a bit of content... It's a vast expansive and ridiculously pretty completely open world filled with monsters, ruins, interesting stories and just so much STUFF to fight, explore and loot. Plus if you ever run out f stuff to do, there's the workshop with a near-infinite supply of very decent user created content. For me it'll always be something I'll return to every once in a while. I'd guess the only downsides to this game are the fact that the main questlines (as opposed to say, Oblivion) are somewhat on the short side and that the population of Skyrim is a bit scarce (you'd really expect to run into just a few more people in the capitals), also watch out for the random vampire attacks with Dawnguard that will decimate your population if you're a bit unlucky (mods can fix that though).

And when I feel lonely, I return to reality and go drink some coffee with my friends. Skyrim is filled with great stories, odd creatures and wonderful places which makes us want to explore it's world even more. As we're allowed to make choices within the game, we feel we're holding our own destiny and we're compelled to write our own dragonborn story. If you haven't tried it out yet, go for it and get lost in it's awesomeness.

From SkyRE to change the combat up, ENB and other visual mods (Static Mesh Improvement Mod is the most notable for me, along with water and flora mods), Falskaar to add new lands... This game just keeps on giving and giving. Twice have I bought the Legendary Edition on sale. Just because it was on sale and GabeN pls. It makes a nice gift, except that the game's so awesome that everyone has it. I highly recommend this to anyone who has not got it.

review: Amazing game, best RPG I've played in a long time. Unfortunately Bethesda don't seem to be able to make a game without it including loads of bugs which really lets this game down. The game is perfectly playable, I've finished it a couple of times and when you're bored of the game you can install mods which is a big plus :)

review: This is not so much a recommendation for the game ... that speaks for itself ... no ... this a a recommendation for the community that supports it. I'm an older gamer with very little computer knowledge so the idea of modding scared me. The Skyrim community patiently guided me through the process as slowly my product knowledge increased and were always there to answer my damnfool questions. And because of them I now have a wonderfully modded game which I understand (mostly) how it all works. And so to this community .... a great big thumbs up .... and many thanks

review: Huge open world RPG, lots of quests to do and many places to explore. Some of the quests I find boring, and the game also has an in game feature (especially on console) called a bug. If you go to the wiki and look at the bugs; you will most likely encounter every single one. I felt that the storyline to the game lacked, but its still a good game. If you don't like the story, just don't do it.

review: Definitely not the best TES game. Not by a longshot. Still, it's decent. I could sit here and write a scathing review of what I think Bethesda did wrong, but nobody really cares about that. If you're new to The Elder Scrolls or RPGs in general, you're probably going to enjoy this game. It's a big, open world with lots of things to do that really won't punish you for your actions. Sure, some of the choices you make are going to have an impact on the game world and all that, but nothing overly major. The leveling system is revamped and actually makes sense in a lot of ways, even if the developers didn't use it to its full potential. The combat is enjoyable and your enemies are always around the same level as your character, so things shouldn't get to difficult for you. If you're an older fan of the series, you're definitely going to need to get a few mods to get this game in a playable state. Or a lot of mods. Probably a lot. I heartily recommend Requiem to start off with. You're pretty much going to find a way to enjoy this game one way or another. There's a ton of mods out there for it, so you can potentially turn Skyrim into whatever you want it to be (or what it should've been... unfortunately there's not much that can be done for Bethesda's uncharacteristically ****** quest writing) if you know what you're doing and you take your time. And by "take your time," I mean don't be an idiot and go and find a bunch of mods and install them without reading the description/Readme (they are called that for a reason, you know). So um, yeah, after all of that rambling, I recommend this game.

This game is built for any play style so if you wanna sneak around and assassinate people or go two handed weapon badass, or just be a spell caster, the choice is yours! I recommend this game with all my heart and you will not regret buying it!

review: Il V capitolo della saga The Elder Scrolls non si fa davvero mancare niente. Trama avvincente, quest secondarie molto divertenti ma soprattutto il fatto di non essere vincolati ad una classe particolare, permette a qualunque giocatore di vivere un'esperienza unica ad ogni partita. I paesaggi inoltre sono molto curati e gli ecosistemi funzionanti sono una vera chicca. Bethesda purtroppo ci ha sempre abituato a bug di ogni sorta, ma con questo titolo  sempre in costante aggiornamento per fixare tutti i minimi problemi che possono presentarsi. Miglior gioco di quest'anno senza dubbio.

review: What can I say? The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is one of the best (and most addictive) games I have ever played. Even years after it's release many people still play this masterpiece. The community has also added hundreds more hours worth of play time through the mods found on the steam workshop and the nexus. Definately worth your time (although be careful you don't play it too much...) I would rate it 10/10 for sure.

review: This is the game the never, ever ends. I picked this game up thinking I wouldn't like it having never played a previous TES game before. Sat in my Library untouched for about a month or two, and finally took the plunge. I was wrong. I was so very, very wrong. This is probably the best purchase I've ever made on steam. Add in the unlimited potential of modding, and it's an adventure that continues forever. I've probably restarted over a hundred times by now with a new character, and still only have beaten Alduin once. ONCE. There's still so much more do to and explore that I'm still discovering quests and areas and little hidden things. I still can't believe how much there is to do and I'm still finding more. At it stands I'll probably wake up one day having lost all touch with reality and actually start seeing the world as Skyrim with how much I've played. And I'm totally ok with that.

review: If I had to choose between this game, and my girlfriend. I'd pick this game. EDIT: I'm single now ON A MORE SERIOUS NOTE: This game is the best in its genre. In previous Bethesda games they made a sad balance in between Questing, and Exploration. Some having more quests and less places to go, and others having very few quests and more places to explore. But in Skyrim, there is no shortage of quests, and if you are like myself and just wander around aimlessly, you will stumble into places that just blow your mind. Every time I have replayed this game, I stumbled into something new. For more info i'd very much recommend mods, with mods such as texture packs, difficulty, quests, armor, and weapons, this games replay value is endless. Go through the game once with plain skyrim, then mod the hell out of it. Overall I'd rate this game an EASY 10/10. If you haven't already. Please buy it, give it a little, and I swear you will be hooked.

review: An epic game made all the more epic by the fact that it is so easy to mod and so well supported by the modding community. The Elder Scrolls series has a large following and often you will hear people argue over each new TES game comparing it to the last, but for me each TES game stands on its own merits, and Skyrim is no exception. The story is pretty good and there are plenty of side quests, but what makes Skyrim so great even when not modded is its large and open nature. This is a land you can just pick a direction and with no quest in mind and just explore. You will find danger and excitement on your journey ... and loot. Lots and lots of loot. But once you start modding this game, that is when you unlock the true value that is Skyrim. Potentially thousands more hours content (for free) in a game that can be improved ten thousand different ways from graphics, textures and sounds all the way to game mechanics and user interface changes. You can make the game exactly what you need it to be, and play it for so long you may still be playing when the next game in this series comes out.... and sometimes longer than even that. If you are interested in modding the PC version of the game, be sure to check out my guide for beginners:

review: I was stacking books on a shelf in my house in Whiterun, one of Skyrim's major cities, when I noticed a weapon rack right beside it. I set a sacrificial dagger in one slot, an Orcish mace in the other. They were on display for nobody but me and my computer-controlled housecarl, Lydia, who sat at a table patiently waiting for me to ask her to go questing. The chest upstairs was reserved for excess weapons and armor, the bedside table for smithing ingots and ores, the one next to the Alchemy table for ingredients. I'd meticulously organized my owned virtual property not because I had to, but because tending to the minutia of domestic life is a comforting break from dealing with screaming frost trolls, dragons, a civil war, and job assignments that never seem to go as planned. It's even a sensible thing to do; a seemingly natural component of every day existence in Skyrim, one of the most fully-realized, easily enjoyable, and utterly engrossing role-playing games ever made. Part of what makes it so enjoyable has to do with how legacy Elder Scrolls clutter has been condensed and in some cases eliminated. In Skyrim, there's no more moon-hopping between hilltops with a maxed out Acrobatics skill. That's gone, so is Athletics. The Elder Scrolls V pares down the amount of skills and cuts out attributes like Endurance and Intelligence altogether. There's no time wasted on the character creation screen agonizing over which skills to assign as major. You don't assign major and minor skills at all, but instead pick one of ten races, each with a specific bonus. High Elves can once a day regenerate magicka quickly, Orcs can enter a berserk rage for more effective close-range combat. These abilities are best paired with certain character builds  the High Elf regeneration is useful for a magic user  but don't represent a rigid class choice. Major decisions don't need to be made until you're already out in the world and can try out magic, sneaking and weapon combat, emphasizing first-hand experience over instruction manual study, letting you specialize only when you're ready. It contributes to the thrilling sense of freedom associated with life in Skyrim. Do a quest, kill a dragon, snatch torchbugs from the air, munch on butterfly wings or simply wander while listening to one of the best game soundtracks in recent memory. Despite the enormity of the world and the colossal amount of content contained within, little feels random and useless. Even chewing on a butterfly wing has purpose, as it reveals one of several alchemical parameters later useful in potion making at an alchemy table. Mined ore and scraps of metal from Dwemer ruins can be smelted into ingots and fashioned into armor sets, pelts lifted from slain wildlife can be turned into leather armor sets, and random books plucked from ancient ruins can trigger hidden quest lines that lead to valuable rewards. Skyrim's land mass is absolutely stuffed with content and curiosities, making every step you take, even if it's through what seems like total wilderness, an exciting one, as something unexpected often lies just over the next ridge. Many times the unexpected takes the form of a dragon. Sometimes they're purposefully placed to guard relics, sometimes they swoop over cities and attack at seemingly random times. In the middle of a fight against a camp of bandits a dragon might strike, screaming through the sky and searing foe and friendly alike with frost or flame. Momentarily all on the battlefield unite, directing arrows and magic blasts upward to knock down the creature, creating impromptu moments of camaraderie -- a surprising change from what may have been yet another by-the-numbers bandit camp sweep. Dragons show up often, their presence announced by an ominous flap of broad wings or an otherworldly scream from high above. The scale and startling detail built into each creature's appearance and animations as it circles, stops to attack, circles again and slams to the ground makes encounters thrilling, though their predictable attack patterns lessen the excitement after a few battles. In the long run they're far less irritating than the Oblivion gate equivalent from The Elder Scrolls IV, can be completed in a few minutes, and always offer a useful reward. Killing a dragon yields a soul, which powers Skyrim's new Shout system. These are magical abilities any character can use, you don't have to specialize in spell casting to slow time, throw your voice, change the weather, call in allies, blast out ice and fire, or knock back enemies with a rolling wave of pure force. Even if you favor sword, shield and heavy armor and ignore magic entirely, you'll still be able to take full advantage of these abilities provided you find the proper words  each Shout has three  hidden on Skyrim's high snowy peaks and in the depths of forgotten dungeons, serving as another reason to continue exploring long after you've exhausted the main quest story, joined with the Thieves Guild, fought alongside the Dark Brotherhood, or thrown your support behind one of the factions vying for control of Skyrim. Not only is this land under assault by dragons, long thought to be dead, it's also ripped in two by civil war. You can choose one side or the other, but so much of the allure of Skyrim is how, even outside of the confines of quest lines, the embattled state of the world is evident, and steeped in a rich fictional legacy. Lord of the Rings this is not, but with the release of every Elder Scrolls game, the fiction becomes denser, and the cross-referencing for long-time fans all the more rewarding. Skyrim's residents are all aware of current events. They'll comment on the civil war, some sympathizing with the rebels, others thinking the establishment sold its soul. The peasants complain about the Jarls who control each settlement, the Jarls complain about the rebels or foreign policy, the overprotective College librarian complains when I drop dragon scales all over his floor; many characters feel like whole, distinct personalities instead of vacuous nothings that hand out quests like a downtown greeter hands out flyers for discount jeans. Characters stereotype based on race, they double-cross at even the slightest hint it might be profitable, and they react to your evolving stature within the world. It makes a ridiculous realm, filled with computer-controlled cat people and humanoid reptiles, demon gods and dragons, feel authentic, like a world that existed long before you showed up and will continue to exist long after you leave.

review: Skyrim is a masterpiece - period. It's also long and I'm not exaggerating. The numerous amount of side quests can have you exploring forever and a day, as it's meant to. The game is designed to be enjoyed, not to be rushed through. You are meant to go explore in this vast world, interact with the numerous characters that you encounter, be fulfilled in combat and feel like the Dragonborn you are meant to become. The main storyline is fantastic and is well worth the journey. All the other stories along the way are just magical... a never-ending fable that urges you to keep going. Everything in Skyrim is just stunning. I seriously have so many screenshots of so many amazing views. I feel like a part of me plays just for the "game photography" and that isn't an exaggeration in the slightest. The music composed by Jeremy Soule is just an epic masterpiece.

review: Not a great fan of Bethesda's work after the ruined my childhood years of gaming with Fallout 3. Bethesda does the standard bit in this game of hiring three or four voice actors to do a few hundred characters, and the whole mushy-irradiated-face you get to customize at the beginning. This game even comes with the standard Bethesda DLC options that are downright unplayable by some estimation. So why am I giving a recommendation? Steam workshop. The mod community, the gamers themselves, have seen the promise in this game and made it their own. As well, I can say this is the first Bethesda game that has not out-right turned me away because I loathed the leveling system. I didn't like the idea of hopping around in the woods for 30 minutes in order to level stats. Seemed stupid. However, this game has a decent leveling system and great mod support so you can have the adventure you crave.

Some screams make people run away from you, others make you push them and so on. Until I bought Skyrim, I had no idea how much fun it was to shout but now I do. Thanks, Skyrim

You can do whatever you want, be the main story or the sidequest, you will always have something to do. You can spend all day and not get bored in this game. The DLC are nice additions, although you already have enough content with the main game by itself. And if by any chance you get bored, there's always the mod's community making news stuff ! When I cracked this game I liked this game so much that I bought it because it's a masterpiece. It's that good. Seriously, stop reading this and go buy it and play it :) !

review: I had not owned Steam's install until now, but if I had written a review when I had originally played this game, it would have been composed similarly to the following piece: "Quite possibly the best Role-Playing-Game Bethesda has had the pleasure of developing. The 100+ hours that I have invested into this game are looked back upon quite fondly (a statement, that I assure you, carries no demur). Alone, this game easily stands tall at 9/10--impressive, no doubt--yet with the DLC content, modding capabilities, and continued patch support, it easily boasts a 10/10. Now I will leave you with these two simple words...buy it."

review: It is certainly true that Skyrim is much, much better on the PC rather than on the consoles. Why? 1 word. MODS~ There are many, many, many, MANY MODS ALL OVER THE INTERNET. Besides, the gameplay is pretty good as well. As far as I'm concerned, this would be rated at a 9.75/10. It's pretty good, but not my absolute favorite game. Still, it's good!

review: Ta gra po prostu wymiata. Jest to jedna z tych produkcji, gdzie bdc w podziemiach, czy ciemnym lesie, naprawd masz obawy co si przed Tob pojawi za nastpnym zakrtem. Do tej pory takie odczucia miaem jedynie w Gothicu. Swoj rol odgrywa muzyka, ktra nadaje ten klimat niepewnoci. Naprawd sporo moliwoci, masa pobocznych questw, ktre bardzo wyduaj rozgrywk. Rozwija posta mona na kilka sposobw, m.in mag, skrytobjca, typowo cikozbrojny wojownik, lub lekkozbrojny piechur. Ciekawie zrobiony system wbijania lvli. eby awansowa na kolejny poziom postaci, trzeba podnosi coraz wyej kade z umiejtnoci - samo zabijanie nie wystarczy. A umiejtnoci jest mnstwo. Kilka rodzajw czarw, kowalstwo, alchemia, zaklinanie, lekki i ciki pancerz, jedno- i dwurczna bro, tarcze... I wiele wicej. Naprawd polecam, daj ocen 10/10 i mam zamiar w przyszoci dokupi dodatki do tej gry, ktre nawiasem mwic wygldaj obdnie - ale to ju inna historia.

review: The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is a very good game in my opinion. Being a person who very much enjoyed the other games in the Elder Scrolls series I believe this one is another game in the series that adds a lot of great gameplay features and replay value.

review: One of the best so far in the Elder Scrolls series. Like previous titles, the base game can get dry and run out of steam, but the modifications available provide hundreds of hours of enjoyable playtime. Packed with lore like always, and with an upgraded engine, there's no reason not to play this one.

review: Skyrim is everything I came to expect from a Free-Roam RPG. From character customization to spells and enchantments to the different enemies that come crashing through after you on your quest, this game delivers. A healthy mod community also delivers engaging (and sometimes ridiculous) mods to suit your fancy and every occassion. I recommend playing the DLC as well once you've finished the Skyrim original content.

review: I have poured many hours of my life away into this game, and it is still one that amazes and intruiges me. I would never not recommend this game; if you're a fan of the Elder Scrolls saga, you should have bought it already. If you've never played an Elder Scrolls game before, this is a great one to come in on, as the graphics are crisp and beautiful and the storyline is deep and engaging. A must buy for Western hack n' slash RPG fans.

review: This game is amazing. Very well orchestrated music accompanied by beautiful graphics makes this game the best fantasy adventure I have played EVER. The gameplay is slow and gritty, with three main classes: Thief, Mage, and warrior, all equally fun. The variety between one thing to the other is immense because of subtlety. For example, weapons ranks are based on their material, and every material makes the weapon change but not by too much, making it more realistic, although there could have been more variety in these weapons. There was one side-quest which the key item was a sword, there were books on this and to get this started I was pumped, but to my dismay it was a regular shape. There are few varieties in crafted weapons, which is my only negative comment, other than the occasional glitch. I give The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim a 9/10

review: Skyrim is easily one of the best games I've ever played. I'm still relatively new to the Elder Scrolls franchise (having only played Oblivion before this) but I feel it's fair to say that this game is probably the strongest entry into the franchise yet. It's got the usual attention to detail you'd come to expect from Bethesda, with the lore, lands, and characters all being well designed and very, very impressive. That along with the wonderful gameplay make for a great game that will eat up your time like nobody's business. Highly recommended. Especially to fans of fantasy, the Fallout series, or the previous Elder Scrolls games.

With mods easily downloaded from Steam workshop Skyrim has roughly 500-a googleplex hours of replayablitly. The only major issue with the game is that it still runs on the amazing yet buggy Oblivion engine though siginfitgantly updated seince Fallout NV and if you mess up modding it can be a pain, so makesure if you do any large mods you watch a tutroial first if you've never modded.

Definitely an improvement from Oblivion; they weeded out some unnecessary features and added some awesome new ones.

Get some really good software if you plan to get the DLC's or your looking at long loading screens. But, this is a really good game to not lie. It's got a short main questline. But it does make up for it by having so many quest's. The reason I bought this was for nolgastia. I miss playing morrowind.

Haha... This game has no bad qualities I can think of other than some bugs here and there, and the combat can feel clunky at times. If you're willing to invest a lot of time in a game than I see no reason not to get Skyrim unless you're "too cool" for involved RPGs.

review: Like all things, Skyrim has both positive and negative aspects to it. Some say it can be boring, others claim it to be the greatest story told in gaming history. Some experience game-breaking bugs before it even begins, others have spent the past two years playing with not a single error. I left the following comment on a friend's review but feel it should be part of my own, too: "It makes you long for a better specced rig because you know the one you're on isn't good enough to show the game at its best (even though it's still amongst the best looking games ever made). Have sunk countless hours into Skyrim since the day it was released (I play on 360 & PC - yes, I'm obsessed) and haven't even completed half of the main storyline. So much to do" Skyrim is exceedingly good at drawing you into its world and keeping you there. Even when you manage to escape for a while, it'll lure you back in eventually. At the end of the day, regardless of all of its other achievements though, Skyrim is best at one thing in particular: it's fun. Not only do I recommend it as part of this review but I have actively told people, face to face, that they need to play it.

review: After playing nearly 200 hours, doing almost every single quest I could find, I finally finished the main questline. And what a disappointment it was. An utterly trivial fight and the "World Eater" is no more. What? After everything I've done in Skyrim, was a total letdown. I pretty much rage quit after I got back to Whiterun and realized that was that. So what did I skip? I skipped the Dark Brotherhood quests. Murderer I am not. Sort of. I skipped the Blades quests as I refused to do what they wanted. And I haven't done the Civil War stuff as I didn't want to join either the Evil Empire or the Racist Mofo. I suppose I'll squeeze out some more hours doing those at "some point", but right now I'm just incredibly pissed at the lame ending. Still, it was a good game. I didn't manage to hit any bugs that I noticed, my only peeve was the sometimes extraordinarily long loading times, which seemed random. Sometimes pretty swift, once it took over 15 minutes - after that I control+alt+delete anytime it took over 2! And the occasional crash when quicksaving, although thankfully the save always actually took place first. Other bad points were the repetitiveness. I do have to give it points for an insane amount of unique and varied locations but the "puzzles" in the game were a joke. Either spin the pillar to select the right side, or spin the dial to select the right face. Very little in the way of unique puzzles. All the mobs were fairly uniform and nothing special. I also found it somewhat immersion breaking that despite the fact I never cast a spell except in the 3 or so occasions required by quests they decided I was an uber mage and could lead them. At least I had to work (a bit) for the Companions and the Thieves. Haven't tried any of the DLC so know if they are any good.

review: Man, where to begin with this game? It is absorbing, engrossing, and I lost a good bit of my life to it. I liked Morrowind, and Oblivion both, and this one reminds me a lot of morrowind. Do not overlook the mod community. The mods are strong with this one. I for one used many Lord of the Rings weapons and some really great power additions, as well as replacing the moon with the Death Star. Really good gameplay. The story is definitely not the highlight, the world is.

An open world RPG, with thousands of mods to change anything you desire in the game - Great Graphics, A solid story, tons upon tons of side quest material and hundreds of fun hours. Honestly what is not to like about this gem of a game`? Heck even if there is something you don't like - just change it with a mod :D Its an RPG must own and it cannot be praised enough. Buy it, play it, love it - and then go change it into something else and play it again!

review: Skyrim was my first RPG that I've ever played, its very special to me. I've never had a gaming experiance quite like The Elder Scrolls. The freedom, world, and lore just can't be matched by any other game. That, tied in with the character building and the countless numbers of quests make it a true master piece of gameing. I've spent many hours on this game and its great counterparts (Morrowind, and Oblivion). I hope to see at least one more TES title come out this decade. The TES community has grown in the past few years so if you think something needs to be added to the game chances are their are mods to enhance it. The Elder Scrolls fanchise is beloved and remarked as one of the greatest games ever. So if you haven't played Skyrim, at least try it out. If you have played, try Morrowind, and Oblivion. And If you've done that too, try similar titils like the Fallout franchise.

review: Ahhh! Skyrim! What a weird relationship we have! Before I bought Skyrim, or even peered into the Elder Scrolls series, I had thought only negativity of this game. I didn't understand what all the hype was about, I didn't enjoy ANOTHER fantasy game coming out. I was dead wrong. I was at a video game club in college when they held a competition and the winner got Steam money (or Xboxlive money, but I'm a PC gamer only). Skyrim was on sale and I went ahead and bought it. My friends had talked their heads off about it so I thought I would give it a try. I was hooked. I love this game to death. To talk about every single aspect of this game would take me hours. However, I can highlight some of my positive experiences. 1) Every playthrough shows me something different. Sure, I have done a lot of the same missions, but every single time I have exprienced so many new things. It has high replayability. 2) Modability is through the roof. Check out the workshop or if you use the Nexus Mod Manager you can check out other online Skyrim mods. I have about 80 working mods now that add patrols, stories, areas, weapons, armor, etc. to the game. Further adding to replayability. 3) Character and skill control. You can literally create and evolve any character you want. This isn't some ESO "your character can wear heavy armor as a healer, but not really". You can legit done heavy armor, be a healer, and smith a thousand tiny daggers. You can be an archer who uses conjuration to spawn your tank to take on most bad guys. You can be a pure destruction mage, unleashing lightning, fire, and ice amongst your foes. You can wield a pure sword and shield combo and go through the whole game like that. The races are diverse from different Mer (elven), Men (human), and beast-like creatures that all have different abilities and a special power of their own. Skyrim is a game about diversity and replayability, it does 100% in both. The only downside? It is a game made by Bethesda, and it wouldn't be a Bethesda game without a ton of bugs in it. On the plus side, most can be fixed by official patches, as well of unofficial mod patches. No game is perfect, but Skyrim comes pretty damn close.

review: With as many hours as I have on record any words in saying this game is good is meaningless, but here it is. It's a great game. It's controls are good, I'm never like dang it the controls screwed me. There's a few bugs, but they are few are far between compared to the amount of content there is. The soundtrack, voice acting is good, if not great. In theory it's an open world action RPG, in truth its really what you want it to be. You want to be lead by the nose and go where the major quests take you, want to say screw all the quests, and just clear out a dungeon because you're a serial killer, want to join the bard college and just travel around with out really doing much of anything? Well the game lets you do all of those or none.

review: In a lot of ways, it is a typical open-world game: there are missions you can go on, if you chose to accept them; there are no level restrictions to certain areas; you are free to level up your character as desired with no pre-set formats. In other ways, the game can be a bit tedious: the combat is not that complex; archery is a bit over powered; and the skills system is mundane to level up (you either gain skill points by using the skill or purchase them from trainers). But that said, I love this game, a fact evidenced by the almost 300 hours I've spent playing this game. The level of detail to the environment and atmosphere is tremendous. The ability to mod the game, and the mods that have come out, its what truly give this game its beauty. If you are the kind of person that loves expansive, immersive environments, you must have this game. If you are a game-lore nerd, you must buy this game.

review: IF YOU HAVEN'T PLAYED THIS GAME, PLAY IT. ----- IF YOU HAVE PLAYED THIS GAME, PLAY IT AGAIN. After 400 plus hours playing Skyrim and all of its DLCs on the peasant console race, I thought I had done it all. I was Archmage, Guildmaster, Listener, Harbringer, Civil War hero, Vampire Slayer, and the best Dragonborn ever (sorry Miraak). I built houses, slayed dragons, murdered who I could, and generally brought total chaos to Skyrim. I truly believed the game had no more to offer me. Soon I discovered PC, Steam, and modders. Steam Summer Sale did its job and made me buy Skyrim. Seriously, ten bucks? Who would pass a deal like that up? I still had my doubts though. I already owned the game on console, so why should I buy it again just to play it on PC? I'll tell you why: Mods. ing mods (excuse my language). Not just mods about ing, though. I ensure you that if you search hard enough, you will find a mod for just about anything. Whether it'd be a mod that makes everyone nude underneath their clothes, a mod that turns dragons into trains, a mod that adds realism through thirst and hunger, a mod that adds DLC sized content, or a ing mod. Yes, you'll find those. The possibilities of modding are endless with Skyrim. You can make it as realistic as possible or create the fantasy RPG you've always wanted. The choice is your's with mods. No vanilla options holding you back. No console peasant race pulling you down. So go my children. Purchase this game. Mod the hell out of it. And spend possibly +400 hours of your life slaying dragons, testing out new mods, and Fus-Ro-Dah-ing all over your keyboard.

review: An amazing RPG! Bethesda really did a good job on Skyrim. I love open world games and Skyrim did not fail me. The fact that you can fight dragons is awesome and how you can gain their soul for unlocking shouts was a cool idea from Bethesda. The weapons were also a blast to play with. The amount of weapons and armor you can enchant really made the game fun and how you can use magic spells instead of using a sword or a mace really changed the way you played the game. If you wanted to go for a long range weapon, you could pick a bow and arrow to take out your enemies, or if you are more of the stealth type, a dagger would be a excellent weapon for you. This game is also amazing because it looks beautiful! With the High Resolution Texture Pack, it makes your Dovahkiin sexier than ever. When you play Skyrim, you never know what to expect and what random loot you will find. I am the Dragonborn wearing a hat with badass horns! I'm Dovahakiin known globally you're nobody at all!

review: It's hard not to appreciate a lot of what Skyrim does well. It is a vast game world with a lot of detail. Visually impressive with enough content that demands hundreds of hours of gameplay if you wish to explore it all. As it turns out, I did put in a few hundred hours. The mods, never forget the mods. This is a big part of just about any elder scrolls game and deserves to get some attention. Oblivion had an impressive array of mods and Skyrim boasts the same if not more. What's disappointing however is that I came away from the vanilla game unsatisfied. I completed the majority of the content but just had to drop the game before even getting to the Dragonborn DLC. This is after taking several long breaks between playing it. To put it simply, the game is just downright glitchy. I hate to put that in writing because for a game this size, it's bound to have some problems. Some quests (mostly secondary or side quests) just won't complete. Saving often is a necessity so get used to pressing F5 a lot to quick save. If you're into achievements, there are several that may not unlock and what's disappointing is that some of them have requirements that can take a long time to complete (Oblivion Walker for example - 2 separate play throughs and nothing). But ultimately, after finishing the main quest line, it didn't feel very epic. The voice acting started to get to me when you hear the same 3-4 voices and you really want to start murdering everyone you come across (which to the game's credit, you can do if you so desire). I so badly wanted to love this game. The hype got to me as well as the positive reviews. The first time I took down a dragon, it was rather exhilarating. But for me, it all went downhill from there and plateaued in an above average experience (not epic). The game is plenty difficult for those wanting a challenge and you can adjust the difficultly at will. I for one, love a challenge and kept it maxed out at Legendary. This fact alone is probably what kept me coming back. Until I got to a higher level, nearly every encounter was a challenge and required quick action, use of potions, on occasion different gear and maneuvering. But...the glitches... I'm ballparking it but I'd say at least 40-50 hours of my game time was devoted to reloading saves to get around bugs and game glitchiness. That's roughly 20% of my time playing this game. Last but certainly not least, after my first play through I went ballistic with mods. The vast amount of community content is staggering. If anything, that is the most impressive aspect of Skyrim. I'm of the opinion that this fact alone has helped keep Skyrim near and dear to many gamers. I can see why, the community contributions (free I might add) in many cases, out-do content in the vanilla game. It is not my intention to belittle what Bethesda has accomplished with Skyrim either. I am but a lowly gamer (years late to the Skyrim party) that just took issue with a few aspects of the experience. An experience that was overall positive with a few reservations. So despite my misgivings...I still need to give it my recommendation. If you want an open world, detailed, vast and moddable game, Skyrim checks all of those boxes. As it stands right now, there really isn't a game like it.

review: If you are into RPG/FRP games and you want to be inside the game as yourself instead of seeing the character from up top, and of course you dont like team play, this is the one for you. In fact play the entire series of Elders Scrolls from the beginning, my recommendation would be to play at least Morrowind and Oblivion first then move on to this one, you'll get the stories and place names better plus the story lines are loosely connected.

review: No Elder Scrolls game is about story. Skyrim captures what the entire mission of The Elder Scrolls series is about: Adventure. When you're walking on the road and bandits attack you, when you stumble upon a cave loaded with enemies and treasure, when you stay up through the late hours of the night because you don't want to go back to the real world, you know you're playing Skyrim. The story driven quests are there to give you a general direction. The random encounters are there to make sure you take the longest route possible while going in that general direction.

review: I simply love this game. I bought it about two years back on my birthday for my xbox for 10 dollars at Gamestop. This was the first RPG type game I ever played and enjoyed it immensly. But, just a few monthes ago I started to switch over to the P.C. to give it a chance. The first gameI bought was this and when I found out about Console Commands (just use them for fun) I figured out this game has it all. Great story, combat, and the graphics are absotuley stunning. And the fact that I could get mods to addon to the already massive world I just got happy. Overall I reccomend this to anyone that loves a strong RPG and loves TES series.

Anything you could imagine could be put into Skyrim by mods, and everybody, for real, has his own versions of Skyrim depending on the mods he used. Every time you play, you will get a fresh new experience. And I love the OST of Skyrim, when you play the game, it completely fits in the game and creates a wonderful feel. Give it a try and you will not regret.

I have completely different games and characters running on my pc when at the home base and laptop for travel. It would be nice, however, if you had an easy way to clear a mission you don't want to run without using the councel to jump thru the scenes and artifically end the mission. For instance, I really don't want to sacrafice a live human on an alter to continue, or become a werewolf so I generally start a new game and avoid those situations. Other than that, this in an amazing game.

review: Is there anyone on the internet who doesn't know at least something about Skyrim? Now, the main gripe people have is that Skyrim needs serious mod work to be enjoyable. I've done bugger all (aside from running around with anduril for a while...) and I've got like 70 odd hours so far. No, I didn't even mod the UI. Is the UI bad? It annoys me at times! Is the combat bad? It's a bit shallow, too hack n slash. Do either of these things or any other complaints I might have stop me from playing it? No, not at all. Skyrim is an RPG in the most basic sense - you create a character and you go play with them. Most of the fun I have from Skyrim isn't from the gameplay itself, but the emergent gameplay - the thought of my unlikely adventurer hacking off a troll's face, thinking "well that was close" and then the look on his face when another two come storming around the corner. Or cutting someone free only for them to try to run away at which point I run them down and hack their legs out with a greatsword. Or sneaking through a bandit-infested cave dispatching all the guards with a single arrow to the head like some weird crouching version of Legolas. Skyrim is about the stories you create, and there's enough in the world to give you a bit of a head start.

review: This game is absolutly astonishing; the graphic quality is amazing; the storyline is malleable, because you can do the storyline whenever you want, so that you aren't 100% required to do the campaigns; and the complete objective of the game is incredible. I strongly only reccomend this game if you have a good computer and if you are able to wait about 6-8 hours for this to download, but i'll tell ya', it's totally worth it.
game-hours: 362.9
review: This is easily one of the best games ever created. It is an enormous improvement over Bethesda's previous offerings. More stable and more polished. The combat is still imperfect, the writing is sometimes off, but all that pales in comparison to the sheer awesomeness of the expansive and beautiful world that has been created. And that's BEFORE we get into the mods ... a must-play!

review: Going through my game list I just saw that I have over 400 hours on this game. I don't understand, how this is possible. I haven't even finished the main quest yet. Barley began the quest line of the first expansion, and not even finished the starter quest of the second expansion. I have yet to fully explore Skyrim. Of the 8 holds (Skyrim districts) I only explored 5 of them. I don't know how many more hours It will take me until I finished the main quest and the two expansions. How many more to see everything, but thank I godI took breaks playing this game. Because if you play straight from start to finish, having maybe over 1000 hours of play behind you, you will be fluid in the ancient dragon tongue, recite the theme song from your memory and likely need a guidance consular to help you take your first steps back in the real world. So immersive is this game experience. In the years to come it won't be possible to take people serious that haven't played this game.

review: It goes without saying, this is one of the best games ever made! It's a Game of the Year accross the board. When you play a game for 150hrs and still have an overwhelming amount of sights still to see, you realize how much heart and soul was put into such a game!

review: Where to start...I've played all the other Elder Scrolls...With that said Skyrim is different. Whereas in the others you could walk around hours and find the world fairly void of life, on this you don't. Whether human or animal you are bound to find something to kill or just look at. The graphics on Skyrim are really enjoyable and the soundtrack really helps immerse you into the game. I played it 10 hours straight, and I normally don't do that, so it is worth buying...but do yourself the favor buy the one with the DLC...also I heard modding the game is insanely fun...I've yet to try it though. If you're a fan of open world RPG's where many things are customizable this is a must for you.

review: I only recommend Skyrim in PC version only because of mods. pc community mod is what makes this game great. I honestly don't get why console version gets so much praise because Skyrim is well...  without mods. Skyrim without mod is glitchfest, boring, and non immpersive. mod is a MUST in this game. I recommend going to Nexus site for mods to check and see which mod has high score and subsribe them in steam workshop. Though I recommend just using Nexus site and program to get/organize all the Skryim mods

review: Addictive, like crack cocaine. But very well done. Storyline is great, the fighting mechanics are reasonably well-done, but the main draw is the open-world environment where you can do anything. There are hundreds of side quests. The best part is that on a PC, there are tons of cool mods.
game-hours: 14.7
review: Quite possibly one of my favorite single player RPGs. Its even better with mods from the skyrim nexus or the steam workshop. PLUS its the only game where punching a chicken gets you a higher bounty than hitting a child with a battle axe!
game-hours: 166.1
review: Don;t normally have a favorite on PC or console when it comes to games, but if your PC can run it on High or better I'd say grab Skyrim for PC. Being able to mod the game gives it an infinite time limit on playability. Get bored of the main game? Download a mod that changes the story or adds a side-story to the game. Want your character to really stand out amongst the rabble? Get some armor/weapon mods. Don't like the leveling up system? Download an XP mod. I think you get the gist of it. Skyrim on PC > console.

From picking up flowers ingame to modding the crap out of it, everything is fun, i got almost 200 hours in it and there are many more hours to come! Definitely a must buy if you like games that aren't over in a couple of hours. The story of this game is Meh but everything else is superb. 9.5/10

review: 300+ hours of playtime later I can certainly say that Skyrim has quite a bit of content... It's a vast expansive and ridiculously pretty completely open world filled with monsters, ruins, interesting stories and just so much STUFF to fight, explore and loot. Plus if you ever run out f stuff to do, there's the workshop with a near-infinite supply of very decent user created content. For me it'll always be something I'll return to every once in a while. I'd guess the only downsides to this game are the fact that the main questlines (as opposed to say, Oblivion) are somewhat on the short side and that the population of Skyrim is a bit scarce (you'd really expect to run into just a few more people in the capitals), also watch out for the random vampire attacks with Dawnguard that will decimate your population if you're a bit unlucky (mods can fix that though).

review: ...and when I need to escape from my life for a while, I turn into a dragonborn girl and explore a new world. And when I feel lonely, I return to reality and go drink some coffee with my friends. Skyrim is filled with great stories, odd creatures and wonderful places which makes us want to explore it's world even more. As we're allowed to make choices within the game, we feel we're holding our own destiny and we're compelled to write our own dragonborn story. If you haven't tried it out yet, go for it and get lost in it's awesomeness.

review: The Scope of the Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, is what makes it such a succsessful game. The RPG mechanincs in this game are very good: you can become whatever you want, a theif that uses magic, an Archer, a swordsman, or just a simple Mage. Added to that, there are over 300 missions/side quests that one can delve into which adds a lot of lifespan to the game. however with this comes the fact that some missions aren't all that diffrent from each other. most of the side quests are fetch quests, but even then it is still fun to do them because there can be a lot of backstory to the quest that can make it more intresting. As for the Campaign, i would say that it has a great story line, and the fact that you can pursue the campaign missions at anytime you want makes it very enjoyable to play this game. In terms of gamelpay, it has a decent combat mechanic that consits of hack-and-slash, but even then, the diversity of the weapons and magic make it enjoyable. Also, the map is very vast, as you will encounter Marshes and snowy peaks to plains of grass dominated by mammoths. The enemies are very diverse, ranging from Bandits to Dragons and Giants, and each one of these enemies have their strengths and diffrences, for example, trolls can regenarate health at a very fast rate, but are very weak when they are fought with fire. In terms of Gameplay, i give this game a 10 out of 10. The graphics are nothing special, but they are a great improvement from Oblivion, and it increases the amount of moments that make you stop and stare at the scenery, just wondering how beautiful and calm it all seems. but of course there are mod packs that make the visuals look much sharper and much better. For Graphics this game gets a 8 out of 10, as the graphics arent like Crysis 2, but they do look quite pretty. At last the Lifespan of the game is good, as i believe this game will continue to be played, as the steam workshop allows modders to create cool things that will add depth and content to the game, and like a lot of PC gamers know, Skyrim with Mods is much better and much more fun than Skyrim without mods. Graphics: 8/10 Story: 9/10 Gameplay: 10/10 Lifespan: 10/10

review: ok since the release of the 1.9 patch in february skyrim has become greatly stable and glitches and bugs seem a distant thing,I know dragonborn was also part of this sucess but as the patch was released before the dlc then im inclined to think they nailed fix alot of skyrim bug/glitch issues,Thankfully the game runs awesome now and skyrim is a greatly reccomended game. "play from solstheim before meeting the blade delphine,Ignore the the jurgen windcaller quest and head straight for solstheim im lvl 26 now with the skills to take on the skyrim dragonborn issue"...just food for thought you dont need to be lvl 50+ to beat miraak"have fun,weeeeeeeeeeeeeee

review: The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Positives: + Amazing graphics which immerse you in the game. Travel through woodlands, swampy marshes, snowy mountains and experience beautiful architecture in cities. + Literally hundreds of quests which have captivating storylines and gameplay. + Various guilds to join, including the Dark Brotherhood (assassins), Thieves guild, Companions guild, Mages guild and Imperial Legion or Stormcloaks. + Hundreds of well designed dungeons, caves, tombs and other locations to explore. Every environment is different and interesting. You always feel like you're exploring something new and exciting. + Many skills to master. Enchanting, alchemy, smithing your own weapons and armour, numerous schools of magic, archery..that's just the beginning. + Skills system where you gain new powers each time you level up, which aids your gameplay. This is really fun and intuitive. Negatives: None that I can think of! Overall Score: 10/10 This game is a true masterpiece and any RPG fan will love it. Highly recommended.

review: I usually hate games with spells and swords with elves running around the place. which made me avoid this game when it was released, all the more difficult to admit it may be one of the most enjoyable games I have ever played.

review: One of the best and largest (no kidding) RPG game ever made. I've played this game since it's release (First on the PS3, then on my PC), and despite literally HUNDREDS of hours spent in Skyrim, the harsh north still manages to surprise me with something new. I have to say that it's one of the few games that are actually worth their price in gaming time. But this also leads to the infamous OMC (One More Cave) syndrome, which can enslave you to your keyboard till unhealthy hours. It's that addictive, but also that rewarding. It gives you a strong sense accomplishment each time you craft new armor or level up in magica based skill trees. And it doesn't age, as the community provides HD graphics enhancers and TONS of mods (some especially creepy). I get Goosebumps each time I realize that Elder Scrolls Online are just a few months away...

review: (((NO SPOILERS WILL BE REVEALED IN THIS REVIEW!!!))) This game is so much fun. You get to roam around Skyrim doing anything. The character creation is cool! You ride in on a carriage and are a prisoner. They do not see you on the list so you do your character creation then head to the chopping block. When they are mid chop off of your head a dragon rides in and destroys the town. Then you go to Riverwood and talk then go to Whiterun and warn the Jarl. You go to the Western Watchtower and kill a dragon then absorb its soul and become Dragonborn. You can become an Imperial or Stormcloak. You get summoned to High Hrothgar and are told to find the Horn of Jurgen Windcaller. You then are distracted to Riverwood again and meet a blade. Later in the game you get to pick whether to kill Parthurnaax or stay loyal to the Blades.

review: Go and buy it now just do it, its my favourite game of all time. i have it on ps3 and ive completed it several times and i bought it again to play with mods. i have spent months and months of my life playing each race levelling up each skill tree and i do not regret my decision AT ALL best game of all time in my opinion.

review: Skyrim is one of the best games that I could have something to do. the graphics are very good, and no doubt the story is compelling. the strength is the variety of weapons and abilities that you can disporre.punto weakness is the amount of bugs in the game. for graphics advice is to try to start with quality standards, and personalize them with a lot of patience to find the ideal set of detail and fluidity of the game. the story in the role of dragon's blood is not very long, but the game is enriched with various quests and different guilds. the chance to go around, and wander from the prairies to the cold mountains makes the game more exciting. I'm sorry I only tried one of the DLC on sale ... (in which I risontrato other bugs, but were eliminated with updates). The overall grade is the story 90/100 (which I expect longest), 95/100 and 90 for the graphics for the game as a whole. I recommend it guys

review: I think the almost 400 hours played speak for themselves. Do you have +400 hours of sparetime? Do you have that urging feeling of slashing that bandit's head of with a twohanded axe made by an evil god? Or why not commit yourself to a beutiful killingspree of innocent people in a peacefull town? Basically, this is fallout, but instead of shooting your enemies heads of with a Nuke-throwing-machine-of-destiny, your chop them of using your fists. And this game has (some kinda) morals.

review: It's hard to give an objective review for this game as it is one of my all time favorites. I've played over 500 hours grand total, and I'm still going. As objectively as I can...: The vanilla game (meaning, without mods and dlcs) can last over 80 hours, depending on how you play. That means, no fast traveling, doing every quest you pick up, exploring, and doing all the factions. That's not bad considering how much the game costs. It's a fairly free form adventure in terms of character progression. You can choose to be a mage, a theif, or a warrior, or any combination of those. Potentially, there are hundreds of different ways you can choose to progress your character. On my most recent play through, I've decided to be a heavy armor wearing Imperial legionaire. I use one handed swords and shields, and I despise magic. By role playing, I've decided to make the civil war my main quest line, and I'm mostly ignoring the dragonborn quest line. I've also made characters that focused soley on theives guild quests, and assassin's quests. By role playing, I've managed to get hundreds of hours out of this game. The one draw back is that eventually you will see almost everything that the vanilla game has to offer. While you will still come across the occasional random occurance, like a giant beating on his mammoth, the game will begin to feel stale. The DLC's (mainly dawnguard and dragonborn) will add another 100 or so hours to the game (potentially), before you begin to run into the same problem. It will eventually feel stale. The graphics will feel out of date, the same old voices, followers, dialogue, combat, places and quests... It'll all be something you've done a dozen times. This is where modding comes into play. By using mods, you can extend your play time in this game by hundreds of hours. The best thing is that the mods are completely free! Graphics overhaul that make it rival battlefield 4 or crysis 3. Weapon and armor mods that quadruple the types of weapons in the game. Difficulty and spawn mods that make it more challenging and increase the number of enemies. Even variant mods that add enemy variants. There are even a few very well developed mods out there that rival the size of the official dlcs, with full voice acting and more quests! Would I recommend this game? Well, not on the consoles. But for a PC player? HELL YES!

Mastering things like using your "Quick Slot" and the open ended quests takes time, but it's well worth it. Very hard to find something negative to say about the game, but for the sake of constructive criticism, I will say this: The DLC content feels a bit rushed, and it's the only place I encountered any bugs at all. Particularly with the 'Dawnguard' expansion. Buy this game, play the hell out of it. You won't regret it.

Just take my advise and install SkyUI, Skyrim SKSE, HD texture pack and an ENB and it will be one of the best looking games ever.

review: A gaming experience that offers a variety of enjoyable playthroughs and a character development system (perks, guardian stones, etc.) that lets you play without as much of a hinderance on playstyle as many other games would seem to enforce, while keeping the door cracked open for interchangeable playstyles without being overly forced to make a new character to play as you want.

review: I figure since I have enough games to tower over a 6 foot tall man, I should at least give you the one i enjoy the most on my computer. The main reason I love Skyrim on the computer is because there is ALWAYS a way to get new content, without having to wait for Bethesda to spoonfeed it to you. I think that Skyrim is one of the besy RPG style games to date, and its modding community only adds to it. If there is one game I'm not ashamed to say that i own more than 1 copy of, and have dumped well over 700 hours total into, it's Skyrim. It's a game that every story-loving gamer should own, and is a prime example of an open world done right.

review: Words can't describe what I have experience in this game honestly like where do I start! 1. Mods 2. More Mods 3.s of Skyrim (must have for immerson) But seriously this game is amazing I remember playing it for the first time on xbox back in late 2011 and now playing it on pc with hundreds of mods! and even though the story is a bit dull compared to Oblivion and Morrwinds stories and is the basic overused YOUR THE CHOSEN ONE it is still amazing and I've played through it 5 times on different platforms. Anyway I recommend this to anyone that enjoys games where you can do what ever the  you want or for people who wanted a challange because you can really change the whole game with mods anyway I keep going off subject besides all the awesome things in this game I will admit that the dragon fights are very very easy and the same repetitive hit them when they get on the ground and asorb there soul crap but thats nothing a couple mods can't fix anyway buy this game just do it!

review: The most recent and arguably best addition to the Elder Scrolls series, Skyrim takes you to an immense world where you can fight monsters, rob houses, or court some of the loveliest ladies (or men, if you swing that way) on the continent. If you finish up with all the quests, which is unlikely, you could download or make a mod on the workshop, and play some more. This is the kind of game you should buy if you're looking for length in a single-player game.

review: (Might be spoilers. Tread with care) Play one of several races. Loot, craft, enchant, fight with weapons or wizardry. Generic sounding? In theory. In practice? Whimsically & groundbreakingly awesome on so many levels. In what other open world game do you get to climb giant mountains, for crying out loud? Though widely viewed as less magical than its predecessor in terms of its atmosphere by Oblivion fans, it is also rightfully recognised for its own grittier aesthetic which complements the celtic/norse house style of the UI in a way that brings the feel of the frosty homeland of the nords forth like nothing else. Also, it arouses further intrigue to see the empire hanging in the balance, & even the Blades forced from their former glory into, um.... well, nine gods know where. Then we have the DLC. Dawnguard? Meh, but having more content for Skyrim was bliss in itself, so I approve. Dragonborn? Now we're talking; what better than to get a glimpse of the Dunmer culture once more, served alongside a deeper exploration of Hermaeus Mora (the fact that his quest was connected to the core game's main quests was a neat introduction to daedric quests, but a bit desperate) as we delve into his realm of apocrypha. Hearthfire? Never bought it myself, but eh, if you WERE looking to build your very own ingame house.... But I must digress. Skyrim: Legendary edition is out there in case you hadn't already caught onto this masterpiece. Although after clocking an, ahem, 800 & over hours of gameplay, I'm not quite as ecstatic these days, I reccommend giving Skyrim... a try? No. This thing was a turning point for my gaming career, from pure nintendo into the world of PC gaming. Go whole hog or go home; you have an albeit small country to fudge around in.

review: I am perfectly comfortable in saying that The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is by far the best game that I have ever played. The combat is familiar but still keeps things fresh to differentiate itself from previous Elder Scrolls titles. By current standards, the graphics and character models may seem a bit muddy, though this can be fixed by one of Skyrim's strongest features, its amazing mod support and community. While the base game of Skyrim itself can keep most players busy for a few hundred hours, mods add hundreds more, and with DLC-worthy mods such as Falskaar and the Skywind Project, the game seems as though there is no end. Gameplay aside, the lore and quests in this game don't offer as much freedom as Morrowind or Oblivion, but don't tie you down enough to where you feel like you're being forced to make a certain decision. The game offers the player a lot of freedom, as all side quests in the game can be completed as long as the player has obtained the power of the Thu'um, and that's another great feature all together. The Thu'um, or Shouts as the game more frequently refers to it as, is a power that the player (and a few other important characters) possesses that allows him or her to use their own voice to pretty much annihilate the enemy. There are more than 20 different Shouts in the base game, with the DLCs adding even more, and each one is uniquely different than the next, so the player doesn't feel like they're just getting an alternate version of the same power each time. A few other small things to mention is the simplified Level Up menu that allows your character to distribute stat points and perks without having to find somewhere to sleep and the amazing character customization. Honestly, there isn't much that I could find wrong with this game. And I'm pushing 800 hours of gameplay. So seriously, if you don't own Skyrim and you need to blow a few bucks, buy it. Trust me, you won't regret it. On a scale from 1 to 10, I think it's quite obvious at this point that the Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim receives a strong 10/10 from me.

review: One of the most fun fantasy action/adventure RPGs out there with an open world. There are probably thousands of quests to do, many sights to see, and the epic battles you will have are endless. The leveling system is incredibly unique and allows one to play exactly the type of fictional character they desire by completely ruling out having to choose a class. Without a doubt, this is personally my all-time favorite game.

review: The game is not perfect. That is why if you are browsing for this game on the PC and using steam, all hope is not lost. While you can spend a few dozen hours playing through a reasonably fun and large world, you can easily spend a hundred more with the power of MODS. The default mod repository that is the steam workshop works like a charm, providing fixes and additional content for you to enjoy aat will. For adventursome modders who want bigger and badder extras there is always Nexus mods.

review: This game is so great, I LOVE exploring and level systems so everything have a level... And I love skill branches... I love it, sob. In Skyrim you don't have to follow the main quest if you want (but eeeh it's neccessary) and I just... It's so fun to just go around and see what you'll find. One time I was in Riverwood, and a dragon appeared just like that. And I paniced I was like ",  THAT I CAN'T DEAL WITH A DRAGON RIGHT NOW." And I went into the Inn... And the music was still playing, but muffled. And then I was like "Fine okay if the music keeps on playing and puts its ing belief in me then okay... I'll do it." And I went out and the dragon was GONE and EVERYONE WAS DEAD. I looted everything, and got too much . And many times I've gone to kill a dragon, finding myself run away to a giant so the giant can kill the dragon instead. GOOD TIMES. I think a lot of people can find fun in this game, it has so much stuff in it. Just... Buy it.

review: I got Skyrim a while ago for my Xbox 360 and it is probably one of the best games I have ever played, and I didn't know it could get any better until I got it for PC. I'm typically one for playing a game with no cheats and no mods, but I gave one or two mods a little try and now I have my game modded out to the point I'd much rather live in my game than real life....minus the flying, fire breathing angry dragons of course! (And those oversized spiders can go too...) Without mods the game is still great, of course. I love that you can freely roam the world and do as you please. Be good, help people out, steal from them, cut their heads off, set everything on fire, start a large battle with an entire town... Good times, good times... Some of the quest lines for the guilds I felt could have lasted a lot longer, have more missions and be a bit more in-depth with a bigger storyline and maybe some more NPCs. And I do recommend the HD dlc if your computer is able to handle it, plus it is free and does add to the feel of the game a bit. And despite the prices I also feel that the DLC Dragonborn and Dawngaurd are worth getting as well (I don't have them yet for PC but I know they are enjoyable from my XBox 360 experience). Hearthfire is good too but if you are looking for more gameplay and quests it is best to go with the other two expansions. (Though Hearthfire is enjoyable...who doesn't want to build their own home and adopt some child you randomly find? Ok I hate kids but building a house was enjoyable.)

If fighting dragons, exploring duengons, reaching max levels, casting spells, or just plain exploring is your thing then Skyrim is perfect for you. It has all that and more! The graphics are amzing, sometime even too much. The workshop is perfect for making the game more coustomazable then it already is. Also not to mention the amzaing thousands of differnt quests you get to do in the game that will never leave you bored. Not to mention the differnt DLC packs for this game which I recommend buying too. Every single moment of this game will keep you want to play more. Once again I highly recommend you get this game :D

review: The Elder Scrolls are a strange bunch of games. In Skyrim, like Morrowind and Oblivion that proceeded it, you wonder around a huge open world, inhabited by wooden NPCs who all seem to utter the same phrases, in a voice you've heard several times before. You engage in clunky, repetitive combat and the main questline falls short of the Tolkienesque epic it could have been. But that's not quite what Skyrim is about. Skyrim is a huge world, intricately crafted and it's the little touches that make it amazing. It's finding a chest behind a waterful overlooking a beautiful landscape; Looking up from the ruins of an ancient underground city to see a crack of sunlight filtering through the rocks, illuminating the architecture of the lost race that once thrived there. Or maybe it's watching the corpse of an undead warrior smash its way out of a burial tomb, an aura of unholy magic nestled in those souless eyes. It's not the quests that make this game, they serve as an interesting motivator to get you out there exploring, the carrot on the end of an elven stick if you will. This game is about the unscripted moments and immersion in a land imbued with a rich mythological heritage. Skyrim never ceases to wow me and coupled with the mods available in the workshop and elsewhere, you could explore the land for weeks without finding half of whats to see. It's been on sale a few times in the last months and, even if you've played it on a console, with the graphics settings maxed out and a few mods to freshen the experience, Skyrim is a fantastic game with plenty more life left in it. It gets a huge thumbs up for me and I'd suggest anyone remotely interested gives it a go and sees for themselves why Skyrim players have racked up some of the longest playtimes for any Steam game, despite the lack of a multiplayer component. Rock on! It gets a huge thumbs up from me!

review: I have never been a big fan of sandbox games. Seriously I like small scale games with strategy and rpgs with a boring linear progression with a plethora of side quests. That is not to say this game doesn't work like that but really there is sooooo much you can do and sooo many side quests. When I finally started to play it, it became one of the best games I had ever played with story and world lore in abundance. You can spend hours reading every book in the world and days exploring every inch of this world. If you are looking for an escape there are few places better to escape to.

review: This game will bind you to your PC and wont let you go for a long long time. The Main Story-line is good, solid, and befitting of the Elder Scrolls. Some complain that it is nothing special, which might be true it is nothing totally new. But one has to consider that most things seem to have been there at one point or another. Instead of laying the focus on innovation I rather put it on how the story is delivered. The Story unfolds depending on your playstyle, you can have it unfold right into your face if you rush ahead. But you could also spend days or weeks in the game and barely scratch the surface of the Storyline. There is a lot to do in Skyrim, a seemingly endless amount of side-quests offer diversion and immersion into the Lore of TES ( The Elder Scrolls ). Besides delving deeper into the TES universe that way, one will also be rewarded with Coin, magical Weapons, Ancient armor and more. The Combat System is not overly complex but offers enough freedom for creative approaches. Especially on higher difficulties, or through mods, combat can be quite challenging and rewarding. Freedom of choice regarding Weapons and Magic add to the diversion of the combat system. Playstyle changes accordingly to ones choice of Weapon and Profession. The Visuals of the game are good and the design of the world appears Epical. Granted the basic Graphic was not spectacular but through the means of a free DLC it got much sharper. There is also the option of visually modding the game, the results are simply stunning. The Sound is bombastic, it adds to the immersion, the music is putting one in the right mood and underlines the fantasy setting. The Graphical User Interface is clearly a console Port, but it is managable. The game has a very active mod community, especially on the Nexus. One can drastically enhance or change the game there and replay it countless times. Each DLC adds greatly to the game as well, adding new content, options and storylines. The game definately has flaws, logical ones, some bugs, but they are not game breaking. The saying " perfection is made by flaws " fits, in regards of the mod community, very well here. Many a flaw inspired a modder to contribute to the game turning a semi rough diamond into a gem to behold. If you like freedom of choice, action, a nice story, immersion and exploring then you should not miss this milestone in game History.

review: never played an elder scrolls game before this but was tempted by the hype of ESO so bought their anthology and its more than lived up to its reputation - i can't say enough great things about this game. anyway i'm hooked so back to questing, exploring and decision making
game-hours: 138.3
review: So I bought this game in Christmas of '11 origionally as a gift for someone else (for the Xbox 360). He had already owned a copy and I didn't know it. As a result I took this game and gave him another one from my stash, which I believe was the newest Call of Duty (MW3?). Let me begin my actual review by stating this was my first Elder Scrolls game, and it got me so hooked that I own every game in the series and am beta testing ESO. I Love This Game. So when I got into it on the Xbox, the first thing i noticed was the possibilities of doing whatever you wanted. It hooked me with a narrowly avoided decapitation, and then the evasion of a dragon, going through Helegan Keep, and thats where the magic happened, both literally and figuratively. Haadvar gave me countless posibilities to get through just the first quest. Magic, Two handed weapons, Dual Weild, Shield and sword, bows, and even subcategories in between (Sword swings faster than warhammer, but sacrifices power). Then comes the choice between nice, enchanted robes, quick and light Light Armour, or slow but strong heavy armour. And that is just the first thirty minutes. Once you really get into the game with quests and what not, you have tons mre options. You can do short, sweet, and simple Miscelaneous Objectives, Side Quests which are a bit longer, but with a greater reward, or Main Quests, which are usually long, but add the most to your experience and give you the best loot. I could go on for hours about everything you could possibly do in this game, but the sad part is that I have hardly scratched the surface. On the 360, I have 1,271 hours, PS3 I have 767, and on the PC I have a good 312 hours (most are offline because I am rarely home lately, which is why I started PC gamming in the first place). The moral of the story is not that I have no life, just I choose to do what I love with my life, and Skyrim is just that thing.

review: The continuation of the excellent Morrowind and Oblivion, Skyrim streamlines many of the biggest complaints fans had from those games (the obtuse and painful levelling systems among them) and continues the experience of the biggest open-world fantasy RPGs ever made. Like the previous games, you're going to want to get the Unofficial Community Patches (Google it) to fix some of the more glaring issues, and the modding community is huge. Much like the previous games, Skyrim also suffers from some lack of depth; the consequences of player actions are limited in overall scope, which is unfortunate. This is similar to other bethesda games, including The Elder Scrolls and Fallout franchises. Ultimately, depth gets somewhat sacrificed for the huge scope and freedom of the game. That said, Skyrim is still an amazing experience that any fan of RPGs of any kind should strongly consider playing. The 'lack of depth' critique only holds true in comparison to other fairly linear RPGs (Deus Ex franchise, Mass Effect, Witcher, etc) and should not be taken as a negative so much as something Bethesda needs to work on going forward.

review: This was my first Elder Scrolls game. I hesitated to start it because just getting involved with it seemed like a monumental task, but I felt obligated to try it out and see what all the fuss was about. I'm very glad I did. The game is very very well done. The art is beautiful, the stories are interesting, the lore is worth exploring and the gameplay is engaging. There are many ways to play this game, and before I move on, I will have tried many of them. But because of the huge mod support that it has, ranging from simple to staggeringly complex in practically any direction you wish to take it, I will have only scratched the surface of its possibilities. I very much look forward to experiencing more of this studio's fine work in the future. Here are a few suggestions to those who wish to play the game at it's best. 1. Google the skyrim nexus and download their mod installer for the game. 2. Search the site for and install all the "unoffical patches" that you need for your level of downloaded content. This kills all the meaningful bugs that are present in the game. There are a few noticable ones that while they don't completely ruin the game experience, if you are OCD at all as I am, they will irritate you. There are some broken quests and a few other glitches that the studio never fixed and are unlikely ever to at this point, but the mod community has done it for them. 3. Don't try and do everything with a single character. The game is huge and there are hours of things to do and many decisions to make that will drag you in different directions. Making some of the decisions vastly change how the rest of the game plays out. Try and stay true to what your character would do and I think you'll really be happy you did later. 4. Try not to use cheats or game breaking mods. You're really going to hurt your game experience and butcher any challenge that the game presents. This game scales with your level so there really are ways to beat whatever you're up against at almost any level. If something is too hard, go do something else and come back to that particular challenge later after you've gotten more powerful. Enjoy folks, this is a great one.

review: Again, I haven't got as much play time on PC, but on XBOX, I have heaps (minimum 250 hrs) Become the strongest person in Skyrim, the Dragonborn, and defeat the dragon threat! The dragons have returned to Skyrim, 200 years after the Oblivion Crisis. They are stronger then ever and are out to inslave the human race again. Or, become the arch-mage of the Mages Collage, or leader of the Companions, or maybe the most feared theif in the land! Master you voice to defeat the Dragons, or help in the civil war. Decide your alliance. Either the Imperials, who fight for Skyrim to remain in the Empire, or Stromcloaks, who fight for independence from the Empire. Who ever you choose, it will be a great experience for you! Many dark secrets await you, in The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim!

review: If you're a older elder scrolls fan this game may upset you a bit,to see it be watered down and some of the best parts of the older games removed But that aside its till a amazing game,it has alot of content to play around with.

review: You are less of a gamer if you have not played Skyrim by now. 11/10 Pro's : Great graphics, beautifully detailed landscapes. Many side quests along with the main quest. Countless hours of entertainment! (I guess it is counted hours of entertainment thanks to Steam) Con's : A lot of recycled voice acting, wonky horse mounts, even wonkier dragon mounts (Dragonborn DLC) Great game, lots of fun. If you disagree and think you could do create a better game, by all means, Mod Skyrim to your hearts content, the Skyrim world is your oyster!

review: Highlight any glaring weaknesses of Skyrim difficult. Some moments, say, work and beneficial to the game, and harm. For example, the camera. First person view was the best decision in the early nineties, but now it may well be abandoned in favour of a form of a third party. Then fights probably would become more dynamic. However, without the view from the eyes you'll have nothing at The Elder Scrolls. Many fans would not accept the change. Ultimately, the only thing that matters is how the game was fun, and in this respect Skyrim is at the height. From it extremely difficult to break away: her pulsating with city life world addictive head. Bethesda once again demonstrated aerobatics, creating the game simultaneously extensive and easy to learn, conservative, and having dug.

Simply exploring the massive lands of Skyrim is fun and often rewarding, and there's bajillions of sidequests and miscillanious quests to play even after the main story line. Even though it's the fifth installment in the Elder Scrolls series, this game stands alone perfectly fine. There are some glitches, but if you save often, you shouldn't have to worry much about them

review: Just when you think you've had your fill of Skyrim, something incredible happens. You come back. I'm not talking about testing the waters as we've all done in Runescape or Guild Wars 2 or World of Warcraft. This is a more genuine feeling. It's not a toe dip for holiday events. Every few months I'll take a look at Skyrim and see something new to like. A new mod(or 4), DLC I haven't played, a better appreciation for playstyles or races I've shunned; and then once I'm there, I find new content or experience it in a completely new way. This time, the simplest of things. In Skyrim, a game seemingly half-constructed by the community playing it, one tiny tweak has revived the entire experience all over again - the removal of the HUD. That's it's wonderful draw, that's why Skyrim is timeless. There's enough here that it never feels bland, unless you want it to be. Skyrim is a game where, the more you want to enjoy it, the more option you have to and the more you *do* enjoy it. New mods that fulfill a Magestyle with a full complement of interesting effects, new weapons, more NPCs, in-game achievements that affect your character, redefined skill trees. If there was ever a game worthy of mods, it's Skyrim, and the community has put so much wonderful effort into it. But after you've gotten everything to your liking, it's the GAME that allows for all of this customizable enjoyment. The developers released the tools, and we've been off to the races ever since. Moreso than my sweetheart Payday 2, or really any experience you don't craft yourself, Skyrim will get YOUR fantasy. Immersive, modular, and plain out one of the most reliably enjoyable games ever made. Skyrim is a real winner and worthy of your shelf/library.

review: This game is great for the PC gamer because of the extensive list of mods in the workshop on steam. The game itself is great, DLC or not. If you take advantage of the Steam Workshop, and use mods, you can vastly expand your player options. I love this game. I am glad I fianlly picked it up. My first impressions of the game were that it was a medeviel version of the fallout games, and that didn't appeal to me at all. So it was a long time before I finally got it. Everyone told me they had similar impressions but were very suprised to see that wasn't the case. There are several different races you can play that alter your playing experience and character interactions. You can customise you characters looks, including dirt, warpaint, complexion, etc. There are numerous armor and weapons to make your character as unique as you like. The map is extensive and every location offers you some for on quest or interation. Unlike similar games like Fallout, once you complete the main question you just keep going, it doesn't end. You can constantly improve on your skills to get better and stronger. The homes, villages, and landscaping is beautifully designed. All of the aspects of the game are great, however you can improve and expand it tenfold through the use of Steam Workshop mods. A must have for all pc RPGers.

review: Beautiful, expansive, epic, and addictive. I litterally sat down for a summer and racked up over 400 hours and still had so much left that could be accomplished on a single character. And I played this unmodded. With the rediculous amount of mods out there, you could continue to play this game until Half-Life 3 finally comes out. Skyrim offers everything I would ever need in a game: Exploration, adventure, customization, excessive item hoarding (optional), entire weeks disappearing, replayability, and so much more. I've sunk so many hours into this game and I've enjoyed every second of it.

There is a crap ton of stuff to do in this game like makeing a house ( hearthfire DLC, a MUST), crafting weapons and armour, mining, Joining clans such as the Dark Brotherhood or the Theives Guild, killing random beasts, collecting items, getting a wife & kids, ( HF DLC), and stealing peoples . I would give this game a 9.5/10 and it would be in my top 10 games of all time list. -Connor

review: If you're looking for a way to get fired, divorced, and cut off from your family, get Skyrim. Skyrim is also proven to lose weight, just buy playing it! It's true! At least 0 out of 10 doctors have verified this statement! You'll play this game so much, you'll forget about that pesky 'outside world'. Silly things like hygiene, bills, responsibilities, all this garbage goes away when you're playing this magnificent work of art and storytelling. The amazing amount of time and love that went in to developing this game is obvious in everything that you will do. This is not your average 'on rails' POS, it's genuinely an experience. it's a rare game that doesn't force you to play any one style, but instead, it lets you choose and rewards you for your unique vision. You can go sword & board, all magic, archery, two-handed hammers, combinations of, and more. Tired of trying to find the perfect weapon? Craft it yourself. Wish it had fire damage? Enchant it. Want to call someplace home? Build it. Need a family for said home? Get married and/or adopt kids. Slay dragons or tame them. See amazing landscapes that defy words. Experience a story where your decisions will shape the continent. There's so much waiting for you, come be a part of it!

review: Everything said about the game is true: Skyrim just purely rocks. You have finally a game that lets you live your character's life and he or she can become anything you ever wanted. A warrior forging his own weapons and armor carving a path of pure destruction? Done. An elven ranger of sleight figure and insane bowskills complete with animal companion and the ability to heal herself along the way? Done that one too. The scholarly spellcaster with flowing robes, devastating magic but kind and compassionate? Done even druids who turn into werewolves at a full moon and are attuned to the world of Nature - you're only limited by one thing: you. If she has a fault it's that there aren't enough hours in a day to put into Skyrim and yet with the sheer nuts amount of talented modders out there you're never short of something to do. Research a new potion, make a new armor.... even get married! Always something going on in Tamriel and always something you can find to occupy yourself with when looking for time to kill in this thing we call a 'real' world hehe.

review: The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim has taken away DAYS of my life. With so many characters to interact with, and most of them giving quests, the game is hard to get bored of. The province of Skyrim is a vast land waiting for you to explore every last corner, find every last septim, and kill every last dragon. As a role playing game it is fantastic, with a major questline for each player to purchase it. For example, if you want to be a hero then join either the Companions or the College of Winterhold, but it doesn't stop there, if you want to use combat join the Companions. For magic, join the College. You also have the standard 10 Elder Scrolls races (Argonian, Altmer, Breton, Dunmer, Imperial, Khajiit, Nord, Orc, Redguard, and Bosmer) that each have different starting stats and abilities. The combat in Skyrim isn't the best. The weapons are varied and can fit different playing styles, but when you hit something it just seems like you're wacking something with a sword until it falls over and dies. You can't tell that your even hurting it without it's health bar, but it's not the worst combat. Finally, the story. For me, the story was definitely NOT the best part of the game. It was pretty simple, basically you're the "chosen one" and you go on an adventure where more people tell you that you're the chosen one, and then for some reason you need to find an Elder Scroll, and then more boring stuff. This was why I stayed away from the main questline. Overall Skyrim is fantastic and definitely is worth your time. I give it a 4.7/5

review: I played Skyrim for a few days solid. Then not much after that. Skyrim, I feel, suffers from the sheer AMOUNT of stuff to do which kind of ends up being fetch quests. Too many quests and too many places to go for too petty of an objective. Skyrim's greatest strength is also it's greatest weakness. It's so huge and there's so much to do, there's nothing to do.

review: This is the game the never, ever ends. I picked this game up thinking I wouldn't like it having never played a previous TES game before. Sat in my Library untouched for about a month or two, and finally took the plunge. I was wrong. I was so very, very wrong. This is probably the best purchase I've ever made on steam. Add in the unlimited potential of modding, and it's an adventure that continues forever. I've probably restarted over a hundred times by now with a new character, and still only have beaten Alduin once. ONCE. There's still so much more do to and explore that I'm still discovering quests and areas and little hidden things. I still can't believe how much there is to do and I'm still finding more. At it stands I'll probably wake up one day having lost all touch with reality and actually start seeing the world as Skyrim with how much I've played. And I'm totally ok with that.

review: If I had to choose between this game, and my girlfriend. I'd pick this game. EDIT: I'm single now ON A MORE SERIOUS NOTE: This game is the best in its genre. In previous Bethesda games they made a sad balance in between Questing, and Exploration. Some having more quests and less places to go, and others having very few quests and more places to explore. But in Skyrim, there is no shortage of quests, and if you are like myself and just wander around aimlessly, you will stumble into places that just blow your mind. Every time I have replayed this game, I stumbled into something new. For more info i'd very much recommend mods, with mods such as texture packs, difficulty, quests, armor, and weapons, this games replay value is endless. Go through the game once with plain skyrim, then mod the hell out of it. Overall I'd rate this game an EASY 10/10. If you haven't already. Please buy it, give it a little, and I swear you will be hooked.

The Elder Scrolls series has a large following and often you will hear people argue over each new TES game comparing it to the last, but for me each TES game stands on its own merits, and Skyrim is no exception. The story is pretty good and there are plenty of side quests, but what makes Skyrim so great even when not modded is its large and open nature. This is a land you can just pick a direction and with no quest in mind and just explore. You will find danger and excitement on your journey ... and loot. Lots and lots of loot. But once you start modding this game, that is when you unlock the true value that is Skyrim. Potentially thousands more hours content (for free) in a game that can be improved ten thousand different ways from graphics, textures and sounds all the way to game mechanics and user interface changes. You can make the game exactly what you need it to be, and play it for so long you may still be playing when the next game in this series comes out.... and sometimes longer than even that. If you are interested in modding the PC version of the game, be sure to check out my guide for beginners:

review: I was stacking books on a shelf in my house in Whiterun, one of Skyrim's major cities, when I noticed a weapon rack right beside it. I set a sacrificial dagger in one slot, an Orcish mace in the other. They were on display for nobody but me and my computer-controlled housecarl, Lydia, who sat at a table patiently waiting for me to ask her to go questing. The chest upstairs was reserved for excess weapons and armor, the bedside table for smithing ingots and ores, the one next to the Alchemy table for ingredients. I'd meticulously organized my owned virtual property not because I had to, but because tending to the minutia of domestic life is a comforting break from dealing with screaming frost trolls, dragons, a civil war, and job assignments that never seem to go as planned. It's even a sensible thing to do; a seemingly natural component of every day existence in Skyrim, one of the most fully-realized, easily enjoyable, and utterly engrossing role-playing games ever made. Part of what makes it so enjoyable has to do with how legacy Elder Scrolls clutter has been condensed and in some cases eliminated. In Skyrim, there's no more moon-hopping between hilltops with a maxed out Acrobatics skill. That's gone, so is Athletics. The Elder Scrolls V pares down the amount of skills and cuts out attributes like Endurance and Intelligence altogether. There's no time wasted on the character creation screen agonizing over which skills to assign as major. You don't assign major and minor skills at all, but instead pick one of ten races, each with a specific bonus. High Elves can once a day regenerate magicka quickly, Orcs can enter a berserk rage for more effective close-range combat. These abilities are best paired with certain character builds  the High Elf regeneration is useful for a magic user  but don't represent a rigid class choice. Major decisions don't need to be made until you're already out in the world and can try out magic, sneaking and weapon combat, emphasizing first-hand experience over instruction manual study, letting you specialize only when you're ready. It contributes to the thrilling sense of freedom associated with life in Skyrim. Do a quest, kill a dragon, snatch torchbugs from the air, munch on butterfly wings or simply wander while listening to one of the best game soundtracks in recent memory. Despite the enormity of the world and the colossal amount of content contained within, little feels random and useless. Even chewing on a butterfly wing has purpose, as it reveals one of several alchemical parameters later useful in potion making at an alchemy table. Mined ore and scraps of metal from Dwemer ruins can be smelted into ingots and fashioned into armor sets, pelts lifted from slain wildlife can be turned into leather armor sets, and random books plucked from ancient ruins can trigger hidden quest lines that lead to valuable rewards. Skyrim's land mass is absolutely stuffed with content and curiosities, making every step you take, even if it's through what seems like total wilderness, an exciting one, as something unexpected often lies just over the next ridge. Many times the unexpected takes the form of a dragon. Sometimes they're purposefully placed to guard relics, sometimes they swoop over cities and attack at seemingly random times. In the middle of a fight against a camp of bandits a dragon might strike, screaming through the sky and searing foe and friendly alike with frost or flame. Momentarily all on the battlefield unite, directing arrows and magic blasts upward to knock down the creature, creating impromptu moments of camaraderie -- a surprising change from what may have been yet another by-the-numbers bandit camp sweep. Dragons show up often, their presence announced by an ominous flap of broad wings or an otherworldly scream from high above. The scale and startling detail built into each creature's appearance and animations as it circles, stops to attack, circles again and slams to the ground makes encounters thrilling, though their predictable attack patterns lessen the excitement after a few battles. In the long run they're far less irritating than the Oblivion gate equivalent from The Elder Scrolls IV, can be completed in a few minutes, and always offer a useful reward. Killing a dragon yields a soul, which powers Skyrim's new Shout system. These are magical abilities any character can use, you don't have to specialize in spell casting to slow time, throw your voice, change the weather, call in allies, blast out ice and fire, or knock back enemies with a rolling wave of pure force. Even if you favor sword, shield and heavy armor and ignore magic entirely, you'll still be able to take full advantage of these abilities provided you find the proper words  each Shout has three  hidden on Skyrim's high snowy peaks and in the depths of forgotten dungeons, serving as another reason to continue exploring long after you've exhausted the main quest story, joined with the Thieves Guild, fought alongside the Dark Brotherhood, or thrown your support behind one of the factions vying for control of Skyrim. Not only is this land under assault by dragons, long thought to be dead, it's also ripped in two by civil war. You can choose one side or the other, but so much of the allure of Skyrim is how, even outside of the confines of quest lines, the embattled state of the world is evident, and steeped in a rich fictional legacy. Lord of the Rings this is not, but with the release of every Elder Scrolls game, the fiction becomes denser, and the cross-referencing for long-time fans all the more rewarding. Skyrim's residents are all aware of current events. They'll comment on the civil war, some sympathizing with the rebels, others thinking the establishment sold its soul. The peasants complain about the Jarls who control each settlement, the Jarls complain about the rebels or foreign policy, the overprotective College librarian complains when I drop dragon scales all over his floor; many characters feel like whole, distinct personalities instead of vacuous nothings that hand out quests like a downtown greeter hands out flyers for discount jeans. Characters stereotype based on race, they double-cross at even the slightest hint it might be profitable, and they react to your evolving stature within the world. It makes a ridiculous realm, filled with computer-controlled cat people and humanoid reptiles, demon gods and dragons, feel authentic, like a world that existed long before you showed up and will continue to exist long after you leave.

review: I love all Elderscrolls. Skyrim is my favorite due to capabilities; however, if I could swap timelines from the release of Oblivion and Skyrim I would be a very happy man. The most engrossing quest line is definitely the Thieves Guild line. It is the only arc in which I am motivated to complete a certain number of radiant quests. While most other arcs are fun, I just wanted more from them. The main quest line is fun, though who really plays the main questy line in Elder Scrolls? In all, I love this game and I will continue to play probably until Elderscrolls Online releases, then I will more than likely never see it again...I'm sure all previous Elderscroll games will be more or less obsolete regardless.
