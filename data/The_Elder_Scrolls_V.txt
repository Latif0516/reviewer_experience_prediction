review: This is the game the never, ever ends. I picked this game up thinking I wouldn't like it having never played a previous TES game before. Sat in my Library untouched for about a month or two, and finally took the plunge. I was wrong. I was so very, very wrong. This is probably the best purchase I've ever made on steam. Add in the unlimited potential of modding, and it's an adventure that continues forever. I've probably restarted over a hundred times by now with a new character, and still only have beaten Alduin once. ONCE. There's still so much more do to and explore that I'm still discovering quests and areas and little hidden things. I still can't believe how much there is to do and I'm still finding more. At it stands I'll probably wake up one day having lost all touch with reality and actually start seeing the world as Skyrim with how much I've played. And I'm totally ok with that.

review: If I had to choose between this game, and my girlfriend. I'd pick this game. EDIT: I'm single now ON A MORE SERIOUS NOTE: This game is the best in its genre. In previous Bethesda games they made a sad balance in between Questing, and Exploration. Some having more quests and less places to go, and others having very few quests and more places to explore. But in Skyrim, there is no shortage of quests, and if you are like myself and just wander around aimlessly, you will stumble into places that just blow your mind. Every time I have replayed this game, I stumbled into something new. For more info i'd very much recommend mods, with mods such as texture packs, difficulty, quests, armor, and weapons, this games replay value is endless. Go through the game once with plain skyrim, then mod the hell out of it. Overall I'd rate this game an EASY 10/10. If you haven't already. Please buy it, give it a little, and I swear you will be hooked.

review: An epic game made all the more epic by the fact that it is so easy to mod and so well supported by the modding community. The Elder Scrolls series has a large following and often you will hear people argue over each new TES game comparing it to the last, but for me each TES game stands on its own merits, and Skyrim is no exception. The story is pretty good and there are plenty of side quests, but what makes Skyrim so great even when not modded is its large and open nature. This is a land you can just pick a direction and with no quest in mind and just explore. You will find danger and excitement on your journey ... and loot. Lots and lots of loot. But once you start modding this game, that is when you unlock the true value that is Skyrim. Potentially thousands more hours content (for free) in a game that can be improved ten thousand different ways from graphics, textures and sounds all the way to game mechanics and user interface changes. You can make the game exactly what you need it to be, and play it for so long you may still be playing when the next game in this series comes out.... and sometimes longer than even that. If you are interested in modding the PC version of the game, be sure to check out my guide for beginners:

review: I was stacking books on a shelf in my house in Whiterun, one of Skyrim's major cities, when I noticed a weapon rack right beside it. I set a sacrificial dagger in one slot, an Orcish mace in the other. They were on display for nobody but me and my computer-controlled housecarl, Lydia, who sat at a table patiently waiting for me to ask her to go questing. The chest upstairs was reserved for excess weapons and armor, the bedside table for smithing ingots and ores, the one next to the Alchemy table for ingredients. I'd meticulously organized my owned virtual property not because I had to, but because tending to the minutia of domestic life is a comforting break from dealing with screaming frost trolls, dragons, a civil war, and job assignments that never seem to go as planned. It's even a sensible thing to do; a seemingly natural component of every day existence in Skyrim, one of the most fully-realized, easily enjoyable, and utterly engrossing role-playing games ever made. Part of what makes it so enjoyable has to do with how legacy Elder Scrolls clutter has been condensed and in some cases eliminated. In Skyrim, there's no more moon-hopping between hilltops with a maxed out Acrobatics skill. That's gone, so is Athletics. The Elder Scrolls V pares down the amount of skills and cuts out attributes like Endurance and Intelligence altogether. There's no time wasted on the character creation screen agonizing over which skills to assign as major. You don't assign major and minor skills at all, but instead pick one of ten races, each with a specific bonus. High Elves can once a day regenerate magicka quickly, Orcs can enter a berserk rage for more effective close-range combat. These abilities are best paired with certain character builds  the High Elf regeneration is useful for a magic user  but don't represent a rigid class choice. Major decisions don't need to be made until you're already out in the world and can try out magic, sneaking and weapon combat, emphasizing first-hand experience over instruction manual study, letting you specialize only when you're ready. It contributes to the thrilling sense of freedom associated with life in Skyrim. Do a quest, kill a dragon, snatch torchbugs from the air, munch on butterfly wings or simply wander while listening to one of the best game soundtracks in recent memory. Despite the enormity of the world and the colossal amount of content contained within, little feels random and useless. Even chewing on a butterfly wing has purpose, as it reveals one of several alchemical parameters later useful in potion making at an alchemy table. Mined ore and scraps of metal from Dwemer ruins can be smelted into ingots and fashioned into armor sets, pelts lifted from slain wildlife can be turned into leather armor sets, and random books plucked from ancient ruins can trigger hidden quest lines that lead to valuable rewards. Skyrim's land mass is absolutely stuffed with content and curiosities, making every step you take, even if it's through what seems like total wilderness, an exciting one, as something unexpected often lies just over the next ridge. Many times the unexpected takes the form of a dragon. Sometimes they're purposefully placed to guard relics, sometimes they swoop over cities and attack at seemingly random times. In the middle of a fight against a camp of bandits a dragon might strike, screaming through the sky and searing foe and friendly alike with frost or flame. Momentarily all on the battlefield unite, directing arrows and magic blasts upward to knock down the creature, creating impromptu moments of camaraderie -- a surprising change from what may have been yet another by-the-numbers bandit camp sweep. Dragons show up often, their presence announced by an ominous flap of broad wings or an otherworldly scream from high above. The scale and startling detail built into each creature's appearance and animations as it circles, stops to attack, circles again and slams to the ground makes encounters thrilling, though their predictable attack patterns lessen the excitement after a few battles. In the long run they're far less irritating than the Oblivion gate equivalent from The Elder Scrolls IV, can be completed in a few minutes, and always offer a useful reward. Killing a dragon yields a soul, which powers Skyrim's new Shout system. These are magical abilities any character can use, you don't have to specialize in spell casting to slow time, throw your voice, change the weather, call in allies, blast out ice and fire, or knock back enemies with a rolling wave of pure force. Even if you favor sword, shield and heavy armor and ignore magic entirely, you'll still be able to take full advantage of these abilities provided you find the proper words  each Shout has three  hidden on Skyrim's high snowy peaks and in the depths of forgotten dungeons, serving as another reason to continue exploring long after you've exhausted the main quest story, joined with the Thieves Guild, fought alongside the Dark Brotherhood, or thrown your support behind one of the factions vying for control of Skyrim. Not only is this land under assault by dragons, long thought to be dead, it's also ripped in two by civil war. You can choose one side or the other, but so much of the allure of Skyrim is how, even outside of the confines of quest lines, the embattled state of the world is evident, and steeped in a rich fictional legacy. Lord of the Rings this is not, but with the release of every Elder Scrolls game, the fiction becomes denser, and the cross-referencing for long-time fans all the more rewarding. Skyrim's residents are all aware of current events. They'll comment on the civil war, some sympathizing with the rebels, others thinking the establishment sold its soul. The peasants complain about the Jarls who control each settlement, the Jarls complain about the rebels or foreign policy, the overprotective College librarian complains when I drop dragon scales all over his floor; many characters feel like whole, distinct personalities instead of vacuous nothings that hand out quests like a downtown greeter hands out flyers for discount jeans. Characters stereotype based on race, they double-cross at even the slightest hint it might be profitable, and they react to your evolving stature within the world. It makes a ridiculous realm, filled with computer-controlled cat people and humanoid reptiles, demon gods and dragons, feel authentic, like a world that existed long before you showed up and will continue to exist long after you leave.

review: Okay, where do I start? General: This game is able to shock you and make you laugh time and time again, even when playing it for the 3'rd time. It takes about 130 - 200 hours of playtime to finish all of the quests, and I guarantee that in the time you will not discover everything there is to discover. If you do not feel like questing, take some time mining, scaring people with magic and shouts, undressing them, stealing, stealthing, killing dragons or giants, throwing cabbages around or simply reading 1 of about 250 integrated ingame books and stories. Graphics: This game has pulled off something I have thought to be impossible and pushed the whole gaming industry to the new levels. It has successfully integrated superb graphics into a lot of content. World is beautiful, vast and full of variety and although a bit dark by default this can very easily be changed by just picking one mod from the workshop. Workshop: Why does this deserve a special tab? Because thanks to workshop, earlier mentioned 200 hours of gameplay easily turn into thousands of hours of gameplay. Don't like any part of the game? Change it! Modify it! Add to it! A huge amount of mods are being made every day, and whether they spawn an extra cupcake in your house or add new cities with their own storylines they will all change your experience and prolong the fun. Name what you want to do, it exists. ALL OF IT. Cons: - Few possible glitches, but all have their fix, just need to be googled out. - A bit too confusing and overwhelming at the start. A lot of unanswered questions may put you off the game. This happened to me on the first two attempts to play the game. I ended up going to the first town, becoming a woodcutter, killing a chicken and getting chased by the guards. But once you push on, you will be nothing but glad you did. Who am I even writing this for? Is there any poor soul out there who has not yet played this game? BUY IT. NOW. Please?

review: The province of Skyrim might be frigid, but the role-playing game that takes place within it burns with a fire few games possess. Yes, Skyrim is another enormous fantasy RPG from a developer that specializes in them, and it could suck up hundreds of hours of your time as you inspect each nook and crevasse for the secrets to be found within. The game returns you to the continent of Tamriel, where you explore the northern realm called Skyrim, home to the Nord race. In these northern regions, snow flurries cloud your view, and platforms of ice float on the chilled waters. Nighttime often brings Tamriel's version of the aurora borealis, with its gorgeous blue and green ribbons stretching across the heavens. Skyrim's predecessor, Oblivion, featured prototypical fantasy environments-pretty but not quite evocative of the lore's darker undercurrents. Skyrim embraces its darker elements. You might feel an eerie chill as you glimpse a half-sunken ship through the mist, or watch as a dragon comes to life before your very eyes under the swirling firmament. Closer inspection reveals hard edges, plain painted-on textures, and other visual flaws that are conspicuous should you seek them out. But like many enormous games, Skyrim makes a fantastic impression not because its individual elements are sharply honed, but because they contribute to a grander whole. There's so much to do that your quest log becomes an embarrassment of pleasures, offering dozens of choices at any given time, each one as enticing as the next.It's impressive enough that there's so much to do; it's even more impressive that most of it is wonderful. Not every dungeon is a joy to explore. Stone-turning puzzles occasionally bring the fun to a halt, and a few repeated cave designs could dampen your spirits. But overall, every task has an excellent sense of context, and surprises lurk around many a turn. Skyrim also uses scattered books and references to enthrall you. You may not be a big fan of reading books in role-playing games, but even so, you should make an effort here.The combat in Skyrim is the tightest Elder Scrolls combat yet, the visual and audio cues normally providing proper feedback with your blows and zaps.Some death blows result in Fallout 3-style slow-motion kills, which retain their power because they're not overly frequent. Movement, too, has seen improvement: you can now play from a third-person view and feel like you're moving across the land instead of floating above it. All in all, Skyrim has some minor issues but as a whole is a brilliant RPG.

The game has one of the largest active modding communities of any game. This helps to spice up gameplay and graphics. With new residents, new weapons and armor, incredible house mods adding giant castles, and visual mods. You can spend hours upon hours finding mods that suit your needs in the nordic lands of Skyrim. It is worth to note that you should know the game to an extent before modding, as it can corrupt save files if not done properly. If I'd have to rate it, it would be a 10/10.

review: This is one of the best adventures you can play: long and storyrich main quest with huge amount of sidequests to venture through! With the official Dragonborn, Dawnguard and Heartfire dlcs there's tons of places to see and enormous amount of quests to complete. If you somehow run out of stuff to find then there's the modding possibility. SO MANY mods are out there (Steam Workshop, Skyrim Nexus...) to give you more quests, items and whatever. With all the mods it's pretty much endless adventure waiting for you as Dragonborn. The best ability of course is shouting at everything you see. It's pretty funny to make people fly away when you feel upset about someone stealing your sweetroll... Some caves and especially Dwarven ruins tend to be pretty boring to go to after some time since they are pretty long (Dwarven ruins) and linear (just killing tons of same enemies to find something/somebody or to get somewhere) but other than that it's a beautiful and rich game in so many ways that there is no reason why you shouldn't give it a try! Btw never attack chickens... those s seem to be pretty valuable in Skyrim since everyone is willing to kill you if you harm them.

review: A game that is complicated to critique. For the first 30-50 hours, you will be completely absorbed in the beautiful and vast world, with seemingly endless opportunities for exploration and questing. As you continue to play, the cracks start to show. The gameplay systems are incredibly shallow, the characters wooden, the world still beautiful but the dungeons copy/pasted 120 times over with the same enemies, the same meaningless loot. The complication arises when you realize that while you are slowly starting to loathe the game, you've had 30+ hours of fun before hitting that point. So the question is, was it worth it?

The game will just suck you in. It has LOADS of contents that will keep you busy for 100+ hours for sure. And mods are just icing on the cake; if you're a graphics-hungry person, mods can make this game look better than most "next-gen" games out there, if modded correctly. And the sceneries, oh the sceneries, I just feel like sitting on my chair and just keep staring at those vast fields of beautiufl grasslands. Totally recommend this game. 15/10. BUT, but, one and only con that I found is of the fighting mechanics; it is just so bland. Nothing else I dislike about this game.

With mods installed prepare to stay up until 3:00 am in the morning while playing this game oh and i mean from 7:00 am to 3:00 by the way, you will literally lose hours just by having fun with the fantastic and active modding community for this game. Now for everything else, The landscape of Skyrim is extremely beautiful, you will get lost in hours and hours of content. More so with the vast dungeons dotting the land. While Elder Scrolls Oblivion had this fantasy artistic style going on with the landscape which is breathtaking within it's own right. Skyrim has this hostile, cold and harsh environment going on. Exatcly how it is described. The quests in this game are extremely well done, more so with quests that don't really start right off the bat until you read a book or hear a rumor, which will keep the player more invested within the game. Also with the AI system implemented in this game, your actions changes how the world views your character with every good deed you do to every bad deed you do. Quest mods also make it more fun and more investing. The skills system aren't exactly as perfect as Elder Scrolls Oblivion. Within that game, whatever class you pick, it will either make the investment into that class fun or not, but either way you will lose hours just getting your characters skills up as you go along within that game. In Skyrim, the skills system are dotted out into three sections, Mage, Warrior, and Rogue, whatever skills you pick it will either help combat scenarios easier or not. Even more so if you choose to go with a thief build. The mage system in this game is pretty badass but not as more through like in Oblivon. But with mods installed it will make these three aspects much more fun to play and make the skill system much more tedious rather than a clean sweep. The Combat system in this game is clunky, it's your typical Elder Scrolls game. If an enemy lungs at you, you block, if you want to gain the advantage against a large stack of bandits or whatever, use a bow. If you want a 'clean sweep' use magic. Here is where modding comes into play once again. Thanks to these overhaul mods the combat system feels more alive and more challenging, with every minute maybe your last. The NPCs in this game while that voice reptition is there, the NPCs of this vast world stand out more than the Oblivion counterparts, each one has a selective schedule and "job" they also have their own "situation" to make these characters either more interesting or more annoying depending upon your point of view. The muscical score makes you want to just to sit back and listen to it. While some people will say "it's recycled music over and over again" There are mods to make the muscial score more diverse and interesting with every combat situation and with every town and city, and dungeon you explore. The DLC are also great in there own right, With Dawnguard, it's your typical light and darkness story. But here you will not only lose more hours into this game, but you will gain new shouts, equipment and companions, and also player homes. With hearthfire it's an add-on, it will just add housecarls and three new houses to the world. If you like that sort of thing. Lastly with Dragonborn, you will explore a very familiar place with a "good" storyline, like with Dawnguard, new quests, new equipment, and new player homes, and new companions. basically Dawnguard and Dragonborn you will get "new" I highly recommend modding this game. In it's original state, again it feels lifeless and dull, even if you lose 1000+ hours into Skyrim. With mods enabled you will enjoy replaying the game over and over again. I seriously recommend this game.

review: I love it, it gave me 2 years of fun, I played every playstyle, every race, every way, every DLC. I been from a straight up heavy armor warrior with a huge battleaxe that can turn into a werewolf, and could stand still taking every hit from a dragon without losing almost any health. To a master thief who isn't very strong but can sneak through a entire bandit camp without being seen once.. All the way to guy who never killed a soul, worked hard for his money chopping wood. Managing to build his own house and have a family. The main story with all the guilds you can join and areas to explore, you won't be bored for a long time. So don't just rush the main story and assume you seen it all. Out of the DLC's, the best would be Dragonborn. It offers a large new world, enemies, quests, armors and weapons. While the Dawnguard only offers a bit and a vampire lord form, and Hearthfire just lets you adopt kids and build homes. The worst thing about it, is there will be bugs, which can easily be fixed by console commands. But only use if needed, like after 5 retrys a quest won't finish or continue. 8/10 Only because it can get far too easy, and the bugs. You get stronger than all the enemies too quickly. So I say when you learn the game better, go on Master or Legendary difficulty for a challenge.

review: Skyrim is undoubtedly the best purchase I have made in the past year. It's worth every $ that it's listed at especially when considering the insane amount of content you are given. I have only spent about 100 hours in the game (this is short in comparison to a lot of people on my friends list) but I can assure you that those hours were all packed with immersive content. Here are some key features that hooked me into the game.. 1. Dungeon Complexity - When I say complexity, I mean that the design for the game's dungeons vary greatly from simple to complex. You just have to keep exploring and you'll eventually run into the intricately designed areas that get you to pause for a moment and think before being able to progress. At times.. I ALMOST felt as if I were playing the latest Tomb Raider once again. I also found it quite neat that you could use your shouts to bypass/solve a few of the puzzles. 2. Playstyle Freedom - I'm sure tht a lot of people take similar routes but the game does offer a great deal of freedom with its perk system. It's definitely a step up compared to games like Kingdoms of Amalur. Do you enjoy melee combat? How about magic? How about a balance of both? There's a lot of possibilities. 3. Expansive Lore - As I've mentioned, the game has a ton of content. Playing through everything (especially if you are aiming for complete achievements), gives you perspective on the whole story and it really is interesting when some quest's lore ties into another - maybe even forming a bigger picture. Skyrim definitely has a lot more charming qualities but these are the features that I really wanted to highlight. They stood out for me and it was for these reasons that I ended up buying the game last year (only to play it now - 2014) during the summer sale. With that said, I paid $30 for the legendary edition. Wouldn't you agree that for all this content, it was pretty much a steal? How many games can you list down that provide hundreds, nearly thousands of hours worth of content (especially if you count the mods) for that kind of price. Just remember, multiplayer games don't count! 10/10. Buy it when it goes on sale during this upcoming summer sale event.

review: Skyrim is one of my favorite games of all time, this game is pure art, the role play is great if you are a nerd like me, however if you don't plan on role playing and you just want to play an amazing game then you can unlike other titles like fallout this game does not punish you and it is not a very hard game, i played it in master for most of my stay in the land of skyrim. This game is the kind of type game where it is not about the end its all about the journey. I have played a lot of rpgs in my day, and in most the quests have been bland and the main idea was to explore however this game can be both the quests are great, the story is great the map is amazing, Yeah there may not be as many random encounters like fallout, however when exploring you will allways find something new, and as we are pc master race we also get the privlage of mods that add alot more to the game which is amazing, i mainly enjoyed some of the modded quests, and horror quests. If you dont have this game by now f*cking buy it jez 10/10

review: This game truly deserves the title of "near perfection", being one of those rare milestones that comes every so often in years of gaming. Skyrim itself, is probably the best release from Bethesda's Elder Scrolls series. Story wise, this is one of the most developed storyline from the series, giving much enjoyment overall. In all honesty, we can say that the community is one of the most desirable aspect of Skyrim, due to their dedication in further releases of modifications - improving much of the overall gameplay (it never hurts to crank up those graphics). It would be a pity to not try Skyrim in the course of your lifetime, so it's advisable to go ahead and try it!

review: There are many reasons why we play games. Some play games to experience a story, some play to compete with others and some play to have experiences they have never had otherwise in real life. Alot play games to escape into another world, and live completely different lives, and this is what drives Bethesdas Elder Scrolls series, a series that has excelled in creating complete virtual worlds, inviting the player to live parallel lives. Skyrim is the latest world offered by Bethesda to live in, and it seems like its Bethesdas finest accomplishment yet. Similarly to the two Elder Scrolls games before it, you start off as a prisoner, and this case you are on your way to be executed. Just before the axe greets your neck, a dragon appears and the entire army base you were in goes into disarray. You are set free after the incident, and it is up to you to find out why are the dragons appearing, and what is your role in the whole ordeal (hint: it rhymes with Shmagonborn). Bethesda displays such dedication to concept of open world that makes other open world games pale in comparison. Skyrim isnt just a series of buildings, environments and NPCs, it is the closest there is to virtual living world in a game. The sense of freedom found in Elder Scrolls is unparalleled, and Skyrim is the best implementation of this yet. The main quest is a minimal part of the game, and most of the fun comes from exploring the world built for you. As you go exploring dungeons, assisting NPCs with their problems, joining factions and reading ingame books, you realize what a dense world Skyrim is. It is compelling to learn more about Skyrim, about its citizens and about its politics, and the more you learn about, the more you are invested in the well being of the world. Through all the running around and exploring, you come across a wide range of missions to complete. The main mission is, as usual, the most interesting one, but the rest of the missions can be worthy, and they are necessary to help you know more about the world. You can complete missions for The Companions (Skyrims equivalent of the Fighters Guild) to understand how ingrained the warrior culture is in Skyrim, or join the Mages College and be looked down upon by Nords who believe that magic is for sissies. Even miscellaneous missions, such as simply standing up for a Dark Elf against a bunch of racist Nords can be satisfying. Standard fetch quests are to be found here and there, but there are far from being the norm. The games graphics have been talked about endlessly. Now, Skyrims graphics are great, with detailed textures and wonderful environments. Yet it terms of detail, they dont hold a candle to games like Rage and Battlefield 3. Yet Skyrim is nicer to look at than the aforementioned games, and that is because of Skyrims aesthetics. Bethesda knows that when it comes to graphics, art direction trumps fidelity, and in Skryim, the beauty of the world comes from its style. Part of the reason Morrowind is generally viewed as a much better game than Oblivion is because of its fantastical designs; while Oblivion came off as a standard European fantasy setting, Morrowind was a truly outlandish and exotic location that had its own unique identity. Skyrim returns with the art direction that made Morrowind so unique. While the location might not be as exotic as Morrowind, Skyrim it is exactly the blistering norse region that you would think is occupied by burly, war-faring people. The buidlings, the environments, the apparel, the weapons, the creatures, and even the music all give Skyrim its unique identity, an identity that is inspired by real-life Scandinavia, but is in no way identical to it. ~~~~~~~~~~~~ The combat, which is one of the weaker aspects in previous Elder Scrolls, is drastically improved here. While there is still the feeling that you are hacking away at empty spaces instead of making a real impact on your enemy, but its not as bad as it was in previous games. The biggest addition to the combat system is the double wielding, and it works great. You can go for a sword in each hand, a sword and spell, or two spells, one in each hand. I personally went sword and staff, Gandalf style. There is also a favorite menu for items, a feature that pauses makes it easier to equip items in game. This is designed to save you the hassle of going to the main item screen during the game, but it also gives a tactical quality to the combat, since the menu pauses the game and allows for quick equipment changes, which is helpful especially when fighting dragons. Dragons appear as random encounters throughout the game, and they are just as imposing as one would imagine dragons to be. You will die alot fighting them, and you would have to rely on myriad of tactics to fight them. A few hacks there, retreat to heal yourself, attack with destruction magic while the dragon is airborne, retreat again, and so on. Killing a dragon is immensely satisfying, and through killing dragons do you acquire new shouts. Shouts are another new combat feature; they are words in the dragon language which, when you say them, unleashes different attacks on your enemies, or gives you new powers. Shouts are a welcome addition to the games combat system, and further adds to the combats tactical quality. Now this is a Bethesda game, which means that bugs are abound. I have experienced a few unresponsive actions from NPCs, same crashes, and an axe suspended in midair. However, this is an area I cant criticize Bethesda much about. In a game of this size and scope, it is virtually impossible to spot all the bugs before release. To their credit, Bethesda is quick to releases patches that fix whatever issues gamers may have. We can also count on the mod community to tweek all the inconveniences out of the game. Bugs are abundant in the game, and players will experience at least one in every playthrough, yet for the most part, these bugs are miniscule and far from game breaking. Skyrim is like a music album that has a few tracks that you arent particularly fond of, but rest of the music is pure aural blliss that you cant help but think of the album as close to perfection as possible. I cant point to a single part of the game and say that is the best part; the entire game is an experience. It stays firmly rooted in Elder Scrolls gameplay, yet with enough improvements and additions (and subtractions) to make Skyrim stand on its own. After experiencing the vast, dense and incredibly detailed world of Skyrim, you cant help but snicker whenever another game is referred to as open world. Good: Vast yet incredibly detailed world, Incredible Depth, Interesting Story, Improved Combat System, Gorgeous Graphics and wonderful style Bad: Buggy, some standard 'fetch' missions Price: AED 9.5/10

review: This is one of the best games I have played in my lifetime. And no, I'm not 11 years old... :p Add 40 years to that. Yes, 51. My life is extremely busy and video games have always been my number one activity to leave the standard world. The Elder Scrolls series of games has been one of the best sources of fun I have found and Skyrim is simply the best one of the series by far! Do download the DLC (Downloadable contents) right away as the latest DLC (Dragonborn) includes very potent aspects to the game as the ability to receive TWO perk points when reading ability books! BUT! Yes, there's a but. The game is so vast that there are some bugs... You need to play this with the Elder Scrolls Wiki

review: opened in a browser (ideally in a separate monitor) when playing to see the various issues with each quests or dungeons (like how not to completely mess up the "Blood on the Ice" quest so you can get to finally buy the somptuous Hjerim house in Windhelm). BUT number 2. Yes, there is another issue. You may SERIOUSLY consider adding a few "mods" to your game since they may fix some of the "bugs" mentioned. For exemple : adding the Dawnguard DLC will make Vampires appear and KILL potentially VITAL characters depending on the sort of build your are trying to achieve for your character! Geeez. You would think they would have thought of a way to hold these attacks until you start the quest? NO they didn't! But.... There's a "mod" that actually does this for you : preventing ALL vampire attacks (which may KILL city vendors and other characters) until you actually start the quest! Yep, this means, sorry lad, but you REALLY should take a stroll around the modding area, easily accessible in Steam by clicking the Workshop button under your PLAY button in the Games Library (once you've selected Skyrim). There are a few really cool mods I like apart from this one. One is called Run for your lives! And also makes all villagers run inside when there's a DRAGON attack. Again, preventing important characters from simply being wiped out before you get a chance to kill them yourself! :p Apart from that, the game is just insanely good... I have played it from beginning to end many times and still discover new things. :)

review: can steal from a merchant, then sell it back to him. 10/10 now on a serious note. skyrim is best value of your money that you will get in any game EVER. reasons is are mods. quest mods, graphic mods, weapons, npc, new spells, voice, animation, you name it theres a mod for it and will add to the game. there are several, hundreds of quest mods that add hours of extra gameplay and even new areas and dungeons. combat in this game is great. amazing if so. you will never find a fps game with sword, magic or bow as great as this. if first person isnt your style you can easily go to third person. ENB and graphic mods change the game completely to make it look like an entire different game that make it look like its a brand new game. i highly recomend this game with the dlc as they add new variety of items and new mechanics that the game can do. though for PC i highly HIGHLY recomend to get SKSE (skyrim script extender) and SKYUI for a PC friendly UI if youre not going to use a controller.

review: Skyrim? Yeah I played Skyrim. Picked it up when it launched on the Xbox 360 in fact. I must've put about 30 hours into it before deciding that I've seen it all. Let me break it down a bit. When I played Skyrim I did the following: I left my house, found a dungeon, grabbed the loot, sold it to the same handful of merchants (including my husband), and...that was it. Morrowind was surreal, wonderful, and just obtuse enough to be charming. With Skyrim, I felt like some cog in a Dwemer machine, trapped in an endless cycle of middling upgrades and a total lack of surprising events. I mean, for crying out loud, more dragons?! These jerks are worse than cliff racers. At the time I figured that I might as well play an MMO, at least then I could get some rare drops. So what happened? What's so different about the PC version that I would put 600+ hours into it? Do you really have to ask? Modding Skyrim is the equivalent of Alice in Wonderland. You don't get to walk up to the rabbit hole and peer over the edge. You certainly can't climb down, take what catches your interest, and climb out. No, you will fall in that hole. The only light you'll be seeing is through the dozens of mods that make up your sunny days in Skyrim. In the beginning you might pick through the mods available on the Steam workshop. A weapon here, a new set of armor, something that makes cows explode or sends people flying into space, you get the idea. But then you look at what other people are doing with their Skyrim. They've got the 4K textures, the dramatic ENBs, the glamour models with their noses just right. Now you may be thinking that you don't need all that garbage, and you probably don't. But you do. Next thing you know you're on the Nexus. It's been 10 hours and you haven't even started the game yet. Stability is the last word I'd associate with Elder Scrolls, and that's without piling on the mods. Getting your modded game to function is more engrossing than Skyrim itself. You've started the game, you're wandering around, and then...Crash To Desktop. What caused it? How do you fix it? Is there a way around it? Are you going to lose your saves? After a long enough period of time you eventually stop caring. My Skyrim is held together by old tape and chewing gum, and that's fine. Eventually you learn to stop caring about those precious game-saves. I'm going to spoil Skyrim: You are the most awesome. Everything you do is right and nobody dares to question you. Nobody will even do anything unless you're somehow involved. Sometimes being the most awesome is fun. It's escapism at its purest. A lot of other videogames tend to punish you with death. At worst, Skyrim inconveniences you. This game doesn't say "YOU DIED." or "HEY POOR PLAYER!" It just assumes you goofed up somewhere and loads your last save. There's something to be said about player-imposed difficulty, but it's hard work trying to be the least awesome. There's a phrase I like to throw around when discussing videogames: "Making the game yours." Usually this refers to playing games in a particular way, like a knife-only run in Resident Evil, or beating Megaman without any power-ups. It's not always about player-imposed difficulty either, it can be about creating an identity through playing. I remember reading about a Morrowind player who spent all of their time in the Ashlands. They'd camp out in a Chitin hut and hunt whatever beasts they happened to find. They made just enough from selling the carcasses to eke out a miserable existence while dealing with the constant ash storms. This doesn't sound appealing, but I have to respect the hustle. That person totally owns their game of Morrowind. When all of the rumors are true, and the player is always the most awesome, there's not a lot one can do to create their identity. This is especially apparent when every single guard you pass mentions something you could be doing (or have already done). Your alteration level could be so low that it couldn't levitate an earthworm, but that won't stop you from becoming an Archmage not long after stepping foot in the Winterhold College. I remember when being an Archmage was such hot  in The Bard's Tale, now it's just a title any Dragonbum can get. When everything in a game takes zero effort and the results are meaningless, why not just make the game in your image through modding? If anything this will lead to new challenges, more possibilities, and *gasp* unpredictability. When I play Skyrim, I play with the intent to fill it with as much crap as I can find, see if/when/how it breaks, and attempt to undo the damage with minimal losses. It's disturbingly compelling, and that's without discussing the mods themselves. I don't settle for being the most awesome, I want to become omnipotent. Only after I've constructed this world, filled it with all of the neatest toys, and prettied it up as much as my mediocre videocard will allow, do I actually play it. At this point I'm fine with being the most awesome, because I feel like I earned that right. This is the time I put some Genesis on, and zone out while exploring, decapitating, and working on that perpetually imperfect nose. Perhaps my comparison to Alice in Wonderland is a bit off. The way I remember it, Alice falls in the hole and arrives in Wonderland. With modded Skyrim; Wonderland is a neverending hole. Inevitably you'll get bored of tearing your game to pieces and putting it back together. You want to see where your curiousity will take you. You might go digging through hundreds of foreign websites to find that anime fighting-style, or ten gigabtyes of hair-styles. You could even find yourself in a lab. What it all comes down to is that Skyrim is what you make of it. The game is fine on its own. It's certainly not lacking for content, and even without thousands of visual-enhancing mods it looks decent. However, Skyrim becomes so much more simply through the act of modding. To me, this is the ultimate sandbox game, and will likely only be bested by Bethesda's next single-player RPG.
