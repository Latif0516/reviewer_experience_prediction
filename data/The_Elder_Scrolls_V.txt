review: This is the game the never, ever ends. I picked this game up thinking I wouldn't like it having never played a previous TES game before. Sat in my Library untouched for about a month or two, and finally took the plunge. I was wrong. I was so very, very wrong. This is probably the best purchase I've ever made on steam. Add in the unlimited potential of modding, and it's an adventure that continues forever. I've probably restarted over a hundred times by now with a new character, and still only have beaten Alduin once. ONCE. There's still so much more do to and explore that I'm still discovering quests and areas and little hidden things. I still can't believe how much there is to do and I'm still finding more. At it stands I'll probably wake up one day having lost all touch with reality and actually start seeing the world as Skyrim with how much I've played. And I'm totally ok with that.

review: If I had to choose between this game, and my girlfriend. I'd pick this game. EDIT: I'm single now ON A MORE SERIOUS NOTE: This game is the best in its genre. In previous Bethesda games they made a sad balance in between Questing, and Exploration. Some having more quests and less places to go, and others having very few quests and more places to explore. But in Skyrim, there is no shortage of quests, and if you are like myself and just wander around aimlessly, you will stumble into places that just blow your mind. Every time I have replayed this game, I stumbled into something new. For more info i'd very much recommend mods, with mods such as texture packs, difficulty, quests, armor, and weapons, this games replay value is endless. Go through the game once with plain skyrim, then mod the hell out of it. Overall I'd rate this game an EASY 10/10. If you haven't already. Please buy it, give it a little, and I swear you will be hooked.

review: An epic game made all the more epic by the fact that it is so easy to mod and so well supported by the modding community. The Elder Scrolls series has a large following and often you will hear people argue over each new TES game comparing it to the last, but for me each TES game stands on its own merits, and Skyrim is no exception. The story is pretty good and there are plenty of side quests, but what makes Skyrim so great even when not modded is its large and open nature. This is a land you can just pick a direction and with no quest in mind and just explore. You will find danger and excitement on your journey ... and loot. Lots and lots of loot. But once you start modding this game, that is when you unlock the true value that is Skyrim. Potentially thousands more hours content (for free) in a game that can be improved ten thousand different ways from graphics, textures and sounds all the way to game mechanics and user interface changes. You can make the game exactly what you need it to be, and play it for so long you may still be playing when the next game in this series comes out.... and sometimes longer than even that. If you are interested in modding the PC version of the game, be sure to check out my guide for beginners:

review: I was stacking books on a shelf in my house in Whiterun, one of Skyrim's major cities, when I noticed a weapon rack right beside it. I set a sacrificial dagger in one slot, an Orcish mace in the other. They were on display for nobody but me and my computer-controlled housecarl, Lydia, who sat at a table patiently waiting for me to ask her to go questing. The chest upstairs was reserved for excess weapons and armor, the bedside table for smithing ingots and ores, the one next to the Alchemy table for ingredients. I'd meticulously organized my owned virtual property not because I had to, but because tending to the minutia of domestic life is a comforting break from dealing with screaming frost trolls, dragons, a civil war, and job assignments that never seem to go as planned. It's even a sensible thing to do; a seemingly natural component of every day existence in Skyrim, one of the most fully-realized, easily enjoyable, and utterly engrossing role-playing games ever made. Part of what makes it so enjoyable has to do with how legacy Elder Scrolls clutter has been condensed and in some cases eliminated. In Skyrim, there's no more moon-hopping between hilltops with a maxed out Acrobatics skill. That's gone, so is Athletics. The Elder Scrolls V pares down the amount of skills and cuts out attributes like Endurance and Intelligence altogether. There's no time wasted on the character creation screen agonizing over which skills to assign as major. You don't assign major and minor skills at all, but instead pick one of ten races, each with a specific bonus. High Elves can once a day regenerate magicka quickly, Orcs can enter a berserk rage for more effective close-range combat. These abilities are best paired with certain character builds  the High Elf regeneration is useful for a magic user  but don't represent a rigid class choice. Major decisions don't need to be made until you're already out in the world and can try out magic, sneaking and weapon combat, emphasizing first-hand experience over instruction manual study, letting you specialize only when you're ready. It contributes to the thrilling sense of freedom associated with life in Skyrim. Do a quest, kill a dragon, snatch torchbugs from the air, munch on butterfly wings or simply wander while listening to one of the best game soundtracks in recent memory. Despite the enormity of the world and the colossal amount of content contained within, little feels random and useless. Even chewing on a butterfly wing has purpose, as it reveals one of several alchemical parameters later useful in potion making at an alchemy table. Mined ore and scraps of metal from Dwemer ruins can be smelted into ingots and fashioned into armor sets, pelts lifted from slain wildlife can be turned into leather armor sets, and random books plucked from ancient ruins can trigger hidden quest lines that lead to valuable rewards. Skyrim's land mass is absolutely stuffed with content and curiosities, making every step you take, even if it's through what seems like total wilderness, an exciting one, as something unexpected often lies just over the next ridge. Many times the unexpected takes the form of a dragon. Sometimes they're purposefully placed to guard relics, sometimes they swoop over cities and attack at seemingly random times. In the middle of a fight against a camp of bandits a dragon might strike, screaming through the sky and searing foe and friendly alike with frost or flame. Momentarily all on the battlefield unite, directing arrows and magic blasts upward to knock down the creature, creating impromptu moments of camaraderie -- a surprising change from what may have been yet another by-the-numbers bandit camp sweep. Dragons show up often, their presence announced by an ominous flap of broad wings or an otherworldly scream from high above. The scale and startling detail built into each creature's appearance and animations as it circles, stops to attack, circles again and slams to the ground makes encounters thrilling, though their predictable attack patterns lessen the excitement after a few battles. In the long run they're far less irritating than the Oblivion gate equivalent from The Elder Scrolls IV, can be completed in a few minutes, and always offer a useful reward. Killing a dragon yields a soul, which powers Skyrim's new Shout system. These are magical abilities any character can use, you don't have to specialize in spell casting to slow time, throw your voice, change the weather, call in allies, blast out ice and fire, or knock back enemies with a rolling wave of pure force. Even if you favor sword, shield and heavy armor and ignore magic entirely, you'll still be able to take full advantage of these abilities provided you find the proper words  each Shout has three  hidden on Skyrim's high snowy peaks and in the depths of forgotten dungeons, serving as another reason to continue exploring long after you've exhausted the main quest story, joined with the Thieves Guild, fought alongside the Dark Brotherhood, or thrown your support behind one of the factions vying for control of Skyrim. Not only is this land under assault by dragons, long thought to be dead, it's also ripped in two by civil war. You can choose one side or the other, but so much of the allure of Skyrim is how, even outside of the confines of quest lines, the embattled state of the world is evident, and steeped in a rich fictional legacy. Lord of the Rings this is not, but with the release of every Elder Scrolls game, the fiction becomes denser, and the cross-referencing for long-time fans all the more rewarding. Skyrim's residents are all aware of current events. They'll comment on the civil war, some sympathizing with the rebels, others thinking the establishment sold its soul. The peasants complain about the Jarls who control each settlement, the Jarls complain about the rebels or foreign policy, the overprotective College librarian complains when I drop dragon scales all over his floor; many characters feel like whole, distinct personalities instead of vacuous nothings that hand out quests like a downtown greeter hands out flyers for discount jeans. Characters stereotype based on race, they double-cross at even the slightest hint it might be profitable, and they react to your evolving stature within the world. It makes a ridiculous realm, filled with computer-controlled cat people and humanoid reptiles, demon gods and dragons, feel authentic, like a world that existed long before you showed up and will continue to exist long after you leave.

review: Okay, where do I start? General: This game is able to shock you and make you laugh time and time again, even when playing it for the 3'rd time. It takes about 130 - 200 hours of playtime to finish all of the quests, and I guarantee that in the time you will not discover everything there is to discover. If you do not feel like questing, take some time mining, scaring people with magic and shouts, undressing them, stealing, stealthing, killing dragons or giants, throwing cabbages around or simply reading 1 of about 250 integrated ingame books and stories. Graphics: This game has pulled off something I have thought to be impossible and pushed the whole gaming industry to the new levels. It has successfully integrated superb graphics into a lot of content. World is beautiful, vast and full of variety and although a bit dark by default this can very easily be changed by just picking one mod from the workshop. Workshop: Why does this deserve a special tab? Because thanks to workshop, earlier mentioned 200 hours of gameplay easily turn into thousands of hours of gameplay. Don't like any part of the game? Change it! Modify it! Add to it! A huge amount of mods are being made every day, and whether they spawn an extra cupcake in your house or add new cities with their own storylines they will all change your experience and prolong the fun. Name what you want to do, it exists. ALL OF IT. Cons: - Few possible glitches, but all have their fix, just need to be googled out. - A bit too confusing and overwhelming at the start. A lot of unanswered questions may put you off the game. This happened to me on the first two attempts to play the game. I ended up going to the first town, becoming a woodcutter, killing a chicken and getting chased by the guards. But once you push on, you will be nothing but glad you did. Who am I even writing this for? Is there any poor soul out there who has not yet played this game? BUY IT. NOW. Please?

review: The province of Skyrim might be frigid, but the role-playing game that takes place within it burns with a fire few games possess. Yes, Skyrim is another enormous fantasy RPG from a developer that specializes in them, and it could suck up hundreds of hours of your time as you inspect each nook and crevasse for the secrets to be found within. The game returns you to the continent of Tamriel, where you explore the northern realm called Skyrim, home to the Nord race. In these northern regions, snow flurries cloud your view, and platforms of ice float on the chilled waters. Nighttime often brings Tamriel's version of the aurora borealis, with its gorgeous blue and green ribbons stretching across the heavens. Skyrim's predecessor, Oblivion, featured prototypical fantasy environments-pretty but not quite evocative of the lore's darker undercurrents. Skyrim embraces its darker elements. You might feel an eerie chill as you glimpse a half-sunken ship through the mist, or watch as a dragon comes to life before your very eyes under the swirling firmament. Closer inspection reveals hard edges, plain painted-on textures, and other visual flaws that are conspicuous should you seek them out. But like many enormous games, Skyrim makes a fantastic impression not because its individual elements are sharply honed, but because they contribute to a grander whole. There's so much to do that your quest log becomes an embarrassment of pleasures, offering dozens of choices at any given time, each one as enticing as the next.It's impressive enough that there's so much to do; it's even more impressive that most of it is wonderful. Not every dungeon is a joy to explore. Stone-turning puzzles occasionally bring the fun to a halt, and a few repeated cave designs could dampen your spirits. But overall, every task has an excellent sense of context, and surprises lurk around many a turn. Skyrim also uses scattered books and references to enthrall you. You may not be a big fan of reading books in role-playing games, but even so, you should make an effort here.The combat in Skyrim is the tightest Elder Scrolls combat yet, the visual and audio cues normally providing proper feedback with your blows and zaps.Some death blows result in Fallout 3-style slow-motion kills, which retain their power because they're not overly frequent. Movement, too, has seen improvement: you can now play from a third-person view and feel like you're moving across the land instead of floating above it. All in all, Skyrim has some minor issues but as a whole is a brilliant RPG.

The game has one of the largest active modding communities of any game. This helps to spice up gameplay and graphics. With new residents, new weapons and armor, incredible house mods adding giant castles, and visual mods. You can spend hours upon hours finding mods that suit your needs in the nordic lands of Skyrim. It is worth to note that you should know the game to an extent before modding, as it can corrupt save files if not done properly. If I'd have to rate it, it would be a 10/10.

review: This is one of the best adventures you can play: long and storyrich main quest with huge amount of sidequests to venture through! With the official Dragonborn, Dawnguard and Heartfire dlcs there's tons of places to see and enormous amount of quests to complete. If you somehow run out of stuff to find then there's the modding possibility. SO MANY mods are out there (Steam Workshop, Skyrim Nexus...) to give you more quests, items and whatever. With all the mods it's pretty much endless adventure waiting for you as Dragonborn. The best ability of course is shouting at everything you see. It's pretty funny to make people fly away when you feel upset about someone stealing your sweetroll... Some caves and especially Dwarven ruins tend to be pretty boring to go to after some time since they are pretty long (Dwarven ruins) and linear (just killing tons of same enemies to find something/somebody or to get somewhere) but other than that it's a beautiful and rich game in so many ways that there is no reason why you shouldn't give it a try! Btw never attack chickens... those s seem to be pretty valuable in Skyrim since everyone is willing to kill you if you harm them.

review: A game that is complicated to critique. For the first 30-50 hours, you will be completely absorbed in the beautiful and vast world, with seemingly endless opportunities for exploration and questing. As you continue to play, the cracks start to show. The gameplay systems are incredibly shallow, the characters wooden, the world still beautiful but the dungeons copy/pasted 120 times over with the same enemies, the same meaningless loot. The complication arises when you realize that while you are slowly starting to loathe the game, you've had 30+ hours of fun before hitting that point. So the question is, was it worth it?

The game will just suck you in. It has LOADS of contents that will keep you busy for 100+ hours for sure. And mods are just icing on the cake; if you're a graphics-hungry person, mods can make this game look better than most "next-gen" games out there, if modded correctly. And the sceneries, oh the sceneries, I just feel like sitting on my chair and just keep staring at those vast fields of beautiufl grasslands. Totally recommend this game. 15/10. BUT, but, one and only con that I found is of the fighting mechanics; it is just so bland. Nothing else I dislike about this game.

With mods installed prepare to stay up until 3:00 am in the morning while playing this game oh and i mean from 7:00 am to 3:00 by the way, you will literally lose hours just by having fun with the fantastic and active modding community for this game. Now for everything else, The landscape of Skyrim is extremely beautiful, you will get lost in hours and hours of content. More so with the vast dungeons dotting the land. While Elder Scrolls Oblivion had this fantasy artistic style going on with the landscape which is breathtaking within it's own right. Skyrim has this hostile, cold and harsh environment going on. Exatcly how it is described. The quests in this game are extremely well done, more so with quests that don't really start right off the bat until you read a book or hear a rumor, which will keep the player more invested within the game. Also with the AI system implemented in this game, your actions changes how the world views your character with every good deed you do to every bad deed you do. Quest mods also make it more fun and more investing. The skills system aren't exactly as perfect as Elder Scrolls Oblivion. Within that game, whatever class you pick, it will either make the investment into that class fun or not, but either way you will lose hours just getting your characters skills up as you go along within that game. In Skyrim, the skills system are dotted out into three sections, Mage, Warrior, and Rogue, whatever skills you pick it will either help combat scenarios easier or not. Even more so if you choose to go with a thief build. The mage system in this game is pretty badass but not as more through like in Oblivon. But with mods installed it will make these three aspects much more fun to play and make the skill system much more tedious rather than a clean sweep. The Combat system in this game is clunky, it's your typical Elder Scrolls game. If an enemy lungs at you, you block, if you want to gain the advantage against a large stack of bandits or whatever, use a bow. If you want a 'clean sweep' use magic. Here is where modding comes into play once again. Thanks to these overhaul mods the combat system feels more alive and more challenging, with every minute maybe your last. The NPCs in this game while that voice reptition is there, the NPCs of this vast world stand out more than the Oblivion counterparts, each one has a selective schedule and "job" they also have their own "situation" to make these characters either more interesting or more annoying depending upon your point of view. The muscical score makes you want to just to sit back and listen to it. While some people will say "it's recycled music over and over again" There are mods to make the muscial score more diverse and interesting with every combat situation and with every town and city, and dungeon you explore. The DLC are also great in there own right, With Dawnguard, it's your typical light and darkness story. But here you will not only lose more hours into this game, but you will gain new shouts, equipment and companions, and also player homes. With hearthfire it's an add-on, it will just add housecarls and three new houses to the world. If you like that sort of thing. Lastly with Dragonborn, you will explore a very familiar place with a "good" storyline, like with Dawnguard, new quests, new equipment, and new player homes, and new companions. basically Dawnguard and Dragonborn you will get "new" I highly recommend modding this game. In it's original state, again it feels lifeless and dull, even if you lose 1000+ hours into Skyrim. With mods enabled you will enjoy replaying the game over and over again. I seriously recommend this game.

review: I love it, it gave me 2 years of fun, I played every playstyle, every race, every way, every DLC. I been from a straight up heavy armor warrior with a huge battleaxe that can turn into a werewolf, and could stand still taking every hit from a dragon without losing almost any health. To a master thief who isn't very strong but can sneak through a entire bandit camp without being seen once.. All the way to guy who never killed a soul, worked hard for his money chopping wood. Managing to build his own house and have a family. The main story with all the guilds you can join and areas to explore, you won't be bored for a long time. So don't just rush the main story and assume you seen it all. Out of the DLC's, the best would be Dragonborn. It offers a large new world, enemies, quests, armors and weapons. While the Dawnguard only offers a bit and a vampire lord form, and Hearthfire just lets you adopt kids and build homes. The worst thing about it, is there will be bugs, which can easily be fixed by console commands. But only use if needed, like after 5 retrys a quest won't finish or continue. 8/10 Only because it can get far too easy, and the bugs. You get stronger than all the enemies too quickly. So I say when you learn the game better, go on Master or Legendary difficulty for a challenge.

review: Skyrim is undoubtedly the best purchase I have made in the past year. It's worth every $ that it's listed at especially when considering the insane amount of content you are given. I have only spent about 100 hours in the game (this is short in comparison to a lot of people on my friends list) but I can assure you that those hours were all packed with immersive content. Here are some key features that hooked me into the game.. 1. Dungeon Complexity - When I say complexity, I mean that the design for the game's dungeons vary greatly from simple to complex. You just have to keep exploring and you'll eventually run into the intricately designed areas that get you to pause for a moment and think before being able to progress. At times.. I ALMOST felt as if I were playing the latest Tomb Raider once again. I also found it quite neat that you could use your shouts to bypass/solve a few of the puzzles. 2. Playstyle Freedom - I'm sure tht a lot of people take similar routes but the game does offer a great deal of freedom with its perk system. It's definitely a step up compared to games like Kingdoms of Amalur. Do you enjoy melee combat? How about magic? How about a balance of both? There's a lot of possibilities. 3. Expansive Lore - As I've mentioned, the game has a ton of content. Playing through everything (especially if you are aiming for complete achievements), gives you perspective on the whole story and it really is interesting when some quest's lore ties into another - maybe even forming a bigger picture. Skyrim definitely has a lot more charming qualities but these are the features that I really wanted to highlight. They stood out for me and it was for these reasons that I ended up buying the game last year (only to play it now - 2014) during the summer sale. With that said, I paid $30 for the legendary edition. Wouldn't you agree that for all this content, it was pretty much a steal? How many games can you list down that provide hundreds, nearly thousands of hours worth of content (especially if you count the mods) for that kind of price. Just remember, multiplayer games don't count! 10/10. Buy it when it goes on sale during this upcoming summer sale event.

review: Skyrim is one of my favorite games of all time, this game is pure art, the role play is great if you are a nerd like me, however if you don't plan on role playing and you just want to play an amazing game then you can unlike other titles like fallout this game does not punish you and it is not a very hard game, i played it in master for most of my stay in the land of skyrim. This game is the kind of type game where it is not about the end its all about the journey. I have played a lot of rpgs in my day, and in most the quests have been bland and the main idea was to explore however this game can be both the quests are great, the story is great the map is amazing, Yeah there may not be as many random encounters like fallout, however when exploring you will allways find something new, and as we are pc master race we also get the privlage of mods that add alot more to the game which is amazing, i mainly enjoyed some of the modded quests, and horror quests. If you dont have this game by now f*cking buy it jez 10/10

review: This game truly deserves the title of "near perfection", being one of those rare milestones that comes every so often in years of gaming. Skyrim itself, is probably the best release from Bethesda's Elder Scrolls series. Story wise, this is one of the most developed storyline from the series, giving much enjoyment overall. In all honesty, we can say that the community is one of the most desirable aspect of Skyrim, due to their dedication in further releases of modifications - improving much of the overall gameplay (it never hurts to crank up those graphics). It would be a pity to not try Skyrim in the course of your lifetime, so it's advisable to go ahead and try it!

review: There are many reasons why we play games. Some play games to experience a story, some play to compete with others and some play to have experiences they have never had otherwise in real life. Alot play games to escape into another world, and live completely different lives, and this is what drives Bethesdas Elder Scrolls series, a series that has excelled in creating complete virtual worlds, inviting the player to live parallel lives. Skyrim is the latest world offered by Bethesda to live in, and it seems like its Bethesdas finest accomplishment yet. Similarly to the two Elder Scrolls games before it, you start off as a prisoner, and this case you are on your way to be executed. Just before the axe greets your neck, a dragon appears and the entire army base you were in goes into disarray. You are set free after the incident, and it is up to you to find out why are the dragons appearing, and what is your role in the whole ordeal (hint: it rhymes with Shmagonborn). Bethesda displays such dedication to concept of open world that makes other open world games pale in comparison. Skyrim isnt just a series of buildings, environments and NPCs, it is the closest there is to virtual living world in a game. The sense of freedom found in Elder Scrolls is unparalleled, and Skyrim is the best implementation of this yet. The main quest is a minimal part of the game, and most of the fun comes from exploring the world built for you. As you go exploring dungeons, assisting NPCs with their problems, joining factions and reading ingame books, you realize what a dense world Skyrim is. It is compelling to learn more about Skyrim, about its citizens and about its politics, and the more you learn about, the more you are invested in the well being of the world. Through all the running around and exploring, you come across a wide range of missions to complete. The main mission is, as usual, the most interesting one, but the rest of the missions can be worthy, and they are necessary to help you know more about the world. You can complete missions for The Companions (Skyrims equivalent of the Fighters Guild) to understand how ingrained the warrior culture is in Skyrim, or join the Mages College and be looked down upon by Nords who believe that magic is for sissies. Even miscellaneous missions, such as simply standing up for a Dark Elf against a bunch of racist Nords can be satisfying. Standard fetch quests are to be found here and there, but there are far from being the norm. The games graphics have been talked about endlessly. Now, Skyrims graphics are great, with detailed textures and wonderful environments. Yet it terms of detail, they dont hold a candle to games like Rage and Battlefield 3. Yet Skyrim is nicer to look at than the aforementioned games, and that is because of Skyrims aesthetics. Bethesda knows that when it comes to graphics, art direction trumps fidelity, and in Skryim, the beauty of the world comes from its style. Part of the reason Morrowind is generally viewed as a much better game than Oblivion is because of its fantastical designs; while Oblivion came off as a standard European fantasy setting, Morrowind was a truly outlandish and exotic location that had its own unique identity. Skyrim returns with the art direction that made Morrowind so unique. While the location might not be as exotic as Morrowind, Skyrim it is exactly the blistering norse region that you would think is occupied by burly, war-faring people. The buidlings, the environments, the apparel, the weapons, the creatures, and even the music all give Skyrim its unique identity, an identity that is inspired by real-life Scandinavia, but is in no way identical to it. ~~~~~~~~~~~~ The combat, which is one of the weaker aspects in previous Elder Scrolls, is drastically improved here. While there is still the feeling that you are hacking away at empty spaces instead of making a real impact on your enemy, but its not as bad as it was in previous games. The biggest addition to the combat system is the double wielding, and it works great. You can go for a sword in each hand, a sword and spell, or two spells, one in each hand. I personally went sword and staff, Gandalf style. There is also a favorite menu for items, a feature that pauses makes it easier to equip items in game. This is designed to save you the hassle of going to the main item screen during the game, but it also gives a tactical quality to the combat, since the menu pauses the game and allows for quick equipment changes, which is helpful especially when fighting dragons. Dragons appear as random encounters throughout the game, and they are just as imposing as one would imagine dragons to be. You will die alot fighting them, and you would have to rely on myriad of tactics to fight them. A few hacks there, retreat to heal yourself, attack with destruction magic while the dragon is airborne, retreat again, and so on. Killing a dragon is immensely satisfying, and through killing dragons do you acquire new shouts. Shouts are another new combat feature; they are words in the dragon language which, when you say them, unleashes different attacks on your enemies, or gives you new powers. Shouts are a welcome addition to the games combat system, and further adds to the combats tactical quality. Now this is a Bethesda game, which means that bugs are abound. I have experienced a few unresponsive actions from NPCs, same crashes, and an axe suspended in midair. However, this is an area I cant criticize Bethesda much about. In a game of this size and scope, it is virtually impossible to spot all the bugs before release. To their credit, Bethesda is quick to releases patches that fix whatever issues gamers may have. We can also count on the mod community to tweek all the inconveniences out of the game. Bugs are abundant in the game, and players will experience at least one in every playthrough, yet for the most part, these bugs are miniscule and far from game breaking. Skyrim is like a music album that has a few tracks that you arent particularly fond of, but rest of the music is pure aural blliss that you cant help but think of the album as close to perfection as possible. I cant point to a single part of the game and say that is the best part; the entire game is an experience. It stays firmly rooted in Elder Scrolls gameplay, yet with enough improvements and additions (and subtractions) to make Skyrim stand on its own. After experiencing the vast, dense and incredibly detailed world of Skyrim, you cant help but snicker whenever another game is referred to as open world. Good: Vast yet incredibly detailed world, Incredible Depth, Interesting Story, Improved Combat System, Gorgeous Graphics and wonderful style Bad: Buggy, some standard 'fetch' missions Price: AED 9.5/10

review: This is one of the best games I have played in my lifetime. And no, I'm not 11 years old... :p Add 40 years to that. Yes, 51. My life is extremely busy and video games have always been my number one activity to leave the standard world. The Elder Scrolls series of games has been one of the best sources of fun I have found and Skyrim is simply the best one of the series by far! Do download the DLC (Downloadable contents) right away as the latest DLC (Dragonborn) includes very potent aspects to the game as the ability to receive TWO perk points when reading ability books! BUT! Yes, there's a but. The game is so vast that there are some bugs... You need to play this with the Elder Scrolls Wiki

review: opened in a browser (ideally in a separate monitor) when playing to see the various issues with each quests or dungeons (like how not to completely mess up the "Blood on the Ice" quest so you can get to finally buy the somptuous Hjerim house in Windhelm). BUT number 2. Yes, there is another issue. You may SERIOUSLY consider adding a few "mods" to your game since they may fix some of the "bugs" mentioned. For exemple : adding the Dawnguard DLC will make Vampires appear and KILL potentially VITAL characters depending on the sort of build your are trying to achieve for your character! Geeez. You would think they would have thought of a way to hold these attacks until you start the quest? NO they didn't! But.... There's a "mod" that actually does this for you : preventing ALL vampire attacks (which may KILL city vendors and other characters) until you actually start the quest! Yep, this means, sorry lad, but you REALLY should take a stroll around the modding area, easily accessible in Steam by clicking the Workshop button under your PLAY button in the Games Library (once you've selected Skyrim). There are a few really cool mods I like apart from this one. One is called Run for your lives! And also makes all villagers run inside when there's a DRAGON attack. Again, preventing important characters from simply being wiped out before you get a chance to kill them yourself! :p Apart from that, the game is just insanely good... I have played it from beginning to end many times and still discover new things. :)

review: can steal from a merchant, then sell it back to him. 10/10 now on a serious note. skyrim is best value of your money that you will get in any game EVER. reasons is are mods. quest mods, graphic mods, weapons, npc, new spells, voice, animation, you name it theres a mod for it and will add to the game. there are several, hundreds of quest mods that add hours of extra gameplay and even new areas and dungeons. combat in this game is great. amazing if so. you will never find a fps game with sword, magic or bow as great as this. if first person isnt your style you can easily go to third person. ENB and graphic mods change the game completely to make it look like an entire different game that make it look like its a brand new game. i highly recomend this game with the dlc as they add new variety of items and new mechanics that the game can do. though for PC i highly HIGHLY recomend to get SKSE (skyrim script extender) and SKYUI for a PC friendly UI if youre not going to use a controller.

review: Skyrim? Yeah I played Skyrim. Picked it up when it launched on the Xbox 360 in fact. I must've put about 30 hours into it before deciding that I've seen it all. Let me break it down a bit. When I played Skyrim I did the following: I left my house, found a dungeon, grabbed the loot, sold it to the same handful of merchants (including my husband), and...that was it. Morrowind was surreal, wonderful, and just obtuse enough to be charming. With Skyrim, I felt like some cog in a Dwemer machine, trapped in an endless cycle of middling upgrades and a total lack of surprising events. I mean, for crying out loud, more dragons?! These jerks are worse than cliff racers. At the time I figured that I might as well play an MMO, at least then I could get some rare drops. So what happened? What's so different about the PC version that I would put 600+ hours into it? Do you really have to ask? Modding Skyrim is the equivalent of Alice in Wonderland. You don't get to walk up to the rabbit hole and peer over the edge. You certainly can't climb down, take what catches your interest, and climb out. No, you will fall in that hole. The only light you'll be seeing is through the dozens of mods that make up your sunny days in Skyrim. In the beginning you might pick through the mods available on the Steam workshop. A weapon here, a new set of armor, something that makes cows explode or sends people flying into space, you get the idea. But then you look at what other people are doing with their Skyrim. They've got the 4K textures, the dramatic ENBs, the glamour models with their noses just right. Now you may be thinking that you don't need all that garbage, and you probably don't. But you do. Next thing you know you're on the Nexus. It's been 10 hours and you haven't even started the game yet. Stability is the last word I'd associate with Elder Scrolls, and that's without piling on the mods. Getting your modded game to function is more engrossing than Skyrim itself. You've started the game, you're wandering around, and then...Crash To Desktop. What caused it? How do you fix it? Is there a way around it? Are you going to lose your saves? After a long enough period of time you eventually stop caring. My Skyrim is held together by old tape and chewing gum, and that's fine. Eventually you learn to stop caring about those precious game-saves. I'm going to spoil Skyrim: You are the most awesome. Everything you do is right and nobody dares to question you. Nobody will even do anything unless you're somehow involved. Sometimes being the most awesome is fun. It's escapism at its purest. A lot of other videogames tend to punish you with death. At worst, Skyrim inconveniences you. This game doesn't say "YOU DIED." or "HEY POOR PLAYER!" It just assumes you goofed up somewhere and loads your last save. There's something to be said about player-imposed difficulty, but it's hard work trying to be the least awesome. There's a phrase I like to throw around when discussing videogames: "Making the game yours." Usually this refers to playing games in a particular way, like a knife-only run in Resident Evil, or beating Megaman without any power-ups. It's not always about player-imposed difficulty either, it can be about creating an identity through playing. I remember reading about a Morrowind player who spent all of their time in the Ashlands. They'd camp out in a Chitin hut and hunt whatever beasts they happened to find. They made just enough from selling the carcasses to eke out a miserable existence while dealing with the constant ash storms. This doesn't sound appealing, but I have to respect the hustle. That person totally owns their game of Morrowind. When all of the rumors are true, and the player is always the most awesome, there's not a lot one can do to create their identity. This is especially apparent when every single guard you pass mentions something you could be doing (or have already done). Your alteration level could be so low that it couldn't levitate an earthworm, but that won't stop you from becoming an Archmage not long after stepping foot in the Winterhold College. I remember when being an Archmage was such hot  in The Bard's Tale, now it's just a title any Dragonbum can get. When everything in a game takes zero effort and the results are meaningless, why not just make the game in your image through modding? If anything this will lead to new challenges, more possibilities, and *gasp* unpredictability. When I play Skyrim, I play with the intent to fill it with as much crap as I can find, see if/when/how it breaks, and attempt to undo the damage with minimal losses. It's disturbingly compelling, and that's without discussing the mods themselves. I don't settle for being the most awesome, I want to become omnipotent. Only after I've constructed this world, filled it with all of the neatest toys, and prettied it up as much as my mediocre videocard will allow, do I actually play it. At this point I'm fine with being the most awesome, because I feel like I earned that right. This is the time I put some Genesis on, and zone out while exploring, decapitating, and working on that perpetually imperfect nose. Perhaps my comparison to Alice in Wonderland is a bit off. The way I remember it, Alice falls in the hole and arrives in Wonderland. With modded Skyrim; Wonderland is a neverending hole. Inevitably you'll get bored of tearing your game to pieces and putting it back together. You want to see where your curiousity will take you. You might go digging through hundreds of foreign websites to find that anime fighting-style, or ten gigabtyes of hair-styles. You could even find yourself in a lab. What it all comes down to is that Skyrim is what you make of it. The game is fine on its own. It's certainly not lacking for content, and even without thousands of visual-enhancing mods it looks decent. However, Skyrim becomes so much more simply through the act of modding. To me, this is the ultimate sandbox game, and will likely only be bested by Bethesda's next single-player RPG.

But one day, when i was passing by Riverwood, there she was, running to me, i drop my sword and my shield, and run to her, never been so fast in my entire life! Happiest day of my life! When i ask her why she left me, she said got lost in the woods, and lost my track, but her love for me, found the way. Then i knew, her words, she was in love too, saw i asked if she want to marry me, and she said YES!! Now this is the best day of my life! We married in Riften, our friends were there, to see this moment. After the wedding, we went to my house in Whiterun, i renewd it just for her, and she love it! We tried to have a son, but Lydia cant have babies, so we adopt a little girl, named Linda. Me and Lydia, play with her, take her out, to see the world out side! With the money i earn from my adventures, i constructed a house, a bigger and better house, and we adopt another child, this time a boy, named Abe. Now we live a fairy tales. 10/10 Would fall in love again (Sorry for the english)

review: Skyrim is not the game people revere it to be. In order to review it, you'd need to point out several factors that weigh in Skyrim's favour. First factor being that you can mod it... VERY IMPORTANT FACTOR! Without mods Skyrim is a buggy mess with no depth to the combat nor much depth with the main story and characters. If you're not going to be modding the game, just playing it vanilla, then I recommend just playing through the different side quests and guilds/groups the game offers. They are much more fun than the main questline and have some nice rewards. Another factor in Skyrim's favour is that it's the only one of its kind. (Discounting the previous TES games, which are outdated. I'm talking strictly games that are popular today.) There is no other open world RPG game that offers as much as Skyrim with as good visuals, voice acting and functionality. (Although Skyrim is INSANELY buggy without mods.) You might be asking yourself why I recommend this game if I'm not stroking it's ego telling it that it's a big boy, and instead bad mouthing it. Well, it has a great modding community (bar the big floppy private parts mods) and an ever growing modding community too. It's a few years old now, yet still manages to pump out awesome mods at Skyrim mod nexus and on the Workshop. I love modding and playing this game, and personally think you'd be crazy to experience Skyrim without mods. TLDR: Skyrim isn't that great without mods, I like this game with mods. You might think differently, just my humble opinion.

review: For the people who: 1) Want DEPTH - A huge story behind every SINGLE quest. 2) Think the NPCs are 'garbage' because they don't react the way the 'should' when the Dragonborn does THIS or THAT. 3) Look for amazing & different ways of combat in order to kill your enemies. 4) Think it's too "repetitieve, shallow, bland dungeon crawler." 5) Want to add THOUSANDS of mods, not reading how to install them & then complain the game is trash because it CRASHES. This game is NOT for you. I enjoy this game very much & I think it's a REALLY GOOD game. It all depends on what kind of games you like & if you're too picky. Sure, this game is not perfect & has bugs, glitches, etc. But I'd like to see YOU developing a game like this or even BETTER. I'm sure people who don't have HIGH expectations will love the game as much as I do. Take your TIME exploring the places, doing the quests. Just add some mods if you need more action, be careful they don't conflict with each other & you're ready to go! (: 8/10

review: What can you say about Elder Scrolls series ? It's more popular than a picture of Jesus holding a pug with a bowtie, and rightfully so. Most of the series issues are countered by the fact that talented, sometimes downright disturbingly obsessive modding community probably modded them out and Skyrim is no exception. Even if you sink more than hundered hours in vanilla version, you can still find something you haven't done and want to do. Want to spend all your time force-pushing chickens around town ? Sure ! Wanna put buckets over NPCs faces while they're delivering important pieces of exposition ? You got it ! While I'm usually opposed to "make your own fun" kind of games, doing your own thing is bread and butter of Skyrim, and that's what makes it so popular. Yeah, it may be a bit more simplified (for the sake of accessibility) than older TES games and maybe enviroments and combat get a bit boring and repetitive after a while, but it all falls flat when you can summon 5000 wheels of cheese and roll them down the mountain on unsuspecting goats.

review: I wouldn't call this the ultimate game, but I would call it the ultimate timewaster. Skyrim was my companion through a couple of days with no internet. It was also one of the only games I had installed. One thing leads to another, you start to see achievements piling on achievements, and you get the idea, "Yeah, I can do this." What a fool I was.

review: (This review is a very long one. It actually is kind of an article between, a gameplay review, a "role-playing" guide, a mods compilation, and story of a character. If you are not intrested, I suggest you to pass it right away.) (Content is written all by me. Please do not distribute without permission.) The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, is undoubtedly one of the greatest PC games ever made, personally the single best RPG and open-world game I've seen. It is an unlimited digital source of pleasure for a lifetime FRP lover like myself. There really aren't many words to describe such perfection. First of all, best thing about Skyrim is the fact that, things you can do is literally endless. Content is literally endless. I am at around +2.000 hours of Skyrim gameplay (Also played it a lot before my Steam copy.), and everyday, I still keep discovering some totally new things. Vanillia game with DLC's, has at least over 2.000-2.500 hours of gameplay (Around 1.500 hours without any DLC's, maybe?), if you do nothing but quests. Endless number of mods you can apply, will make gameplay way, way longer. And again, this is only possible if you do nothing but quests; no sightseeing, fast traveling all the way, skipping lore, and forgetting about the identity of your character. Still, it's your choice to play Skyrim in the way you want. I have 3 characters, and I'll talk about one of them, whom I mainly play. (Vanillia content is more than enough to play 3 unique paths (except main storyline) for 3 seperate characters. You also can alter main storyline to a degree.). But first, I'd like to talk about mods which I actively use in all my characters (Plus, there are some particular ones for each character.)(No visual mods included.) - First of all, most indispensable mod for me, is probably the "Disable Fast Travel". I think that fast traveling absolutely ruins the game. I never fast traveled before (Neither in Skyrim, nor Oblivion. Morrowind didn't had it anyways. Damn, I love Morrowind.), never will, and I hate people who fast travels. Fast travel system is necessary as a result of overall demand to Skyrim, but when it's being used, that's half of the games beauty gone. Some people play it just for the other half anyways. - I very much like the "iNeed" mod, which adds a streamlined approach to needs. You need to eat, drink, and sleep once in a while, for full effectiveness of your character. It has some nice details, like for example, you can carry a flask, drink your water from it when you are thirsty, and fill it from any water source when depleted (Even from rain!). - Static Mesh Improvement, an amazing mod which replaces some plain textures with idea of adding a feel of third dimension, with actual 3D meshes. It adds a whole new level to details all around Tamriel. - SkyUI, a must-have interface overhaul - Cloaks of Skyrim - SkyrimSpeeds, speed adjustments - Improved Dragon Shouts - Command Dragon, for manual control - Alternative Crafting System, helps role-playing without abandoning your gear potential - ImmersiveFP, for first-person dragon & horse riding - A quality world map with all roads - Touring Carriages - FNIS, custom animations engine - And, Falskaar! It's an amazing mod, which adds a new quest line, a huge new map, and a very solid lore. Very professionally done, almost like an official DLC. The character I want to talk about, is my female dragonborn assassin, last member of the Dark Brotherhood, and guildmaster of Thieves Guild. She's the character that I played the most, although she's not the character I first created, or beat the main storyline. I beat the main storyline with my mage for the first time, and I wanted continue as an assassin, created her. After completing the Unbound quest (Which is the very first quest.), I literally quit the main storyline, and completed The Dark Brotherhood and Thieves Guild storylines (Yea, you can do that. You literally can complete almost every side quest in Tamriel without touching the main story.). By the time I return to the main storyline, I already was a master assassin, (Skyrim has an NPC progress system; it doesn't let you level up more than usual before story, and one-shot every NPC. You'll still have an adventage tho.), so I progressed through it at ease (Except the dragon parts, where I needed to go head-on.), and I completed it, as she completed her personality. She's not a type of assassin without honour, she's not like killing random people just for money/fun, or she's not using her dragonborn powers for personal gain (Spidey-philosophy), instead, she actually delivers justice, and avenges the downtrodden. She's more like Batman, The Dark Knight, except the killing part. And all that Thieves Guild, 'stealing' part, is also like the phiolosophy of Robin Hood, or at least the Cat Woman. In the end, she's a very righteous character, in her own way. I completed a billion small quests, and some big ones like Civil War and The Companions storyline (Actually, all the big ones as far as I know.), and married with Aela (Yep, Aela is a female. Yep, I'm a female. Yep.) before heading to Dawnguard DLC. I've completed Dawnguard as a vampire. I got cured afterwards, but I'm still not sure about being a vampire, since it actually fits the concept of her being a master assassin hiding in shadows, but there are too many downsides; I won't ever be using the Vampire Lord form, since it's totally irellevant with my character, and I don't like its benefits/aesthetics anyways. After that, Dragonborn came out, and I also finished it, which actually fits perfectly to her personality, since the purpose is (kind of) assassinating a corrupt leader as the only assassin (because of being a dragonborn) who can do it, and became a complete Dragonborn. Since then, I'm traveling short distances with Shadowmere, and long distances on a dragon (Not dragon fast-travelling, I'm navigating manually.). I do some unusual things in my spare time in Skyrim, which many can find weird, but I enjoy a lot. For example, I have some favorite places (Which I won't be sharing. Be assured, finding your own places would be much more satisfying.), I sometimes toggle off the running mode, and randomly walk at these places again and again, for hours, never getting bored. I also find books in Skyrim very exciting (There are countless in-game books which you can read. Each one of them are written exclusively, with its unique content.), I have a great intrest in collecting and reading them, and I actually find some of them way more intriguing than many 'popular' real books. Some of which I can recommend: Rising Threat (4 volumes), The Wolf Queen (8 volumes), Kolb and the Dragon (That's probably my favorite book in the game. Not in terms of its story, but it is actually a "choose-your-own-adventure" type of book.), The Black Arrow (2 volumes), A Dance in Fire (7 volumes). As a side note, in my honest opinion, books in Oblivion were better... Before finishing, here are some mods that I use especially for my assassin: - The Dance of Death, a kill-move mod - Higher Jump - Martial Arts - Realistic Crime Radius - Throwing Weapons Redux - Faction Crossbows - Stealth Immersion And, I suppose, that's all. In terms of characters, as you can see, making a character totally unique is pretty simple, it's just a matter of will. Skyrim, or any game for that matter, can only provide you the visualization and tools of role-playing; you have to use your imagination for an advanced FRP experience. And in terms of gaming perspective, you now should have an idea about how I feel about Skyrim, and you probably figured out how different you can approach to the game. In the end, conclusion is actually pretty short, and simple: Skyrim is a must, must, must, MUST have game, and a masterpiece to experience, just like a Mozart concerto, a Shakespeare play, or a trip to one of 7 Great Wonders of the World.

review: Skyrim is the best Elder Scrolls game so far, with the expansions it has gotten even better. I felt that ESIII: Morrowind brought more to the table for its time than ESIV: Oblivion but believe this game has done even more. I have enjoyed it on console, on PC and gone through the DLC which is worth the extra cash. The only thing missing is co-op/multi player but Elder Scrolls Online is running now, although I wish they would have done things a little differently on that game.. Even if your not an Elder Scrolls fan or follower the game is a nice play as it allows you to customize yourself and play in many styles to allow a change up. I did have a few technical issues following the main quest line but just shifted to side quests and other things until I found out how to fix my save. They could have done a litle better on updating to debug some of the common issues or allowed a form of abandoning quests to reset them. Overall I'd say 9.5/10 for what it is as I can't complain about missing features that just weren't supposed to be in the game although I think they coulda just put out a co-op patch/expansion to allow us to play with 1 friend or something which would have enhanced the gameplay alot and expanded the games popularity.

review: The Elder Scrolls V:Skyrim is for me one the best RPG games that I've played. This game is briliant in many ways, the graphics are pretty decent on the year, when the game was released (ofcourse there are many retexture mods that can improve the looks of the game). Combat is pretty sweet too, You can choose which class You want to play and You can combine them in the way You want it. This game with beautiful open-world, many quests, many adventures, and a lot of more great content can give You the best role-playing game experience..

review: The way I see Elder Scrolls series: it's not about beating the game, it's about travel. My first one was Morrowind. I've played Oblivion, but didn't really pay attention to it and I bough Skyrim pretty cheap. So far, eight hours in the game, this is the biggest, most complete, wonderful ES game for true adventurers. You don't play to win, you play to travel, you play to read books, you play to enjoy it through and through. A RPG game like no other, if you didn't play ES games before, get Skyrim and forget about this ugly world we live in...

review: Skyrim (Base Game) - REVIEW What is there to say about this game? Where do I even begin to tackle this monstrosity that has taken me on my 1st playthrough 141 hours just to finish the Skyrim base-game? We're not enough counting the DLC's here...yet! The Elder Scrolls (TES) is 1 of those series that are loaded w/ tons + tons of content, offering up an insane amount of value + "bang for your buck". To experience all of it at once - IMHO, at least for me, that's probably not the wisest ideas. This game has so many different storylines, quests, areas to explore, factions, things to do (i.e. get married) - it's a game you play for numerous hours until you've hit that wall (i.e. "I need a break for a while"); just go away from for a bit; & then it calls you back for more. Very few games do this to me - Test Drive Unlimited 2; Far Cry 3; + Skyrim all come to my mind here. Class systems are gone here in Skyrim. Just practice the attributes you want to want to improve (i.e. sneak around, improve that skilll; swing a 1-handed sworded and hit someone, that improves; cast a spell from a certain school, that improves, etc); + select new abilities from those attributes to learn at level-up time. Since you're constantly improving your attributes + leveling-up like there's no tomorrow, this can be addictive - think like that Diablo-like kind of addictive. Skyrim has improved in numerous ways over its predecessor. Graphically, on the technical side, the game is much better than Oblivion. Girls actually do look more so like girls (in the face, namely), this time around - thanks for finally getting this right, Bethesda; it took you long enough! While many of the game areas are nowhere as crazy + interesting as Oblivion's Shivering Isles expansion (my favorite area in any TES game since starting in the series w/ Morrowind). These lands have a Nordic influence on them + most of them truly do look fantastic. Likely, if you see an area way out in the distance, there's a great chance - you can go there + explore it completely, which is fantastic. Combat here has improved & is a bit more visceral than Oblivion - but, when compared to others, it certainly is still a little bit clunky (like most TES games) + does not rival the combat of other games like Kingdom of Amalur: Reckoning + Dark Souls (those games certainly do specialize in combat) - it's still pretty good here in Skyrim. One thing that's new - you can now dual-wield weapons; can even wield magic in one hand, a weapon in another; dual-wield different magic spells in each hands; and/or even dual-wield the same magic spell (for double the power). Simply put - these are great additions to this game's combat system. NPC's in the game-world actually have taken a page right out of the Gothic play-book, as you will see NPC's doing things to immerse you into the world - i.e. blacksmith sharpening blades with equipment; NPC's acting on schedules + doing things together on their own; + things of that natures. As usual, there's even more books added to read, for those who want to dwelve into the ever-expanded + ridiculously-sized Lore of the series. The main story here is this - dragons have returned to Skyrim, you're to meet a certain group of people to fulfill your destiny as the Dragonborn (a human that can learn dragon skills), learn Dragon-style shouts, & take the Dragons out once + for all - which is typical fantasy stuff. While the main quest is decent enough + is solid, it really feels like it's just another quest in the game - like many of the main quests in Elder Scrolls base-games since Morrowind. While Bethesda is no BioWare + no Obsidian when it comes to generating fantastic narrative, prose + dialogue - where Bethesda succeeds over just about every other of the game companies is creating insanely huge playgrounds that have a good deal normally going on w/ tons to accomplish, if you like what you're doing. Trust me - this is another addictive sandbox from Bethesda, in which you won't know how to let go of for a while or after being away for a while, it will eventually get you coming back for more. While not everything here is a home-run, there are also many good-to-great plots + storyline strings here - such as the Thieves Guild's quest-line + especially Dark Brotherhood quest-lines, that I don't even know where to begin. Skyrim will generate some random quests on its own, which often do wind-up in the Misc section - which could keep you going for a long time. As if the base-game couldn't do that enough already, making this game such a time-sink - throw in also that the game ships w/ the Toolkit these days & the ridiculous amount of mods out there b/c this series has an extremely heavy modding community + fanbase - you could live for 100's of hours in Skyrim, even long well after it takes finishing the insane amount of content that Bethesda has already provided. If there's something about Skyrim you don't like - i.e. the UI isn't that great, again; even though it's improved immensely over Oblivion - trust me, there's a mod out there to fix your issue w/ the game. For example - SkyUI Mod vastly improves + fixes Bethesda's UI-system immesely. By offering up a huge sandbox & an insane amount of things to do (from questing to exploring) here, Skyrim succeeds in proving again why Bethesda + their Elder Scrolls is 1 of the best - if not, the best - at providing addictive time-sink RPG's. Bethesda yet again offers up the kitchen sink here; I'll certainly drink to that + from that. RPG fans looking to get lost for 100's of hours, it's almost impossible to rival what Bethesda does in their games - & that's especially true here in Skyrim. Simply put - another RPG masterpiece from Bethesda. Final Grade = A+

review: Skyrim is easily one of the best games of this generation. Its one of the games that you get as much out of as you put in. Its also one of the games you play exactly how you want to play. You can choose to ignore the main story immediately after beginning or play through the quests like a linear action adventure game. Speaking of quests, theres an awful lot of them. The main story is centred on the return of dragons to the world. Pretty soon, you find out you are the legendary Dragonborn, a man or woman with the ability to consume dragon souls. Its your job to find out why the reptiles have returned and try and protect the world from this new menace. two thumbs from me! because the game deserves it.

review: This game is honestly the best game I've played. I've sat down and played countless hours on the elder scrolls games but this tops it off. A great follow up and so much better than elder scrolls online that was recently released as the next in the series. If you are skeptical of this game still I'm not done yet. There are thousands of hours of modding put in by a dedicated modding community that adds around 1000+ hours of new content just by using the mods from the workshop, if youve looked at the workshop and it doesnt look big with only 10,000 mods, you have the nexus with over 30,000 that adds so much to your game and if you have complaints there is a mod for it that changes it and makes your experience amazing and fully immersive. The game challenges you to patience and choosing the right moment to do things and it really adds in an immersive way of living in the elder scrolls with full ability to extend your abilites in the largest scale open world map ever made. You can slaughter a city of the rebels - the stormcloaks, or delve deep into dungeons recovering powerful artifacts that can help you on your way to the top of the chain. As your progress your story the way the people of skyrim treat you differentiates, you can slay a dragon and they start to say "Youve slain a few dragons in your time" Or when you become the whisperer of the dark brotherhood you find npcs every so often that use the dark brotherhood greeting "hail sithis". There is a whole new experience to everything you have ever experienced in a game. Buy the game.

review: The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is an epic fantasy RPG games where you can countless of hours in-game. You want to be an Archer? Grab a bow + heaps of arrows and start shooting people like a boss! You want to be a Swordsman? Wield or dual wield the countless amount of weapons in Skyrim and start slashing peoples! You want to be a Sneaky Basterd? Level up your One-handed, Sneaking, Speech, Lockpicking & Pickpocketing and you can be silent as f*ck killing people and grab their $$$ or talk your way through to get things go down your way! In this game, you imagine what you cannot achieve in real life. The world is massive, the mechanism is flawless and there's infinite amount of quest that you can do in this game. Of course there's bug here and there but in its way, this game is fun to play. Don't forget the amount of mods already available today. After 3 years of its release, this game is still living and mod is one of many reasons Skyrim still one of the most played game. I myself play this game with using mods that increase immersive such as RnD and I imagine being a Solo-Player like Kirito with Elucidator & Dark Repulser. Do what you want, be what you want. Welkommen to Skyrim!

review: I don't care what anyone says, Skyrim is one of the greatest games I have EVER played, I have dedicated SOOO much time into it, (Yes i know on my profile it says I haven't played it for all THAT long but I never really played it while connected to the internet so yeah) There was a time when I would play skyrim for close to 12 hours a day (yep sure did take my life away from me) It was actually my very first steam game. After dedicating even more time in TES IV Oblivion, I eventually got Skyrim in 2012 and I will admit that after creating all kinds of characters I did eventually get tired of it, that was until I discovered MMOxReview on Youtube (Great guy, check him out :)) I then started modding my skyrim game, and a once Great game turned into something legendary... Now to be honest I wasn't all THAT fond of the Main quest, BUT the thieves guild and Dark brotherhood in these games has always really inspired me, I just wish they could have made them both longer :( Unfortuantly I have never played the expansions for Skyrim seeing as though I can't afford it :( Yeah i know, sad isn't it, But that hasn't stopped me from playing Skyrim over and OVER again... TES Online... let's just say I probs will never play it because I just don't really like the looks of it. And I am VERY keen for TES VI (I think it is going to be set in Hammerfell) Please tell me if you would like me to write a guide for this game, I am quite happy to and I promise I won't use any of that noob language if i do. I highly recommend this game, I give it a score of 9.5/10 Have a nice day ;)

review: The anticipations were Very high for this game months before it's release, maybe even months before this game even had it's first piece of gameplay shown. Reason being it's successful predecessor The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion. A game that soley revolutionized the western RPG scene completely, with true next generation graphics and depths. Going even further back we have yet another giant and just an astonishly beautiful and incredible game - The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind. I can not begin to explain The Elder Scrolls to someone who never heard about it. The last 3 games have all recieved Game of the Year's and been just hands-down, non-negotiable, best selling and mind-blowing epic games. It is hard to talk about any individual Elder Scrolls game without mentioning any of the other games and the bigger picture. All the latest Elder Scrolls games are in the top 5 of my favorite games of all time, ALL THREE OF THEM. Hell, The Elder Scrolls series is better than the Half-Life series... Have you any idea what that means? How much confusion this causes to my beloved Half-Life? No you don't. These games are better than the best. One more paragraph of how awesome Elder Scrolls are before getting to Skyrim. These games keep my up at night, I dream of them by day, they make me smie, they make me cry, I love them, I hate them, they change me, they leave me, I conquer them, I resign to them, they are my soul, they are my heart, We are one. Oh Tamriel, why are you a fictional world? Why are you not real, I long for you, I live inside of you, from Vvardenfell to Summerset Isle, from the great glaciers of Skyrim to the cursed realm of Oblivion, from Fargoth the Bosmer to the Adoring Fan. If I ever truly worship something, it got to be The Elder Scrolls. You are my drug. Skyrim is the weakest of them. It's Morrowinds and Oblivions little sister. Yet it is the most popular one, how is that possible? Well there's just something about dragons, isn't there? An RPG with dragons is always an RPG with DRAGONS! Flying immortal beasts that breathe fire and are legends with the Gods themselves. Skyrim got very successful thanks to that console generations drought and the lack of good games to play, also because all Elder Scrolls games are being successful surprises. With at least 5 years in between each game the fan base have had a good long while to linger in their despair and demands, giving growth to something called Hype (Good example: Half-Life 3). I will never get to the actual game itself, will I? It's a western RPG! What else is there to say, expect role-playing with normal sized swords and not some Japanese bananza. You are set in the province of Skyrim, which is not the most northern one, but it sure as hell feels like it. Skyrim is like the opposite of a really good book, instead of giving you a story and the rest is up to your imagination - like books do. Skyrim gives you the imagination and you ARE the story, you play the Dragonborn, a son of Dragons, of Septim. The rest is up to you. Skyrim does not feel like home, oh no, you are in a hostile world where you constantly feel threatened. The key thing in Skyrim is the atmosphere, there is nothing quite like it. Same goes for all Elder Scrolls - again. So much visually appealing flora and architecture, a living world with animals and creatures roaming about. Then there is the Extremely in depth story that only the true fans will explore. Who were the Akaviri? What lies beyond Tamriel? what happened to the Dwemers? Nerevarine? Is Kvatch rebuilt? Is the Adoring Fan finally dead? Is Azura the best Godess Ever? etc. Questions that will live on through all games to come, questions that never can be truly answered because that would break the rules. You, whomever you choose to be, will slowly get used to this hostile world as you expore the story and build your own. Kill stuff, get loot and level up. Focus on Health, Stamina or Mana - depending on your class build; Brute force, Striking Speed or Cunning Magic. As you choose your path, you will encounter people to lead you and people to stop you, join the appropriate guild and do side quests. Take sides, fight battles, even fall in love and get married, buy or build (Hearthfire) a house, adopt a child. Encounter the most mythical of creatures - Spriggans, Werewolves, Giants, Vampires (Dawnguard). Use Shouts to cause only the havok Dragons can, or spend your time stealing from the rich and give to... yourself? In the end, you will stand all mighty and look upon yourself, like an author looks upon his work. You will look back on the days of struggle, on the days of joy - and you will realize that it's far from over. You will spend hundreds of hours in Skyrim, because that's what you are meant to do. Hopefully you will have more questions than ever when you leave the game aside. You will use this hunger to explore other worlds and look upon your real life and use the fictional beauty to define...

review: Wow! I spent almost 200 hours playing Skyrim and that was without any DLC. Excellent value for money. If you are a completionist and enjoy doing side-quests then this is the game for you. There is so much to do it is almost overwhelming, but an excellent map system can always keep you on track for your chosen quest. Brilliant game.

review: Before Skyrim, there was Oblivion. It was flawed, unbalanced, dated and had DLC for horse-armour, and yet it was still loved because despite these things, it was still one of the best games of this genre. Skyrim is Oblivion but without the bad bits. I still don't understand why there aren't more games like this. You are let loose in a massive open world and are allowed to do what ever you want. The closest games to it would be MMOs or Grand Theft Auto, but Skyrim is a single-player experience. You'd think that this would make it lifeless and unrewarding, but you couldn't be more wrong. The entire world is lovingly hand-crafted. Every character you see had to be placed there. They had their face, personality and clothing picked by a developer of this game... and then you're free to come along and end their life with one slash of a blade. Or not. The choice is yours. I didn't expect much from this game. I had kind of seen through Oblivion and it became lifeless for me, and I thought that since this was constrained by the same hardware that it wouldn't be a large leap, but I was so wrong. I couldn't wait to explore every crag and valley simply for the sake of it, accompanied by the amazing LOTR-style soundtrack. I happily gobbled up the quests and have had countless exciting memories of this game where I've accidentally picked a fight with some one bigger than me, or where the game glitches out spectacularly. What ever happens, it's a joy to behold. Even if you're not a fan of this sort of genre (come on, who isn't? The Elder Scrolls games are a genre in their own right!) you need to play this game. Get it when it's cheap and you'll more than get your money's worth, even if you only play a fraction of what there is to see and do. You can live a virtual life as a fisherman, merchant or fighter and unlike the older games which required a bit of imagination to pull off, this one has the depth and complexity required to make it enjoyable. The down-sides? The dragons are too easy to defeat, though this game has since been patched to include harder ones. You'll hate it when somebody dies through no fault of your own (damn you, radiant AI!) and you're left with an empty shop where you once purchased your stuff. You'll end up with far too much in your inventory as you plunder tombs and your companions become more of a burden than a help as you level up, transforming into mules to carry your rubbish as you battle against the undead. But really, who is going to be reading this review without an idea of what this game is like? Who hasn't seen the thousands of mods available for free for this game? They make the vanilla 100's of hours of gameplay turn into 1000's. You'll have no life for weeks after picking this game up! In short: buy this game.

review: Skyrim is by far the best video game There is so much freedom so much exploring and you can always find something to do in this game. The graphics are incredible which leads to incredible landscape views all the around the world. There is plenty of things to fight, places to go and things to find. There is also hundreds of items in the game . The game is very complex so you may think it is hard to learn but when I played for the first time I got the feel for the game in only days! and most i like the mod especialy the kaboobies ;p I highly recommend this game!

review: The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim has got to be one of the most worked on games of 2011 and 2 years on, it still doesn't fail to impress. The amazing work put into the game has definitly paid off with hours upon hours of things to do. The game works amazing on every platform from PS3, Xbox and PC. As I have experienced from the console versions, the loading screens take quite a long time and there are many glitches that happen every time you play. This is 100% different with the PC version as the loading screens are very quick, even on the top graphics settings and the glitches are much less frequent. Pros: - Amazing graphics - Amazing stroyline - A high selection of weapons - Amazing character interface - Easy to use controls - Large amount of side quests Cons: - A few glitches I would give The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim a well earned 10/10!

review: The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is one of those games that ultimately grants you the freedom to do the things that you can only do in your imaginative mind. For example, you can kill people in bars, villages, castles, stands, anytime you want, however you want. Killing by doing a finishing touch is my favorite part of the game. You can have a pet, wife, build a house and do a lot of varied things. Though what makes this game better is the mods, you can do tons of things with it and do a lot of hilarious crap, stunts, sex, movie scenes and other crazy stuff. This game just never ends and there's always things to do even if you don't want to do quests. Dragons, monsters, spirits, horses, women, potatoes, and stealing things craftily are all huge features in the game. Now, finally, don't be like me who waited to buy this game on sale and not pay the full price of it. Because it is definitely worth your money!

review: I've been a fan of The Elder Scrolls series for a while, and I think Skyrim is definitely a worthy addition to that line of games. Skyrim is a huge, immersive, lore-filled, immense world full of character. You can explore, fight, collect, or just wander around like a tourist taking screenshots. Even after playing for a couple of years, I still constantly find new places to explore and new experiences to be had. Everything about this game is extremely detailed and well thought-out, from the crafting system to the player homes, from dungeon layouts, to the races of the different NPCs you encounter and the way they use their culture to express themselves in their clothing, armor, weapons, homes, and towns. If the hundreds of hours offered by the game itself isn't enough, there are literally thousands of mods for Skyrim, offering everything from texture enhancements to full cinematic lighting effects. There are hours and hours of additional fan-made quests and storylines, in addition to the three official DLC expansions offered by Bethesda. New NPCs, pets, followers, houses, towns, armor, weapons, food, ingredients -- you can probably find a mod to change or add to almost any aspect of Skyrim. In this way, you can keep the game fresh and new, even after hundreds of hours of play. If you break it down to dollars spent per hour played it's probably one of the best deals in gaming.

review: Skyrim is amazing, defiantly recommend for medieval lovers. Here is a poem I wrote about Skyrim! Skyrim the sky was blue, it was true snowy mountains, huge lands the one who seeks adventure didn't know what he had inside what he could do, with the power could he fly, could he reach the sky no, but he was the dragonborn the one and only who could defeat the ancient ones the ones who could fly, glide and attack track their foes, eat their toes the dragonborn can intake their soul he can kill any sort of troll sword slashing, kicking and bashing loot the things you have killed sell the items, receive money and then buy a bunny burn a chicken, raid a house be stealthy like a tiny mouse get married or become a wizard like Harry Potter level up by doing quests to become the best but now you're crying because the villager was lying then you come back into reality and realise it`s only a game!

review: This game is not a "love it or hate it", it's a "love it AND hate it". Sometimes while playing I think to myself: "This is THE game, it's just a dream come true, is it real?", but the next moment it might change to: "This is the most stupid waste of time I've ever paid for". First of all, it is HUGE. It is enormous. I've done 300 hours into it and I'm still in the middle of the main quest. It's got everything: fights, spells, potions, horses, dogs, children, marriages, dragons, clothes, bookcases, treasure maps, grocery stores, pagan worshipping, war, armageddon, waterbreething, dead naked sorceresses in bikinis, mysterious ancient civilisations, glowing mushrooms, mammoths, zombies and lots, lots, lots of bugs. It is very beautiful, especially at night, when you see the northern lights shining, but also very ugly when the low and high resolution textures are messing up in front of you. It's got so many quests, tasks, characters and places, I think even developers don't know them all. It is a gem for those who like to explore and discover the territory for themselves. Each cave has something in it, each ruin might conceal a secret, each village might have a mystery to uncover. The freedom of choice given to the player is unnatural. You can be a werewolf, a vampire, a mage, a warrior, an archer, a thief, an assassin, a blacksmith, a miner, an alchemist, on top of the dragonslayer and The Chosen One, and most of that you can be at the same time. This schizophrenic development of the character results in a no less chaotic gameplay. You have swords, bows, daggers, maces, spells, magic staffs, magic scrolls, and dragon shouts, all of which you can use as weapons. You meet all sorts of enemies and you're free to deal with them by any means you prefer. There is no special weapon for a giant. You don't really have to use spells against a mage. Moral choices are also a blur. There is no "proper" or "right" way, really, you just do stuff and get stuff happen as a result. It's not a bad thing to use conjuration spells, necromancy is not punishable, poisons are as legal as healing potions, there is no white or black magic. Sometimes it's impossible to understand if you're doing good or bad. I think the only thing that stops freedom from being absolute is the quests. If developers would remove the quest lines as such, turning them into a mass of random tasks you can perform in any sequence, at any time (and preferably at any place with any character), it would make the game a triumph of freedom (and a complete mess). So, Skyrim is a beautiful, ugly, strict, messy, very stupid and very clever game, which everyone should play at least once. On the easy level it is almost casual, no effort is required to deal with the fights. It can be played on a Mac through Crossover, but it is sluggish no matter how low the graphics settings are.

review: This game is the most enjoyful and expensive drug that will ever be created. This game is just amazing! Great game and PC mods make it look amazing and a lot more fun. There is no doubt about this game being Game of the Year following Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion. This game is fantastic with its detail and perfected gameplay that puts gaming in RPG's on a whole new level. I am looking forward to the next installment of the Elder Scrolls whenever they can get it out as quickly as possible. However long that may be I will be putting my hours and life into this game as it requires that devotion with all the quests and aspects to understand them. I have played other generations of Elder Scrolls and I have not been disappointed yet. This is a fantastic franchise of games

review: How could anyone not love Skyrim? With mods abound to customize your game, it's a game that keeps on giving long after you get into it. I absolutely love this game, and if I wasn't running on a very weak computer I'd probably never stop playing it and modding it. I suggest Skyrim to anyone who has never played it, or even playing it on PC vs Console (the modding capabilities to change the way your game looks and plays are so much better than console -- take it from someone who first played Skyrim on her Xbox.) Absolutely well worth the money and an excellent game that you cannot put down.

review: Step 1 - Buy the game Step 2 - Mod the game until someone comes to your room and asks you ''What movie is this?'' The campaign is short but a great one. You have to save the world from the dragons who are led by Alduin, the most evil dragon....basically that is all there is when it comes to the campaign. But apart from that there is a story you create on your own with a rich and detailed open world to explore and million other cool side missions to do. This game doesn't hold your hand at all, you can approach the game in anyway you want by becoming a Thief, a Vampire, a Werewolf etc etc you can also join different groups like the Dark Brotherhood for example, you can join the empire and become an Imperial or join the Stormcloak rebels to free Skyrim from the empire influence. Crafting, Smithing, Enchanting, Marriage, Adoption, Purchase a house, Learning spells, Cooking etc, this game has so much to offer it will literally consume you. Astonishing graphics (especially with mods), amazing soundtracks and endless quests. This game is a masterpiece! Worth every penny! Personal Rating: 10/10 Greatest Open World RPG of all times

review: Where has this game been all my life?! Seriously, it's one of the best games I've ever played. The world, Skyrim, is so huge and you will always find stuff to do, you will always discover something new, something you haven't seen before. I really don't know what to say about the game - I'm still so amazed at it. It's just super awesome and totally worth the money since you (probably) will spend hundrets of hours in Skyrim. So if you haven't already: Make sure to try it out one day.

review: It may seem odd to review a game I have not finished, so take that into account as you read this. I first played the Elder Scrolls series with Morrowind. Back then I thought it was the coolest thing ever. Huge world, tons of monsters and weapons. At the time though I was big into MMOs so I felt very disconnected from the game. Alone. So my time with the game was short, and I never finished the main campaign. When Oblivion came out, I gave it a try, and instantly was reminded of Morrowind and why I lost interest in the game. So I probably played it for only a few hours my first time in. Elder Scrolls games are a fickle thing though... you see screenshots, hear about other people having fun, see Mod updates, and before you know it. BOOM. Right back in you go and you forget why you ever left. My right back in was Skyrim. So much hype, so much graphical goodness. I resisted for a LONG time, then came a Steam Sale and I was in. The game... Wow, so much better. Is it the dragons? Hell yes it is the dragons! I have about 50+ hours on record as I type this, and I go off and on playing the game so as not to get burned out on it. I modded it up as best I could and I think it makes it that much better. Graphics - Just amazing! Even unmodded this game looks stunning. Character models less so than the world itself, but still a great show for the eyes. Sound - I'm no audiophile, but I tend to get drawn in more if the sound is good. This game does not disappoint. Music, voice acting, sound effects, all perfect. The first time I fought a dragon, and it came swooping in and bathed the ground around me in fire, I was amazed at how awesome it sounded (surround sound headset of course!). Do yourself a favor and really crank the volume. Again, I am not finished the game. Will I ever? Who knows, and who cares. I am having fun so that is all that matters. If you are holding off for similar reasons that I was, wait for a sale like I did. But don't deny yourself the experience if you can. It is totally worth it.

review: Ok, so the first thing i have to say here is that i'm in love with this game XD When i first saw the trailer for Skyrim i was like: "ohh...ok...another awesome video, filled with some good actions scenes and a lot of graphic magic to make it look better than the game really is...", meaning i liked the trailer but was kinda unsure if it was true to the game or if i was gonna be dissapointed to have an enhanced video and then the game would be below the expectations of it. BUT...this was the FIRST TIME EVER that a game completelly surprised me, i was blown away the first time i was able to play the game. Skyrim trully delivered what it was offering in the trailer. It's a big game and has a LOT to explore and a lot of hours for the players to get lost in it XD Its a massive game with a vast world to explore, lots of races to choose from to keep you satisfied, a bunch of weapons and spells to your hearts content, enumerous monsters and enemies to fight, so many roads and choices you can make to decide your fate in the storyline and you can be anything and follow each and every road in one single character, you don't have to start a new game to uncover all the paths in the game. Of course if you want to fully explore the game to its limits you will have to play with other races to discover some tiny things that are specific to each race. You can be anyone and do almost everything is the game: be a hunter and slay wild animals; be a miner and explore the depts of mines and find rare minerals; become a fearsome warrior and fight for the rebels agains the empire; join the companions and become a fearsome beast and transform into a werefolf to fight your enemies; explore the dark arts and become an assassin to work for hire for the dark brotherhood; join the thieves guild and become a master in sneaking, lockpicking, stealing and killing your enemies with one blow without them even noticing you; join the college of Winterhold, learn and practice to master all the spells to become a powerful arch-mage.... I could go on and on and on, on what you could do inside the game hehehe...........is THAT big :D I do advise to take some time to fully explore this game, this is not one of those games on wich you play like a speddy to get to the end and know the finalle. Its a waste to go and play it like that so do take your time, explore and uncover its secrets, its gonna be worth it :) The controls and gameplay are very easy to master in a couple of minutes so you will move around like you own the place in no time. At first, you must take your time and explore the skyrim world to find all the locations you need to go. It consumes a bit of time (but you won't even trully notice it if you're doing quests), the less patient people might complain about it a bit but once you discover all locations you can teleport to that location anytime you want in the future, thru your map. Map and menus are very easy to use as well and are very simple and well explained. You have every information you need explicit on your inventory and other menus. All the info for the quests is also there in the quests log, all you have to do is activate it and follow the arrows, litterally LOL but be advised that in a few quests and side-quests you may not encounter all the work done for you to acomplish it and you need to do a little digging yourself. Your character keeps evolving thru out the entire game(and after you end it as weel if you keep playing with the same character), it levels up as you use your powers, skills and as you finish quests, wich gives you some skill points to use as you see fit. I also strongly advise to always keep multiple saves, the game isn't all that glichy or even has a lot of bugs but, as every game, its not without its flaws. Sometimes you might get stuck on a mission or an AI character might not be doing what it should...it autosaves but to prevent that from happening you should always keep an extra pair of saves, its not a big thing and it doesnt consume much time, it takes less than a minute to do it and it ensures that your game runs smoothdly and you can always go back if you did something wrong or if you wanna deal with a situation differently. OK this review is going long so i'll just finish up by saying its a 5 star game for me and i strongly advise you guys to, at least once, try and play the game and dont jump into conclusions by what other people say, unless you have played the game yourselves.

review: Skyrim is awesome. Whilst working on a quest you find a note in the world that makes you pursue another quest. This goes on until you no longer remember what your original goal was, that is the beauty of Skyrim and Elder Scrolls. Exploration, rewarding gameplay, choices (you are not given as much freedom in choices as you were in Morrowind, though) and funny  bugs that have always defined Elder Scrolls to me.

And if you are board of the vanilla quests, or you just compleated them all (highly unlikely) Skyrim is one of the easiest games to mod, workshop and nexis combined! Also, quest mods aren't the only mods out thare. Thare are follower mods, weppon mods, magic mods, and so much more! If you don't alredy have the game, take it from me... GET THE GAME!!! 753 stars out of 5. You will most likely never get board in this game! you can spend a year on the game and still not compleat all of the quests. I hope this helped, and I hope you get this game.

review: Well,what can i say about skyrim(i am brazilan ,so if my english is not as good as it should be sorry)skyrim is a game about someone who wake up in carriage and is going to be executed be things he/she did or not ,everything could be just a mistake or this "someone" could have killed a whole city, a king or nothing,when "someone" is going to be executed when a dragon (that can be his worst enemy or a "friend" it depends of one little(or not) thing that i will say later) shouts and stops the executation of "someone" (ironically or not) saving his life, someone will later be helped by two mans, one stormcloak(nord rebels that want skyrim to be of the nords again, and destroy the imperials) and one imperial (imperial is a race and a faction the imperials want to stop the stormcloack and... i think is just this) "someone" is very lucky ,later he/she will or not discover that he/she can absorv dragon souls and use a thing called shout, and that he/she is something called dragonborn/dovahkinn ,this someonecan have great adventures , "someone" can own and build a house,get married,adopt a child,be a vampire or a vampire hunter,can defeat the first dragonborn/dovahkin ,ride dragons, help the daedra and get special artifacts as a reward,ride horses,fight giants,dragons,undeads,machines and other things, explore the dwemer/dwarve ruins,become the leader of the companions,the archmage of the college of winterhold ,the commander/or something like this of the imperial/stormcloaks ,and many many other things. but returning to someone what his story(that is the little thing)? what race is he/she? is it male or female? you decided and everything will happen in skyrim a beatiful place that has some "dimensional problems" like dead things starting to fly like... cows,dead bodys suddently dissapearing and other thigns skyrim is a open world rpg ,but what is special about skyrim? it is like a book that every time that you read a page another two pages appears on the book,you make your own decisions ,your own story or take a pre-made history and build made by other player ,make or use mods, that can add a little change or change the whole skyrim to something better or worst now my personal opinion, skyrim is the best rpg i played in my whole life, i hope you enjoy it and help this already big community of player become even bigger,if you have enough money i suggest you to buy it,then install take something to eat and drink sit in a comfortable place like your bed or a chair and put (if you have ) your headphones listen or not a music or skyrim soundtrack and have fun (ps: don't lost opportunities because you were playing skyrim)

review: Who's rapping? Dovahkiin Dragons? I'm not over keen I'll dice them like a knife Slicing right through an aubergine. My dragon shout flow Is sweeter than a SodaStream You won't belive your eyes I'm like an overload of dopamine A broadsword in one hand,and a magic spell in the other. I'm the last of the Dragonborn There's no other,my brother so run for cover. If you've got scales,then I'm on your tail,and I will not fail. Like a free-roaming sandbox game. I'm off the rails,I'll walk the trail,through awful gales,and storms of hail. 'Til all the nails Are knocked into your coffin,I'm not stopping. 'Til you're impaled,and I've prevailed. In the name of the Nords,I pray to the lords. You all get a taste of the blade of my sword. I'm taking on hordes of enemies,I face them with hoards of weaponry. They're draining my force,so chemistry comes into play with retorts and recipes. Alchemixing like a DJ,Restoration,restore my energy. My legacy,odyssey,elegy,prophecy's,written in heavenly bodies,and buried with every body that ever did bother to mess with me deading them terribly,horribly,I'm a celebrity,honestly,you're a wannabe,I'm a prodigy. The suggestion you're better than me at being a warrior? Ha! comedy. It's a gift to me,I don't just spit flames lyrically,but literally,and the Elder Scrolls are scripts,in witch I've written your obituary. I am the Dragonborn,wearing a hat with badass horns. I'm Dovahkiin,known globally,You're nobody at all. =) BY DAN BULL )

review: Oh my god, who doesn't think this game is a game of the year? Sure it has it's fair share of glitches but please name one, GREAT, game that doesn't glitch and heck, half the time their quite funny. It's an amazing single-player experience you'll only get once every few years. I started playing it once and could never stop, it's so fun. Over 800 hours in this game i can tell you that this game is a must buy if you don't have it. The only things that could be improved on this is perhaps a co-op mode because who else thinks exploring Tamrial with a friend is awesome? This game is so immense, chocked full of wonderful content. This is a must buy, 10/10

review: Skyrim is the best game I've played in a long time, I love it, I have it on Ps3 and PC. The mods will keep you entertained once you have played it for 200+ hours, Which is one of the reasons to have this on the pc. If you're thinking about getting this game you deffinitly should! It keeps you entertained for hours and it feels like minutes.

review: Skyrim is one of those breath taking video games that goes on to become a Legend. The open world gameplay will make the world come alive to you. While you are the main character, not everyone else revolves around you and your character. You will find npc hunting, working their day to day jobs, children running and playing tag, people praying to their gods and much more. But you still can interact with them. which can start new quest's, the option to have a follower and more. The main quest line alone is a piece of art and will keep you busy for a good bit of time. If you really enjoy your social life than this game is not for you. Because once you start; your not likely to stop anytime soon. Good luck on your new adventure hero and Don't forget to check out the mods for this game. There are quest mods to add even more gameplay hours, New weapons, Player homes, new worlds, and Even exploding chickens.

review: The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, one of the most in-depth games you will ever encounter. Many quests and stories to tell, you can instantly conjecture when you are born into the world of Skyrim. In the beginning of the game, you emerge as a captive member held by the imperial army, captive from trying to cross the border of Skyrim. Sitting in the carriage with your fellow captive thieves and bandits, questioning where you are flowing. As youre held captive by the solders in the carriage, being carried over the roads to Helgan. As youre being kicked off the carriage, held in your queues to your beheading, you notice your foes worried about a large scream across the lands of Skyrim. As you place your head on the pedestal, ready for your penalty, the scream becomes stronger. All of the sudden, a dragon appears, landing upon the castle to your left, he speaks in his dragon tongue and destroys Helgan. This is your time to escape, and begin your journey in the world of Skyrim. Who knows what this frozen land has in store for you. The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is a action role-playing game, allowing you to create and customise your character, join a race and choose how your character handles in dangerous encounters, there is a range of possibilities to role-play in the world of Skyrim. The game is playable in a first person perspective or in a third person perspective, both can be toggled easily by using the scroll wheel. The game encourages you to freely roam the environment, finding dungeons, towns, abstract structures and a range of side-quests to find while following the main quest, this allows the player to freely choose which quests the player can freely choose to conquest. The atmosphere the world of Skyrim creates is outstanding. Viewing this frozen nation in its misfortune is interesting and viewing the world revovle around you. As you progress throughout of the story, you get view different cultures and view how people live in various cities as you progress through the story. You can fully view how people and what people are willing to do to survive the events and the catastrophe of the lands of Skyrim. Viewing the scenery at its best adds to the atmosphere, looking out into the distance and spotting the large mountains standing tall and superior with a hint of snow on the peak, ruins standing, capable of anything, do you dare to enter? Then looking down the plains of land, grass blowing in the wind. The scenery an essential characteristic to the world of Skyrim. Graphically, the game is outstanding, this statement is considered even without graphical modifications. The game has high resolution textures, this being the ultra graphical setting, but if youre feeling curious, you can get even better textures with the free downloadable content that Bethesda Game Studios offer. Adding onto the graphical discussion on The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is something I mentioned earlier, the scenery. The scenery is just breath-taking. If these visuals arent enough for you, the graphical modifications created by the community are phenomenal, I couldnt recommend more that you browse through some videos on YouTube of them, but on the negative side, some are very intensive to your computer unlike the default textures. Talking about the performance of The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, the game is polished and the performance is outstanding. This is a enormous statement, but the game could almost run perfectly well on any PC. Ive know many people who have ran The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim on a laptop without messing with any graphical settings, running smoothly of course. This truly shows the effort in the development cycle that Bethesda Game Studios has put into the game. On the unfortunate side of this, I wish that the game was supported for multiple operating systems, but alternatives can be found to still play the game on different operating systems. Content; the department that The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim does not disappoint. Approximately the game has around 300 + hours of content, this isnt including modifications. If you feel that this isnt enough, you have modifications to add extra quests and various other content, The Elder Scrolls community is talented for creating these outstanding modifications. Now finally, to the conclusion to The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. This game is well worth every single penny, the amount of effort that the developers have established into this game. To you, the reader, I recommend you buy this game, take your time while playing the game to look at the detail this game contains because this game deserves the title along the side of the Elder Scrolls games.

review: Having played 90+ hours of Skyrim this past week, I figured that I should write a review on it. First of all, I had to said this is an amazing SandBox+ RPG experience. I am someone who enjoyed doing side quests as well as misc quests as a mean to earn more money. I got to say that till now I had not finish the story as there are so much more to do. I was pleasantly surprised initially when I see people with over 2000~4000+ hours of gameplay time. All I can say is Skyrim had just that much content especially if you include all the DLCS. I mean just building a single house took me more than 2 hours, not to mention the fact that I had to design and decorate my own house. It pretty much a chore that feel great after you are done with it. I am also barely done exploring Skyrim after 90 hours in, the combat are extremely fluid and animated especially when you do a sneak attack. There are many other great elements in Skyrim such as pick-locking which can be extremely frustrating but fun to play around with. I had never been this impressed with a RPG before and I definitely think Skyrim is by far the best I had played so far for this price. I definitely recommend this game to every RPG lovers, you won't ever regret it especially if you enjoyed other RPG such as The Witcher as well as Fable.

review: The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim: -Field Rating 9 -Graphics 9 About Graphics: -Skyrim is a beautiful game, made even more beautiful by the extremely active modding community. The engine was a wonderful leap from the previous engine we saw in Oblivion and the Fallout series. The details in the environments are wonderful reminders of just how intricate the world really is. -Gameplay 9 About Gameplay: -Skyrim lives up to its Elder Scrolls name, granting us the freedom to craft our own story, in a gigantic world where you can spend hours simply exploring. The combat has seen a huge improvement since the days of Oblivion, with the ability to dual-wield chaning up gameplay styles wonderfully. The physics however, are still as wonky as ever. Sometimes with hilarious results. You won't get tired of wandering around this world. -Story 9 About Story: Enough interest to drive you forward, and plenty of lore to keep you distracted, Skyrim finds the wonderful balance of permeating the world with the story, yet giving you the freedom to advance the plot when you wish. Multiplayer: No Depressingly: no. Replay-ability: 9 -The only thing that will stop you from coming back to Skyrim for awhile is completely burning yourself out. But then the cycle repeats. Overall 9/10 -Being a long time Elder Scrolls fan, Skyrim was a welcome breath after the much loved, much played Oblivion. The freedom, the scope, and the environment are great. The graphics are beautiful. Though none of the Elder Scrolls since Morrowind have yet captured the full extent of the magic that made Morrowind so great, Skyrim has been a huge push in the right direction. A must buy for any RPG or open-world gaming fan.

review: Wow. The only word that I can use to describe this game is "Misleading." I have over 320 hours on this game, and I have yet to even see the Skyrim. I've tried Googling the location of the rim, but to no avail. This game doesn't even have helicopters to use to even get to the rim! Like, wtf Activision? Fix your game. This is the biggest waste of 74 Euros ever. I even installed the Beautiful Males mod because I got tired of looking at Battlefield to get me off, and that doesn't even do it. The  physics are atrocious. No flopping, no particle effects, nothing. Why would you put naked men in the game if it isn't even arousing? I guess the snow is ok, but nowhere near the quality of the snow in that one level of Call of Duty. I can't remember which one, though. Graphics - 2/10 Gameplay - 1/10 (WAAAYYYY better on consoles)  physics - 2/10 (Left too much to the imagination) Snow - 6/10 (I'm being generous with this one) Overall - 10/10 - A fantastic game with an amazing storyline. You can play it fer dayz.

review: Quite honestly, I thought I would regret buying this game again after having 100s of hours in it on Xbox 360. Oddly enough, I didn't. Even after completing everything this game has to offer (which I might add, is a ton), mods give this game a complete new life. Sure, Skyrim isn't the best Elder Scrolls to date, but it's pretty damn good. Even if you've played it on a console system before, it's not the same. This game is a must have for any RPG lover.

review: Skyrim is the perfect example of how a vast and addictive adventure game is done, without overloading the player with Witcher-like  complexity. You begin the game picking only your race and from then, what type of fighter you are is completely built off of how you play, making for endless possibilities of the fighter you can become. It is a poor idea to just stick to the main story all throughout, because it will leave you at a disadvantage if you ignore the varying side quests and beautiful exploration, which allow you to uncover some of the best equipment as well as enhance your skills and levels. This in turn, has given me a massive playtime of 37 hours so far and the main story still only feels like it's a quarter of the way through! This is a fantastic watercooler game, allowing for you and your friends to share hours of stories about your unique adventures and play style in Skyrim. If you have the system specs and you love exploration, DO NOT MISS THIS GAME!

review: TL;DR end of review. This game: -Has a magnificent story. -Cheats -Awesome Mods (Nexus) -Open World -Do almost anything -And the list goes on. If I had more money, I'd buy 10 more copies of this game for anyone who really needs to play it. In this game you can: -Go Anywhere -Kill anyone -Scream -Get married -Buy a house -Kill dragons -Eat (dragon) souls without being a ginger -Store a thousand item in your inventory -Climb mountains on a horse -Duel with losers ingame -Travel -Explore a wide vareity of places, cities, villages, dungeons and many more -Have a cute lady follow you everywhere and defend you (better with sexy mods). Too long, didn't read (TL;DR) -----Buy this game, don't pirate it.----- -----The developers deserve more than pirated downloads of the game.----- -----This game is totally worth you $20 (or $5 if sales)----- Support the developers, think about it, if you don't buy their amazing games, they may go bankrupt and not make good games like Skyrim, Fallout NV, Dishonored, etc. then we'd get stuck with  EA and Ubisoft. You can't buy anything in this game for real money. It wouldn't rip you off. Spend $20 for this game and play forever instead of buying another overpriced game from another game developing company. Thanks for reading.

The storyline is vast however completed the campaign in 1 week and the side quests i believe will take months which i will enjoy alot. Thanks to the steam community for Skyrim mods it is great and gives lots of laughs and hours of gameplay. Muskets, new swords and clothes are great to add into the game and my Dragonborn is now fully equipped for battle , taken out Miraak and now building a good armour set however nothing beats the Eleven blades, armour and bows.
