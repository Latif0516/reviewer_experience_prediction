review: This is the game the never, ever ends. I picked this game up thinking I wouldn't like it having never played a previous TES game before. Sat in my Library untouched for about a month or two, and finally took the plunge. I was wrong. I was so very, very wrong. This is probably the best purchase I've ever made on steam. Add in the unlimited potential of modding, and it's an adventure that continues forever. I've probably restarted over a hundred times by now with a new character, and still only have beaten Alduin once. ONCE. There's still so much more do to and explore that I'm still discovering quests and areas and little hidden things. I still can't believe how much there is to do and I'm still finding more. At it stands I'll probably wake up one day having lost all touch with reality and actually start seeing the world as Skyrim with how much I've played. And I'm totally ok with that.

review: If I had to choose between this game, and my girlfriend. I'd pick this game. EDIT: I'm single now ON A MORE SERIOUS NOTE: This game is the best in its genre. In previous Bethesda games they made a sad balance in between Questing, and Exploration. Some having more quests and less places to go, and others having very few quests and more places to explore. But in Skyrim, there is no shortage of quests, and if you are like myself and just wander around aimlessly, you will stumble into places that just blow your mind. Every time I have replayed this game, I stumbled into something new. For more info i'd very much recommend mods, with mods such as texture packs, difficulty, quests, armor, and weapons, this games replay value is endless. Go through the game once with plain skyrim, then mod the hell out of it. Overall I'd rate this game an EASY 10/10. If you haven't already. Please buy it, give it a little, and I swear you will be hooked.

review: An epic game made all the more epic by the fact that it is so easy to mod and so well supported by the modding community. The Elder Scrolls series has a large following and often you will hear people argue over each new TES game comparing it to the last, but for me each TES game stands on its own merits, and Skyrim is no exception. The story is pretty good and there are plenty of side quests, but what makes Skyrim so great even when not modded is its large and open nature. This is a land you can just pick a direction and with no quest in mind and just explore. You will find danger and excitement on your journey ... and loot. Lots and lots of loot. But once you start modding this game, that is when you unlock the true value that is Skyrim. Potentially thousands more hours content (for free) in a game that can be improved ten thousand different ways from graphics, textures and sounds all the way to game mechanics and user interface changes. You can make the game exactly what you need it to be, and play it for so long you may still be playing when the next game in this series comes out.... and sometimes longer than even that. If you are interested in modding the PC version of the game, be sure to check out my guide for beginners:

review: I was stacking books on a shelf in my house in Whiterun, one of Skyrim's major cities, when I noticed a weapon rack right beside it. I set a sacrificial dagger in one slot, an Orcish mace in the other. They were on display for nobody but me and my computer-controlled housecarl, Lydia, who sat at a table patiently waiting for me to ask her to go questing. The chest upstairs was reserved for excess weapons and armor, the bedside table for smithing ingots and ores, the one next to the Alchemy table for ingredients. I'd meticulously organized my owned virtual property not because I had to, but because tending to the minutia of domestic life is a comforting break from dealing with screaming frost trolls, dragons, a civil war, and job assignments that never seem to go as planned. It's even a sensible thing to do; a seemingly natural component of every day existence in Skyrim, one of the most fully-realized, easily enjoyable, and utterly engrossing role-playing games ever made. Part of what makes it so enjoyable has to do with how legacy Elder Scrolls clutter has been condensed and in some cases eliminated. In Skyrim, there's no more moon-hopping between hilltops with a maxed out Acrobatics skill. That's gone, so is Athletics. The Elder Scrolls V pares down the amount of skills and cuts out attributes like Endurance and Intelligence altogether. There's no time wasted on the character creation screen agonizing over which skills to assign as major. You don't assign major and minor skills at all, but instead pick one of ten races, each with a specific bonus. High Elves can once a day regenerate magicka quickly, Orcs can enter a berserk rage for more effective close-range combat. These abilities are best paired with certain character builds  the High Elf regeneration is useful for a magic user  but don't represent a rigid class choice. Major decisions don't need to be made until you're already out in the world and can try out magic, sneaking and weapon combat, emphasizing first-hand experience over instruction manual study, letting you specialize only when you're ready. It contributes to the thrilling sense of freedom associated with life in Skyrim. Do a quest, kill a dragon, snatch torchbugs from the air, munch on butterfly wings or simply wander while listening to one of the best game soundtracks in recent memory. Despite the enormity of the world and the colossal amount of content contained within, little feels random and useless. Even chewing on a butterfly wing has purpose, as it reveals one of several alchemical parameters later useful in potion making at an alchemy table. Mined ore and scraps of metal from Dwemer ruins can be smelted into ingots and fashioned into armor sets, pelts lifted from slain wildlife can be turned into leather armor sets, and random books plucked from ancient ruins can trigger hidden quest lines that lead to valuable rewards. Skyrim's land mass is absolutely stuffed with content and curiosities, making every step you take, even if it's through what seems like total wilderness, an exciting one, as something unexpected often lies just over the next ridge. Many times the unexpected takes the form of a dragon. Sometimes they're purposefully placed to guard relics, sometimes they swoop over cities and attack at seemingly random times. In the middle of a fight against a camp of bandits a dragon might strike, screaming through the sky and searing foe and friendly alike with frost or flame. Momentarily all on the battlefield unite, directing arrows and magic blasts upward to knock down the creature, creating impromptu moments of camaraderie -- a surprising change from what may have been yet another by-the-numbers bandit camp sweep. Dragons show up often, their presence announced by an ominous flap of broad wings or an otherworldly scream from high above. The scale and startling detail built into each creature's appearance and animations as it circles, stops to attack, circles again and slams to the ground makes encounters thrilling, though their predictable attack patterns lessen the excitement after a few battles. In the long run they're far less irritating than the Oblivion gate equivalent from The Elder Scrolls IV, can be completed in a few minutes, and always offer a useful reward. Killing a dragon yields a soul, which powers Skyrim's new Shout system. These are magical abilities any character can use, you don't have to specialize in spell casting to slow time, throw your voice, change the weather, call in allies, blast out ice and fire, or knock back enemies with a rolling wave of pure force. Even if you favor sword, shield and heavy armor and ignore magic entirely, you'll still be able to take full advantage of these abilities provided you find the proper words  each Shout has three  hidden on Skyrim's high snowy peaks and in the depths of forgotten dungeons, serving as another reason to continue exploring long after you've exhausted the main quest story, joined with the Thieves Guild, fought alongside the Dark Brotherhood, or thrown your support behind one of the factions vying for control of Skyrim. Not only is this land under assault by dragons, long thought to be dead, it's also ripped in two by civil war. You can choose one side or the other, but so much of the allure of Skyrim is how, even outside of the confines of quest lines, the embattled state of the world is evident, and steeped in a rich fictional legacy. Lord of the Rings this is not, but with the release of every Elder Scrolls game, the fiction becomes denser, and the cross-referencing for long-time fans all the more rewarding. Skyrim's residents are all aware of current events. They'll comment on the civil war, some sympathizing with the rebels, others thinking the establishment sold its soul. The peasants complain about the Jarls who control each settlement, the Jarls complain about the rebels or foreign policy, the overprotective College librarian complains when I drop dragon scales all over his floor; many characters feel like whole, distinct personalities instead of vacuous nothings that hand out quests like a downtown greeter hands out flyers for discount jeans. Characters stereotype based on race, they double-cross at even the slightest hint it might be profitable, and they react to your evolving stature within the world. It makes a ridiculous realm, filled with computer-controlled cat people and humanoid reptiles, demon gods and dragons, feel authentic, like a world that existed long before you showed up and will continue to exist long after you leave.

review: Okay, where do I start? General: This game is able to shock you and make you laugh time and time again, even when playing it for the 3'rd time. It takes about 130 - 200 hours of playtime to finish all of the quests, and I guarantee that in the time you will not discover everything there is to discover. If you do not feel like questing, take some time mining, scaring people with magic and shouts, undressing them, stealing, stealthing, killing dragons or giants, throwing cabbages around or simply reading 1 of about 250 integrated ingame books and stories. Graphics: This game has pulled off something I have thought to be impossible and pushed the whole gaming industry to the new levels. It has successfully integrated superb graphics into a lot of content. World is beautiful, vast and full of variety and although a bit dark by default this can very easily be changed by just picking one mod from the workshop. Workshop: Why does this deserve a special tab? Because thanks to workshop, earlier mentioned 200 hours of gameplay easily turn into thousands of hours of gameplay. Don't like any part of the game? Change it! Modify it! Add to it! A huge amount of mods are being made every day, and whether they spawn an extra cupcake in your house or add new cities with their own storylines they will all change your experience and prolong the fun. Name what you want to do, it exists. ALL OF IT. Cons: - Few possible glitches, but all have their fix, just need to be googled out. - A bit too confusing and overwhelming at the start. A lot of unanswered questions may put you off the game. This happened to me on the first two attempts to play the game. I ended up going to the first town, becoming a woodcutter, killing a chicken and getting chased by the guards. But once you push on, you will be nothing but glad you did. Who am I even writing this for? Is there any poor soul out there who has not yet played this game? BUY IT. NOW. Please?

review: The province of Skyrim might be frigid, but the role-playing game that takes place within it burns with a fire few games possess. Yes, Skyrim is another enormous fantasy RPG from a developer that specializes in them, and it could suck up hundreds of hours of your time as you inspect each nook and crevasse for the secrets to be found within. The game returns you to the continent of Tamriel, where you explore the northern realm called Skyrim, home to the Nord race. In these northern regions, snow flurries cloud your view, and platforms of ice float on the chilled waters. Nighttime often brings Tamriel's version of the aurora borealis, with its gorgeous blue and green ribbons stretching across the heavens. Skyrim's predecessor, Oblivion, featured prototypical fantasy environments-pretty but not quite evocative of the lore's darker undercurrents. Skyrim embraces its darker elements. You might feel an eerie chill as you glimpse a half-sunken ship through the mist, or watch as a dragon comes to life before your very eyes under the swirling firmament. Closer inspection reveals hard edges, plain painted-on textures, and other visual flaws that are conspicuous should you seek them out. But like many enormous games, Skyrim makes a fantastic impression not because its individual elements are sharply honed, but because they contribute to a grander whole. There's so much to do that your quest log becomes an embarrassment of pleasures, offering dozens of choices at any given time, each one as enticing as the next.It's impressive enough that there's so much to do; it's even more impressive that most of it is wonderful. Not every dungeon is a joy to explore. Stone-turning puzzles occasionally bring the fun to a halt, and a few repeated cave designs could dampen your spirits. But overall, every task has an excellent sense of context, and surprises lurk around many a turn. Skyrim also uses scattered books and references to enthrall you. You may not be a big fan of reading books in role-playing games, but even so, you should make an effort here.The combat in Skyrim is the tightest Elder Scrolls combat yet, the visual and audio cues normally providing proper feedback with your blows and zaps.Some death blows result in Fallout 3-style slow-motion kills, which retain their power because they're not overly frequent. Movement, too, has seen improvement: you can now play from a third-person view and feel like you're moving across the land instead of floating above it. All in all, Skyrim has some minor issues but as a whole is a brilliant RPG.

The game has one of the largest active modding communities of any game. This helps to spice up gameplay and graphics. With new residents, new weapons and armor, incredible house mods adding giant castles, and visual mods. You can spend hours upon hours finding mods that suit your needs in the nordic lands of Skyrim. It is worth to note that you should know the game to an extent before modding, as it can corrupt save files if not done properly. If I'd have to rate it, it would be a 10/10.

review: This is one of the best adventures you can play: long and storyrich main quest with huge amount of sidequests to venture through! With the official Dragonborn, Dawnguard and Heartfire dlcs there's tons of places to see and enormous amount of quests to complete. If you somehow run out of stuff to find then there's the modding possibility. SO MANY mods are out there (Steam Workshop, Skyrim Nexus...) to give you more quests, items and whatever. With all the mods it's pretty much endless adventure waiting for you as Dragonborn. The best ability of course is shouting at everything you see. It's pretty funny to make people fly away when you feel upset about someone stealing your sweetroll... Some caves and especially Dwarven ruins tend to be pretty boring to go to after some time since they are pretty long (Dwarven ruins) and linear (just killing tons of same enemies to find something/somebody or to get somewhere) but other than that it's a beautiful and rich game in so many ways that there is no reason why you shouldn't give it a try! Btw never attack chickens... those s seem to be pretty valuable in Skyrim since everyone is willing to kill you if you harm them.

review: A game that is complicated to critique. For the first 30-50 hours, you will be completely absorbed in the beautiful and vast world, with seemingly endless opportunities for exploration and questing. As you continue to play, the cracks start to show. The gameplay systems are incredibly shallow, the characters wooden, the world still beautiful but the dungeons copy/pasted 120 times over with the same enemies, the same meaningless loot. The complication arises when you realize that while you are slowly starting to loathe the game, you've had 30+ hours of fun before hitting that point. So the question is, was it worth it?

The game will just suck you in. It has LOADS of contents that will keep you busy for 100+ hours for sure. And mods are just icing on the cake; if you're a graphics-hungry person, mods can make this game look better than most "next-gen" games out there, if modded correctly. And the sceneries, oh the sceneries, I just feel like sitting on my chair and just keep staring at those vast fields of beautiufl grasslands. Totally recommend this game. 15/10. BUT, but, one and only con that I found is of the fighting mechanics; it is just so bland. Nothing else I dislike about this game.

With mods installed prepare to stay up until 3:00 am in the morning while playing this game oh and i mean from 7:00 am to 3:00 by the way, you will literally lose hours just by having fun with the fantastic and active modding community for this game. Now for everything else, The landscape of Skyrim is extremely beautiful, you will get lost in hours and hours of content. More so with the vast dungeons dotting the land. While Elder Scrolls Oblivion had this fantasy artistic style going on with the landscape which is breathtaking within it's own right. Skyrim has this hostile, cold and harsh environment going on. Exatcly how it is described. The quests in this game are extremely well done, more so with quests that don't really start right off the bat until you read a book or hear a rumor, which will keep the player more invested within the game. Also with the AI system implemented in this game, your actions changes how the world views your character with every good deed you do to every bad deed you do. Quest mods also make it more fun and more investing. The skills system aren't exactly as perfect as Elder Scrolls Oblivion. Within that game, whatever class you pick, it will either make the investment into that class fun or not, but either way you will lose hours just getting your characters skills up as you go along within that game. In Skyrim, the skills system are dotted out into three sections, Mage, Warrior, and Rogue, whatever skills you pick it will either help combat scenarios easier or not. Even more so if you choose to go with a thief build. The mage system in this game is pretty badass but not as more through like in Oblivon. But with mods installed it will make these three aspects much more fun to play and make the skill system much more tedious rather than a clean sweep. The Combat system in this game is clunky, it's your typical Elder Scrolls game. If an enemy lungs at you, you block, if you want to gain the advantage against a large stack of bandits or whatever, use a bow. If you want a 'clean sweep' use magic. Here is where modding comes into play once again. Thanks to these overhaul mods the combat system feels more alive and more challenging, with every minute maybe your last. The NPCs in this game while that voice reptition is there, the NPCs of this vast world stand out more than the Oblivion counterparts, each one has a selective schedule and "job" they also have their own "situation" to make these characters either more interesting or more annoying depending upon your point of view. The muscical score makes you want to just to sit back and listen to it. While some people will say "it's recycled music over and over again" There are mods to make the muscial score more diverse and interesting with every combat situation and with every town and city, and dungeon you explore. The DLC are also great in there own right, With Dawnguard, it's your typical light and darkness story. But here you will not only lose more hours into this game, but you will gain new shouts, equipment and companions, and also player homes. With hearthfire it's an add-on, it will just add housecarls and three new houses to the world. If you like that sort of thing. Lastly with Dragonborn, you will explore a very familiar place with a "good" storyline, like with Dawnguard, new quests, new equipment, and new player homes, and new companions. basically Dawnguard and Dragonborn you will get "new" I highly recommend modding this game. In it's original state, again it feels lifeless and dull, even if you lose 1000+ hours into Skyrim. With mods enabled you will enjoy replaying the game over and over again. I seriously recommend this game.

review: I love it, it gave me 2 years of fun, I played every playstyle, every race, every way, every DLC. I been from a straight up heavy armor warrior with a huge battleaxe that can turn into a werewolf, and could stand still taking every hit from a dragon without losing almost any health. To a master thief who isn't very strong but can sneak through a entire bandit camp without being seen once.. All the way to guy who never killed a soul, worked hard for his money chopping wood. Managing to build his own house and have a family. The main story with all the guilds you can join and areas to explore, you won't be bored for a long time. So don't just rush the main story and assume you seen it all. Out of the DLC's, the best would be Dragonborn. It offers a large new world, enemies, quests, armors and weapons. While the Dawnguard only offers a bit and a vampire lord form, and Hearthfire just lets you adopt kids and build homes. The worst thing about it, is there will be bugs, which can easily be fixed by console commands. But only use if needed, like after 5 retrys a quest won't finish or continue. 8/10 Only because it can get far too easy, and the bugs. You get stronger than all the enemies too quickly. So I say when you learn the game better, go on Master or Legendary difficulty for a challenge.

review: Skyrim is undoubtedly the best purchase I have made in the past year. It's worth every $ that it's listed at especially when considering the insane amount of content you are given. I have only spent about 100 hours in the game (this is short in comparison to a lot of people on my friends list) but I can assure you that those hours were all packed with immersive content. Here are some key features that hooked me into the game.. 1. Dungeon Complexity - When I say complexity, I mean that the design for the game's dungeons vary greatly from simple to complex. You just have to keep exploring and you'll eventually run into the intricately designed areas that get you to pause for a moment and think before being able to progress. At times.. I ALMOST felt as if I were playing the latest Tomb Raider once again. I also found it quite neat that you could use your shouts to bypass/solve a few of the puzzles. 2. Playstyle Freedom - I'm sure tht a lot of people take similar routes but the game does offer a great deal of freedom with its perk system. It's definitely a step up compared to games like Kingdoms of Amalur. Do you enjoy melee combat? How about magic? How about a balance of both? There's a lot of possibilities. 3. Expansive Lore - As I've mentioned, the game has a ton of content. Playing through everything (especially if you are aiming for complete achievements), gives you perspective on the whole story and it really is interesting when some quest's lore ties into another - maybe even forming a bigger picture. Skyrim definitely has a lot more charming qualities but these are the features that I really wanted to highlight. They stood out for me and it was for these reasons that I ended up buying the game last year (only to play it now - 2014) during the summer sale. With that said, I paid $30 for the legendary edition. Wouldn't you agree that for all this content, it was pretty much a steal? How many games can you list down that provide hundreds, nearly thousands of hours worth of content (especially if you count the mods) for that kind of price. Just remember, multiplayer games don't count! 10/10. Buy it when it goes on sale during this upcoming summer sale event.

review: One of the bests Waifu Simulators out there. You can dress them up, pose and take lots of pictures afterwards. Its just like a Barbie dolls for girls, but made for the adult men that can play it and don't feel bad at all.

review: Skyrim is one of my favorite games of all time, this game is pure art, the role play is great if you are a nerd like me, however if you don't plan on role playing and you just want to play an amazing game then you can unlike other titles like fallout this game does not punish you and it is not a very hard game, i played it in master for most of my stay in the land of skyrim. This game is the kind of type game where it is not about the end its all about the journey. I have played a lot of rpgs in my day, and in most the quests have been bland a
