review: This story requires a bit of setup. Last year, a friend of mine whom I'd known from gaming for a long time contacted me and told me about this great new game that was in beta that he was backing as a founder (called a "Grandmaster" in-game) called Warframe. A third person cooperative shooter with elements of Phantasy Star Online/Diablo loot runs, procedurally generated levels, and more content being added all the time. The game was difficult to start, as there are many keys for various secret parkour maneuvers. Running along walls! Sliding down ziplines! Soon, I was completely hooked; my friend and I were playing late into the night, trying to grind out just one more piece necessary to build a new component or weapon, or trying to beat our best time on the Survival missions -- where you fend off an ever growing wave of foes as life support ticks down. Over the year, there were many great victories, hair raising last second escapes, and new friends joining our little group. Many hours were spent joking around with each other on Skype, cracking jokes, blasting weird songs at each other, and coming up with our own stupid little catchphrases. Flash forward a year; Warframe now has space combat, new Warframes, new weapons, and new combat controls. The game still has its original style, but it's so much improved. Last week, our four player regular team developed some incredible strategies that let us get further than we ever had on wave defense missions. The only thing that made us stop was getting tired. On Tuesday, my friend who invited me to the game a year ago didn't show up that night. I found out on Wednesday that he had passed away suddenly from an undiagnosed health condition. The shock of it is still hitting us hard. The friendships that we had formed through the game, gone in an instant. It hardly feels real. I keep expecting him to log in and be there, ready to do another defense mission, and it's difficult to accept that we'll be going it alone now. We contacted Digital Extremes, the company that makes the game, and asked if there was anything we could do. They dedicated their 11/20/2014 episode of their webcast to the memory of our friend and read our memorials to him on the air. Their reactions were heartfelt and touching. They really do listen to and react to the community. I not only recommend the game for how much fun it is (I recommend you play it with a group of friends on voice chat -- up to four per session; your gameplay experience may vary alone, and form a clan or join one just because many items are clan-only), I recommend it for how responsive the game developers are to the community. They constantly improve it and add new content, items, and weapons. There is a storyline that is unfolding. The voice acting is delightful. You could easily play this game without spending a single dollar of real world currency on it (real world currency is used for cosmetics and increasing the number of Warframes and weapons you can own, or buying things that you can't wait for). Thanks, Digital Extremes. And rest in peace, Woxit.

review: How to ruin your life: 1) Download Warframe 2) Learn how to press buttons on your keyboard to play Warframe 3) Grind for hundreds and thousands of hours for that one thing that looks really cool. 4) Congratulations, you now have no life. This method is tried-and-true, I have even tested it on myself; that's how sure I was that it would work. Edit: A few people are adding me for help on WF. Feel free to add me if you wish, and I'll try my best to accept and answer any questions you may have, but just know I may not have time to play more than a few rounds with you :c Sorry.

review: | Update (24/4/14): It has been a fairly significant chunk of time since I wrote this review of Warframe, and some elements of the game have been expanded upon in ways that alleviate some of the issues I originally had. The premium currency, platinum, can now be traded between players. This provides an option for players who do not wish to put money into the game but want to participate in using the storefront. Users in the comments have pointed out that there are many powerful items which are not available in the store - if you want them, you'll need to grind. Multiple new game modes exist, including "Invasion", a mode which allows players to team up together with the Corpus or the Grineer to work against the opposing faction. This mode gives the player some agency in the kinds of rewards he receives for completing the mission. The latest update introduced Melee 2.0, which delivered improvements to the game's melee combat. The most interesting update comes in the form of Dark Sectors. Clans and alliances can own parts of the Solar System, and can fight for that contested ownership. Clans and Alliances can also set tax and resource requirements on anyone who accesses their conquered territories, leading to territorial battles for supremacy. In conclusion, a decent amount of content has been added to the game. While the core argument of my review holds true, Warframe is finally approaching the level of depth required to elevate itself above a mere grinding game. The new "EVE Online"-esque sector mechanics are particularly promising in that regard. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | Original Review (25/11/13) A great-looking, initially interesting game that feels like one compelling part of what should be a greater whole. Warframe is an interesting entry in the free to play space. It has the looks and the gameplay, but after a while it begins to feel lacking in the way of substance. Gameplay largely involves clearing your way through various missions types as you progress in rank, leveling up your weapons and your Warframe (the game's metaphor for various Classes, each having their own unique abilities, advantages, disadvantages and so on) as you shoot a myriad of alien Grineer, infested hordes, and Corpus robots. Missions range from rescue scenarios where a hostage must be located and escorted to safety, to mobile defense missions where waves of increasingly difficult enemies must be held off as you protect a moving objective. These can all be completed solo, but are made more interesting by grouping up with other players. Higher level missions are tricky by yourself, making teaming up the more attractive proposition. Weapons and Warframes can be augmented with various modifcations that apply the standard Action RPG fare - elemental damage bonuses, increased critical hit damage, faster reload speeds, you name it. This allows for some diversity in gameplay between players, where you may opt to build out your Warframe in a more supportive role, or stock up on mods which provide a more tanky character. So far the game has been well supported with semi-regular content updates and special events, usually in the form of new warframes and weapons, and a "community effort" in which everyone can participate. The only "issue" is that the game is a bit of a grind. In fact, it's a complete grinding game. The main reason for going on missions is in the hopes of accumulating various materials with which to craft the new warframes or weapons. You can use the games "premium" currency to expedite the process of manufacturing said items (which take hours, days of real time to craft) or simply buy them outright from a storefront. Why do you want these new weapons and warframes? To grind more efficiently for materials. This might strike you as a monotonous loop, and to an extent it is, but the joy of the gameplay itself goes a way to allievating the game from being a total bore. Inevitably though you may become tired of the treadmill. The game sometimes feels like it is skirting the boundaries of being gross about its "free to play" nature - you can certainly get almost everything in the game without spending if you're willing to commit to the grind, but it can sometimes feel like game systems are designed to encourage you to give up and bring out your wallet - namely the sheer amount of materials required to craft better equipment, and the time spent waiting for these items to actually be built. It's always questionable when a F2P game includes a long timer alongside a button to make it go away for just a few pounds. Ultimately, if you're just looking for a good looking, nice playing third person shooter with online components and a decent aesthetic, you can do far worse than Warframe. After spending some time with it, however, you might wind up wishing there was a little more to the experience beyond what is currently available.

review: Before you read into this review, let me ask you one question. Do you think fun is the most important thing in any game? If you answered yes, stick around and keep reading. If you answered no, you probably wouldn't like Warframe. Warframe gets a lot of flak for being repetative, but I personally feel that the reviewers who complain about the gameplay being repetative are failing to see the bigger picture. Warframe is not about a deep, gripping narrartive or memorable characters, it's about action, fun, and pretty crazy weapon variety. And to top it all off, everything that impacts gameplay can be obtained for free. Warframe is a very specialized game, focused on action, flare, and fun. And boy oh boy does Warframe nail action and fun. With over a dozen unique Warframes(Powersuits used by the player, each with their own unique abilities and stats) to choose from you're sure to find one that you really enjoy playing as. And then there's the weapons. Oh boy, the weapons. This game has almost every kind of Sci-Fi weapon I can think of. We have small scale particle cannons, Beefy sniper rifles, plasma casters, living weapons that shoot everything from Electricity to streams of deadly viruses, an insanely powerful rocket launcher, a Grenade launcher with remote detonation, powerful bows, a gun that shoots spinning saw blades, and of course the obligatory pew-pew assualt rifles to ease new players into the experience. Oh, but that's just the Primaries. In every mission, you will have the option to carry a Primary, a Secondary, and a Melee but you can choose to carry only 1 or 2 if you please. The Secondaries include but are not limited to: Living weapons that shoot Corrosive darts and poison gas, a goo gun that shoots sticky globs of acid that eat right through armor, 2 deadly hand cannons, one of which shoots many metal balls in a shotgun spread while the other shoots a spread of radiation blasts, Miniature plasma casters, rapid fire dual pistols, a spread-rocket launcher that they somehow compressed into the size of a pistol, a pistol that shoots bolts that can pin enemies to walls, deadly and accurate burst fire pistols, pocket snipers, Revolvers, a Lever action beast, Throwing knives, Throwing stars, and a Standard semi-auto pistol to ease new players in. And then there's my favorite weapon class, the Melee. We've got Greatswords that can hit numerous enemies in a wide arc, more conservative longswords that swing fast and allow better mobility while attacking, Dual daggers which generate an incredibly fast flurry of slashes and stabs, whips for when you want the range of a greatsword but the mobility of a longsword, there's also the polearms, Heavy axes, Heavy hammers, ROCKET HAMMER, and even the Thrown melee weapons, useful for killing at a distance while conserving ammo and for stealth kills. More recently Digital Extremes added in 2 Katanas and a set of claws that pop out of your arms like Wolverine. Melee has become much more prominent lately now that DE has completely revamped it. No longer do you simply mash or hold E, now you can perform different combos that require different inputs. These combos are assigned to stance mods that you can apply to your weapon. Each melee weapon class I mentioned above has at least 1 stance mod, and each mod comes with it's own unique combos that are useful for different purposes and situations. My favorites are the Katanas with Decisive Judgement as the stance. I use it to make my tenno look and fight like Vergil from Devil May Cry 3. So yes, Warframe can seem repetative to some people, but not to me. I greatly enjoy the vast arsenal that is placed before me, and I truly believe that these tools of destruction make up for the lack of deep narrative. That said, I thoroughly recommend Warframe to anyone who likes Shooters or character action games, or anyone who likes having fun.

review: Warframe in it's simplest parts is a amalgamation of Mass Effect 3 shooting, old school Diablo looting / hoarding, Free Running / Parkour, and freaking space ninjas! Did I say Space Ninjas? It's really really fun living out your childhood dreams of dropkicking baddies in the face while throwing stars at a secondary target. If you ever wanted to be Bruce Lee; this is your game. It has boss fights with actual strategies, plenty of unlocks to find, lots of socializing for those that want to chit chat as much as kick things in the derriere. The new weapon damage system gives hardcore mathematicians something to theory craft about, but is as easy as Paper, Rock, Scissors in it's simplest form. Weapon choice is varied in feel thus you many choices to find the perfect weapons that suit your playstyle. Alternative playstyles such as Stealth plays a prominent role in Warframe. You can absolutely wreck targets from the shadows! You can choose between Support frames, Offensive frames, and Defensive frames for a mission. Invite your buddies or grab some guys / gals from the recruiting social channel. If you want to meet new people, join a completely randomized group of 4 players hell bent on conquering space! You have multiple saved loadout slots for free! Digital Extremes doesn't really nickle and dime you in this game like other F2P games. They do need to make a profit so they sell cosmetic items, XP boosters, warframe slots, weapon slots, and materials for those too busy to go fight. Nearly everything in the game can be acquired by doing fun events that last nearly a week so you can choose when to partake of them. They give away the best guns for free during those events. They have a XP system that also nets you some of the best guns in the game for just running missions to collect loot and crafting that loot into weapons and warframes. Leveling up those frames and weapons gives you the XP necessary to unlock the sickest weapons! This is a Play to Win game where you can buy materials to craft if you are impatient, but you can just play more and get it. Isn't playing the game the purpose of it? Of course you can buy completed Warframes for real money, but spending a couple hours of your time you can get the same thing for free. Of course you still need to buy the inventory slot for that frame to use it. At less than $1 a slot, no subscription fee, and no initial game purchase, this sounds like the steal of the century. And you don't have to buy them and still have fun, but it's nice to be able to support the developer for their time and effort. In short play this now!

review: There is only one thing you need to know about Warframe: It's free. Oh, maybe I didn't make myself clear enough. When I say that Warframe is free, I mean, literally speaking, it is free. Still not clear enough? Alright, I'll elaborate. Apart from two different types of items - appearance items (such as skins and coloring pallets) and weapon/Warframe slots - it is possible for all players to access almost all types of in game items and entities (apart from a few that are no longer available to everyone). In this manner, it is possible for you to obtain every Warframes (characters or so to speak), every weapons, every non-visual-based items and the likes. Of course, there are conditions to fulfill, and obtaining everything will most likely take up a good portion of your time (isn't this what you are looking for?), but the point is, it is perfectly possible to play Warframe in the long run without paying a single cent. It's your choice. So, what is Warframe? In this game, you are basically a character known as "Tenno" who fights battles within a futuristic solar system. You will be teaming up with 3 other Tennos (this is a 4 player co-op game) to complete missions laid out by Lotus, a female commander issuing you orders. Nah, she is nicer than your ex-girlfriend, so don't worry about that. You will basically be facing three separate forces, Grineer, Corpus and the Infestation (think of the three races in Starcraft if you want to get a better idea). There are different types of missions, ranging from elimination, rescue, spy, to defense and rescue. As for weapons, basically you get to equip a primary weapon (rifle, shotgun, sniper and many others that are hard to categorize), a secondary weapon (categorization is hard for this as well) and a melee weapon (sword, mace, fist... you know the deal). As for your character, you will be using one out of the somewhat 10-ish (slightly less than 20, though the number is gradually increasing as more update comes by) Warframes. Each Warframe comes with different stats, such as self-repairing shields, like those in halo, health, energy (mana) and speed. Still, more importantly, each Warframe has its own unique set of 4 skills. These skills are great assets for the players as most of the times they will come in handy. One thing to note is that gender is preset, so those transsexuals don't have to fake their gender anymore, which is, well ... you decide if it's good or not. There are also mods (modifications) that you can insert into your weapons and Warframes to make them much stronger than they originally are. Oh and there are parkour. Learn how to press "WASD" + "LShift" + "LCtrl" + "Space" in fluid coordination. It will be helpful and painful, but you will definitely need them. Simple? Unlike many co-op shooters, Warframe definitely has its merits. One of the most apparent distinction of the game is that it has a leveling system that can be found in most MMOs. You can level up both your weapons and Warframes to a maximum rank of 30. Moreover, you can rank up your mods as well to make them more powerful. In this way, Warframe won't be a simple "run-shoot-kill see-score go-sleep" type of game. Never. There are things more important than that. Another merit of Warframe is that there are frequent updates. When I say frequent, I mean FREQUENT, as in one big update per month or so. There will be new game modes, Warframes, weapons, mods ... etc. I mean, come on, who thinks that L4D2 came too fast after L4D1 is released? I do. Who is still waiting for L4D3 after all these years? I am. Who thinks that Gabe Newell should fulfill the unsaid promise of completing the trilogies of Valve games? I do. Come on, we have been waiting for L4D3 and Portal 3 and HL3, and we are sick and tired of being sick and tired of waiting. This won't happen for Warframe though. The game has a gradual and comfortable pace of updating. You get new contents every now and then, and they usually blends well with the game. Usually. Still, like most games, there are pros and cons of Warframe and I have to sincerely admit that there are shortcomings with this game when compared to other games. One major shortcoming (I won't say flaw) of this game is that it lacks a concrete story line. Apart from some trivial storytelling, there really aren't much of a tale going on. There are stories told, I'm not saying there aren't, but they are rather weak. I know, that is not their aim, and that is not really the point of Warframe, but compared to the rich (though monotonous) storyline of L4D and Portal, Warframe needs to good a better job here. Also, the game can be rather repetitive. You know, this applies for most Coop shooters, so there really isn't much to say about this. Yeah, repetitive. So, in general, try Warframe. It's free. If you don't like it, drop it. Simple as that. If you do like it and if you feel that you will be playing it in the long run (like how I felt after my first 100th hours), do consider buying a little platinum to expand your weapon and Warframe slots. I bought like 19.90 USD worth of platinums. Not much, but it is the spirit that counts, right?

review: Now half of you will just rate the review unhelpful because it's negative, but be reminded that every one of these problems is something I want to be fixed, not that I laugh about, read on if you care, or be one of the many who would disregard what I say because they think it's bad to point out issues, and will blindly follow Warframe to the depths of hell itself to shoot down critisizm. Look at my hours, I know what I'm talking about. Off-putting Community with really short-sighted Devs. First The Positives, +It's free to play, (With some restrictions.) +Playing with friends can be a lot of fun, the problem is trying to get them to play the game with you. (It's harder than you might think) +Combat is fun, albeit a bit buggy at times. +Weapons and frames a quite varied, making almost every item a new experience. +Not bad in terms of graphics, everything looks like plastic and rubber but hey, it's a free game. Now the Negatives... -The game is an infinite power creep. -The forums, I have never met such a nasty group of people in my life. -The game doesn't have too much grinding, the game IS grinding, you are grinding to grind more. -The game is ridiculously easy, you can get almost every item in the game in just about a month. -The paywalls, unless you only want to have two Warframes, you gotta pay up, that or attempt the horrible trading system. -The generic enemies of clones and spacemen, most of the concepts are quite unoriginal. The enemy designs seem to be based on freaking shapes, or just generic space zombies straight out of something like Halo or Dead Space. -The AI barely makes enemies a threat, they will suicide rush you solo, all while getting slaughtered. -The bugs, this is a beta game but good god, it's been out for 2 years, they simply neglect to fix them. Hell, sometimes they create more bugs than they fix. These things are so rampant, it actually makes a SERIOUS impact on the games sometimes, from camera issues to getting stuck in walls, bugs ruin SO much of the gameplay that it hurts sometimes. -The balancing, DE couldn't balance a seesaw, some items are worthless, others OP to the extreme. The developers have proved time and time again to be completely incompetent when it comes to the issue of imbalance with weapons and frames, they will leave the top teir weapons that completely outclass anything that comes near them alone, while nerfing random items that very clearly didn't need it. It makes no sense, the whole update process is an endless stream of nerfing and ignoring. They also just straight up ignore useless frames and items, theres nothing more to say, they just ignore them. -The updates, most just introduce a shiny version of something already in game, or a useless gun. -The end goal, if you don't care about a number next to your name, there is none -The asskissing, DE will release a patch to fix something THEY broke, and people thank the  out of them, yeah sure, that makes sense, not to mention ANY critisism of ANY of their decisions, (no matter how stupid they are) will be shot down by their White Knights -The gameplay, stealth is a neglected factor entirely, the whole game is just trying to get ahead of your squad to try and do more damage, any other gamemode is just killing  with some minor objective to focus on while you spam your skills or choice of over-powered weapon. -The devs greed, they will ignore major problems so that they can release a new Prime package and find more ways to suck your money out, (Like slots, for example) -The idiotic community, just go look at the wiki, every page's comments has someone  on a weapon and telling you some other one is better, they just bicker endlessly about everything. -The matchmaking, there isn't any, you have to go sit in a chat room, (Unless you join a clan, WHICH YOU SHOULD BE!) and wait for some Rhino Prime to join your game, unless you're doing normal missions, cause then you are  out of luck cause unless some random person is doing the same node at the same time, you're doomed to play it solo. -The money creep of cosmetics, every new item that comes out is more expensive than the last, you know why DE does this? Cause they know their brain-dead community will eat it the  up, and throw tons of money at the screen while mashing "THANKS DE" into their keyboard as hard as they can. -The lack of progress with updates, sure they come often, but seriously, they give us random weapons that who's gonna care about when there is elite top level gear that cannot be out-classed. The updates never bring ANYTHING new or significant. -The lack of variety in gamemodes, there's like 4 or 5 gamemodes and you better like them cause they are gonna be the only thing you play, ever. -The PvP, this should have never been added, the Conclave is straight up dead, being horribly unbalanced and incredibly laggy, (I'll get to the reason behind that next.) and Dark Sectors are controlled by clans that use DDoS and other shady tactics to force massive taxes down players throats. -The lack of servers, every game is hosted by a player, which means lag, a LOT of lag, it sometimes makes the game literally unplayable, and it's incredibly common. -The crashing, I crash 2-3 times a day on Warframe, just... my god, if I had to list the amount of times I had to Alt-F4 out of the game, this review would be three times as long. -The movement, you simply latch on to walls when you wall run, nothing feels natural, every jump, every vault, they all feel stilted and slow. Not to mention sometimes you just FLY mach 5 across the map when you jump from a sliding position, the jumps are so irregular. -The melee combat, you run up to the enemy mash the E key and you MIGHT hit them, it's completely random. And just like other weapons, melee weapons are completely unbalanced, for the most part heavy weapons are useless, and certain weapons destroy the rest hands down, its borderline . -The Argon issue, every new weapon requires Argon crystals as an artificial way to make them harder to obtain, this simply comes from DEs issue of being uncreative with ways to acquire new weaponry. -The fact that certain frames are one trick ponies, certain frames are only used for one (sometimes two) abilities, while the rest of their entire arsenal is completely ignored. -The lack of a challenge, this somewhat correspondes with the game being too easy, with a certain frame and weapon, anything can be completed by a braindead child, people actually have to make up their own end-game of getting to high waves simply to have the RISK of being defeated. -The lack of a skill requirement, as I said directly above, so long as you have the right weapon and frame, you can conqeur literally anything. There is no reward for being good at the game, in fact you don't even have to try your best, simply having the numbers 1-2-3-4 on your keyboard is enough to be just as good as anyone else. -The most ignorant developers I've ever seen, here is an example, there is a weapon called the Dark Dagger, it is awful, as every single handed dagger is. However, the hilarity insues when you realise, that the tiny Dark Dagger, is around the same speed as the giant two handed hammer Fragor. And you think that's bad? NONE of the dagger stances actually match the Dark Daggers stance polarity, NONE. That is the most idiotic thing I've ever heard in my life to be honest. If you want to play with other people, join a clan, most of the community is elitism  who don't care about the gameplay, and are simply waiting for the next prime to come out. The more people who dislike this only proves what I'm talking about with the asskissing, every one of these points is true, no matter how much people will try to deny them. Fanboys will be ignored and most likely have their rant deleted, think before you post.

review: So, i playing this game nearly more than 2 years and i want to write this. This game have good graphics, but with only graphics you can't make a good game, So this game have a great choise of weapons, but 80% of them feels the same and more than half of them are not very useful with high-level enemies. And this game have a lot of enemies, but all of them feels the same and doing the same tactics, nearly only things that change with them are weapon, models and protection types (flesh, cloned flesh, robotic or ferrite armor, etc.), all enemies dies the same in your daily slaughter. Diversity of tilesets, and they all beatiful and atmospheric, but it doesn't really pays to play on 70% of tilesets. because some of them (Orokin Void which have prime parts and more XP for example) are more profitable. Archwing, it's awesome to fly in open space and shot\melee everyone who flyes near you, but right now it's just barebones, nothing more interesting in it and all of the Archwing and their specific weapons are locked behind a hard grind. Kubrow, you can got and rise your own dog-like loyal companion, but they are just running everywhere and dying and then they losts their loyality which you can refill only by 30% per day (they losts it like 20% per their dead), and their health drops about 10% per day, you need to buy refills (DNA Stabilizers, 6 things per 75,000 credits) which refill only 40% per use. and to find a egg you need to spend about 2-200 runs (depends of random and your luck) to get one. so in point of view they are just credit-sink and any normal sentinel can replace every type of doge (and sentinels don't require credits to take care of them and don't tose loyalty after death) This game have great variety of Warframes and their awesome abilities, but most of them don't have much differences other than abilities and different stats (and cool looks), and some of them are closed behind a heavy grind. This game have a nice amount of bosses (one per planet), but most of them are just plain and boring, for example you need to wait until they becone vulnerable, because they are invulnerable and you need to shot specific hit-point on them to kill them (example: Councilor Vay Hek, General Sargas Ruk, Lephantis, or Mutalist Alad V) and some of them closed behind grind to get frame which drops from them (Vay Hek(Hydroid), Lephantis(Nekros), Mutalist Alad V(Mesa)) In this game you can get every weapon\frame without paying platinum (local currency you need to buy with real-life money (but still you can get it through trade with people)), but you need to grind for them (blueprint costs credits (in-game currency you get throught missions) some blueprints requires research from Clan Dojo's laboratories, which requires credits and resources too, and blueprints requires resources and credits to craft things (Resources you can get throught missions too from killing enemies). Cool varity of mods for frames and weapons, which drops from enemies and you can make you weapon\frame more powerfull with them, but some mods are rare and some mods drops from rare enemies, and some mods are very, very close to be useless (Intruder: +6 seconds for hacking Maxed, Rifle Aptitude: +15% status chance Maxed.) But even so this game is very good, and i had a good fun with it, i'm recommending it, try to play it with friends and kill things together. 9.5/10, this game still growns and becomes more interesting with time, i hope on this game's release developments will get rid of the disadvantages in it. Honestly, this is best F2P game on Steam (don't count Valve's TF2 and Dota 2)

review: I started writing a review for why after a year of playing the game, I changed my review for it from recommended to not recommended; and it ended up being far longer than is a reasonable length for a review. It is not the proper forum for me to write four pages as to what happened to the game, and why I can't suggest playing it anymore. If you want to read more on it, I suggest going to the actual forums for the game (not through Steam, but through the official website). The players there are very active in posting, and there will be a lot of threads going in detail about the faults of the game, and talking about how DE's actions have never been further out of sync from what players want from the game, and from the direction they were once taking it. Instead of writing four pages, i'll summarize it into something short and concise. Again, if you want more specifics, feel free to go look into them, but I'll summarize, as I have logged more than enough hours into the game to be very familiar with it, and what has happened. What it really boils down to is this: The company is using grind walls, and severely crowded RNG tables to deliver content. Which is one of the least creative, and worst examples of game design I have ever played. It wasn't originally going to be that way, but that is what it has become now. And considering it is supposed to be an action game, and not an MMO/RPG, the grind really kills the feel of the game, you are much less of a Space Ninja saving the solar system, and more of a mindless drone collecting resources for new weapons, all for literally no reason at all, due to the lack of story. In my 20 years of gaming experience, I have never seen a company so unwilling to work with what their player base wanted, and just outright ignore them. The community is incredibly vocal with ways to make the game more enjoyable for the players, and keep them interested, and avoid just getting burned out on the game, and patch after patch, they go ignored. From the past year of expereince with this game, the current state is that it is a fantastic concept, being delivered in one of the worst ways imaginable, by an inadequate design and balance team.

review: Warframe is kind of like Mass Effect 3's multiplayer but better in many ways. It has a power system similar to ME3's power system, but it has a variety of missions instead of only a deffence/horde mode. It has some really cool weapons. And it has bows. These bows are what sold me when I first started. I saw a bow in the store and spent $10 to buy the thing faster than *put Flash joke here*. It's not a PvP game. Some of the Warframes, like Rhino, are REALLY OP in PvP. But overall it's a good time, especially with friends. I should note that you can buy almost anything in the game via Plat, this does lead to a "Pay 2 Win" kind of game. You can get almost anything in the game via Plat / trading, BUT you can get EVERYTHING in the game without paying anything. A lot of the weapons in the store are around 275 Plat (which is REALLY overpriced) and Warframes will run from 75-375. (which is a little better because of the pain it is to build them) I must stress here that Warframe is the most fun when you are just playing and not grinding for something. Yes, grinding is something that you HAVE to do in order to get anyware in Warframe, but (at least for me) this does not ruin the overall experience.

review: FarmFrame
game-hours: 197.9
review: My review of Warframe Warframe is an amazing game with a truly original story and setting. In the year 2029 Austria, birth place of Hitler, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Money Boy and Joseph Fritzl decided to place a ban on all other forms of national production. Farms were closed, factories shut down and local stores were forced out of business. The only businesses allowed to operate were the ports, for importing food to feed the now practically enslaved workforce. All national production refocused on the construction of the "Door Frame" Austria's answer to your door hanging needs. By the year 2031 rogue factions within the Austrian government decided it was time to strike, uploading a selective virus in to the entire nations production lines. This led to the creation of the "War Frame" a door frame so focused on war that it caused conflict wherever it was mounted, homes across the globe now featured Austrian doorframes and unfortunately a rogue batch of Warframes were also set loose across the globe. These Warframes were notorious, sealing front doors to homes to prevent you visiting your neighbours, sealing doorways to places of worship so people could no longer pray to their chosen gods and gradually over time the world fell to darkness and chaos, as even the doorways to power plants and gas stations refused to open. Some Warframes gained sentience and self awareness and as they saw the human uprising finally coming to fruition, their evil colleagues and companions burned in the streets and smashed to splinters they rose up to assist their human allies in the fight against their own kind. You take the role of one of nineteen types of Warframe, from Oak, to pine to cedar wood. The choices are limitless, your skills totally customizable, from 'tea tray services' to 'Opening for the elderly'. As one of the newly freed warframes, you must take up the mantle of free-DOOR-m fighter, fighting across not only earth but the moon, Mars and Titan to free the oppressed human people from their true foes, the evil Warframes of the Austrian Mega-doorframe-corp. 11/10 would open and close door again.

Here's why: -Play the same level, over and over again, expecting to actually get a Mod/Prime/resource -Play this game over and over again, expecting it to not be the most rage-inducing game you've ever played. -Complain in the forums over and over, expecting nerfs/buffs on demand.

review: Once upon a time there was a bunch of glowing white people living in a magical realm of reality known as the VOID. It was in this VOID that a war raged between the glowing white people and an unknown, let's call them yellow people. In a desperate attempt to succeed, the glowing white people created magical spandex suits to contain the power of those affected by the VOID's magical glowingness. The war turned, and yet for unknown reasons the magical spandex people of the VOID turned on their former masters. Zing to the sort-of-present-in-this-universe, you play as a WARFRAME; a magical man enveloped by the most staggeringly beautiful piece of spandex to grace the seven galaxies. The magnificent contours of your spandex allows you powers beyond your wildest dreams, from jumping really high to tearing people apart with magical fire-gloves. Your magical journey through candyland starts off in a Cryotube getting ravenously bullied by blue crab-people named GRINEER; one of the 3 warring factions in this ed-up universe, comprised of clones that wear really stupid armor. In self defense, you gracefully tear the crab-people into tiny gibs and escape into your own personal ship named the LISET, accompanied by a really annoying voice named ORDIS. Your adventure continues through the black  expanse of space to further terrorize the crab-people of Earth, and rescue DARVO, tied to the CORPUS; s who care only about money and wear 80s spacesuits designed for really wierd fetish porn. After escaping the grasp of the crab-people and spacemen, the rest of the story falls into your hands, the sentience behind the spandex. Only you can write your own destiny, tell your own story, spin your own tale. Go forth, spandexman, and bring forth with you wrath the likes of which never graced by this generation, nor will ever be for generations to come. TLDR: Lots of grinding

review: At its core, Warframe has the potential to be an enjoyable game. With fast-paced acrobatic combat, it evokes the feeling of old-school fast-running shooters. I even got flashbacks to The Specialists. But for every minute of enjoyment I got out of the game, an hour of disappointment presented itself. As a free-to-play game, there was an expectation for some grind. But grind is deliberately an essential part of the game, for the same reason it is in subscription-based games; to encourage users to purchase Platinum. In fact, every decision by the developer seems oriented around profit. As someone used to the hobbyist approach of indie developers, this bothered me. But even beyond that, there just isn't much of the Game here. The missions are repetitive, all factions use a swarm mentality, the AI is shallow and simple, and there isn't much variety in the weapons. The game is purely gear-based. If you don't have the correct mods (which you have to grind for) or good weapons beyond the starting gear (which is deliberately weaker than most weapons) then there's just no amount of skill that can compensate for that. Despite community feedback, weaker weapons rarely (if ever) get buffed up to the current power curve, and instead get "retired to the vault" to make room for even more powerful new purchases. Unless you're allergic to variety, there is a paywall. You only get access to a paltry amount of slots for Warframes and weapon slots, and you can only purchase them with platinum. You can't even grind for them like you need to with everything else. So if you want to try a new frame, be prepared to sell the old one. Finally, just as most free-to-play games, the price of in-game currency is bloated beyond belief. The cheapest Warframe costs 75 platinum, which is a $5 purchase. More expensive frames cost up to $20 worth of platinum. For that price, you could just get another game. There are occasionally discounts you can receive for logging in daily, but these are exceedingly rare. Overall, despite how many hours this game has given me, I just can't recommend it. Most of those hours I can't even recall, as they consisted of mindless farming for Neurodes or Orokin cells so I could have something new to play with. But only a small part of it was actually fun. If you really love grind, or repetitive, shallow gameplay, you might like it. But if you want challenge, depth, or a developer that cares about more than making money, this game isn't for you.

review: You are Tenno. What is Tenno? Nobody really knows. All they see is the suit. The Frame. Beautiful and deadly. An instrument of war and destruction. You awaken, weak and powerless, with no memory of who or what you are. Vay Hek, leader of the Grineer, the genetically modified mechanically enhanced remnants of humanity, is after you. He wants to harness the power of your Warframe to fuel his campaign for galaxy wide domination. You cannot defeat him. You must escape. If you somehow manage to elude Vay Hek, and escape into the depths of the dark and unforgiving galaxy, you might just encounter other lost and memoryless Frames. Perhaps your race has a chance for survival. As you explore the galaxy, you are guided by a mysteriously entity known only as "Lotus". For reasons unknown, Lotus has taken an interest in the Tenno, and appears to be on your side. For Now. Your mission: Disrupt the three dominant powers of the galaxy through terrorist missions and guerrilla warfare. Amass the most powerfull and exotic weapons and frames known to galactic life. Discover the mysteries of the galaxy, and the secrets of the Tenno Race. If you can do all this, maybe there is hope after all.

review: I'm just gonna be simple with this: No pay to win AT ALL, there is a lot of maps that are also randomly generated and you can have a clan with your friends too in which you can create a dojo to duel in, research weapons and do much more. There is a trading system in which you can get Platinum (basically SpaceBucks so you don't have to buy it rather just trade rare items for it). It's mostly a PVE game but PVP is fun too although with bad hosts it can suck a bit. I have around 2000 hours in this game at the moment and I enjoyed every single bit of it. In the end you are a space ninja that can wallrun, use crazy abilties and be badass :D. 10/10 and it's still in beta, I'm impressed. REALLY FUN MUST GET.

review: Warframe is a fast paced RPG, Hack and Slash, and Third Person Shooter mix that blend concepts from popular games like Halo, Assassins Creed, and Call of Duty into one jam packed free-to-play online game. This game supports nearly every play style, and there is no one way to play. Unlike other games with four or five classes, this game includes 20 unique armors with unique skills to aid in your fight and with new ones added frequently. Also unlike most other free-to-play games it is not pay-to-win. Granted, you can only go so far in the game without the special currency which you have to use to get extra slots to store your armor and weapons, but thats is one of the best parts of this game, you dont have to spend a penny to get this currency, you can trade it with other players for things youve obtained in your missions that they need, you know how some people want to just buy their way to the end of the game, so there are always people buying and selling things to each other passing around this currency to each other. As far as the graphics go I am extremely impressed. The graphics surpass those of a lot of games that cost $40+ and still remain free-to-play. The gameplay is even more impressive, with 20 different warframes to choose from and each having unique abilities, the game is very dynamic. The way I might use my favorite warframe might not work for you and you might be killed frequently while I blaze through killing everyone. Also there is a miniature card game involved and each warframe and every weapon has slots where the cards go drastically changing the stats, survivability, and the abilities of your warframe and weapons. These mods are sometimes dropped by your fallen enemies with different enemies having different mods they can drop. These mods can also be traded with other players for the special currency, other mods, or for blueprints for special items found only in a special kind of mission. Which brings me to another aspect of the game: crafting. As you progress through the levels you will pick up materials that you use to build new weapons, armors, and some very useful equipment. Different locations have different components that drop from them. Being a game that takes place in space, each of the different locations is an entire planet, although most of the time your missions are inside the ships orbiting these planets. Each planet has most of its nodes ruled by a single one of the factions, from time to time there will be missions where you support one of the factions to either invade and take over the node or defend it from the opposing faction. There are three distinct factions: The Corpus, The Grineer, and the infestation. The Grineer are the first faction you come into contact with, they rule the entire first planet and are the faction in the tutorial. They are a race of humans deteriorated from years of excessive cloning. They are heavily armored units with standard bullet shooting guns and feature everything from standard machine guns to flamethrowers and rocket launchers. The next faction is The Corpus. These troops are a mix between robots with mounted laser guns and cyborgs with different laser shooting guns. These units also have recharging shields like those seen in Halo. This factions weaponry is comprised of mostly repeating energy guns, again much like those in Halo, and continuous beam lasers, also like those in Halo. Another Faction is the Infested. These are troops from the Grineer and Corpus that have been afflicted with a parasitic growth that takes over and changes their bodies, a lot of Halo references here, these being completely identical to the flood in how they work. These units are almost all melee units that are very strong and attack in swarms. As far as weapons go they have their claws and the heavier unit will slap you with its stretching arm. Almost every planet has their own boss which will randomly drop one of the three pieces you craft to form you new set of armor. Each boss has its own set of skills which most of the time will have some correlation to the warframe obtained from killing them. For example the boss General Sargus Ruk uses a flamethrower and has a variety of fire based abilities he uses to try and burn you alive. Upon his defeat he will drop one of the three parts needed to craft Ember, a fire based warframe with two abilities nearly identical to those of Ruk. While on the subject of bosses, I am going to mention another of my favorite features. Upon killing a boss you have a chance to receive a death mark. Getting one of these will give you a chance to have a deadly assassin, appropriately named The Stalker; spawn randomly into literally any mission many levels above you with extremely overpowered weapons. He is thought to be a rogue Tenno, those who can use the warframe armors, and has the same weapon load outs and many abilities shared with other warframe armors. As far as weapon load outs go, you may carry around a primary, secondary, and melee weapon, and have the choice of only bringing one weapon with you if you would like to. With this comes even more diversity in play styles. Personally I prefer t use mostly just a melee weapon, relying on a powerful long range primary and short range secondary for those tricky kills. Others might use only there primary weapon completely ignoring their secondary and melee weapons. Each weapon can be outfitted with mods to drastically change how the weapon works, one mod can cause your weapon to fire two bullets at time, while another may cause your weapons bullets to travel through enemies and objects such as walls or doors. Right now there are nearly 350 of these mods with new ones added all the time. There is also a large variety of mission types. Some of these include defending a certain object from the enemy, destroying targets such as the ships power core, or special machinery, to straight up kill everything on the ship. This game also includes a very popular RPG tool: customization. On top of the mods you add into your weapons/armor, you can also customize the clor of your weapons and armor, and there are special attachments, bought with that special currency or obtained through one of the frequent events. As a paid game I would give this a 9/10, but being completely free-to-play it gets a 10/10. Definitely a game worth trying, and if you dont like it you can just delete it with no worry about money you waited because its free

review: First of all, I have quite a number of hours under my belt, so I think I can express my opinion without being called out. When it was in beta form, the game was extremely promising.Once released commercially, it, slowly but steadily, started to become more and more of a grindfest.For first timers, it might be fun and exciting to build and craft, but as time goes by, it gets a chore and eventually the rewarding part loses it's nature. Of course the player can cut through the time consuming process by buying directly the weapons/items/frames.I think that it's not a "pay to win" tactic, (it is a free to play title), but rather "pay to save time" one.Still it will eventually tire someone, it's just a matter of reaching one's limits when he says "I 'm done with this".I personally would prefer to buy this title, and then have DLC's coming out every now and then. Moreover, the game left the player with only one viable option to complete a hefty number of important missions, if not most: rely on finding a group to help him out.Solo play has gone out of the window and multiplayer only has taken its place, and the problem becomes bigger when he sets out to craft prime weapons and frames. While admittedly the graphics and sound are top notch (although in some cases it can get to more like a colorful blurry chaos, like bad acid) , the same cannot be said about the story.There's some background information, but remains just that.Most of it never gets represented in the game, it's just background info.Lotus, the most important person that 99% of your time gives you orders and guides you through missions, gets only depicted through an intercom window.You never (so far) see her in person. The missions are simple, like 'go there, kill X person or detroy X item, exfil' or 'go there, defend, leave'.Mostly routine. Lastly, the game is quite sparse on informing the player what to do, on occasions.You might find yourself in a "ok, what am I supposed to do now?".The game's Wiki does help, but still I find it to be a huge drawback when designing a game, and believe me, you will rely a lot on information, not just on what to do, but more importantly, on the comprehensive and complex crafting and levelling system of the game. Would I recommend it?Only to people that have quite a lot of time to spend.Not all of us have 3+ hours to spend just to craft an item which then needs even multiple time to level up and on top of that some more time to customize to each one's playing style.

review: *Update 4/3/15* I started playing again once I heard about the Sanctuary update. It had a dragon warframe included, so why the  not, right? Any, I picked up right where I left off months ago, and some nice changes have been made. The new Law of Retribution raid is pretty much the only reason I can recommend this game now, for a variety of reasons. It gives you a purpose, for one. Before, I was just swapping gear and getting more powerful just to do the same old  and get even MORE gear. Now, with a massive raid as challenging as this, I finally had a reason to get my frames up to snuff and whatnot. Secondly, this raid is the only gratifying victory in the game. I felt accomplished only by the end of LoR, nothing else, as this was the only mission that wasn't just a fetch quest or grind. Another thing I've learned to love about the game since I picked it back up again is the glory of trading. Do you know how fun it is to rip off people who paid REAL money for digital  in this p.o.s. game for your digital ? It's insanely fun. Yes, kind sir, you can pay $30 for platinum and exchange it for my crappy rare mod that I have lying around. Then I'll buy the Mesa warframe with your cash, and you can enjoy a crappy mod that I can farm again in under an hour. It's great fun as long as you're not on the idiot side of things. In short, here's the scoop: Chroma, The Law of Retribution raid, and ripping people off for plat are the only kicks I can get out of this game, and now that I've done all three I assume I'll rarely be picking this up again after my recent binge. This game is still the equivalent of smoking, in that just because you unwittingly catch yourself doing it doesn't mean you'd recommend it to others. *Update over, enjoy the original review below* It's addictive for all the wrong reasons. Sure, the space ninja gameplay starts out fun enough, what with the stabby-stabby and shooty-shooty . But then, well, you realize that your only options to explore more of the game consist of A.) spending real world dollars on ridiculously overpriced content or B.) grinding and farming your way to the top of the free-to-play food chain. Now, of course, the game is built for farmers and grinders because there is a LOT OF FARMING to be done. Every single item requires a blueprint, which requires farming, then materials, which require farming, then parts of the blueprint which need farming, then the final assembly, which requires farming and grinding. In short, you could be looking at seven hours worth of work and literally three days worth of waiting just to build a new ing pistol. Unless, of course, you'd like to speed that process up for a measily $9.99. Now, I'm not not knocking the monetization as considering the game's target demographic, the farming aspects are very well done and you're ultimately never really shoved into a corner where the devs beat you up and steal your lunch money. But here's the thing: it's not addictive because the gameplay is great, it's only an okay time killer. And it's not addictive because any of the rewards are great, because no one gun or warframe is that spectacular. No, it's addictive because the temptation to get more , whatever that "more" might be for you, is always there. After 40 some odd hours wasting away my life on this game, I realize that there was no real accomplishment to show for it. No overarching story, no greatly increased OP character, no real progress. Just a swap of this frame for that frame, this gun for that gun. In short, it was like shuffling a deck of cards for 40 hours. If you have literally nothing better to do with yourself and want to spend days, weeks and months of your life like that, Warframe is hands down the free-to-play game for you. But poke past its initially endearing facade and you'll find a game so utterly trivial (even by video game standards) that shame is all you'll feel long after ignoring the clock.

review: Interesting, but very grindy and samey. Artificially difficult, you need to have grinded enough to not be dead weight to your team. The weapons are horribly imbalanced even with the new damage system and while you're supposed to be stealthy ninjas, the best way through a level is to gun everything down with the heaviest weaponry or ignore enemies and alarms entirely. The developers seem to almost genuinely care about the community, but some of their ideas are half-baked and their quality assurance team appears to be nonexistent. Ultimately, a casual run-and-gun with severe balance issues that still manages to be one of the better F2P games on the market.

review: If you like space and ninjas then you have found the right game :D It's a co-op game that have a party of 4 players :D It also has PvP ( Players vs Players ) but I have never tried it because I don't usually like PvP in co-op oriented games, But anyways that's just my opinion :D It's also very repetitive :p And one more thing. It takes some time to build/craft gear and other random things in the game like weapons, pets, Warframes ( Other classes ) And other stuff. But thats because it's a f2p ( Free 2 Play ) game :D The game gets a 11 out of 10 because they tell you to take a break :D

review: I think I'll kick this off by squashing a few rumors or misconceptions, Warframe is NOT a Pay2Win game but it is in a Pay for Convenience format. What do I mean by Pay for Convenience? Every gameplay changing weapon, item, part.etc can be gotten through simply playing the game whether you're grinding for that specific resource or rare drop or not. Another feature is these 12/24/72 hour building periods for weapons, enhancements or Warframes. BUT HOW IS THAT JUSTIFIED?!? Well that's simple, this is a Free to play game and the Devs need a way to earn money, yet you can still get every item you want simply by playing and waiting. If you choose to spend money you can use it to rush foundry builds or outright buy items from the market or trade chat. Another thing to note is this game is still technically in beta (despite having a working ingame Market focused around premium currency) and receiving updates nearly every week. Now that that is out of the way lets move on to the real review. Warframe is a game about an ancient warrior race, they are called Tenno. (some may recognize this as the last name of the protagonist in the Dark Sector series, that game is also created by Digital Extremes an Warframe is seen as its successor) In a nutshell they are a group of Space Ninja whose sole purpose is to maintain balance of power in the Solar System. How might they do that? Simple, they slaughter hundreds of deteriorating clones, Greedy Merchants and Infected who are pretty much zombies of the aforementioned clones and merchants. Gameplay can be a mixed bag for people, Its generally Pve with the occasional pvp thrown in due to fan requests. You will have a Primary, Secondary and Melee weapon. This is simply to create versatility in your loadouts and to offer unique ways to approach the fast paced combat. Now I mentioned before grinding and waiting times, yes you will need to wait a few hours or days to build your new weapons and Warframes but its Free to Play so I'm going to let it slide. I understand this review could be more concise, but there are so many more that do this game more justice than mine. Besides its free to play, you should give it a few hours and then decide for yourself.

review: THis game has nice graphics and the gameplay is fun. However, there's a reason why this is still in beta. After playing for a week or two you'll see that pretty much all the missions are quite similar. Sure there are different ones like Extermination and Survival, but most of them end in getting the task done and then running back to "Extraction". Also, this game is a complete grindfest. The Devs put up ridiculous prices so you either have to buy the item or you have to grind for DAYS in order to get it. However, if you do get your item, it usually takes days for it to be ready. A new warframe takes THREE DAYS. THREE! And you need three components (which all take a day each to build) in order for you to move on to the main blueprint (takes 3 days to build). So this game emphasizes on you either having money or time. But yeah, not much content or backstory either. I seems interesting enough, but it's so vague. I would just play this for a week and then get on with your life.

review: For a free-to-play online shooter, this is as good as it gets. Really great graphics, pretty interesting co-op gameplay. Basically, you're getting Left4Dead + Mass Effect in this one. It gets a little repetitive after some time and monetization is forced sometimes, but hey -- it's overall free and the game is pretty good by itself, even when you're not paying to get some stuff. I'd rate this game 8.5/10.

I would highly recommend this game if your PC is at least Medium-Spec, and you're into Parkour Shooters like GunZ, S4 League, or any other Games similar to them. It's ing SPACE NINJAS, for Christ Sake. You can't go wrong with that! GET THIS GAME! You will definitely not regret it!

review: It's unfortunate when a game with this much potential chooses to be crippled by all the standard free-to-play tropes in the name of profit. Everything you hate about free to play games is front and center in Warframe: an unenjoyable, crippled experience if you don't buy ingame currency, infinite grinding and farming, and pay-to-win that makes your character and weapons twice as powerful if you don't play and farm 40+ hours a week. A special note needs to be made about the level of grinding in this game. The game is literally nothing but farming and grinding. There is nothing else in the game. One of the central mechanics of the game is to level, then relevel, your character and weapons. Each time you completely relevel something in the game you gain a few more points to put towards the abilities of the character or weapon. Imagine if you played World of Warcraft and upon reaching level cap you had the option to relevel your character from level 1 to level cap, and the reward for doing so was you would gain half of an ability slot. The game was fun but flawed until the recent "Combat 2.0" system was implemented. In one patch Digital Extremes changed all weapons so that any weapon you choose is only effective against 1/3 of the enemies, experience gain was cut by more than half, and coincidentally the same patch also added the ability to purchase any abilities or "mods" you might need from other players using in-game currency. To put it more pointedly the developers made weapons 1/3 as effective and not only did they not reduce the amount of grinding necessary to level those weapons they made levelling items and acquiring resources more than twice as difficult. They simultaneously added an option to spend real money in order to buy whatever you may need from other players, presumably in order to not be accused of having the game be blatantly "pay-to-win" if they sold the items directly. As you can see I put over 700 hours into this game, and there are some aspects that are (were) fun. Greed and hubris have finally overcome and outweighed the enjoyable aspects of this "game". If you enjoy pay-to-win, farming, grinding, levelling then relevelling you character and weapons, "content" that consists of running a few mission types infinitely, and overpaying for virtual items and goods than Warframe is probably the game for you.

review: For a game in it's beta version it is actually quite impressive. This game is a 3rd person co-op shooter game featuring (the generic definition) "Mothering space ninjas with magic." There is a large variation of characters to fit anyones play style including various and very unique and powerful energy abilities and weapons. I have never seen a game with such advanced player movements including wall runs, sliding, jump kicks, and dodge rolling which really keeps the game feeling fast paced and exhilarating. The game excels in graphics, level design, and combat keeping the game very dynamic with the best experience making this one of the best free-to-play game in existence.

review: Speaking as a player from the Steam Release in 2013. Wasted potential: The Game Horrible weapon and frame balancing. Devs seem to outright refuse to fix fundemental issues with the game and are just content with piling more shiny things onto the garbage heap. Endgame can be hit within the first 5-10 hours of play. It's just grind and scamming other players in trade-chat. Game is incapable of being difficult without also being tedious at the same time (meat sponges; insta-gib-capable foes; forcing gear limitations; stat restrictions, etc.). In part due to the satisfying but ultimately imbalanced movement system and fundementally broken mod system. Mod system relegates player progression to the mercy of RNG's whims. Mod drop tables are over-saturated with useless things (like +7.5% radiation resistance) that absolutely nobody runs. If anybody tells you that they run those mods, they're simply horrible players or their mod count is lower than the number of combined digits across their fingers and toes. Stances; advertised as a long-awaited fix to the horrible melee system, were a disappointment and also relegated to the drop tables, futher saturating them. No variety in builds if you want to grind efficiently. Stack damage mods on guns; slip in crit mods if the base chance is 20% or more; put every power mod that would be suitable on your frame, then fill the rest with durability mods. Melee has been awful forever and only serves as a mobility tool. Enemies are either inconsequential glass figures or spicy meat-sponges due to the messed up scaling bought upon by the mod system. Don't ever buy platinum (paid currency) unless you get a 50% off coupon or better as a daily login reward. It's horrible value for money otherwise. For the love of god do not buy the starter packs on Steam at their base price. They are a HUGE rip-off; only reason I bought the Tenno Pack last year is because it was like 75% off during winter sales and became excellent value-for-money. Weapons and Warframes in the market are hideously overpriced considering you'll need to go through tens of weapons and warframes to rank-up. PvP is an absolute joke. You know how in most RPGs you deal a lot of damage compared to enemies, but also have a lot less HP compared to them? It's like turning party members in those games against each-other. You just run about instagibbing/getting instagibbed and finding ways to cheese the system. Enemy variety is poor, with the only real distinctions being the differences between heavy troops and regular ones (the former of which is the only thing you should really consider when modding weapons as they're far, far more resilient than regular enemies). There's no pay2win, only pay2notgrind. Warframe utilizes a time-based gating system like those commonly found in mobile games. You kill enemies in missions, they'll drop materials. You'll buy the blueprint from the marketplace. And then you'll craft the item. Weapons take a minimum of 12 hours to craft; clantech takes 24 hours PLUS the time spent crafting the pre-requiste materal (this can make the cumulative time of some clantech to be over 96 hours if you're dead-on with your timing in moving through each stage) Although there are many missions available which offer those special materials as rewards, massively reducing the total clantech crafting time. Warframes take a minimum of 84 hours to craft; get the helmet, system and chassis blueprints as random boss drops, they take 12 hours each but can be crafted simeltaneously, then combine them into the main warframe blueprint from the market, which takes 72 hours to craft. To be honest, I don't have an issue with the time-gating system as it isn't coupled with pay2win stuff like most time-gate systems are. Although some might, which is why I've explained it here. The good things about the game? It looks very nice. Although the atmosphere is non-existent as opposed to how it was years ago (go search for early-2013/late-2012 footge and compare it with 2014 footage). Movement system is fun but is almost impossible to balance around without introducing tedium. Gunplay is okay I guess. Devs don't do rollbacks whenever exploits pop up and are fixed. If you're fast, you can capitalize. Only real reason I'm still on-and-off with this game is, plainly put, some form of addiciton. Although I did quit cold-turkey for about 8 months earlier this year out of plain disgust with their implementation of the stances system. At the time of writing this, it seems I'm phasing out again. Whether or not I'll come back I don't know. Although I'm looking at this from the perspective of a long-time player; so if you're new then you probably haven't become disillusioned with the game quite yet and will enjoy the bit that you play. It's like a worse version of Mass Effect 3's multiplayer. Also: Warbros #1

review: Warframe is a great timewaster that is not only fun, but affordable. Unlike most "free2play" models used by developers, Digital Extremes takes a different approach, in that anything you can get with platinum (Warframe's currency that is exchanged for irl money) can be obtained without buying it, excluding inventory slots for weapons, Warframes, and companions, colors, and syandanas (Think of them as scarves) or Sugutras (Think of them as scarves for your melee weapon). Even the platinum you spend can be earned through trading for rare parts to Prime weapons and Warframes, as well as rare mods. The only thing platinum allows you to do is get things faster and easier. One of Warframe's highpoints is that it's easy to jump right in, play a quick 3 minute mission with (Up to four) friends, and jump right back out. You can spend a few minutes playing, and that few minutes might change into a few hours, but it might not. The user interface has traded a bit of functionality for looks, but when I say it traded, it got a LOT of looks out of the deal. It's quite the knockout of a UI, visually. Digital Extremes themselves are a good company. They listen well to the community, and try to find a middle ground between pleasing the playerbase, and making the game into the vision of what they want it to be. As of recent updates they appear to be pushing back much needed bug and balancing issue fixes in favor of new content, but hopefully that will slow down and they will realize that this game, is not only their baby, but a giant chunk of software that needs polishing. It might be their baby, but currently their baby is a little bit under the weather and they refuse to buy cold medicine. But this is understandable. They are excited to make their game. The game is a timewaster, and can be addictive (As my in-game hours show), but it can also be played casually, though progress will be slower. There are no paywalls, and finding a match is fairly easy. There are tons of characters and weapons and even companions to choose from, and you will find no shortage of fun to be had, so long as you take care not to burn yourself out. The level designs get repetetive after a while, but new tilesets are added often, and enemies will become a challenge very quickly until you can equip yourself well enough to be the warrior-god you were meant to be. Enemies will again become a challenge in later levels. The biggest gripe reviewers have (I'm looking at you IGN) about Warframe is its lack of a story, plot, lore, and quests. Quests are a recently added feature that is so far a bit underdeveloped, but has amazing potential. Often reviewers ask "What exactly is the point of this game? What objective are you trying to reach?" And the simple answer is, there is no objective. The game is there for fun, and fun alone. The fun of slaughtering hordes of enemies with a single blade, blowing up a battalion of troops with a rocket launcher, and then using an ability to stomp so hard you literally FREEZE TIME. The fun of being a powerful slaughterfactory that cant be stopped (Until you reach later levels). Warframe is, overall, a good game. It has a nice grimdark feel, interesting character designs, a responsive and involved developer, and is being constantly updated and reshaped. Being critical, I would have to give it an 8/10. Should the developers get some content fixes out, I'd give it a 9/10. So grab a few buddies, grab your trusty Skana, and go kill some Grineer!

review: So after playing Warframe for 1,040 hours (Steam says about 658 hours, but it's incorrect.), I finally decided to write a review on the game. In this review, I'll be stating how "Free to Play" the game actually is and what the gameplay is like, what the game offers in terms of content, and a pros/cons list at the end of the review to sum things up. So first off, how Free to Play is this game anyways? As a lot of us know, most Free to Play games have you paying for microtransactions to get most content in the game, with no way of using the in-game resources or currency to get them instead. Warframe does not do this, only cosmetic items, color pallets, interior decorations for your Liset, etc. Things like Weapons, Warframes, and Companions can all be earned by playing the game and getting enough resources/credits. Although Warframe and Weapons slots can't be obtained without platinum (Warframe slots are 20 platinum each and weapon slots are 2 for 12 platinum), you can trade items in the trade channel to people in exchange for platinum. Another thing I should mention is Foundry build rushing. If you are building a weapon or Warframe in the foundry, you will notice a "Rush build" option. This isn't spendy though, usually only costing 25-50 platinum to do so. Trust me, if you have what people want, you can obtain a hefty amount of platinum without paying a dime and have plenty to spend on rushing builds or buying slots. Now if you actually start liking the game and want to spend money to get things quicker, this is where you could have a tough time. Market prices from Digital Extremes are, you could say, "Extreme". With Weapons usually costing about $5-$12 depending on the weapons and Warframes costing $5-$20 depending on the Warframe. To put this into a better perspective, it costs $5 for the most basic package of platinum, which is 75 platinum, all the way to $200 worth of platinum, which is 4300 platinum. There is a cheaper way to get platinum though. The game has a login reward system and sometimes you can get a coupon for 25%, 50%, and 75% off your next platinum purchase. This would be an ideal time to buy some. They started doing Prime Access, which allows you to access the lastest prime Warframe and weapons instantly.....for $150 of course. The cheapest package you can get in Prime Access give you just the prime accessories, a 90 day Affinity Booster, and a 90 day Credit Booster....for $50!! I feel Prime Access just isnt all that affordable, but maybe that's just me. My rating on Warframe's Free to Play factor is a 9/10. Alright, next thing to talk about is the actual gameplay. Is it fun? Is it rewarding? Well, Warframe can be very fun to play at times, other times it can be annoying and tedious to play. It's a 3rd person view Co-Op/PvP shooter with unique elements that will be talked about later. In the beginning, you will have a choice among 3 Warframes ( Excalibur, Mag, or Volt), you will have a choice between 2 primary weapons ( MK1-Braton or MK1-Paris), you will have a choice between 2 secondary weapons (Lato or MK1-Kunai), and you will have a choice between 2 melee weapons (Skana or MK1-Bo). Either of the Warframe are fun to play, in my opinion. The MK1-Braton is garbage, both secondaries are good for beginners, and both melee weapons are good for beginners as well. Getting used to some of the controls might be a pain at first (Such as wall-running and sliding), but eventualy you'll get the hang of it and be flipping around like a space ninja in no time! Basically what I'm saying here is that the beginning of the game is hard to get past, in the sense that you feel underpowered and weak compared to your foes. If stick with it long enough to get better equipment, then it becomes much more fun to play. Weapons are fun and all, but I think the Warframes are what spice the game up the most. Each Warframe has a set of 4 powers that you unlock as you rank them up. The powers are some of the most fun this game has to offer. Example scenario: You are a rank 10 Excalibur surrounded by 25 Grineer troopers and there are just too many to shoot and kill before you die yourself. What do you do at this point? Activate Radial Javelin, which is your most powerful power as Excalibur, and watch as all 25 of them are pinned to the walls around you. Eventually, you'll be able to do the same thing, but with 50 guys surrounding you. Warframe powers, yes please. Now what about rewarding gameplay? This game can reward you at times, however, it can be very grindy. The first thing you'll probably farm for in this game are resources. Resources aren't that painful to try to get, although Orokin Cells, Neurodes, Neural Sensors, and Argon Crystals are the ones you will be grinding out on the most. In terms of farming, the only real things that could be tedious to obtain are Warframe parts, Prime Warframe parts, Prime Weapon parts, and Archwing parts. Speaking of Archwing, if you have played the game awhile now and feel the need for something new to do, try getting the Odonata Archwing and fly through deep space in Archwing missions. It's a breath of fresh air if you feel like ground combat is getting boring. Gameplay can get pretty intense at times, if you finally have the loadout to survive 30 minutes on Warframe's survival gamemode or 30+ waves on Warframe's defense mode. All in all, the gameplay is fun, the farming/grinding usually isnt fun, but once you get that weapon built or Warframe built, the fun begins yet again. Overall, Warframe's gameplay gets an 8/10 from me. Now to talk about what Warframe has to offer in terms of content. Well, it has a lot of content to offer compared to when I started back in June 2013. There are 22 Warframes available to play as, not counting the Prime Warframes (Only difference is they have an extra polarity and look way cooler). There are 100+ weapons in the game as well, not to mention the primes of course. There are 14 planets to visit, each with increasing number of missions available. Tons of mods to choose from, including melee stances, which enhance your melee weapons by allowing you to perform combos. Just, plenty of content for a newcomer to explore. Every other Wednesday, Digital Extremes usually updates the game with new content, bugfixes, and changes that improve the experience of the game. Usually every two months, Digitial Extremes puts out a massive update, usually going up a whole number ( As in Update 14.5 goes to Update 15). These massive updates add hours upon hours of new things to do. Warframe's amount of content gets a 10/10 from me. Now finally, a pros/cons list to sum everything up (And some things I didnt talk about): Pros: -The game is fun to play once you get the hang of things. -Easy to learn thanks to a tutorial -PvE and PvP -You can earn content in the game without paying -Friendly community -There is a wealth of content -At least 7 gamemodes to play -Endgame is cool, more to come! -No Pay to Win business models -Rewarding exploration (Especially in Void missions) -Warframe powers are fun as hell -Most boss fights are awesome for a F2P -Alerts, Invasions, and Infestations as daily missions are great and rewarding -Most all weapons past the beginner ones are great -Pet dogs Cons: -Market pricing is a bit steep -Prime access is ridiculous -There is some farming/grinding -Some bugs still in the game a frustrating -Napalms are jerks -Beginning of the game loadouts can be tough to get past (Because of how underpowered they feel) -Higher mastery rank Tenno entering your game could ruin the experience for you -Some people in trade overprice everything ever Let me know if there's anything I could add, as this is my first review :). If you need any help in-game, add me as ttrlabs02. If I'm online and not busy, I shall help you out! Thanks for reading, Tenno.

review: Warframe is undeniably one of the most satisfying experiences I've had with a Free to Play title. It contains an ever expanding arsenal of weapons, mods, and warframes that can be mixed and matched for endless possible combinations. The game also features a highly satisfying clan system including the ability to build your own clan hall, which provides several bonuses besides the simple meeting area with cosmetics. And the great feature of Warframe is that it always contains a challenge. From raiding the Orokin towers, to hunting down the elusive Stalker and Harvester, something is there to put your mettle to the test. And in case it wasn't clear, you play as freakin' Space Ninjas. What's not to love?

review: This game started out fun enough, especially for a free to play game. Unfortunately, every patch (and there's about 4/week) makes the game even worse. It's been out for almost a year, and I don't think a single bug has ever been addressed, while every patch brings a whole host of new bugs; most minor, some major. The netcode is terrible. There are no dedicated servers, instead relying on one of the four players to host. It seeks out the absolute worst host imagineable for every game. When I play with friends it's fine, but about 9/10 times you play with the public the lag is so bad as to render the game as unplayable. The game frequently refuses to accept certain inputs. It's fairly common to just be plain unable to use your melee weapon, or be unable to crouch for several games. Bosses occasionally become completely invincible. Did I mention the lag? It's bad. I don't just mean there's lots of snap back, and targets become impossible to hit; I'm talking extended intervals (i.e. double-digit minutes) where it's so bad you have trouble leaving the room you're currently in. The variety of weapons started out as neat, unfortunately they've increased the grind factor needed to get them every day. This is the rare case of a an early Beta game being pretty fantastic, but absolutely every change they've made since then has been for the worse. I would pay money for the Warframe of 8 months ago. I wouldn't pay $0.01 for the Warframe of today.

review: Well this game has actually surprised me... I love anything Ninja based and when they said Ninja's with Guns in Space at first i was like WTH. But after playing for the past few weeks i have to admit this game is Freaking Awesome. A few problems here and there but the design team are always coming up with new content and fixing those bugs faster than they pop up. I absolutely love the starter selection of Warframes (your cyber ninja suit) and would only recommend adding a notice that the weapons and sidearms you select in the first mission will be that you are stuck with till you can make your own later on. And also a way of maybe choosing to play the first mission as one of the alternative warframes. A way to test the different classes out you are offered. I mean as a new player the skills and stuff mean very little And the only way to test it all out and find your Niche' is to play the different character types. With alot of game where you have to pay for certain in Game items you know from the get go guys who have cash to blow will get the best and the rest of us meer mortals with  Exchange rates will be stuck with the scraps... Warframe gives you the option to jump ahead with Paid content but everyone can get there eventually. No items that are Platinum(in game real money Currency) only that can not be found or made later. Its all just a matter of time and according to some higher level friends you can actually start trading platinum at a later stage. Overall i love the game a bit of a rocky start but well worth it.

review: The life of a warframe player -Gets game. -Plays for 30 hours . -Starts noticing the paywall. (Dont you dare say there isn't. You need a catalyst/reactor to make your frame/ weapons do damage to anything over lvl 30. Yes they drop in alerts but unless you want to wait a fortnight at a time at the chance of getting one you will end up putting money into it) -Puts money into the game and it feels like a whole other game. -Starts the farm for "prime" parts. -Hits 600 hours and has all prime frames and weapons. -Just sits there wondering why the  they just did all of that. Ok for all of you saying "there is no paywall they drop in alerts." You do realise they drop ONCE a bloody fortnight. For a non casual player playing this that drop rate is too bloody small. You will gain more weapons in one week that you want to catalyst than the amount of catalysts drop in a whole damn year. NEXT TIME READ THE DAMN REVIEW BEFORE YOU SAY THEY DROP IN ALERTS!

review: Grinding. Do not play this game unless you enjoy grinding. I wake up screaming at night because I have nightmares about things not dropping. The same map over and over and over again until that one little piece of gear drops. That is what this game is about. Also shiny asses, but only on the men.

review: It's very rare that a F2P game with a model like this keeps my interest for over a few minutes, but I've been playing Warframe for 7 hours within the first day of downloading it. Really surprisingly quality and well-polished combat as well as loads of different mods and abilities makes for a really entertaining game overall.

review: A very well made Free to Play 3rd person shooter. Uses a custom lanucher/updater. GAMEPLAY Gameplay is quite repetitve in the long run. There are a bunch of planets available to you, each with sectors ( missions ) with different gamemods which you complete for rewards. The game uses tiles to randomly generate levels. Some planets have unique tilesets, etc. Has a bunch of different weapons and weapon types, each item has to be ranked up with XP. You can then mod your weapon/warframe/etc with a huge amount of mods to tweak each parameter to your liking. Has a lore, but there's no campaign as such, just a few story quests. REAL MONEY Basically almost nothing is locked behind a paywall in this game. The only exceptions I found are some cosmetics ( character attachements, color pallettes, animations sets ) and inventory size ( For weapon and characters ). You can trade in-game currency bought for real money to other players at higher levels, which means that you can unlock pretty much everything for free, which enough time put into the game. Not only that, but you can get a -75% discount on Platinum ( Currency bought for real money ) as a daily login reward, and for 5$ you can get enough of it to lift all restrictions on the inventory size and buy some cheap cosmetics. Buying weapons/characters for platinum is pointless because you can simply craft, or acquire them otherwise. SCORE If I had to give it a score, I'd say 7.5/10.

review: Way back then I have had a good look at Firefall and Warframe. Both quite unpolished and in so much need of work. Gave Firefall the benefit of the doubt, and just loved it. I needed a change though and a good buddy of mine in Firefall, was also playing Warframe and so I asked how the game was these days. Three months later, and I am all in on this game. With Firefall having open space and more of an MMO feeling, Warframe is level based, with a mission. A big change for me, but liking it lots. You get to know the mechanisms, the frames, mods etc etc and just get better at it. Frames keep leveling, so are the mods. All these things give you a feeling of accomplisment in this game. The frames are quite distinctive, and all have their specific abilities that make you come back for more. DE is adding more features, releases frames or updated/upgraded frames (Prime) and hopefully in the near future I'd like to get more into the lore of the Tenno. Every week a live community stream and I believe every other week a dev stream as well. Both with giveaways. All in all a great game that will let you have a great time with your buddies. ps. It's certainly not p2w at all. Almost everything you want, you can get it by playing certain levels etc etc. If you do pay, that's great. The game deserves all the support :)

Where you are not forced to buy DLC with weird crap that allows you to shot enemy, or buying some weapons to make a kill on a low level farming loots. You can choise between Hardcore farm and Trading with people, or quick purchase using your wallet. That what I truly call F2P (Free to Play), not Pay to Play.

review: Warframe is a refreshing take on the squad based 3rd Person shooter, in its over all game play and especially its art design. While not every gamer's taste, I find Warframe to be a refreshing take on design. The characters and aliens are unique, very inspired and striking. My compliments to the art direction and the whole team. The gameplay is tight, responsive and franciticly exciting giving the player the experience of feeling like they're a true "space ninja". You'll be parkouring over obstacles, climbing on walls, hacking apart enemies and sliding across floors while going all "John Woo" on anyone that stands between your teams and your objective, Ninja. I've found myself coming back to this game over and over again ever since a friend got me into it way back in June 13'. As of today, I've already spend hundreds of hours in Warframes. Game sessions can be as pick up and play as a half hour or turn into longer survival and raids. Its one of the most open to all FTP's out there. Paying players don't overwhelm the F2P players in the gameplay department. They just don't have to spend the time gathering and crafting those items. All of which can be easily found in the game and created with miniumal grind time compared to how many other F2P's work. Digital Extremes really did this game right, give it a try and you won't be disappointed.

review: I've played this game for a LONG while now. I love ninjas and slaughtering my enemies. This game gives both of that to me. I have always been a huge fan of third person shooters. And 'Warframe' gives me the extra boost that I need to be on the top of every game. I mean come on, I'm sure those of you who want to see how AWESOME your character looks while your slaughtering your enemies. I mean, a game just doesn't feel right if I don't look cool, right? Anyways, this game does not really have a story yet and I still love the game, I have spent a lot of money on the game even when you aren't required to. I put this one aspect of the game on the top of this list because the game is not P2W (Pay to Win) and that is the main reason I have stuck to this game for so long. You can craft everything in this game, the warframes, the guns, the ammo and health packs. I mean you don't have to spend money aside from if you want to have more than 2 warframes or if you want an awesome looking cape or scarf that has absolutely no attributes. But, you can buy every gun and every cape and so on. But you can craft it, it may take around 12-24 hours or if you're looking at warframes it adds up to 3 days but you can wait, trust me. Also, if you aren't looking to collect every warframe, you'll be just fine with just 2 frames. I have only used the Frost Prime, and the Vauban. I'm stuck on those 2 frames. I have a lot of other warframes but I'm just so connected to the ones I currently have because they are EPIC. There are some items you cannot buy. And that is what makes them so precious. They have a special name to them also, that way, you can rub it into your friends face that you finally made the weapon or warframe. The first 3 items that came out were called the Frost Prime, the Latron Prime, and the Reaper Prime. They were such a high demand, people were always asking people to take them on void runs. Which that reminds me. To have a chance to get the parts to make the weapons/warframes, you have to get Void Keys from survival missions or defence missions. (Don't worry, it will take a while, but it's definitely worth it!) The game can sometimes get boring to me I will admit, after playing for about 3-4 hours you get tired of slaughtering your enemies because most of the time you will be farming for supplies or just surviving it out on a survival mission with your buddies. But then, you can just go play a different mission and have fun all over again! They have a variety of different mission types out there while your waiting for that storyline to come together, some like Extermination, Capture, Defence,and plenty more. The game does not make all enemies level with you, you can choose to play on a low level mission or you can choose to play on a high level mission. Each planet has its own set amount of missions all with increasing difficulty as you go along. Every update they have had (And I will say, they update frequently.) they have added more and more content. I will tell you this, if you're tired of games having a limit on how much weapons they have on the game, then this game is the game for you. There are TONS and TONS of guns and melee weapons you can choose from, I've played for a while and I can say some guns I don't like, others I love and will use over and over. Each warframe and gun has 30 levels you can achieve. Each level, it adds a mod point that will allow you to add mods to your gun. Now, 'Call of Duty' players don't get so excited, I don't mean mods like scopes and camo, I mean mods that will change fire rate, bullet damage, bullet elemental damage, and SO MUCH more. But, now you 'Call of Duty' players can get excited for this. You can relevel your gun, why you ask? Because you get to change a mod slot to make it have a symbol on it. Now, you're wondering what does the symbol do? Well, if it matches the symbol on the mod card, it only takes up half of the points that the mod uses. It is definitely worth it to relevel a gun, especially if you plan on using that gun for a long time! I can't wait to see the storyline come together, and I can't wait to see what Warframe becomes. 10/10

review: While sometimes a bit repetitive and grindy, the game offers a fair free to play market based system, with just about everything not cosmetic on the market place obtainable in game with a little work. My only real complaint is actually just the community at times. If you aren't used to the games parkour, speed tricks, and moving while fighting mechanics, some of the higher end players doing lower level missions will simply leave you in the dust and not look back, completing the mission themselves, leaving you sort of an empty experience with the mission. The most intimidating thing about the game is its parkour system though, being able to move at extreme speeds, wall running, climbing and vaulting just about anything, sliding while unleashing a torrent of melee attacks or gun fire, and using it all to your advantage. Give it some time, after a couple of hours practicing it can start to become second nature, especially anyone used to combo based games. But in the end when you are feel confident about your ability to do it all, nothing feels more badass then executing a series of attacks while sliding and moving through waves of enemies quickly and efficiently, and being able to turn around when all is said and done to see some of their bodies still falling to the ground. And come on, whats better then being a freaking space ninja with guns.

review: Warframe is a retrofit, fast-paced, animated novel. You'll encounter deep and thorough story elements along with deep and interesting game mechanics. You'll find no grinding in this game so Farmville lovers beware. This first person, tatical, real-time strategy, tower defense game is very hard to put down and will have you racing around the track for hours on end. I give this game a Square Enix out of an Electronic Arts.

review: I been playing Warframe for almost 1300 in-game hrs. For me Warframe is a game with beautiful graphics, i must admit game artists are very original and it keeps me hooked into this game. Gameplay wise, the game requires you good amount of grinding, if you are a RPG kind of player that is adapted to play repetitive missions this will not be an issue at all. Warframe Developers are great, they release constant updates every month (sometimes even every week) and game support is the best i've seen. Devs are always in contact with the comunity and constantly reading player opinions. A good point about Warframe is that it doesn't require real money to become strong, you can get almost all equipments without Platinum (real money currency) Anyways Platinum is a great help, mainly focused for players that lacks time to play.

review: Warframe is an enjoyable game. But here's the list of things you don't wanna do if you wish to play it for a looooong time. -Rushing missions- Warframe gets boring and hard to play if you play the missions just to get the loot, enjoy the game in whole. -Playing every mission online- Now, you might just laugh at this one but, its true! There are many trolls and whiners in this game since its free-to-play, many rushers too. -Getting someone to get you all the things you want- This one is the biggest reason to become boring. I knew this guy, he played for a week, and already had 70 hours on record. He got all the things he wanted in one week. Eventually game became boring and lame to him and he stopped playing. Now the things that will make you play the game: Really neat developers, will often respond to community questions and bugs Constant Dev-streams which spoil all the things you always wanted Often patches Often mini-updates which bring in new weapons and stuff No paywall. You can basicly get everything in game for free except the cosmetics which are here just for those who want them Things that make not play this game: Trolls and whiners Hard to get materials Elitistic s If you really like the game like I do, you will ignore all the things that make you quit the game.

review: Warframe simply put is a solid, well rounded video game. I spent a while trying to sum it up with a genre but it borrows from several. Mass Effect with jumping! It's a third person shooter/brawler that puts you in the role of a Tenno, a nearly extinct race awaking to find several factions ruining the galaxy and various shenanigans occuring that are for your detriment. Going on missions in various space stations, ships and planets using tons of weapons and warframes in a free2play game that looks and plays like a current gen AAA game. + Good Graphics & Sound Design + Large amound of varied enemies, unique styles and boss battles. + Procedurally generated maps with dozens of tile sets. + Very satisfying gunplay and indepth melee combat/combo system. + Fantastic replay value. + Hundreds of weapons covering all different categories and type & Plenty of warframes to get with very unique abilities. + Decent story and universe created. + F2P - Lack of direction to new players after initial quests. - Late game can slowly get repetetive. - Minor inconveniences to be had if not spending any real money. - PvP is currently Peer2Peer and very laggy with no tangible rewards for putting time into it. - A lot of mechanics go unexplained unless you actively check the codex/wiki. In essence you are able to progress through hundreds of missions that are instanced for up to 4 players in a squad, completing random objectives in procedurally generated maps against one of the 5 possible enemy factions (or sometimes a combination!) This is a solid formula, with a lot of different planet/map tilesets, a ton of very well crafted rooms and a very hefty roster of enemies for each of the main faction. Combine this with the hundreds of weapons you can craft (varying from pistols to grenade launchers to crossbows to electric boomerangs to rail guns), 20+ warframes (classes with very unique 4 abilities, akin to a MOBA) to choose from, a very good looking engine and some solid gunplay/melee combat and you've got a fantastic game in it's own right. You level up and upgrade all of your gear with mods that drop from enemies constantly, so everyone can tailor their weapons and warframe to their own liking and you do get a very solid sense of progression. You can parkour around the maps, wall run, pull of some complex melee combos and act like a space ninja, or you can be moving from cover to cover, co-ordinating with your team and playing it through like a tactical third person shooter. It has a very good looking engine that stands up by todays standards depiste the game being nearly 3 years old (counting the closed beta) It's got a godly particle system, as well as full usage of PhysX, very cool looking units and maps and a consistent art style throughout. The sound design is very competent but the music stands out the most, there are several dynamic sound tracks when fighting each of the factions that change depending on how much combat is happening but they all sound very unique and cool to listen to in the middle of some hectic shenanigans. The kicker being that this is completely free to play. This is a hybrid co-op/MMO without the 1-9 button smashing on the keyboard and it relies entirely on your skill with the weapons, abilities and movement to be good. It being a F2P MMO esque game, you do have to craft new weapons and warframes which take time but due to how inherently fun the actual gameplay is, farming for materials or blueprints never feels like a chore and 99% of the time you'll be collecting more than enough materials just while playing normally. There's a ton of PvE mission types, some new PvP, horde modes, a space combat mode (think zone of the enders) and plenty of replay value inbetween. There are several story quests and tutorial missions to all new players a grasp on all of the basic mechanics however once the tutorials are over you are just sort of left to your own devices. The lack of constant direction might annoy a few players but I strongly reccomend just deciding that you want to go and check out a planet or get a cool weapon then work toward those goals, seeing new things and acquiring more equipment on the way. Planets have bosses, new planets need to be unlocked and so on so there are tangible goals to set yourself. You can create a clan with your friends, build a very large Dojo that can be used for trading, researching exclusive weaponry, dueling, storing event trophies as well as assisting in building solar rails for the very large scale PvP solar rail conflicts. I would reccomend if you're really into it getting just a few dollars worth of platinum then buying a scarf, they're cool, because it's in space.

review: The thing that immediately drew me in to this title was how apparent the use of Zbrush was when creating the characters. Seriously, as a character modeler myself, this is like all the stuff you want to make in Zbrush but can never get into a real game because it's too far away from mainstream design. The dev team is a bunch of hardworking people who outdo themselves with each update. I cannot begin to describe how happy I am with the growth of this game, it blows me away every time an update rolls out. The events are super fun, the weapons modding is full of tons and tons of options, there is an ever growing list of items and warframes, and there is just so much to bite into in this game. I am a person who enjoys deep detail and stats and customization, and this game speaks to that need very well, in addition to the utter beauty of the visuals. Oh, by the way, it's totally free. The only place I find a little lacking is lore. They have done a lot of worldbuilding and set up a great stage for their characters but have not embellished them or the history of the world very much. This grows with every update, of course, but I feel it is growing much more slowly than the game itself is. I'd love to even just be able to read more somewhere, if nothing else. However, there is enough there though to latch onto to make stuff up, and that can be fun. Would love a bit more! Ok go try it now.

review: It's an awesome concept, but the game gets stale after the first 30-40 hours of gameplay. You find yourself collecting the same things in the same levels against the same 3 basic enemy types. The only thing that changes as you level up is the variety of weaponry available and the number of enemies on-screen. Imagine ME3's co-op multiplayer mode turned into a giant standalone, minus the variety. That's Warframe.

Also, it being a f2p you seriously don't need to buy anything with real money ever. I bought 8 dollars worth of platinum for a color pack, weapon slots, and character slots.

review: The developers *Digital Extremes* has continually made this game a piece of crap. Let me explain. To get the Detron, a piece of gear that has been wanted by players to be added for a month, was finally added. How to get it? Well, you do missions against the Corpus *Also known as Boxhelmets and Robots*, while siding with the Cyborg armored guys. Each mission gives a 5% chance or so, to have a "Harvester" spawn at you in another game, which if you abort, will cancel the Harvester coming at you. This Harvester once killed can drop nothing, a Detron Blueprint, a Detron Chassis, or a Detron Barrel. When third party programs tried to find a way to properly make the Harvester spawn easier, because of course, no confirmation of whether or not the Harvester came randomly or you had to do missions vs Corpus, Digital Extremes, the maker, took out the logs from view. Long story short, Beta is a tag, Developers are money grubbers, game is going stale, and I haven't seen a single good content addition since I joined. Every boss that gets reworked gets turned into someone with an "Invulnerability Stage" that can be teabagged 99% of the fight. Mixed with glitchy parkour, bad melee, unbalanced frames, and overpriced cash shop, I'd avoid this game like the plague. If only it wasn't for my clan, I'd be gone.

review: Saying this game is Free to Play is a bold lie. Let me tell you the story of when I started this game. You are only allowed to pick 1 of 3 starting classes, or warframes, out of the existing 10 or 15. So you play around and you want to make a weapon. You can either 1. use ingame points to unlock a blueprint for the weapon, if the weapon you want even has a blueprint, farm the resources to make the weapon which can take a really, really long time, especially for a starting player, after obtaining everything, spend even more ingame credits to START the making of the weapon which takes 24 hours (not joking), wait an entire day, and THEN you get to play with the weapon. Or 2. give Warframe your money. Making warframes is even worse. You have to fight the same boss over and over just hoping you get the right drops from it. You need a Chassis blueprint, systems blueprint, helmet blueprint, and a warframe blueprint. You need to build ALL those items before you can even begin making the warframe, which all use ingame credits AND TAKES 3 DAYS TO MAKE. Or you can throw your money at Warframe. Oh, and you can only have 2 warframes out of the 15 to play with. You only have 2 warframe slots and like 5 weapon slots. You want more weapons or warframes? Looks like you have to spend some MORE MONEY. You need to give Warframe more money so you can get more slots just to get more warframes and weapons. Let's talk gameplay. The gameplay is "fun". Sort of. I enjoyed playing solo missions more than playing with 3 other strangers . Why? Because if I play solo, I can try using stealth, which is impossible if your new "teammates" fly down the halls shooting everything in sight. Also, if I play solo, I can play at my own pace. Every single game that you play online with 4 people, the game becomes less of a fps and more of a race. Actually, that's a perfect description of what happens. It becomes less of "There's 2 guys over there, I'll sneak up on one and shoot the other in the head" and more of "RUN RUN RUN OH LOOK AN ENEMY OH HES DEAD RUN FASTER FASTER". It turns into a clusterf**k of color.... I'll summarize all of this. So basically, this is micro-transaction the game. The only way to enjoy the game to it's full extend is spending a lot of money. And I mean a lot. I would actually prefer it if you had to buy the game. That way, Warframe wouldn't be a lie, and you wouldn't have to deal with half the bullcrap in the game. Sadly, even IF they did that, you would have to deal with the OTHER half of the bullcrap, like waiting 3 days to play with a warframe. It's just a stupid system, and is just used to siphon more money from your wallet. Oh I forgot to mention, you can spend real money to speed up the process ._. so yea, more ways of spending money... great... The game is "fun" ish, if you can look passed all the crap, which I cannot. If you ignore the facts that you need to spend money to use more than 2 warframes, spend money to use more than 5 weapons, wait 3 days to use a new warframe, wait 24 hours to use a new weapon, how the game puts micro transaction after micro transaction in front of your face every single time you open the game (oh, if you stop playing for a day, the next time you open the game, you win a "random reward", which is ALWAYS a discount on your NEXT MICRO TRANSACTION), then you might like this game. I don't

review: I'm quite surprised at how far along this game has come along. The graphics have gotten better and the gameplay, while repetative, has also gotten better as the beta has gone on. If you enjoyed games like Mass Effect 3 Multiplayer, Gears of War Horde mode or any other type of game where you and your crew of 4 take on endless waves of baddies in pure co-op awesomeness sprinkled with the loot grind of dungeon crawlers like Diablo or Torchlight, then you will have a blast with Warframe. If had to say one thing in the negative about it, it would be the real world dollar cost on any of their items. Luckily everything can be gained in game with some RNG luck and time, as well as the in game "won from missions" currency. All in all a great game, definitely worth checking out. It's FREE! What have you got to lose?

review: Never have i been so proud to be a Space Ninja. and Warframe teaches you all about it. =/OVERVIEW!\= Warframe is a 3rd Person Shooter hack-n'-slash game that takes a VERY wide amount of choice to the way you like to play. With quests, your own ship known as a Liset, many different locales, space missions in space with a pair of jet wings (Archwing), and 16 different mission types, there's alot of fun to be had, even IF there's not much story to it. Couple that with the good 100+ weapons total in the game and you'll have LOTS of time to try out everything. Now, on to the review itself! *points triumphantly* Warframe was made by Digital Extremes, a company with an already impressive reputation after making the multiplayer for Bioshock 2, helping out with the Unreal Engine and even making one of the Unreal Tournament games. They also made Dark Sector, which was actually supposed to be Warframe, but frankly was turned into something different so they could pitch a sale that the console owners liked. It was alright, But eh...Not incredible. the details were impressive though. The game you're reading this review for RIGHT NOW is packed with action AND stealth depending on your playstyle. You take on the role of Space Ninjas known as Tenno. "You are the Tenno. Warriors of the Gun and Blade." - The Lotus Each Tenno has his or her own Warframe to pick from, and a good third of the Warframes in the list so far have special "Prime" versions of themselves you can get from the Orokin Void. I'll talk about the wonderful funderful Void later. =/WARFRAMES!\= Now, what does being a Tenno mean? It means your a certified bone-breaking, body burning (Ember), heart-electrifying (Volt), Void sentencing (Limbo), gunslinging (Mesa), wolvering claw-slashing (Valkyr), gravity crushing (Mag), Stop-Hammertime'ing (Rhino, LIKE A BAWSS!), Radial javelin'ing (Excalibro, LIKE A REAL BAWSS!), troll-teleporting (Loki), matter detonating (Nova), illusion employing (Mirage), bass boosting (Banshee), bone chilling (Frost), Skin shedding (Saryn), priest powered (Trinity), Paladin styled (Oberon), Captain's ship cannonnering (Hydroid), Pinball Wizarding (Vauban), sky-high flying (Zephyr), Undead raising (Nekros), Mind controlling (Nyx), Stealth style murdering (Ash) BADASS. YYyyyyup. Lots O' Frames. =/GUNS! YOU'LL USE THEM! YOU'LL USE BIG GUNS, SMALL GUNS, SILLY GUNS, COOL GUNS, FUTURE GUNS, STUPI-- you get the idea.\= Aside from Warframes you cabn get some pretty badass weapons, Assault rifles, homing-fire machine guns, compound bows that stick enemies to walls with a full draw, marksman rifles, sniper rifles, shotguns, flak cannons, hand cannons, akimbo pistols (Get out that inner gunslinging boss you hide inside!) of many kinds, freeze rays, rocket launchers....OKAY, FINE! ROCK-IT LAWNCHAIRS! YOU HAPPY?...Uhh...Right, Melee weapons! Heavy swords, sword-an-dagger combos, dual daggers, dual hand scythes, normal scythes, whips, batons, the Legendary Proiva Vandal (Thank you John Prodman for gracing us Tenno with your battle prowess) battle hammers, battle axes, DUAL hand axes, and of course, katanas. =/SENTINELS AND KUBROWS!\= Because the Origin System just isn't fun enough without your own pet robot or Space Puppy. There's a plethora of Sentinels: Wyrm (BLINDED BY THE LIGHT~), Shade (The first two are the original ones. Also, YOU CAN'T SEE THIS!), Dethcube (MY COMPANIUN CUUB! :D), Carrier (VACUUM UP THOSE MODS! *points triumphantly*), Djinn (Ash's BFF. :P), and one of my favorites, Helios (SCAN DAT BOOTY). For Kubrows we have Sunikas (Police Attack Dogs, bruh), Huras (Stealth-trained murder-puppies!), Sahasas (Be careful, they'll dig ALL OVER your backyard.), and Raksas (No, not Roxas from Kingdom Hearts. totally different game...>.> ["WE'RE HIS...BODYGUARDS!" - Neebs "The Noob"] ). There are also Archwings! Your first is the Odonata (MISSILE POWAH!). there's also the Elytron (Dem nukes, bebe), and the Itzal, the newest one (HIGH SPEED SLAMMAH JAMMAHS). In short, you can play ANY WAY YOU SO GODS BE PRAISED PLEASE. =/MODS!\= In addition to this is an awesome way to modify how your weapons, Warframe, Sentinels, Kubrows and Archwings function, Known as Modules, are simply, mods. I just call them Mod Cards...I mean, they basically look like that. xP Anyway, Mods change the way you want to play, letting you further augment how you define fun. Wanty to jump high and slide far? Slap on some mods to compliment it! Want to run walls for longer and have rocket launchers with miniature nuke blast radius explosions? Slap on some mods! Looking to make your dual machine pistols fire three shots with each round released? Slap on some mods! There's TONS of mods, LITERALLY HUNDREDS of mods. So i won't list them all. Now this game does have the capacity to get repetitive, but that's only if you keep using the same weapon for a month. Switching up how you play makes life alot less dull. Moving on to the nexzt series of things now! =/THE FOUNDRY!\= Now this is where you craft stuff from. most things you craft will take 12 hours. Warframes however, will take a WHOLE 3 days. but you can instantly complete the production of your item with a premium currency called platinum. Now, before i get into THAT too, let me explain some about the Foundry. you collect resources from multiple planets, then use those resources to produce weapons, warframes, parts, whatever you need. Just make sure you have the credits and you'll be golden. *thumb up* =/PLATINUM!\= This is the game's premium currency, and you start off with a little under $5 worth of it. You get 50 platinum right off the bat which is pretty cool! I usually advise people to spend it on a Warframe slot and 4 Weapon slots (They come in pairs). Warframe slots are 20 platinum, and Weapon slots are 12 pltainum for each pair. a DAYMN good deal if you ask me. it's pretty easy to make platinum too if you know where to look for items that people will buy! =/PLANET LOCALES!\= so, each planet has a unique theme. Earth is overgrown jungle, Mars is snow and mountains, Phobos is nothing but desert, and so on. But you're not here to learn about ALL the fun places and listen to me spoil the locales in one shot are you? *pokes face* OF COURSE NOT! You're here to know a little bit about the Orokin Void! =/OROKIN VOIDS/DERELICTS!\= These are kind of like bonus reward missions, and it REALLY shows. you get TONS of credits out of these missions, and typically a prime part or Forma. you don't get blueprints of the parts though, OH no (Well, the warframe parts are collected as Blueprints. v_v). You get the full part. You'll see why when you try to complete one. Prime Weapons and Warframes take a little more dedication to complete. The Derelicts are the opposite of the Void's pleasant appearance, looking more like a nightmare done right. Here you'll find OTHER prime parts, as well as Orokin Vaults containing corrupted mods. Make sure you have the dragon key for the vault door though, as there's four different dragon keys. squads work best, and i'll discuss that topic later too...actually, NOW. =/CO-OP FACIAL DESTRUCTION!\= That's right. You can band up with three broccoli or broccolettes, and destroy your way through hundreds of Grineer, Corpus, Infested and/or Corrupted faces in any way you so please! However, rushers tend to be a problem, so watch out. :P =/THE DEVELOPERS!\= This company...They are the epitome of Awesome. If South Korea's best is Neople, Canada's equivalent is Digital Extremes. They're VERY dedicated to the game and its community, hearing any and ALL comments, complaints, suggestions and otherwise about, to or for the game. They also have Devstreams every 2 weeks and Prime Time streams every thursday, and give out awesome prizes because they LOVE their fans. I give this game a 9.7 out of 10. Would grind 9 more times in the name of RNGesus. *9 thumbs up*

review: Suddenly, a very high quality f2p game. The co-op size, for 4 people, as has long been the actual start, you have to shoot the enemies of the crowd, whether robots or mutants. The game has a great variety of missions. There is a pumping system, with those experiences not only gets the character for whom you play and weapons that you fight. Interesting system improvements. The visual part of the game is full of colors and effects. Lots of explosions, lots of glowing stuff. All very nice. It should say that the game is not PVP, PVE only, can in the future it will be in the game and, well, until .... the battle against hordes of mutants! PS I almost forgot, in the game at first do not understand what they want from you in a mission where to go and who to shoot but eventually everything falls into place. sorry for my english)    f2p .  , 4 ,    ,    ,    .      .  ,      ,         .   .  ,    . ,  .  . ,    , ,       ,,  ....    ! ..   ,     ,        ,             .

review: Ninjas Pay Fees would be more appropriate, let's be serious for a moment, yes, this game is no PvP oriented and yes, you can get almost everything by grinding, but this game is not only lacking any direction and making its developers look like the lovechild of EA Bioware and IGN. The whole thing is made for you to feel frustrated enough to buy some stuff, the moment you jump into it you will feel like there is almost no way to progress naturally, you are stuck with a very underpowered loadout in the first three planets for a while, you may think you are getting some nice loot until you realize you are not able to craft anything useful until later in the game when you can access the harder missions and once you complete the star map you will find little to no reason to play unless you want to get new stuff to painfully level up every single time you want to fully customize it, not to mention the huge prices in the cash shop if you happen to consider skipping some of the "content" in this game (that is grind to grind), please let me make this clear, once a game has monetization, cash shop or the like is no longer "BETA", it is just an incomplete released product using a buzzword to avoid criticism. If you seriously want to play this game just be warned. * You will have to grind for days or play with matchmaking which is almost a never newbie-friendly experience. * You will need to be in a clan ASAP if you want some of the better gear to tackle the "challenging content" later in the game. * You will be tempted from every front to spend real money in the game, either by the poorly implemented trade system or the painful grind. * If you happen to have some complaints you may find half of its community to be really hostile and blindly loyal. *Also, you will experience game breaking bugs in every major update, while this is kind of expected the loyalists will dismiss all your complaints as "gamer entitlement" and thus slow down the process thanks to how developers take negative feedback into account. In short, a nice artistic concept completely botched by pure greed and lazyness.

review: I've been playing this game nonstop for the past few weeks. It's a great game. Although i feel that there isnt a lot of story or plot, there is, however, a nice backstory/lore and a unique setting. The game allows you to customize your character (to an extent) and has a large selection of weapons and warframes to suit one's playstyle. In the beginning, the game felt very pay2play; everything i wanted at that point costed platinum(premium currency) and wasn't available until i progressed further and it required (what i assumed to be) heavy grinding. But now, having progressed much further, i've found that most things could be acquired with just time and patience, and the only things that truly required platinum were cosmetics and bundles. And platinum is a tradable currency, so if you really want x that costs y platinum, you could make platinum by trading with other players. But is the game fun? Yes, it's loads of fun. The gameplay is relatively unique, progression freels rewarding, and it looks great. Updates are pulled out quickly, fixes are adminstered hastily. Overall, it's a very refined game (especially one that's in beta)

review: Verry fun game, and can be verry adicting. This game has a long learning curve, but when you got the basics there is always something to do, always 1 more mission to play, 1 more thing to craft, 1 more resource needed to find. All these things add up in the big picture and make Warframe much bigger then it seems to players, its not your typical Free to play game or pay to win game, no you can do all free theres no advantage in paying. Its super fun for me and my friends with who i have spent in this games are numerous days. Several h a day and we never got bored, we only runed out of energy to play the game and was super fun to yell at each other to help him and not to run away from reviving a budy,  arround and all that cool stuff. There are numerous guns from mashine guns to shotguns, from pistols to laser rifles.You play on planets arround the solar system, and in each planet there are multiple missions in wich you can unlock mods to upgrade your warframe character and guns, those are called mod cards, wich are randomly droped by enemys or boses. Each warframe, or gun has a lvling system from 1-30 leveling a warframe makes him to have more shields, hp armor etc, but with mod cards you can upgrade him the most you like him to be bore tanky or to dish out damage its all up to you. Theres a clan DOJO where you and you clan buddys can go and build structures like power plant, and reserch facilities. In reserch facilities you can reserch new guns, mostly that enemys use, can reserch warframes but all that takes multiple day resech time. There are game events in wich players allways kinda keep their aye on the game to see if there is a alert mission in wich can be droped a mod card they want, or a accesorie item they want for a warframe wich can be bought only by real money but with alerts can get them free. Anything is posible when you play like a true ninja warior. My score for the game is 9.5/10 Game worth a try not your 2h bot it deserves more then that.

review: It was all fun and all when I first started playing this game. However after a couple of hours here and there, I feel like I have lost my passion to like this game. The only thing thats keeping me to play is the aesthetic look and the graphics. Everything feels like a grind fest and it's just seems so ridiculous you have to wait 12-24 hrs for an item you are building. The only way to get around this is if you use plats to speed up the process. :'(

review: Played Warframe with a few friends earlier today. We all agreed while it's great for a free to play game containing some beautiful graphical work, some interesting game mechanics, and good controller support, it gets tedious very quickly and nothing really makes it stand apart from a failed third-person action game like Too Human unfortunately. It's also quite a tough game to get a grip of as it contains lack of explaination about how certain aspects of upgrading and customising a character work. Regardless, I'd recommend giving it a bash, it's a good bit of fun at first but nothing I can see myself playing in the long term and spending money on! :)

review: Digital Extremes crafted an amazing free-to-play, third-person hybrid action-shooter in Warframe. Technically the game is just a more polished up version of their 2008 outing Dark Sector, but the polish has turned the game into something for the ages, making it one of the most badass free-to-play games on the market right now. The game originally launched last year to little fanfare but managed to grow a strong community based on the game's infectious lore and equally infectious gameplay. Basically, the story revolves around an ancient race of space ninjas known as the Tenno, who must serve and protect the interests of the galaxy from various overlords amassing their forces in the hostile alien races known as the Grineer and the Corpus. Simply enough, players in the role of the Tenno must don their Warframe bioskins (yes, the Warframes grow on the Tenno like skin) and sabotage, destroy, and disrupt the forces of the Corups and Grineer. The very basic plot outline sounds like typical MMO fanfare but my goodness does it work and work well, mostly because it's set against the motif of space-Ronin without proper masters doing all that they can to save the galaxy. The game starts when the Excalibur Tenno is freed from his chamber while Grineer forces are trying to collect and breed their own Warframes from the Tenno race, and that's where players hop in and start kicking butt and taking names. The actual tutorial stage is short, sweet and simple and doesn't even begin to tackle some of the more complex elements of the game. So how complex is the game? Well, the story is barebones, the dialogue is simple and the quests are all mostly repetitive and circulate around the same formula. What makes Warframe so complex and so badass is that the gameplay is just balls-to-the-walls awesome. You can wall-run (which isn't anything new), you can climb up anything you can reach, you can backflip off anything solid and you can shoot dodge like nobody's business. The game also has a variety of melee weapons that offer very, very, very different styles of play. For instance, using the dual-bladed pole-ax is nothing like using a long blade, or dual daggers, or boxing the crap out of enemies with modified armored hands. Each melee weapon requires a completely different approach to the gameplay that's rarely seen in many games. The attention to detail in the combat is one of those added reasons why Digital Extreme's free-to-play shooter is so addictive and yet so versatile in its approach to a tried and true gameplay format. The above example isn't even a remote exaggeration but more like an under-representation for some of the absolutely mega-badass things you can pull off in the game. It's insane.

The attention to detail in the combat is one of those added reasons why Digital Extreme's free-to-play shooter is so addictive and yet so versatile in its approach to a tried and true gameplay format. But it doesn't end there... you can combine your melee combat with seamless transitions into special powers and abilities on a whim. Even more than that, you can transition from your powers and abilities (or melee combat) into shooting with your primary or secondary weapons with ease. For example, you can run across the side of a wall, jump off, split an enemy right down the middle with a sword (literally, split them down the middle Mortal Kombat-style) and then do a sideways flip and land a headshot while in mid-air, blowing the brains clean out of another enemy (and yes, you can see the brain particles fly if the graphics are turned up enough). And did I happen to mention you can customize your weapon stats, affixes and abilities like a micromanaging RPG fanatic? Well, you can. You want to freeze enemies with every pistol shot? No prob. How about combine fire and ice together along with electrical damage so that they burn, freeze and then convulse on the ground in a single swipe from your warhammer? Sure can do. Increased critical damage for fast-as-a-fly instant kill headshots? Done and done. While the game is as grindy as a butcher factory, the fact that the gameplay is fun more than makes up for it. Even more than this, all that fancy-schmancy Matrix-style, space-ninja stuff you can pull off isn't done to the effect of boredom. The game's difficulty scales like a crazy mofo. Instead of choosing a difficulty, the planets themselves work as the difficulty factor  the further out into the solar system you go, the harder it gets. The best part about Warframe's difficulty is that the game isn't artificially difficult. Yeah, a lot of you know exactly what I mean. Saints Row, Call of Duty, Mercenaries, Just Cause and Uncharted are prime culprits of having difficulty that scales artificially, and by that I mean that the AI isn't smarter, it's just more of them standing around and shooting incessantly without missing. It's a cop-out on difficulty. In Warframe the AI takes cover, calls for reinforcements, uses ship panels to lockdown areas or suppress players. It's difficulty done right and forces players to adapt cooperatively and get out of a situation using both skill and intelligence. Again, it's difficulty done right and this is just another reason why Warframe is so badass. After fixing some of the mod cards, balancing some of the Warframes themselves and expanding the universe, the game has come a long way since launch and offers players a really unique free-to-play experience that's hard to find anywhere else. Maiet will have their work cut out for them in Gunz 2. (This review was written by (CINEMABLEND)

It's F2P and almoast all of the items that can be bought with real money can also be crafted by getting in-game resources and credits. The graphics are great, and so is the gameplay! It's a really fun game! The devs are great, and actually listen to the players on their forums! If there's a bug, you report it and they fix it in the next update! In short, warframe is a great PvE teamwork game. Also don't forget: Ninjas Play Free.

review: Hello, and welcome I guess to my NEW review of a game: Warframe. Okay so my earlier review got a really postive response so yes thank you! :D But now let's start with the Warframe review itself. So yeah the game is amazing and it has a lot of things to do in it. Missions are not boring but quite the opposite, they are really intresting and acually have sense, I acually played some games in which the missions have no sense with the game or the story. But Warframe as I said is amazing and a really good game if you're a ''super-natural'' fan or something about Ninjas this game is 100% for you :) So yeah that is a wrap of the that... I hope you will like this as you did my earlier review (it was Batman A.C.). Have a nice day of evening depends on the which part of the day you're reading this.

review: You know what? Within a month(Possibly even a few weeks) I sunk over a hundred hours into this game. And I would like to say those are the best hundred hours I've had in awhile. First of all, THERE WILL BE GRINDING/FARMING. This game kinda works like that. I understand not everyone has the patience to well grind for a certain items(In the newest update, kubrow eggs will be your worst nightmare in farming, unless RNG is on your side. Then I hate you), but I do think it's worth while because it gives you that feeling of progress towards what you want. And that feels pretty good. Second, there are microtransactions, but they are not needed. You will only need them when you want to fully buy/rush something, want to but additional accersories(color packs, armor, etc.), and when you want to trade for certain items. I must say, this game handles microtransactions very well. As long as you don't spend it too fast. Like two of my friends. Which I will not metion either of them. Third, this game will (sometimes) require some sort of teamwork. Like other people to help you. I used to think you can fully "beat the game" all by yourself, until a certain entity called "The Stalker" absolutly whopped my . Then I realized, "I need a team to play with...". I'm not sure if you can fully solo the game from the beggining but if you can, i'd be happy to know. Last of all, it's just fun to explore every weapon and warframe in the game. I mean when I first built a warframe that had the ability to stop ALL damage coming to her, bring out energy claws to rip people up, and gain her health back? I was damn well surprised and I still enjoy the warframe up to date. I recommend this game to anyone who is interested in RPG like elements and a game that you and your friends could enjoy. I mean who doesn't enjoy being a space ninja cutting people in half, shootting people up, and jumping all over the place? I enjoy it. Immensely.

review: I've been a part of this game since the closed beta. I've seen a ton of changes and don't let steam fool you. I've logged in more than 400 hours on this baby right here. You play as a Tenno. A master of the warframe armor. The universe is set years and years after Dark Sector (DE confirmed that Hayden Tenno was indeed the "O.G." Tenno.) where the Tenno are at war with 2 factions: The Corpus and The Grineer. Both of which are at war with each other and the result is an imbalance in the system which the Tenno are tasked with balancing. There is a fourth faction, the sentient Infected. The technocyte ravaged beings twisted into monsters after years of dividing and acquiring biomass, they pose a threat to everyone in the universe. The game itself has quite a learning curve but the community makes it so easy to learn. There are a ton of events and rare items as well as alert missions that allow you to take certain rare items or platinum items that you could buy in-game with microtransactions but the game allows you to get them for free. You don't need to spend unless you want to. Prime frames are the same. (You grind for them to get em for free) I personally spent money into this game and am a founder and have not regretted spending money on this game. It has given me so much fun and joy and i just love being a space ninja. 10/10 Easily one of the best games i have ever played.

review: Pros: Nice graphics Great variety of Warframes and weapons and... it's "free" Cons: "Ninjas play free" - more like "mindless drones collecting resources so they can make better gear to collect more resources with play free" Even though the game is "free to play", there is only very little you can't buy with real money. As in, you can either spend 3-4 days (depending on how much do you play) farming for resources to get a new Warframe (character "class") and then spend another 2-3 days building it OR you can just buy it for 20 dollars The game does everything in its power to make you throw money at it - Want a pet? You can either farm for an egg which can drop from dens present only on one planet, usually found in quantities of 4 per mission, then you have to farm for credits and resource obtainable only in special area accessible only with a key received from several missions as a random reward, then you have to craft an item to even begin the breeding and then you have to wait 4 days before your pet matures. OR you can throw money at the game to bypass all this . But that's not all! If you happen to not play the game for a while, your pet will die because you have to "feed" it with item that costs quite a lot of credits. There was also a new resource introduced some time ago, which drops only from one enemy in the game that also happens to attempt suicide whenever he sees you to make you even angrier and drop money to bypass boring grind Cash shop is incredibly overpriced - 40 dollars for a discounted pack with three weapons, out of which only one is "good" and a color palette (weapons in that pack also have extremely small chance of dropping from a single enemy in the game, who happens to be someone who can and more often than not will kill you before you even notice... coincidence maybe?) Those color palettes cost about 4 dollars each and there is about 10 in the store... The game is focused on grinding and farming - if you want to play high level content you have to level up some gear and farm credits and resources to get your mastery rank up so you can then start farming resources for the good gun viable in high level missions so you can grind and farm even more to get even better weapons so you can grind all the mods and credits faster so you can repeat the whole process more effectively Game is intentionally gear based - Literally no amount of skill can help you if you don't have good gear/mods Bosses are just bullet sponges with the "weakspot" mechanic Drop tables are diluted, especially when new gear comes out Games are hosted on players' computers, so expect heavy lag and common disconnects TL;DR If you enjoy doing the same boring and tedious thing over and over and over again, this game is probably for you. On the other hand, if you don't like being ripped off by greedy developer, you should look somewhere else.

review: Hey everyone! I'm new here and this is my first game to play. I like this game, I played it just now and I think it's a very interesting game. The graphic looks cool, the design of it looks awesome, and I think it's about somekind of alien? right? sorry if I get it wrong. Since it's the first time for me to play games at steam, I was really excited to find this game as my first game to play which is free and it has a cool graphic too. I'm worry about my computer though because it's lagging like hell these days, I hope it's nothing. Anyway, this is real cool game, you really should try it, and also it's free to play.. Now I'm going to play some more :)

review: Ok im a new player of this game. I just started right before the new UI update (Your Ship) that just came out a few weeks ago.I have to say this is without a dought one of the best F2P out there at the moment.The game starts were you can pick out of 3 free Tennos.You can get more Tennos from the store for Plat (paid currency) or you can farm them for free by buying the plans off the market for credits (free currency) .You can get Tenno Parts and Plans and weapons plans off boss fights and as login rewards and misson rewards.The games game play is pretty much 3rd person action game,think Gears of War meets the pilot part of Titanfall ;) The GFX are amazing ,has to be the best gfx i have seen in a F2P!!The games controlls are spot on you can slide dash and run off walls and melee your target real fast and move very fluid back to your main weapon or side arm.As for the missons they do get repetitive, but there is so much action that you dont seem to mind bigtime when your tenno and mods lvl up :) There are a buch of diffrent mission modes are as follows --> Assassination  Capture  Conclave  Deception  Endless/Wave Defense  Escape  Exterminate  Hijack Interception  Invasion (Solar Rail)  Mobile Defense  Rescue  Sabotage (Hive)  Spy  Survival PvP  Environmental Hazards!! There is also mission Alerts also this pay good credits and have gear and weapon plans at times you can make in your Foundry . The game has Solo Play and Squad Based Action of 4 players. There is also settings for Friends Only and Invite Only.So you can be Social or Anti Social as you want its up to you :) The real beauty of this game shines in the MODs they are like cards you collect and lvl up and add to your Tenno and Weapons.They can take a average Tenno or Weapon and make it superior. As for the paying part of the game they have a good slection of prices and you really dont need to buy any unless you want stuff fast and dont feel like farming or want cosmetic addons for your gear and Tenno.I would recommend saving your Plat or buy Plat just for Tenno Spots(20 Plat) and Weapon Inventory slots(12 Plat 2 slots) ;) But if you are like me and dont mind spending on a few Plat to help suppport a real good F2P by all means spend away !! :) Plat price packages range from $4.99 (74 plat) to $199.99 (4300 plat + Rare Card mods).I give this game as a F2P a wopping 9/10 only reason i gave it a one point deduction is i think the prices in the store could be a tad cheaper.But all in all a darn good game so give it a shot if you are looking for a solid action game!!! See you on the Battle Field TENNO!!!!

review: More of a Warfarm than a warframe. I have become quite addicted to this free to play game. Most things are available in the game with out having to pay cash for it. Just requires a bit of farming to get. Only things that arent, are Warframe slots, weapon slots, and vanity stuff like scarfs and colours. Third person 4 player co-op shooter/hack and slash. But of course if you are too lazy to farm stuff up... you can always pay money for new frames and weapons too.

review: Warframe is a free to play game where you can play co-op up to four players or solo if you wish. Really great games and a lot of customization for different play styles and it gets updated constantly which is always a good thing. You play as a space ninja wizard with guns, exploring different planets in the solar system, obtaining minerals, blue prints and mods to create your character build and craft new weapons and make new warframes. After playing for 68 hours I'm still having fun so that's saying something. I still have not explored all the planets yet. Overall, I really enjoy the game and love that the game gets updated with new content so frequently.

review: This is a top notch f2p 4 player co-op shooter / plat-former; however, if you and your friends are looking for a game with a solid story line and character development, look some place else. While the free running is tons of fun to master, the levels are massive and the combat is fast pace and thrilling, the game is without a doubt a grind. Get a mod; level a mod. Get a frame; level a frame. Get a gun; level a gun. There are tons of guns, mods and frames to level, but without a team of friends to do it with, I could see the task being a bit daunting. The levels you play in are HUGE! But, The maps are cooky cutter to say the least. It can take ten minutes to make it to the escape, passing one deja vu after another. Lots of detail and care went into some parts of the environment while others are dull and uninviting. The free running is a blast! So fluent and fun to play around with. Tough to pull off in combat, but that's what keeps you trying it again and again. Unless you look up videos that show all that there is to learn, it will take a long time to figure out all of the techniques. The graphics are shiny and clean. A fun game to look at and it is extremely well optimized. The character models have great detail and the colors can be customized... that is If you buy a color pallet, the b***ards! The weapons fall a bit short. There are a ton to choose from, but a lot of them feel very similar; fortunately, the melee weapons are a good balance with the guns. Each player can also have a "sentinel" that does a number of useful things: attacking enemies and picking up loot items are examples. All the weapons can be modified through a unique leveling and modding system that I have only seen in this game. It works well, but adds to the inescapable grind. The combat is splendid. There is a good variety to the enemies, and a solid balancing system that can lead to easy push-over style fights, and intense battles that have the players pushed to the edge at all times. The free running plays a large role in the combat. Over all, the game is the perfect addition to any group of friends looking to add another good co-op shooter the their lists. Plenty to grind and plenty to uncover and discover. I recommend buying "some" platinum in the being. It can take a while to get going without it.

review: Introduction: This is a dungeon/instances based action third person mmo (kinda like vindictus, dragon nest, etc) I have 1k+ hours.. and I play this since CBT (which was way before it came to steam) I can say for sure I gave this game my time and hopes for get a good experience as the game gets made on the go~ I really wanna write a wall of text explaining why this game is soo good and WHY is kinda bad at the same time, but let's be honest here nobody likes to read now days~ so ill try to keep it short starting with the good and bad things, but if you feel like reading bit more, please, do so. Good and Bad things: +New content every week. +Developers that are close to the community. +Not real paying restrictions that will f*ck up your enjoyment. +Nice graphics (they're nice, not mind blowing but nice) +Great amount/variety of characters with their unique set of skills. +Cool upgrade systems with mods (that look like 3d cards) which you can add to your character, weapons, pets, etc. +Well set up, in depth and immersive enviroments. +Variety of missions. -It gets repetitive (yes, even though it does has several game modes, maps, and lots of content) -Long period of wait time for build (craft) each thing in the game, and you will be doing that a lot (we talking from 12h to 72h of wait time) These can be rushed with in game currency, but you don't wanna be doing that with every thing you build.. so it is definetly a downside. -Glitchy and buggy at times, plus cam angle will be a total mess if you downside your aim in close to any in game model (npc/other players will turn into giant monsters if you do so hahaha and I doubt they ever fix this) -LAG yes, this game will lag if you get paired with a bad host, you can "fix" this by putting ping/region restriction, but keep in mind this is a F2p, most people playing will be people with not great internet connections and if you put restrictions you will find yourself playing alone most of the time. -Broken pvp, as this was never meant to be a pvp game, DEVS put it almost by force by high demand from the community and believe me, you wanna stay out of that and stick to pve experience. -It gets grindy at times, mainly toward 60+ hours when you start farming for new mods, and weapon parts.. etc you can get these by trade but the most rare ones will requiere almost an equal item rarity or platinum for make the trade happen. Also for rank (level) up your stuffs will need several time of grindy missions for get it done, no matter how many game modes they add into the game~ for get the stuff level up fast you will often find yourself playing the same game modes: survival and defense. A short txt of what you should know: The game started to be a very early beta (more alpha like) with only 1 map type, and the overall game was barely 2gigs size.. Now after 2 years (I think) the game is 10+ gigs. and that fact should give you an idea of how much content the developers put into the game ever since it was released. The game gets weekly updates, most of the time every wednesday and is just a new weapon, skin, or some random thing but you can be sure new content will arrieve every week. For MAJOR content update, these come every 2 to 3 months, and normaly it's a HUGE update that will change the entire game experience (unfortunally, so far, the core gameplay it's still the same and grindy.. I highly doubt they can improve that no matter what crazy content they add into the game) The So called "F2P Restrictions": As almost every F2P they need to make some money out of you, and unfortunally is not just costume, or skins, they have a system in the game that went worst over time, this system is that will requiere certain amount of time to build (craft) every new weapons, warframes (heroes you play with), almost anything will requiere at least 12+ hour to build. BUT if you do decide you can "RUSH" the build time instantly if you use "Platinum" (in game currency that you can acquire by paying real money, or by doing trade with other players) It is not a huge downside, but it is something to keep in mind, as you won't really see it when you start playing, and more when you get at least 20 to 40+ hours in the game. Other restrictions that you will notice right when get into the game, is that you will need Platinum once again for buy warframe slots, weapon slots, pets...and almost everything will always requiere a slot that you will need to buy (these are cheap tho, 20p warframe, and just 12 for the rest.. you can get 75p for 5$ also, once again, you can get plat by trading with other players) Overall and all I give a thumbs up because I did had my fair fun time with the game, and I do really recommend it, but keep it casual, this is not a game you wanna put 100s of hours in, as it will get repetitive and boring fairly quickly. The small restrictions are a bit of pain in the , but is not that bad, is playable, enjoyable, but I feel the need to say that these restrictions will get worst over time so if I was you, I would play this casually. If you put the time in it (which I already stated that you should NOT do so) you could have a truly full FREE TO PLAY game. --HAVE FUN!

If you are a fan of mass effect than you will have a great time with this game. everything from the graphics to the market, to the battle mechanics of the game, are all well developed. At first glance, i saw that they provided a tutorial for this game which blew my mind away, usually i have to figure out controls on my own with games, but this game ensured that everyone will know the basic mechanics of the game and how to keep up with the players online.

review: Everything you once knew about this game has changed. Back when all of us tried it in beta, this game was only "OK." It did get repetitive, and eventually, my wife and I quit. Recently, I've come back to what seems to be one of the most expansive changes ever. This game has me completely hooked in so many ways now. Base building, PvP, Void Key missions, New Frames, New Weapons, etc... Everything can be earned with enough patience. No money is needed to be spent. (Though it does speed things up quite a bit.)

review: I've never been a fan of free to play games on steam, mostly because most are Pay To Win or Pay To Play (seriously what is going on with all this garbage on steam nowadays?). Anywho, WarFrame is the exact opposite. To be honest, I wouldn't mind buying this game. It is worth it, mostly because of all the things you can do in this game. You can craft weapons, you can attach mods to your weapons, change color, buy weapons, BUY WARFRAMES AND ALL THAT WITH CREDITS. IN GAME ITEMS THAT BUY THINGS. DEVELOPERS TAKE NOTES. The multiplayer is great as well, if a mission is too hard to accomplish call a friend over, it is more fun and easier for you as well. I rate this game a 9/10, if you don't fancy buying games, play this one, it is worth it.

review: For a free to play game, I honestly didn't have much hope in this. Yeah, it had the cliche flashy trailer with great special effects etc etc, but still, we all know how free to play games are. They're almost always hooked up with that pay-to-win crap that everyone truthfully hates. I must say, after playing this game once with a few of my friends, I was immediately hooked, and still am to this moment enjoying the game's graceful fluent and loose gameplay. The mixture of freerunning with combat, very unique weapons, and lovely little original touches, truthfully made the game quite graceful to me. It doesn't over-dramasize everything, but at the same time, it isn't exactly boring. Everything is nice, balanced, and even the community is fun. I highly recommend this game to anyone looking for a nice free-to-play experience, and even recommend it to those willing to spend money. With or without putting real life currency into the game itself, doesn't change the joy of playing it in my honest opinion. I joyfully give this game a 9/10.

The fact that the story is straight and forward (save the solar system from evil aliens) the Tenno are called to do the job and fight of waves of Grineer e.t.c and rescue other Tenno to save our solar system. SPOILER ALERT! Play the game to find out more and other wounderful content it has like warframes(Tenno), weapons, sentinals, pets, dojos (remember Tenno are ninja), your very own ship, its insanely awsome.

review: This game has its moments. The graphics and combat are fluid and eye capturing. Unfortunately, like many other F2P games it becomes a very tedious grind for anything you need, be it a frame, weapon, or etc. Say if you're the lazy type also and you want to purchase Platinum (in-game currency) it doesn't help that it is very expensive for how little in return you get. All in all like most other games it has good parts and bad parts. So anyone contemplating it should just give it a whirl and see for yourself.

review: In Warframe, you play as a Tenno, a member of a species of ancient warriors that have reemerged to lay waste to the various nefarious species populating the solar system. Your foes include the Grineer, a jackbooted army of deteriorating humanoid clones; the Corpus, a mix-and-match crew of robotic and human parts; and the Infestation, a bunch of shambling organic creatures that vaguely resemble the Flood from the Halo series. While your enemies are visually uninteresting, a lot of the Tenno suits and weapons have a great sense of style that imbues Warframe with a spark of personality. Each species has a cursory backstory, and there is some lore to be found buried in the menus, but there's no narrative thrust or intrigue to speak of. And so you run mission after mission, moving outward from the sun as you level up your loadout and become a more proficient killer.The core combat of Warframe is straightforward. This is a third-person action game in which you wield two primary weapons and a melee weapon against foes who are largely content to come right at you. You also gain suit powers that allow you to dash and slash through a bunch of enemies, or stun all foes within a certain radius, though these abilities can change drastically depending on what suit you equip. You could unleash fiery maelstroms, turn invisible, create a decoy, use teleportation to switch places with an enemy, or manipulate your foes to fight against their allies. Acquiring new suits, however, requires a significant investment of time or money.Regardless of what powers you have equipped, you can often wage effective war against your enemies by firing on them from a distance, then slicing up the ones who manage to get close. This tactic grows tiresome after a while, however, and doesn't serve you well as you take on tougher levels. Fortunately, you can combine your ability to jump, sprint, and crouch into an acrobatic array of slides, flips, jump kicks, wall runs, leaping slashes, and more. Though there's a certain rigidity to your movement, your mobility is one of the most interesting and enjoyable things about Warframe, and it's fun to zip around your enemies, slashing and shooting until the only ones left standing are your fellow Tenno.You can run Warframe missions with up to three other players, and while flying solo is definitely possible in the early going or when you're grinding for experience or resources, teaming up becomes necessary as you tackle tougher missions. ighting your way through fiendish hordes with the help of some allies can be very satisfying, especially when there's a good mix of powers in play. Coordinating with friends is the best way to get this kind of experience, because jumping into matches or having folks join you can lead to lopsided situations.If there's a gap in player level or a mismatch with the mission challenge, as often happens, your cooperative missions can devolve into all-out sprints as players easily cut their way through enemies they far outclass.To minimize such gaps, you can focus on playing only new missions, since those tend to scale toward the upper bound of your capabilities. To spice things up, you may want to acquire a new gun, a new melee weapon, or a new suit. Warframe is free to play, but you must spend either time or money to acquire new items. Currently, new suits range roughly from $5 to $25, with new weapons falling close to the lower end of that spectrum. Alternatively, you can purchase blueprints to craft new weapons and suits using in-game currency. It takes a significant amount of time to save up the money for a new blueprint, and then you must spend even more time acquiring the resources to actually craft it.Even if you skip the lengthy crafting process by using real-world currency, you still have to spend time leveling up your new gear. Jumping into a high-level mission with a brand-new suit is a death sentence, so it's back to lower levels to grind for experience. As your gear levels up, you gain more slots to modify it using boosters picked up during combat. Adding abilities to suits, improving the attributes of your gear, and imbuing your weapon with elemental damage are just some of the things mods can do. Unfortunately, the system to apply and improve mods is poorly laid out and barely explained, leaving you on your own to figure things out.Some problematic menus pale in comparison to Warframe's real problem: a pervasive tendency toward repetition. Whether you're forging ahead with a high-level suit or leveling up a new one, Warframe repeats enemies, environments, and scenarios too frequently. Without new challenges for your combat abilities, the excitement soon dries up, leaving you without a compelling reason to keep playing.As it is now, Warframe's interesting combat mechanics are too quickly overcome by the grind of repetition.

review: At first, I REALLY didnt like this game. I played it back in January of 2014 for a couple hours and felt utterly lost and confused on what was going on. Fast forward to two days ago when a member of my clan started playing it out of the blue. Once again I reinstalled it and started from where I left my 'Mag' Warframe. Again, I was confused, lost and irritated along with my clansmen. So, rather than give up I turned to the almighty TUBE and found a small 3 part series of videos that broke it all down really easily and quickly. I can honestly say I'm pretty hooked now. I really like it. For a Free to Play its very good for almost EVERYTHING can be bought or better yet, built with patience, the forge and mats. Of course, you could buy them. But I'm proud to say that I have a Rhino Warframe chassis currently being built and it will be completed early in the morning. (Its like having a new toy in the morning waiting) So I'm excited, I found a new addiction and am enjoying myself. You might too, its free and I'll link the very helpful videos below.

review: Warframe.... warframe you strange beast, you're repetitive, and obnoxious but damn I love you. I love you because the implications in your universe make me want to know how people live in that setting. combat is a bit choppy but well done, F2P is one of the better models (aside from a wait-to-progress gear and a few powerful frames being locked behind absurdly hard-to-unlock-bosses) updates have been both fleshing out the content and the universe, actual languages given to the inhabitants, unique bosses that are less reskins and more something that actually challenges- well, entertains at least. when I left in 2012, warframe was space-ninjas with unique powers fighting nebulous empires with bland-voiced stormtroopers. when I came back, I returned to a four-way galatic war, between a dogmatic corporate religion, a militarist legion of recursive clones, transhuman assassins struggling to retain their humanity, and an infestation so virulent that it makes the former three point their guns at it in unity. there needs to be some frickin' books made about this game!

review: Playing this game is a must if you like Third Person Shooters and parkour. It's just perfect in everything; The developers are very nice people, the game is completely balanced as a F2P game with real currency(i.e. Platinum which you can get for real money or during giveaways). Graphics are stunning, gameplay is great, ofcourse there are some bugs. Also, there's not a single thing such as "IF YOU WANT TO KILL EVERYONE IN A FEW SECONDS, BUY THIS PREMIUM STATUS AND BUY ALL THE OP GUNS THAT YOU CAN ONLY GET FOR REAL MONEY!" unlike in most of the other F2P MMO games. You can get every single weapon that is in the game just by playing! You can suggest things to be added into the game as well(you can do that on their forum). This game is in good hands, therefore it is good itself aswell. I have to tell, I barely ever make reviews, and if I do : it's either a perfectly done game or a terrible one. This one was worth the time I spent typing this. :L

review: Great game with lots of amazing weapons and warframes. It gives you that hardcore mmo grind vibe in bite sized portions, that you can dip in and play for 10-30 minutes and still be able to break off and leave if you need to. They constantly keep adding new content which is great to see in any mmo. I was stand offish about this game a long time and regret not playing it sooner now. If you are on the fence about this game give it a try.

review: Great graphic's, one of the best dev teams i've encountered to date, probably the best F2P model i've seen as well. If you don't mind a grind and have the time to actually work to obtain your things in this game it's definitely worth a look. It's Co-op need's some work to actually make missions feel as a team effort, as it stands it pretty much Run n Gun and blow everything up, which is pretty great too. The constant hotfixes which take place through the week also show their dedication to the current community. Just an overall refreshing experience

review: Great game for all play styles, customization allows you to play the type of game you want to play. You can build your warframe up to be a tank (absorb and deal a great deal of damage), stealth(for the ninjas out there), manipulation(yup mind control your enemies) and or room clearer(not overly strong but power to kill everything close by). Overall just a fast paced, configurable, very enjoyable Third person shooter.

review: I never thought I would be so satisfied with being a space ninja, but warframe brings excellent content, phenominal mechanics, a nice community, smooth graphics and extraordinary gameplay. Although, it falls behind with the P2W mechanics and repetive aspect, it is worth the time to become immersed in the games crafting system to suit your needs to become an assassin, a manipulator, a crowd controller or even a class that slices and bursts through a mission. I find this game much more satisfying after playing for about 9 hours, when equipment, ablilities and gameplay clearly improves for your warframe. :D

review: This game can be a pain when first starting off but gets greater and greater when some time has been put into it, like if u get put with some people with prime everything they take over and u dont get any kills to level up your weps but u still get xp for letting your friends get the kills. There are also many updates on warframe as well daily 7mb updates and each month a larger one, that can be very painful for people with slower internet speeds like I. when it comes to trading, too many people are willing to sell than buy from others witch can can be frustrating just to sell a single piece or to trade for it. but when u get up to the harder missions u can just find the part that your looking for on a hard planet. In conclusion if u have a spare couple of GB's u should download it for the gameplay.

review: It's a great game. Whoever says it's pay to win lies. You don't have to spend any cent on the game, and tbh you can get all the items without spending a single penny. I did and i can do any mission on the game without problems. Only problem it has is that the end game might not be that great yet but it has plenty of updates and they care about players opinion and feedback. Also the community is great. Only drawback is the bugs, but hey is beta and most of the time (over 95% of the time) works fine. It has continous updates and events and also the alert system keeps you always busy. Archwing (next patch) looks awesome. This game has great pontential and they wanna be sure to explore it. Its an awesome game and it's free... Hope to meet you there!

review: Warframe was really fun for the first time, and it was pretty addicting for a while. However, once I started constantly grinding I began to lose interest for the game and end up not being interested in it anymore. From the short time I've played I ended up having 2 dreams and other stuff happening due to the Tetris effect kicking in so quickly. It's addicting as hell for a while, so I recommend it (so long as you don't mind reducing a few grades).

review: I've spent far too much time and money on this game, so I can say that it's one of the best free to play games out there. They've managed to make it free to play without making it pay to win, so props to Digital Extremes for that. There's a huge variety of ways to play this game, and there is no single best playstyle. Whether you like to stay unseen and pick off your enemies from a safe distance or you just want to get in your enemies' faces, whether you like to play co-op or solo, you can do all of it, and all of it very well. Its gameplay is an absolute blast. Space ninjas are ing awesome. It's a bit of a work in progress, and DE periodically releases huge updates that greatly improve it. I have few complaints about this game, but it does have flaws. The first one is an almost absolute lack of story. It has a good introduction, but then it just kind of throws you out to a solar system filled with seemingly out-of-place boss battles, some of which just seem a too hastily thrown together. It also has numerous logical fallicies, such as how it's always snowing on Venus. My last complaint is that it's pure grind. You spend the whole game farming resources and leveling up your stuff so you can get better stuff. If you're willing to overlook its flaws, and are willing to accept it as a work in progress, you will have a great time with this game.

review: This game is phenominal. If you are looking for an intense Online Sci-fi Third Person Shooter, you've found it right here! Assume the role of a Tenno Warframe, busting out some ninja parkour moves to get around with a very smooth movement system, craft your own weapons, kill enemies, find mods, use mods to upgrade your weapons, and much much more. I HIGHLY recommend this game to anyone looking for an amazing online co-op shooter!

review: Warframe Is one of the few games out there that Really impressed me. With it's many places to go and many "Warframes" to play as it definently has Diversity with the amount of characters it has along with all the guns and other things you can have. The amount of things you will figure out in this game will amaze but you must Realize that this is basically like Borderlands or any other tough single player game. I Would suggest having a few friends to play with because alone this game is nearly impossible with the massive amount of enemies it sends at you. It could use a little difficulty tweaking but all in all makes up for it by being one of the few games that lets you use Parkour as most people call it otherwise known as being able to run on walls and other things like that. All In All an Amazing Diverse game that makes up for little story by having amazing gameplay mechanics.

FUTURISTIC SPACE NINJAS WITH MAGIC need i say more? but anyway. the game has a lot of grinding in it, but it can be worth it. it takes a whike to involve yourself in the community, but getting involved in game is easy - drop into a mission and make friends! it is F2P but [MOST] of the stuff in game can be bought if you dont want to grind. either way, you get stuff and itll be a fun time. its a fun game with a kick  community, amazing graphics, and awesome lore / story. and. anD aND AND ITS FREE. for all this stuff, for free? why would you ever say no?

review: Warframe. This is an peculiar little game. What is so strange or not usual about it is that it's focused a lot on gunplay and ability usage between players across more than 200+ mission map tiles. I will review this game by different mechanics/parts of the game with a rating system of 10 points and I will pull the average for the game. Oh, and before you read, FORGET THE SLOGAN. This game is NOT even Ninja-themed because the stealth elements and the overwhelming amount of brutal killing missions implies that the Tenno aren't even meant to be Ninjas, but instead, somewhat Samurai-based. Even the lore confirms that. MAP TILES: 3 out of 10 The map tiles in the game are really original, and interesting as well as have a bit of an exploration, however, when it comes to variation between planets, they're a massive letdown. What I mean is, they don't fit the planets they're on, they don't offer any diversity by planet and overall they feel somewhat strictly limited. EXAMPLE: Mercury is supposed to be this super-scorched planet right next to the Sun, however, the game doesn't offer any visuals on Mercury's surface or the size of the Sun when you are playing on Mercury. GUN VARIATION: 9 out of 10 Possibly one of the best things this game does right is the gun variation. You get dozens of different guns, normal versions and Prime variants and all of them are equally exciting. Some are very weak with base damage, but offer destructive critical damage, or are simply awesome in basic damage but lack in critical or status damage. It's shy of a 10 because some guns just fall short of their value entirely and are pretty much useless. MODDING: 10 out of 10 This part of the game is simply awesomely executed, and when I mean awesome is that NO OTHER GAME COMPARES to this mechanic. Modding features mod cards that offer different upgrades for your weapon, for your Warframe, for your Sentinel or your pet Kubrow (Space dog). Your builds are heavily dependent on which mod cards you apply for any piece of your equipment and if at least one card is wrong, the entire build will not work as planned. You can apply only 8 mod cards per piece of equipment, and there is a ''power limit'' of 30 units. The power used is determined by the value of the mod card. Power limit can be doubled by applying an Orokin Reactor (On Warframes, Sentinels and Kubrows, also known as a gold potato) or an Orokin Catalyst (Applied on weapons, also known as a blue potato). Warframes have aura slots which grant an additional passive boost (for example, energy regeneration or armor decrease for enemies) and offer additional power limit boost depending on the mod slot's polarity or the rank of your aura card. WARFRAME VARIATION: 10 out of 10 Not a single Warframe feels like a copy of another and that is something I've seen rarely in any other game. For example, you have the Volt who is an electricity-based Warframe and spits out electricity with high damage, or you have Mesa who is a gunslinger and focuses on gun-play and buffs damage and so on. This is a great feat that the developers achieved and that's why it deserves 10 points. CUSTOMIZATION: 5 out of 10 It's not too bad, but it isn't anything to be proud of either. Customization in this game so limited, and, as a matter of fact, ugly with issues, that it barely deserves 5 points. Its only saving grace is the few sets of plates and Syandanas (like discount capes) that make your Warframes appear quite good. The severe lack of any good or real decorations or greaves and gauntlets and stuff also makes me quite frustrated because I can't make damn near any Warframe look good with the given accessories. Personally, I want SPARTAN-IV-esque armor pieces perfectly crafted to fit any Warframe (Like armored greaves, chest sections, gauntlets, thigh armor and arm armor as well as shoulder pads) with greater variation and such, but my point stands, this isn't the best part of Warframe yet. Customization also falls short, because you can't customize your guns to feature scopes, underbarrel attachments, silencers or heavier barrels, flashlights (which just happen to pop out of nowhere in dark missions) or laser points. PARKOUR: 6 out of 10 Parkour in this game is just basic with vaulting, wallrunning and wallclimbing without any other really awesome feats of physical conditioning and training and such. What would perfectly suit Warframe would be something taken out of the latest Assassin's Creed games - the parkour mechanics that include different vaulting animations each time, as well as enhanced wall-climbing with the ability to grab on to a ledge and hold on to it, say, for stealth, or with the ability to scale high surfaces that would otherwise be unaccessible by typical wall-climbing as well as brand new map tiles to complement the enhanced wall-climbing mechanic and additional stealth features. MISSION VARIATION: 3 out of 10 Exterminate, Capture, Rescue, Spy, Deception, Defense, Mobile Defense, Survival, Sabotage, Hijack, Hive, Assassination, Excavation, Interception. What do they have in common with one another? Total unoriginality (Murderfest). Sure, Exterminate, Defense, Rescue, Hive and Sabotage are the ones that fit with the overall Murderfest theme, but not the others. The developers continuously say this game is based around Ninjas (Shinobi, for those Japanese speakers that don't fully understand English), but where is this Ninja-themed game that we've been hoping to play? I kind of don't see it at all. There must be a total rework of all game modes. STEALTH MECHANICS: 2 out of 10 For a Ninja-based game, stealth is severely lacking in this game. There are only two Warframes that can achieve absolute Ninja-level stealth in this game (Ash and Loki, coupled with bows, kunai and any melee). The game is out for three years, in development for far longer, and the most trademarked asset of this game is possibly the worst mechanic out of every one in the game. You cannot hide anywhere, there is a severe lack of weapons with silent fire, or better yet, ABSOLUTELY NO SILENCERS in the game, so you literally have to rely on a melee weapon or pick a weapon that you might not be good with, but want to play with your favorite one. QUESTS: 7 out of 10 Now, the quests in Warframe look cheap and they come out once a month, even though it would probably take precisely six days to finish one of these quests at most. That is not to say they are not entertaining as, in fact, they provide some replay value and an interesting change from the usually silent missions and offer a slight increase in overall dialogue and that's the quest saving grace, however, none of these quests really offer an explanation as to why and how you were born/made and so on and instead they act as fillers or something, even though the developers probably didn't want that. ARCHWING (Space sections): 5 out of 10 Archwings are a really annoying part of the game. They're like jetpacks with Korean MMO-style wings which quite doesn't seem right in an IP like this. It feels out of place on a massive level. Most of the players don't even like Archwing as a matter of fact, and consider it to be a massive shortcoming of Warframe. The most preferable replacement for the space sections would be starfighters with actual cannons, missiles and afterburners instead of this, but Archwings are better than nothing. THE FINAL RATING - 6 out of 10. Warframe is still a game that's under heavy development (lazy development at that), but it's a perfect filler game while you wait for some grander releases that might dwarf Warframe and its community once and for all. Warframe isn't bad, it isn't perfect, and it's a pretty much slightly-above-average as a game for me, but you can definitely play it.

review: There is a reason why this is my all time favourite Free2Play game. It is just badass. I think i never had that much fun with a F2P Game. The Game changed alot over the past 2 Years and i think there is no F2P developer that is similar to Digital Extremes. DE has a very friendly and cool staff, they do lots of Livestreams/Developer Streams, they answer question and actually listen to the community. The Economy of Warframe is really fair and you don't have to pay a single cent if you don't want to. You can also earn the real money currency called "Platin" by just trading with other players and selling them parts for Weapons for an example. This Platin is used to buy Skins, Colors, Gearslots and it can also be used to buy Weapons or Ressources but you really don't have to because you can get nearly everything by just playing the Game. There are a few exceptions but those exceptions can't be bought with Platin either. Those are things from Events or from the old Founders Packages. If you do decide to buy Platin then its worth to wait a bit because you get discounts from the login rewards from time to time and they go from 20% up to 75% meaning that you can basically buy a 180 Platinpack for only 45. You also get alot for your money, for an example: In the Platinpack for 180/45 you get about 4300 Platin. A Slot for a Weapon or a Warframe costs around 10-20 Platin. Skins or other visual things are at around 50-75 Platin. You might need some Platin if you decide to buy Reactors or Catalyst, which are used to enhance a Weapon or Warframe. Those can be used one time on a weapon and cost both 20 Platin, but there are lots of events and i think one special mission each week where you can get one. Depending on how motivated you are this amount of Platin could be enough for a looong time and you are also able to earn more by trading with players. Now a bit more to the Game itself: Warframe is a Coop Multiplayer Game that can be played alone or up to 4 other Players. You are basically a space ninja, called Tenno. You are able to use all kinds of Weapons either melee or ranged or even both combined. Machine Guns, Swords, Lasers, Revolvers, Rocket Launchers, Scythes, Axes there is nearly every Weapontype you can think of and new content keeps getting released. You are basically able to play the Game however you want, even though it might be a bit hard depending on your type of enemy. In the first few hours of the game you will grind yourself through different kind of Missions while following a Questline. The tutorials are pretty new and not really good at all, but at least have some kind of Tutorial now. Before that you had a little introduction and then it was basically "gl hf now go" Every now and then you unlock a Bossfight. Those bosses are a special kind of enemy and can be pretty hard, especially for newer players. They also have the possibility to drop Blueprints or Parts for new Weapons or Warframe. Every Weapon and Warframe etc that you can't just buy straight from the market, needs to be build in the Foundry. The Blueprints you need for that can be found on the Market, in Clan Dojos and their Researchingstations, in Bossfights or in the Void. I will talk about the Void later. To Build something you need to gather Ressources or other Parts for it first. Then it takes about 24h or 3x 12h + 1x 36h, for Warframes, to finish. While playing the Missions you will also find Mods for your Gear that is used to enhance it. After a while you might have gathered some decent Mods to upgrade your Gear. As soon as you are strong enough, you want to enter the Void or the Orokin Derelicts. Those are a special kind of Missions and they are basically the Endgame. The strongest Weapons and Warframes can be found in the Void while some of the most important Mods are found in the Orokin Derelicts. Those are Places with pretty tough enemies and maybe even deadly traps. Depending on the Mission you choose, you can get a wide variety of rewards. Besides your Weapons you also have to level up your Account itself. It's used to be able to use special kinds of Weapons that require a specific level before you can use them. To level your Account you have to level your Gear. Most people build and gather every piece of Equipment and level them up to their max level to push their own Accountlevel as high as its possible. Thats why most people try to collect every weapon as possible to level them up to their max. The main focus of the game might be the collecting of Gear and Mods to level up and make ones equipment as powerful as possible. If you don't mind spending lots of hours into farming Ressources or Equipment then i would totally recommend this Game to you, but even if you don't like farming stuff: Give it a few hours like 20 or so. Most people i know didn't really stopped to play after they got used to it. If you are still unsure: Look at the amount of positive reviews and the average playtime of those people.

Your builds are heavily dependent on which mod cards you apply for any piece of your equipment and if at least one card is wrong, the entire build will not work as planned. You can apply only 8 mod cards per piece of equipment, and there is a ''power limit'' of 30 units. The power used is determined by the value of the mod card. Power limit can be doubled by applying an Orokin Reactor (On Warframes, Sentinels and Kubrows, also known as a gold potato) or an Orokin Catalyst (Applied on weapons, also known as a blue potato). Warframes have aura slots which grant an additional passive boost (for example, energy regeneration or armor decrease for enemies) and offer additional power limit boost depending on the mod slot's polarity or the rank of your aura card. WARFRAME VARIATION: 10 out of 10 Not a single Warframe feels like a copy of another and that is something I've seen rarely in any other game. For example, you have the Volt who is an electricity-based Warframe and spits out electricity with high damage, or you have Mesa who is a gunslinger and focuses on gun-play and buffs damage and so on. This is a great feat that the developers achieved and that's why it deserves 10 points. CUSTOMIZATION: 5 out of 10 It's not too bad, but it isn't anything to be proud of either. Customization in this game so limited, and, as a matter of fact, ugly with issues, that it barely deserves 5 points. Its only saving grace is the few sets of plates and Syandanas (like discount capes) that make your Warframes appear quite good. The severe lack of any good or real decorations or greaves and gauntlets and stuff also makes me quite frustrated because I can't make damn near any Warframe look good with the given accessories. Personally, I want SPARTAN-IV-esque armor pieces perfectly crafted to fit any Warframe (Like armored greaves, chest sections, gauntlets, thigh armor and arm armor as well as shoulder pads) with greater variation and such, but my point stands, this isn't the best part of Warframe yet. Customization also falls short, because you can't customize your guns to feature scopes, underbarrel attachments, silencers or heavier barrels, flashlights (which just happen to pop out of nowhere in dark missions) or laser points. PARKOUR: 6 out of 10 Parkour in this game is just basic with vaulting, wallrunning and wallclimbing without any other really awesome feats of physical conditioning and training and such. What would perfectly suit Warframe would be something taken out of the latest Assassin's Creed games - the parkour mechanics that include different vaulting animations each time, as well as enhanced wall-climbing with the ability to grab on to a ledge and hold on to it, say, for stealth, or with the ability to scale high surfaces that would otherwise be unaccessible by typical wall-climbing as well as brand new map tiles to complement the enhanced wall-climbing mechanic and additional stealth features. MISSION VARIATION: 3 out of 10 Exterminate, Capture, Rescue, Spy, Deception, Defense, Mobile Defense, Survival, Sabotage, Hijack, Hive, Assassination, Excavation, Interception. What do they have in common with one another? Total unoriginality (Murderfest). Sure, Exterminate, Defense, Rescue, Hive and Sabotage are the ones that fit with the overall Murderfest theme, but not the others. The developers continuously say this game is based around Ninjas (Shinobi, for those Japanese speakers that don't fully understand English), but where is this Ninja-themed game that we've been hoping to play? I kind of don't see it at all. There must be a total rework of all game modes. STEALTH MECHANICS: 2 out of 10 For a Ninja-based game, stealth is severely lacking in this game. There are only two Warframes that can achieve absolute Ninja-level stealth in this game (Ash and Loki, coupled with bows, kunai and any melee). The game is out for three years, in development for far longer, and the most trademarked asset of this game is possibly the worst mechanic out of every one in the game. You cannot hide anywhere, there is a severe lack of weapons with silent fire, or better yet, ABSOLUTELY NO SILENCERS in the game, so you literally have to rely on a melee weapon or pick a weapon that you might not be good with, but want to play with your favorite one. QUESTS: 7 out of 10 Now, the quests in Warframe look cheap and they come out once a month, even though it would probably take precisely six days to finish one of these quests at most. That is not to say they are not entertaining as, in fact, they provide some replay value and an interesting change from the usually silent missions and offer a slight increase in overall dialogue and that's the quest saving grace, however, none of these quests really offer an explanation as to why and how you were born/made and so on and instead they act as fillers or something, even though the developers probably didn't want that. ARCHWING (Space sections): 5 out of 10 Archwings are a really annoying part of the game. They're like jetpacks with Korean MMO-style wings which quite doesn't seem right in an IP like this. It feels out of place on a massive level. Most of the players don't even like Archwing as a matter of fact, and consider it to be a massive shortcoming of Warframe. The most preferable replacement for the space sections would be starfighters with actual cannons, missiles and afterburners instead of this, but Archwings are better than nothing. THE FINAL RATING - 6 out of 10. Warframe is still a game that's under heavy development (lazy development at that), but it's a perfect filler game while you wait for some grander releases that might dwarf Warframe and its community once and for all. Warframe isn't bad, it isn't perfect, and it's a pretty much slightly-above-average as a game for me, but you can definitely play it.

review: This game is here to stay. I've played quite alot of it and I cant wait to see whats comming. I will just start with the negatives - to get them out of the way. The main problem for me is the server situation, the games are user hosted and that creates problem (however a new recent patch promises at least some optimisation, we will see). Another problem is the lack of rewards you get from pvping however pvp is yet problematic. Few bugs here and there, some will argue its a rollercoster, but I like what I see from the developers, taking care of the game + its issues the best they can and keep adding tons of new things. Having said that, Warframe is a game like no other out there. The artwork is really inspired and the combinations of warframes, mods, weapons, archwings, gamemodes will keep you intrested for a long time, having thousands of things to do and collect. Another HUGE advantage of this game is the free to play model it uses. You can practically buy/sell/make/trade almost anything, I love the fact that I can spend real money or dont pay a single dime and create what I want with relative ease. I hope Warframe keeps heading to the direction it is, and we see more and more stuff in the future!

review: There is a reason why this is my all time favourite Free2Play game. It is just badass. I think i never had that much fun with a F2P Game. The Game changed alot over the past 2 Years and i think there is no F2P developer that is similar to Digital Extremes. DE has a very friendly and cool staff, they do lots of Livestreams/Developer Streams, they answer question and actually listen to the community. The Economy of Warframe is really fair and you don't have to pay a single cent if you don't want to. You can also earn the real money currency called "Platin" by just trading with other players and selling them parts for Weapons for an example. This Platin is used to buy Skins, Colors, Gearslots and it can also be used to buy Weapons or Ressources but you really don't have to because you can get nearly everything by just playing the Game. There are a few exceptions but those exceptions can't be bought with Platin either. Those are things from Events or from the old Founders Packages. If you do decide to buy Platin then its worth to wait a bit because you get discounts from the login rewards from time to time and they go from 20% up to 75% meaning that you can basically buy a 180 Platinpack for only 45. You also get alot for your money, for an example: In the Platinpack for 180/45 you get about 4300 Platin. A Slot for a Weapon or a Warframe costs around 10-20 Platin. Skins or other visual things are at around 50-75 Platin. You might need some Platin if you decide to buy Reactors or Catalyst, which are used to enhance a Weapon or Warframe. Those can be used one time on a weapon and cost both 20 Platin, but there are lots of events and i think one special mission each week where you can get one. Depending on how motivated you are this amount of Platin could be enough for a looong time and you are also able to earn more by trading with players. Now a bit more to the Game itself: Warframe is a Coop Multiplayer Game that can be played alone or up to 4 other Players. You are basically a space ninja, called Tenno. You are able to use all kinds of Weapons either melee or ranged or even both combined. Machine Guns, Swords, Lasers, Revolvers, Rocket Launchers, Scythes, Axes there is nearly every Weapontype you can think of and new content keeps getting released. You are basically able to play the Game however you want, even though it might be a bit hard depending on your type of enemy. In the first few hours of the game you will grind yourself through different kind of Missions while following a Questline. The tutorials are pretty new and not really good at all, but at least have some kind of Tutorial now. Before that you had a little introduction and then it was basically "gl hf now go" Every now and then you unlock a Bossfight. Those bosses are a special kind of enemy and can be pretty hard, especially for newer players. They also have the possibility to drop Blueprints or Parts for new Weapons or Warframe. Every Weapon and Warframe etc that you can't just buy straight from the market, needs to be build in the Foundry. The Blueprints you need for that can be found on the Market, in Clan Dojos and their Researchingstations, in Bossfights or in the Void. I will talk about the Void later. To Build something you need to gather Ressources or other Parts for it first. Then it takes about 24h or 3x 12h + 1x 36h, for Warframes, to finish. While playing the Missions you will also find Mods for your Gear that is used to enhance it. After a while you might have gathered some decent Mods to upgrade your Gear. As soon as you are strong enough, you want to enter the Void or the Orokin Derelicts. Those are a special kind of Missions and they are basically the Endgame. The strongest Weapons and Warframes can be found in the Void while some of the most important Mods are found in the Orokin Derelicts. Those are Places with pretty tough enemies and maybe even deadly traps. Depending on the Mission you choose, you can get a wide variety of rewards. Besides your Weapons you also have to level up your Account itself. It's used to be able to use special kinds of Weapons that require a specific level before you can use them. To level your Account you have to level your Gear. Most people build and gather every piece of Equipment and level them up to their max level to push their own Accountlevel as high as its possible. Thats why most people try to collect every weapon as possible to level them up to their max. The main focus of the game might be the collecting of Gear and Mods to level up and make ones equipment as powerful as possible. If you don't mind spending lots of hours into farming Ressources or Equipment then i would totally recommend this Game to you, but even if you don't like farming stuff: Give it a few hours like 20 or so. Most people i know didn't really stopped to play after they got used to it. If you are still unsure: Look at the amount of positive reviews and the average playtime of those people.

review: Warframe Is one of the few games out there that Really impressed me. With it's many places to go and many "Warframes" to play as it definently has Diversity with the amount of characters it has along with all the guns and other things you can have. The amount of things you will figure out in this game will amaze but you must Realize that this is basically like Borderlands or any other tough single player game. I Would suggest having a few friends to play with because alone this game is nearly impossible with the massive amount of enemies it sends at you. It could use a little difficulty tweaking but all in all makes up for it by being one of the few games that lets you use Parkour as most people call it otherwise known as being able to run on walls and other things like that. All In All an Amazing Diverse game that makes up for little story by having amazing gameplay mechanics.

review: Warframe is a very fun game with space guns, space ninjas and space bad guys. Oh, and space-badassery. Once you start playing it's hard to quit, Having login rewards really keeps you going, The one drawback is when you're just starting. YOur weapons dont do much damage anymore, even though they're maxed damage. But you can use all your hard work to buy blueprints of weapons and build them. The Boltor is very good to start with too. This game is very fun with friends and a group of 4 people, with a wide range of game modes and modifications for your 'warframe' and weapons. There's even lot's of secrets and lot's of hidden lore. I hope people enjoy the game like i have.

U spend hours trying to new equipment only to find that there is even stronger ones coming out later, which of cause u will and want and spend more hours farming to get it, so if u got nothing to do anymore and enjoy sci-fi action i would recommend because i have to admit this is a good game

review: As a free to play game, you cannot really complain about anything from the get go. It is a high action run-n-gun Third Person Shooter, incorporating parkour maveuverability and a variety of skills in order to dispose of the mass of enemies that come between you and your objective. There are also a variety of game types, enemies, maps, weapons, abilities/mods, warframe suits and bosses and each of the maps, though they use similar textures and areas, are randomly generated per game. The missions are seemingly endless with other 200+ missions across a dozen or more planets. Although, like every game, there is a few cons that go against its pros. For example, it can get repetitive - especially replaying certain missions in order to get certain drops from that missions, or having to level up your warframe or weapons in order to be able to advance to more difficult and challenging maps - though that is not as bad as it sounds as there are plenty of weapons, warframes and abilities in order to build and switch up your character to change the way you play reduce the boredom of repition. And that it has an item mall where you can buy things without having to struggle or earn them, or that F2P players will be at a disadvantage of inventory space which is key to keeping your favourite and more powerful equipment whilst you're using equipment that you wish to level up. My overall view of this game is that it a fun and expansive free to play game with endless amount of achievements to gain, such as defeating ever boss, conqeuring every planet, completing every mission and collecting and leveling every piece of equipment. There's also a great clan system that's rather complicated, I will admit, but it's set up in a sort of 'rank' fashion - and clans can also level up over time in order to build up your clan dojo to gain more powerful weapons that you cannot find elsewhere, as well as the dojo being fully modifiable and being created to your own tastes and liking (granted you have farmed enough credits and resources to do so.) My score for this game is 8/10 - it's graphically beautiful, it has great sound effects, a nice fluent gameplay and fighting system that allows you to use the map to your advantage, expansive armoury and a limitless amount of build variations and to top it all off.... IT'S FREE, so if you do not like it you are not losing out.

review: A Science Fiction, fast paced, SPACE NINJA third person shoot. This is by far one of my favorite games only second to Skyrim. Warframe is a co-op based shooter with very little pvp. Warframe makes up for this by making combact unreal. For example, sliding and WALL RUNNING. Now combine these acrobatics with sword slashing , knife throwing, and a little bit of martial arts. There is no way you can resist Warframe. Keep your blade sharp, and may you see many victories, Tenno.

After playing for about 400 hours I started to get bored, so I took a break from the game for a couple of months. When I came back, so much had been added and improved, it was like a whole new game. Digital Extremes is an excelent developer and is known for listening to its customers feedback. With the upcoming X1 release, I imagine sinking even more time into this amazingly fun and beautiful looking game.

review: In Warframe, up to 4 players work together to complete missions, such as eliminating enemies or retrieving data from terminals. Players wear a battlesuit called a Warframe, each with its own set of abilites and statistics; and are equipped with 3 weaponsa primary weapon (such as a rifle or shotgun), a secondary weapon (usually a pistol), and a melee weapon (like a longsword). Players earn Affinity (experience points) for killing enemies and completing challenges and missions, which allows them to level up their weapons and armor. Warframes and weaponry have access to modifications, or "mods", that can be installed, removed and upgraded between missions; the higher the Affinity rank of any one piece of equipment, the more mods it can accommodate. The camera is positioned over the shoulder for third-person shooting. The player can jump, sprint, slide, and roll, as well as combine techniques to quickly move throughout the level and avoid enemy fire. The game also allows players to utilize parkour techniques to evade enemies, bypass obstacles or gain access to secret areas. Maps are generated procedurally; with prebuilt rooms connected together so that no levels have the same layout. At times, the enemy faction can initiate a lockdown of the area, forcing players to hack security terminals by completing a puzzle minigame within a small time limit. Credits, ammo, resources, and mods can be found in set locations, such as lockers and destructible containers, as well as dropped by enemies. New weapons, Warframes, and equipment can be purchased in the market (either the items themselves or their blueprints), using either Credits earned in-game, or Platinum purchased via microtransaction.[3] Blueprints can be constructed using resources found during gameplay.

review: Brilliant game. From the first minute you launch the game you get straight into the in depth tutorial on how to control/use your warframe. It's fantastic. The buttons used to do certain things with your warframe just seem so... relevant. In particular, I like the fact that there are multiple planets (ones we know, and ones we have never heard of because the seek extistance) and on each planet, the difficulty basically goes up. For example, you start on Mercury which is the easiest and work your way up to.. Earth. Then there are the small implementations. Trading system where you can trade mods for weaponry and also platinum which you can use to purcahse weaponry. I would recommend this to all my friends if I could be bothered. For sure pick it up, of course seeing it's free!

High quality graphics, smart A.I. and a excellent cover system with tight target boxes (you must aim AT the target to hit it not just NEAR it). Parkour around the environment, bounce off the walls dodging bullets to your hearts content, or charge the enemy with guns blazing; however the wall climbing is hard and DOES require a lot of practice. Build everything by finding the blueprints and supplies or spend money and buy them, plus get rewards for improving skills and meeting goals. Add Mods to your character and equipment to improve their abilities, increasing damage, shields, speed and lots more. Want to light the bad-guys on fire (?) or freeze them solid (?) YOU CAN. Play Warframe once and you won't regret it. REMEMBER, IT'S FREE TO PLAY!!

All i can say is that this game is really fun to play, either solo or with friends (always better with frineds of course). Maybe people can get bored if they play alot, but tis is one of this games that u will want to play later on. On my case i never get bored and collecting all weapons and warframes on the games is like a challenge to me that i have to complete. They keep adding new stuff, and biger and better everytime.

review: I wanted to like this, but couldn't. The biggest thing that jumps out at you is that this isn't a game that has grind, it's a game that was built around grind as a primary design mechanic, and overall purpose in the game. I don't mean Diablo or Borderlands type grind, but incredibly dull, mindless, painful grind, where often the best option, is very low level missions you can just tear apart with ease, or to just leech away in public games. While it has a number of nice concepts, it unfortunately fails to execute them very well. Worst among those being the painfully grind centric, and RNG related progression mechanic, rather limited variety of loot that feels more like resource gathering, than loot collecting, and the overall poor game balance. Although this is shaping up to be one of those infinite beta type games (with a functioning cash shop), as there's always various aspects marked as coming soon, currently being redesigned, or reredesigned. With some of the changes forcing you to wonder if much thought went into them at all, while others are seemingly focused on just looking cool, rather than if it would be an enjoyable game mechanic. The "Space Ninjas" thing is a marketing gimmick, as stealth in the game is not a good option, and only semi-functional in one of the mission types. Although if you play with others they always just charge in with guns blazing like space marines. Mob AI is inept, they like to run in circles, then often take cover while standing behind explosive barrels, things that only cover their lower half, or just right out in the open. The parkour only sort of works, some of the time, the rest of the time it either doesn't trigger, or slingshots you off at mach 10. Warframe certainly has it's fair share of bugs in general. I have all too often had to abort a mission, giving up all my item rewards, because the door to the next area wouldn't open, the last mob was stuck underground, the next sequence didn't trigger, or so on. It might shape up to be a really good game at some point along the line, should it ever get out of beta, and they really sit down to figure out how to get everything to work together effectively. Although, as it is right now, I couldn't recommend this to anyone.

review: Warframe is a really beautiful game with interesting gameplay, but after time gets very repetitive. Lots of grinding for the items/gear/frames you want, but can be truly rewarding. I love this game, but I wish there was more incentive to complete worlds. I also wish there was a larger variety in mission type, because its basically either assassinate a special dude, kill all the enemies, or defend a cryopod. Variety would make this game 10/10. At this point I would still give it a 8/10. Again, its ing GORGEOUS on highest graphic settings. Would fap to.

review: There are many free-to-play games out there that use their "free" status to constitute shoving a reason to spend money in the player's face. When they don't do that they usually have very little actual gameplay that makes you feel like your progressing anywhere. These are the games that are often labeled as "pay to win" for the need to pay money to progress anywhere. Warframe is the rare example of a free-to-play game done perfectly right. Except for one minor detail, but I'll get to that. Paying money in Warframe gives you the in-game currency platinum, which can buy a multitude of different weapons, warframes (basically armors/classes of this game), and other components used in the game. While these things can all be bought though, they are all achievable through regular gameplay as well. In fact there are many items, especially weapons, that can only be aquired as you progress through the game. All it requires is a little patience, and if you have a group of friends you will probably be flying through the game building awesome new weapons and warframes like no tomarrow. The only thing that could hold a completely new player back is the learning how the game works. The game doesn't have a very well built system intoduction yet (I say yet because the game is still in beta and is constantly getting new content and updates). The game never pushes you to pay anything either, in fact the advertising for the platinum system is almost entirely kept tucked away inside of the in-game shop, which you only ever open if you want to buy something (the shop contains both items that you pay platinum for, or blueprints for those items which are bought using credits earned by playing). The only time this rule is ever broken is when your trying to customize your character or get too many weapons/warframes. The customization of your character's look in the game is relatively small, but it is made even smaller by the fact that only 1 out of the 9 color pallets as well as many of the cosmetic items and skins are locked behind platinum payments. This is a relatively small complaint however, as cosmetics play no role in the gameplay. The bigger concern is the fact that you have a limit of how many warframes and weapons you can store. You can buy more slots with platinum, but if you don't want to spend money then you'll have to give up a weapon when a new one is finished building. So far I've been talking about the payment plan of the game. So you might be wondering: 'What is the gameplay and story like?' Well here is the answer, the gameplay is amazing. On the outside it looks basically like any other 3rd person shooter (although the graphics are exceptionally good), this game is far more complex than it looks though, and has far more to give you in terms of action than a simple shooting experience. Before I go into the little details though let me explain some of the backround story. You are a Tenno, basically a space ninja, and you must fight a multitude of enemy factions fighting for control of the solar system along-side your fellow Tenno in order to mantain balance. That's the back-story and as for regular stoeyline within the game, their is very little. In fact the game's storyline reminds me of Dark Souls in the way the storyline was made to be purposfully miniscule in order to get the player to fill in the gaps themselves and create their own personal story. The real question after learning the story though is: if your a ninja wouldn't this have far more gameplay to it than just a simple shooter experiance? The answer is yes, and this game provides that in the form of parkor, melee weapons, and best of all, ninja super powers. The parkor can be a lot of fun, the melee is a bit lacking (as of the time of this writing an update will soon be coming out that will be improving melee usage), and the super-powers are amazing. These powers are unique to each warframe you use (each one has four powers) and can range from something as simple and destuctive as throwing fireballs at enemies (used by a warframe called Ember) to something team based and useful like Healing the health of your allies (Trinity/Oberon). While the powers of each warframe could decide your play style, they don't have to. Every warframe and weapon is highly customizable with different upgrades called "Artifact Modules", more commonly called "Mods". These are gained from fallen enemies or the completion of mission objective and adds a huge amount of depth to the game. There are nearly 300 different mods in the game, and more get created all the time. There is a limit to modifications you can put on your weapons and warframes though, so choices must be made. The level up system is rather interesting and goes in a sort of imaginary pyramid. On the top is the player level. This unlockes the use of certain weapons and warframes. In order to gain XP for yourself you must level up your weapons and warframes, which go up to level 30. The higher level the item, the more mods you can apply to it and the mods themselves can be leveled up by fusing mods together, maximizing at different points depending on the mod. The one problem I have with this entire game is map design. The maps (especially during the first few planets) are boring and repetative to look at. While the later maps get more interesting the first few hours can look really bland. This could be a major problem if the game was fully released, but it is, as I said before, still in beta, and this is a problem that has been adressed and is being worked on as I right this. The fact that it is in beta and is still being upgraded and added to is why I look forward to the future of this game so much. It's in open beta, and the developers are always taking advice from the players themselves. Everything from weapons, warframes, and even story ideas are taken from the players and used to help create more for the game. In this way the players and developers are working together to make this game the best that it can be. While this game still could get better or worse, I can only see it getting better with the kind of devotion and teamwork shown by both the players and the creators of the game. So in the end, after my current 200 hours of playtime in this game, do I recommend it? YES. I do.

review: What happens when you combine the Parkour from Mirrors Edge, with Bullet Physics, Moba-like Power-ups and Melee? An unplayable pulp... And yes, thats what Warframe was for a while Unplayable, confusing, straight up bad... But this game has seen in its one and a half year of existence, more attention than any other game I have ever played, and it was attention from the Devs, and Players alike. Its step by step evolution from unplayable to epic was a long journey, one that I was a part of. Warframe is now closer to the final draft than ever before, and in my opinion is one of the few fun and original shooters out there The current mechanics offer a great spice up to the genre and the co-op focused nature of the game makes it feel like an epic RPG rather than a generic VS shooter The amazing character designs and settings, the concept and the lore of the game are delivered in an amazing way. They make this game pleasant without much unnecessary dialogue and cutscenes, and the ran-gen nature of the map and enemies, is a powerful tool, than ensures differentiation in weapons and tactics, even if you are to play the same level again, you will never find the same enemies at the same place, using the same gun Dont let the Free to play scare you away! Warframe is a no-Paywall game You can craft everything in there through normal gameplay, get the materials and build all the things! Or you can buy them with platinum to support the game! (You need Platinum to buy weapons slots and cosmetics) Yes, Warframe is not a perfect game, and its not a finished game It can be really frustrating at times and it lacks many things. But its finally on the right path. Seeing a game get from unplayable to amazing doesnt happen often. But what I always saw, is that Warframe has this, sort of retrieving quality Maybe its the community, maybe its the huge flow of quality content, maybe its just the stunning way this game looks, maybe its the sheer fun this game exhales, maybe it's the people that I met in the game, the tenno in my clan, or maybe its just me I could never stop playing this game Its only clear that we have a gem in our hands, and that it gets brighter every day Warframe, you won! Tenno on guys! ^^

review: gameplay: pretty good but a little poopy. DE sometimes changes the poopy things but not very fast. still enjoyable progression: very snappy compared to most MMOs, you can get new things very easily. maxing stuff out in every possible way takes a long time but that's good because you need something to do if you do everything else graphics: very nice, pretty effects, etc. story: you are a space ninja robot man so 10/10 dumb : crafting important things like new warframes (characters) takes days IRL, but you can still do other stuff in the mean time and you don't need to be logged in or anything. End game content is pretty poopy. Some tilesets get used a bit too much (but they add new ones sometimes, and they're still much better than going through the exact same dungeon constantly) Sometimes the game bugs out but fortunately it won't ruin your session very often and if it does you can just kill yourself and let your team finish the mission for you.

review: This game is definately a good reccomend for anyone who has the time and the paitience (or money) to progress in it. This game is being constantly updated with new content every week, some small, some game changing, but always progressing, chances are if you played this game earlier in its beta that it is a completely new beast from whatever you lasted tasted - everything has been up for change: the damage system, the melee system, the upgrade system, the UI, the hud, the parkour, individual warframe abilites have all been successful candidates for overhaul and have improved the game. The only major gripe is that the level of content and lack of support can currently make things daunting for newer players to learn. But again, this is something the devs are currently working on to improve. The only issue with how well you'll do will depend on how quickly you join and the sooner the better. It's a beta, you'll run into glitches and hitches, it's just how it works, you'd be hard pressed to find even fully released titles that don't have bugs, but it'd be harder to find a dev team more dedicated to pushing this game forward than the team behind Warframe. This game is going places and you should definately consider joining the ride now while you have the chance to get the upper hand as soon as possible. To top it all off, it's a game about space ninjas with superpowers, honestly I don't see what else you want.

review: Looks Good, Runs well on my machine, and is co-op. #Freetoplay, #Installthis, #Playwithfriends ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// This was my Review when I had pumped almost 6 hours into this game, blinded by the depth of the crafting table, resource gathering and exploring the solar system. 240 hours in I can say this game is nothing but a glorified farming simulator, you spend hours grinding for gear you think you need, 15 min for one little resource that you need out of 5 to build your little potato so you can make your warframe more powerfull, oh big whoop! but imagine grinding 15 min for reasources 5x for each of your weapons? and I have about 8 weapons, 6 warframes and a  tonne of blue prints. Okay so you level up and grind untill you have such an over powerd warframe that you can take on the later levels with ease, but guess what? now you have access to the void on wow! this game is soo indepth I never saw this coming new levels and everything. The enemies get a new skin, do more damage and its all pretty much the same but in these levels staying alive 20 minutes or more only gets you the good resources, so you gotta keep grinding. Just keep swimming for the ultimate goal right? what goal? you allready have all you want, oh but what about that one warframe that you dont have Vulban, who can only be unlocked by spending all your waking hours on the game to catch the 3 alert missions you need to grab all his parts, they come and go randomly in the game and sometimes only last an hour, without all 3 parts you cant build  and are left with no way of gaining the others untill you find and play the next super rare alert mission. It took me 240 hours before I could build Vulban, I played with him for 4 hours, yea hes pretty ing sweet. but not worth it in my opinion. Now there is nothign more I wish to do. Nohting more I wish to see. I have finaly escaped the grind for resources and see little else in this game. 7/10

review: I've been playing this game since beta about half a year ago and i cant begin to explain how aweosme this game is! Its a challenge and a ton of fun. you have to choice to do so much. Creating and customizing your warframe has to be the best part just waiting for it to be done is suspenseful. The game says you can be a ninja but in in my view your a god with awesome abliilties depeding on your warframe. Each warframe has different abilities it on depends on which one you pick or any warframe bluepring you pick up. This game has changed a ton honestly so much to do you can upgrade your warframe to be more BADASS and your weapons too. You can even have this little sential that will follow you around kill, heal or hack for you. There really isnt much of story line that i can remember but its a ton of fun! Its an online game you can switch the settings so you play with others or just rock out by yourself. No one can kill you but its a ton of fun at times to play with others whp actually know what their doing. This game is worth it all at the end short download and alot of detail and action! DOWNLOAD IT NOW you wont regret a thing once you try it and get use to it.

It's combinated FPS Coop shooting game where you can do climbing, wallrunning, jumping, sliding and much more. There are so many weapons like swords, katanas, scythe, polearms, rifles, bows, crossbow, pistols, grenadelaunchers etc. I recommend to gather some friend and play together because it's really nice game with very long gameplay. +Gameplay +Graphics +It's free +Great Guidance +Long Gameplay +Creativity +Great Community (not like blaming ppl in DotA2, LoL, HoN etc.) -Bugs (Of course it's still Beta) -Problems with connection to a friend

review: Warframe is a game where you're a robot ninja and you go around with 3 other robot ninja's and prepare to curbstomp the entire enemy opposition because of all the characters unique abilities. This game can also be described as Metal Gear Rising meets Halo meets Dead Space meets Borderlands. You got the fast paced robot ninja action ala Metal Gear, the characters looking like Halo and Dead Space, the infested feel like Halo Flood and the Dead Space Necromorph, and the 4 player drop in drop out co-op and grinding is like Borderlands. Of course, the devs where smart when they designed the grinding aspect, as the map has a unique thingy that allows each and every time to be different so you don't get bored of running through the same place a million times to go fight this boss, which is where borderlands failed. The microtransactions are kinda weird though, but nothing too major unless you like to waste money buying items when it's easier and cheaper to go find the components, build it, and then rush the item. The action is very fast and flowing, where you could go from jumping in the air shooting at people to sliding into people and insta gibbing them with your melee weapon. It's all very fun, and I'd recommend it for anyone who likes fast paced ninja robot action TL;DR: THIS GAME IS GOOD GET IT YOU AS SHOLE.

review: Fantastic f2p game everything can be earned ingame minus things such as extra equipment slots and warframe slots. Ahem think of it as a 3rd person space diablo esque type game and thats Warframe in a nutshell! Plenty of customisation is available for weapons via the Mod system for both weapons and warframe with each mod being upgradeable. The Dojo acts as your clans (guilds in Warframe) home base which YOU decide how it's laid out and whats being built and/or researched at any given time. PvP does exist but at the moment being in beta still it's not quite there yet but overall the Game is always improving every patch, the void is challenging, Survival can be extreme fun pushing yourself for those risky extra 5 minutes for another chance at that oh so rare mod and with the recent addition of the trading system this game will always be something I go back to!

review: When it comes to discussing Warframe, I can say a lot of stuff. I can mention a refined game system, which updates even further over time. I can praise the developers, who obviously love the game they create and are fast to bring us the new stuff. I can say that Warframe is the first game that attracted me with its unique style. But the thing that I love the most is the setting lore - well, its scattered parts, which are brought with every new update. The lore is by far the most original thing in the game: how about a well mixed coctail made of space adventures, roman and japanese culture? Don't forget the feeling of waking up in a cryocapsule and realising that there are very few left of your nation, if any, and everyone else in the universe hates you.

There's a Dojo where you and your clan can battle in pvp mode, and you can test your own build Warframe with others. There are monthly updates that bulk up the game time after time. If you don't play this yet, just download it for free and start pew pewing your way through the galaxy.

And if you're a tight- free2play type, Digital Extremes have the most fair monetization system I've seen in any f2p game.

review: This game made me forsake the ease of use console style gaming and return to PC gaming. Between the massive variety of things you can do, modify, and customize to suit your exact style of play DE made happen. Just about everything you could ever hope to get in a premium game, and it's absolutely free.

review: Cool game space ninja wars FTP. like the box said :) Make your your way trough the missions modes exterminate, sabotage, defense, capture, interception, excavation and planet boss fights all while building new frames/weapons. U get mod cards to power it along the way. Build your self a sentinels robot to cover your back and join u on your quests as of update 14 We got kubrows (wolf bat cat dogs XD) as a battle pet as your companion option. Most things (all if u trade items for platinum near end game) in the game are able to be obtained for free though it can be a lot of work. The Platinum is priced kind of high but then again the devs need to make a living somehow so get it if u like to support the devs :) and u can always wait on a steam sale or login reward discount. War is a grind but im having a blast while doing it ^^

review: Have you ever wanted a retro ninga game? Well, this is for you. This 4 player player third-person shooter is good for freinds looking for a good time. You play as a Tenno, an advanced race of beings, who have these advanced suits called Warframes each with their own special characteristics and abilitys. You, and 3 other players, go from planet to planet, to help and save it, from the deep jungles of Earth, to the icy and cold wastelands of Mars. Every planet has a boss that you must defeat to advance to the next planet, and getting there is half the fun. The controls of this game are very fluint and wallrunning and sliding around the map makes you feel like a badass ninja. The weapons in this game all have their own feel to them, and exploring and testing out which ones are good for you can be very fun. Plus, all the mods you can put on them make it feel like your own. The imagery and art style of this game is amazing, and beutifal to look at. I found myself stopping and looking around at the beutifal scenary and architexture before speeding off again to join the rest of my teamates. The time when you are surrounded by hundreds of enemies, and you pull off your special move to clear them all away is something to admire. The best thing about this game is that it's free, so play to your hearts content. Be prepared to grind a lot though, if you want to be able to get all of the other cool and amazing weapons, and Warframes without spending any money, it's going to take many hours. This game is a very strong money pusher, but if you stay head strong and just grind, you will get to where you don't need to spend a dime on what you want. My other gripe about this game is that the crafting system and market isn't really explained well, and can be confusing to first timers. But, once you are able to learn and play, you will be sucked in this game for hours on end, and you won't want to stop. from a scale of 1 to 10, i would give this game a 8 out of 10. Hope this helped!

review: Warframe was a game I got into a couple of months ago. Overall, I'm really skeptical about Free to Play games, lots of them are one time installs and play for the laughs with some friends and then delete it about 2 months later after forgetting you installed it. Warframe is not such a game, in fact I'd go as far to say that it's a rare gem in the whole free to play game list. It's fair about leveling & items and it's not heavily slanted towards the usual pay to win style we see from free to play games. Anyone can build themselves new items and frames from blueprints (purchasable in the market with the regular currency) which require you to find all the parts from locations and wait for it to craft in the foundry. Alternatively you can just pay the price tag in platinum (the premium currency) and get it on the spot. Even after 200 hours of play time, I have never bought a single item with platinum. I didn't even spend any money on the game until around 150 hours (and even then, it was only $25 because I got a 75% off voucher log in reward) and that should clearly show you how nicely balanced this game is. There is a LOT you can do without paying; heck you can do everything in the game without paying which is fantastic to see in a Free to play game. The developers are fantastic and really active, they have hotfixes and updates monthly if not weekly and are actively talking with the community and dealing with reported bugs and such. The community is just as equally amazing and I've had lots of enjoyable and funny online experiences with pubs. To sum this all up: play it. Give it a shot and see what it's like. The early game is a little slow if you don't have a bunch of friends to carry you through high level missions to get masses of xp, but soon enough you'll be tearing through enemies with multi shot rifles that set people on fire and send body parts flying.

review: Maybe you bother to read, maybe you dont. maybe this review will get top rated, maybe it wont. maybe you'll never see this, maybe you will. if you've seen this the last maybe-maybe doesnt count for you :D. i'm writing this review at 21/08/14, but i've stopped playing warframe because i was trying out some other games and got lured in by grinding, so some stuff might be outdated when you are reading this. i'm trying my best on english, grammar and typing but it might contain some grammar/ spelling-errors. plz no hate for those but i will try to fix asap if you say it in a post. CaPiTaLs have never been my thing, so you wont see many I's and. Capitals after . ... ... (dots). One of the most un-P2W games I've ever played. besides that, you are able to get nearly anything from the store. and you are gonna need additional weapon/ inventory slots. which can all be bought by.... .... .... platinum(premium, tradable currency)! there aren't any real boosters but there are "potatoes"/ catalysators which'll give your weapon/ warframe twice as much mod capacity. these catalysators are also availble through "lotus gift", an random alert which'll give you one of those. for some weapons/ frames you'll need to increase your mastery rank, which will increase by leveling up any gear. every weapon/ warframe has to be crafted if you choose to grind all its components and not pay for it. the blueprints can be bought from the store or can be found. its gonna cost you from one minute to 3 days for stuff to finish, weapons starting at 12h and the frames themselves high and lonely at the top. all can ve rushed for..... guess what? platinum! when its finished you'll have to go through the regular path of claiming it, and than leveling, to a max of lvl 30. why do i have to lvl it? because itll get you mod capacity! allowing to omptimize your gear and fine-tune it according to your playstyle. there are, starter weapons (MK-1 mostly) regular weapons, expansive regular weapons, clan tech and grindy prime stuff (prime components/ blueprints are tradable). for clan tech you'll obviously need a clan which has build a room, allowing you to build research rooms (a total of 4). in every research room you can ... research stuff! good guessing. researching will require credits (non premium currency, not tradable. but required to trade!) and a lot of time/ platinum. once researching is done you can get the blueprint. there are sentinels and kubrows to help you in your mission. a sentinel is a floating thing which can be customized and modded. there are multiple sentinels with multiple guns. once you've made a sentinel you'll also get its gun. you'll have to craft the sentinel for the gun but you can equip nearly any gun on any sentinel. every sentinel will also come with its own special abilities. same goes for kubrows, but these are melee and look more like a dog. they'll help you and have some awesome mods to be equipped. for guns you have a primary and a secondary. including bows, crossbows, shotguns, rifles, sniper rifles, throwable knives and special stuff. you can get 30 to 60 mod capacity on these. melee! you have long swords, short swords, dual sword, daggers, a glaive, axe, dual axe, whips, some hammers and more. these also have 30-60 mod capacity which can be upgraded by stance mods. allowing you to perform combo's and increasing the stamina cost. warframes. all have their unique powers (though some powers closely resemble eachother), speed, hp, shield, armor, stamina and energy. warframes are equippable with aura mods which'll give a team-wide bonus. they also give additional mod capacity. you have tanky frames to stealth frames. engineer frames and "medic" frames. and more. you cannot chance a frame's gender. frames will also get a little energy/ hp/ shield bonus with every lvl they gain. mods. as said you have a mod capacity. you'll gain one to two mod capacity for every level your weapon/ frame/ whatever gains. melee and frames have stance/ polarity slots which'll increase the mod capacity even more. whats that? i have added so many mods and i want to max them all but i cant because i've reached the max! no worries, forma is here to save the day. forma..? yeah, it resembles some golden puzzle piece and is able to change that little icon you can see in the upper right corner of every mod-slot. but! forma doesnt save the day for free, it wants maxed gear! so it can eat every precious level away until its unranked! you'll do that for you dearest weapon wont you? forma isnt that hard to get, it will sometimes be availble through alerts and can be found in OD missions. :o what is OD? its orokin derelict. fight infested on an infested orokin ship. BPs can be bought in the store and will require a nav coordinate and ANY void key. dont was your T3 and T4 here, just use T1 or T2 if you want. this game will get you grinding pretty fast. STOP! when you start grinding the fun is gone (for me). look for some friends, invite them to the game, maybe start up your own clan with them? get together in a (4 players max) squad, and have fun! if you care, my favourite weapons and frames are: valkyr/ zephyr. ogris/ ignis. none/ yet. jat kittag. Beware: everything except valkyr is clan tech, and zephyr requires tons of oxium (i bought it .-.)

review: Warframe is among one of the best free to play games you can get...if you can run it. Even with my high end gaming laptop it still has lag issues. But besides that it's really fun to play. New content and updates/fixes are administered quite frequently and it has gotten more content since I first tried it when it came out. There always seems to be an event going on which makes it more fun to jump in and play. A word of advice...do not go and buy the weapons and Warframes. Why? Because it's more fun to gather the ingredients to make them. You can basically make any of the items (weapons, Warframes and sentinels) with blueprints...if they aren't on the market you'll eventually collect them. If you always wanted to know what it feels like to be a parkour ninja...this game is perfect. Otherwise...it's definitely worth a try anyway!

review: Do you love shooting them sum'bucks? Do you love magical powers? Do you love grinding your life of for rewards? Then this game is perfect for you. Warframe is without a doubt an awesome game, constant updates, a space themed FPS with magical powers to melt the faces of your enemies, very fast paced action, it's dynamic and you can parkour the entire level. You're never gonna be without a thing to do, but because of this we can talk about the only downside of the game, which for some others, like myself, aren't that bad of a negative point, I'm talking about the overgrind to get stuff like specific mods to upgrade your weapons, weapon parts and warframe parts. This game isn't difficult at all, the early phase is just fine to play without a sweat, and much more fun with friends, but you might reconsider if you're not in the mood to grind when you reach that near mid-game, but it is worth when you two-shot that freaking boss who killed you a bunch of times when you get more levels and better gear.

review: 1.) You're a ninja...in space. 2.) You have access to potential overkill weapons and abilities that you can upgrade any way you want. 3.) You basically become an "unknown hero" by saving the galaxy without a soul truly knowing. 4.) Nothing is ever truly the same time, going though the same area multiple times will show different maps and enemy layouts, so each time in a mission you have to think on your toes. 5.) Why are you still reading this and not in-game right now?

review: Applause is in order for the developers for creating such a truly amazing game. It may be quite repetitive, but compared to a game like Call of Duty or Counter Strike, Warframe is not that repettitive. The game may be a grindfest, but all shooters are in some way a grindfest, and most have minimal customization. Call of Duty is nowhere near the customizational level, and counter strike is static uncustomizable to the max. And who wouldn't want to be a freaking space ninja? However this game is highly... well... Beta... glitchy... and all out hillarious or annoying when it does. I'm in love with this game. When you look in the platinum store and you see a weapon that is 150+ platinum, it's simply the developer's way of saying, "Here, be lazy if you want, but it'll cost you buddy!" There is no way that I can express the fun I've had on this game because the game itself is ever changing and ever updating, and best of all... FOREVER FREE. This game without a doubt has my seal of approval. I the Leader of Boxes everywhere am proud to give this game a 10/10! (and a 50/10 in Betaness)

review: You sir! Yes you! Do you enjoy 3rd person games? Do you enjoy shooting games? How about games with swords? And what about games with wall running, sliding, flipping, air kicks and all other ninja moves, you enjoy those aswell? Do you like your games with a easy multiplayer setup and amazing clan function with a working meeting hall (dojo) and everything? Well then, my good sir, this game is for you! There is, however, a heavy P2W factor involved that will have you easily spending a couple of bucks a few hours into the game if you're the kinda guy that doesn't like working for his stuff. There is a supreme lack in any story in this game but the devs seem to be trying to patch that up with many new quest releases. Speaking of devs, here we have a development crew that are actually in touch with their community actually listen to them. Which is refreshing in the modern society of false promises and poor delivery in gaming today. All in all, great game, I haven't paid for a single thing yet and I'm having a blast so the P2W doesn't bother me that much. It's got solid game play and is seriously pretty. Did I mention they added moustaches?

review: Been playing this game for a long time (The hours in my steam didn't sync with my warframe account idk why), and it's so much fun along with the community itself. Well this game is a "grinding" game which forces you to play missions over and over and over again, but it's so addictive. The most fun part is building your warframe/weapons until it Overpowered (or OP), putting the right mods and stuffs. There's so much memories in this game even i can't remember them all lol. Game score? for a co-op f2p i give it 7 out of 10.

review: This is one of the best free games you're gonna find on the market right now. The game has tons of levels, diverse enemies, and more weapons than you can shake 12 loosely bundled sticks at. The only minor complaint I had about the game was the need to buy more "backpack" slots using real money, but this has now been solved, with the recently added ability to trade in-game items for platinum. You have no reason to avoid this game. Try it, or suffer a less delightful life.

review: 1.) You're a ninja...in space. 2.) You have access to potential overkill weapons and abilities that you can upgrade any way you want. 3.) You basically become an "unknown hero" by saving the galaxy without a soul truly knowing. 4.) Nothing is ever truly the same time, going though the same area multiple times will show different maps and enemy layouts, so each time in a mission you have to think on your toes. 5.) Why are you still reading this and not in-game right now?

review: This game is definately a good reccomend for anyone who has the time and the paitience (or money) to progress in it. This game is being constantly updated with new content every week, some small, some game changing, but always progressing, chances are if you played this game earlier in its beta that it is a completely new beast from whatever you lasted tasted - everything has been up for change: the damage system, the melee system, the upgrade system, the UI, the hud, the parkour, individual warframe abilites have all been successful candidates for overhaul and have improved the game. The only major gripe is that the level of content and lack of support can currently make things daunting for newer players to learn. But again, this is something the devs are currently working on to improve. The only issue with how well you'll do will depend on how quickly you join and the sooner the better. It's a beta, you'll run into glitches and hitches, it's just how it works, you'd be hard pressed to find even fully released titles that don't have bugs, but it'd be harder to find a dev team more dedicated to pushing this game forward than the team behind Warframe. This game is going places and you should definately consider joining the ride now while you have the chance to get the upper hand as soon as possible. To top it all off, it's a game about space ninjas with superpowers, honestly I don't see what else you want.

review: Warframe is a really beautiful game with interesting gameplay, but after time gets very repetitive. Lots of grinding for the items/gear/frames you want, but can be truly rewarding. I love this game, but I wish there was more incentive to complete worlds. I also wish there was a larger variety in mission type, because its basically either assassinate a special dude, kill all the enemies, or defend a cryopod. Variety would make this game 10/10. At this point I would still give it a 8/10. Again, its ing GORGEOUS on highest graphic settings. Would fap to.

review: What happens when you combine the Parkour from Mirrors Edge, with Bullet Physics, Moba-like Power-ups and Melee? An unplayable pulp... And yes, thats what Warframe was for a while Unplayable, confusing, straight up bad... But this game has seen in its one and a half year of existence, more attention than any other game I have ever played, and it was attention from the Devs, and Players alike. Its step by step evolution from unplayable to epic was a long journey, one that I was a part of. Warframe is now closer to the final draft than ever before, and in my opinion is one of the few fun and original shooters out there The current mechanics offer a great spice up to the genre and the co-op focused nature of the game makes it feel like an epic RPG rather than a generic VS shooter The amazing character designs and settings, the concept and the lore of the game are delivered in an amazing way. They make this game pleasant without much unnecessary dialogue and cutscenes, and the ran-gen nature of the map and enemies, is a powerful tool, than ensures differentiation in weapons and tactics, even if you are to play the same level again, you will never find the same enemies at the same place, using the same gun Dont let the Free to play scare you away! Warframe is a no-Paywall game You can craft everything in there through normal gameplay, get the materials and build all the things! Or you can buy them with platinum to support the game! (You need Platinum to buy weapons slots and cosmetics) Yes, Warframe is not a perfect game, and its not a finished game It can be really frustrating at times and it lacks many things. But its finally on the right path. Seeing a game get from unplayable to amazing doesnt happen often. But what I always saw, is that Warframe has this, sort of retrieving quality Maybe its the community, maybe its the huge flow of quality content, maybe its just the stunning way this game looks, maybe its the sheer fun this game exhales, maybe it's the people that I met in the game, the tenno in my clan, or maybe its just me I could never stop playing this game Its only clear that we have a gem in our hands, and that it gets brighter every day Warframe, you won! Tenno on guys! ^^

review: gameplay: pretty good but a little poopy. DE sometimes changes the poopy things but not very fast. still enjoyable progression: very snappy compared to most MMOs, you can get new things very easily. maxing stuff out in every possible way takes a long time but that's good because you need something to do if you do everything else graphics: very nice, pretty effects, etc. story: you are a space ninja robot man so 10/10 dumb : crafting important things like new warframes (characters) takes days IRL, but you can still do other stuff in the mean time and you don't need to be logged in or anything. End game content is pretty poopy. Some tilesets get used a bit too much (but they add new ones sometimes, and they're still much better than going through the exact same dungeon constantly) Sometimes the game bugs out but fortunately it won't ruin your session very often and if it does you can just kill yourself and let your team finish the mission for you.

review: Warframe was a very good surprise, i used to play on the earlier stages of the game and it was a very good concept with great graphics but there wasnt much content at that time, so i took a break from it, but when i return i found a great f2p game with a lot of content and replayablity. The graphics are awesome, the looting, the teaming up with your clan/friends, you will get hooked once you understand the basics and then you want more and better. The only negative is the connection problems related to the Strict NAT issue, but im sure they will fix that and add even more content to the game. 4,6/5.

review: This game is all around fun. It's not Pay to Win, just Pay to SWEAG. Everything that's in the store can be found and built in-game. You can either play solo or with friends. (Playing with friends in this game doesn't slow you down, it actually speeds things up.) And best thing is, YOU'RE A SPACE NINJA WITH GUNS. Fighting against eveeeiiillll. It's a definite get. I mean if it wasn't, then why is is so popular and on PS4? GET IN THIS AND FIGHT FOR THE LOTUS, TENNO!

review: I can highly recommend this game to people who like third person shooters. It is a freerun (very good movement to get quickly around the maps), cop ninja space hack'n slash shooter. It has many different area's and in each area it generates a new order of chambers to make the completion run slightly different every time. Also it's free to play so why wouldn't you try it out? the PvP isn't really great, but it is mostly a cop PvE game anyway. This game is much about farming resources and bleuprints for new equipment, weapons and suits/characters. There is a trading system in game to make getting the prime bleu prints easier. You can ofcourse spend money on additional stuff (it isn't a pay to win game). That isn't necesarry to do so, by using trading you can get even those items anyway but it'll take way longer ofc. I played this game for more then 1120 hours and i never spend any real money on it. If you become really good in playing and speeding trough missions, it can become kind of a bore and annoyance to drag noob players across the map, if I play a non t4 mission with players that are not on my friend list, 99% of the games I play will result in me having done more 90% of all damage and me waiting at a door that needs 2 players to open.... Also there is not really much of an end game and if you want to play this game for melee mostly then don't, it's a shooter, at the point of writing this review melee is obsolete even for characters that are based around melee. Conlusion: It's good and free, by far my most played game on steam.

review: Warframe is a game that is free to play, but no payment is ever really nessicary. I've actually only played the game for 100 hours, and I'm in end game tier equipment. The game is always open, and though uninteresesting at first, once you get some friends to play with, and talk to the game is a blast. Don't get me wrong, the game is a blast without your friends, but in a co-op game, friends is always the best way to go. The game has missions, about 20 per planet/moons. There are about 20 of these moons, along with random levels called "alerts", and "invaisons". There are 6 or 7 mission types. The levels are randomly generated, but the type will always be the same for the mission you selected. I've never seen the same level twice, though they will pretty much always have the same aethetic. These mission types really make each mission unique. Extermination is where you need to kill all the enemies in a level. Defense is like horde mode, but you're defending a certain artifact. You have the option to extract every 5 waves, with loot getting better, but enemies getting harder every wave and the potential to lose everything you're already earned. Moble defense is kind of like defense, but rather than wave based, it's time based with you having to take a core around to different static posts. This is the worst type of mission. Survival is a time based mission where you must survive (duh) as long as possible. The enemy will cut your life support at the start of the mission, so you must get life support dropped from Lotus. Extration is where you must mine cyotic, a special ore ice thing, used to freeze luxury Marsian Jellyfish (I wish I was joking). The game is always intense action, there's always something to do, and that's why it's so fun. Though Earth, and eventually Mercury are kind of boring, but once you get out of there, the game gets so good, it's unimagible. A great experiance, deserved to be played by everyone, with frequent patches, and constant attention. PLAY THIS GAME!!!

review: +Looks like devs push their Evolution Engine pretty good; +Smooth gameplay; +Good matchmaking; +Nice weaponry and deal damage system; +Game become much better over time with new features, modes and fixed old ones; +Finally some AI improvement is going on; +Music improvements, now is pleased to hear; +Pretty responsible dev team to community; +Okay clan system. -Sadly low level of overall design (but have some tact) and palette and FX planning; pretty influencing, f.e. sometimes you find enemy or ally much faster at radar instead of just looking in front of you! in the middle of a battle. -Different diffuse and normal maps resolution in game assets; seriously? Devs haven't sense of object's scale? -Few quests, poor story; grinding feelings. -Some overload CPU performance; actually You not "feel" it ingame, but! if you monitor your Hardware or have any tasks in BG that using CP during game running you'll find out... -Some breaking logic elements in crafting and gameplay. -Minor not much gamebreaking bugs, some of them you don't even see if you're not so pedantic; things like slightly different damage dealt on host and client side of the game even with good network and data bandwidth and so on...

review: While I recommend this game, because it is a fun experience... I can easily see how the fun factor will die very quickly. There are a lot of weapon choices and different classes to play, but if you don't know what you already like you'll either spend a ton of time or money trying to find out. By default, you are limited to 2 classes and 8 weapons. Your starting class will take 1 of these slots. You (typically) have 3 weapons at all times. 1 primary, 1 sidearm, 1 melee weapon. During the learning process of what you like, you will most probably be deleting several weapons and frames to test out new ones. (or you can pay for more slots) Weapons and frames are crafted (or bought) They also level up. Leveling up items is how you level up your overall character level. That means, you must try new weapons and frames in order to advance further. I do not recommend spending money on anything that can be obtained by playing the game. The purpose of playing is to obtain resources and unlock new areas... to obtain more resources. If you buy your way to end-game, you will not have a reason to play. For me, I joined with a friend, who has some friends that have been playing for some time. My sister also joined up. What I've noticed is this... When I play with the veteran players (or with the public) there is a heavy rush factor. You will feel very underpowered, and will not really kill anything. It's like acceptable leeching. When I play with my friends that are just as weak as I am, I feel like we can have fun and explore the levels a bit more. The game is heavily co-op. The veterans that I know don't seem to have any trouble soloing some missions, but overall the missions are unforgiving. You will need to go in with a team. Lacking a central hub to meet people (future content) you will have to either have friends that play, or join in public games and take your chances. Recommended, but not long term.

review: A very cool game indeed. I did not want to play this game at first thinking that it would not be very fun because the game is a free-to-play game. However the gameplay is great and very action-packed. I really wish this game had more of a storyline, because there is allot that the creators of this game could do with a single player or co-op campaign. Other than very little story line, if you like game with allot of action and killing hoards after hoards of monsters while you play as a Tenno in the field to save the Universe!

review: I've been playing this game since beta about half a year ago and i cant begin to explain how aweosme this game is! Its a challenge and a ton of fun. you have to choice to do so much. Creating and customizing your warframe has to be the best part just waiting for it to be done is suspenseful. The game says you can be a ninja but in in my view your a god with awesome abliilties depeding on your warframe. Each warframe has different abilities it on depends on which one you pick or any warframe bluepring you pick up. This game has changed a ton honestly so much to do you can upgrade your warframe to be more BADASS and your weapons too. You can even have this little sential that will follow you around kill, heal or hack for you. There really isnt much of story line that i can remember but its a ton of fun! Its an online game you can switch the settings so you play with others or just rock out by yourself. No one can kill you but its a ton of fun at times to play with others whp actually know what their doing. This game is worth it all at the end short download and alot of detail and action! DOWNLOAD IT NOW you wont regret a thing once you try it and get use to it.

review: With smooth animation and semi-simple controls, Warframe is on the right path. The graphics are pretty good, enough to run fluently. Gameplay can be a little difficult, with no real levels to train. It pushes you right into the game, and does a good job of explaining the controls for the most part. Some bugs may occur but it's on it's way. The sounds in the game are well done, an atmosphere that really pulls the player into the game. Gameplay may be a little intense. All in all, Warframe is a fairly good game, but it could use some improvements. 7/10
game-hours: 3327.4
review: Highly Recommended for the long term player. This game is still very much in development. The core gameplay works, but they're still struggling with balancing item drops and distribution systems. Bosses and areas are being revamped from placeholders, and major systems have not been implemented yet. Max rank for a player account is 30, and we do not have enough content yet to do more than barely scratch Rank 15 even doing everything. (02/18/2014). There's some negativity from players joining and expecting a finished and polished game as well as from established players who mistake incomplete or placeholder systems for 'bad' systems, but if you're looking for a long term shooter game with lots of progression and variety... frankly there aren't many good options out there right now. Warframe has TONS of weapons, VERY active development, REGULAR weekly content releases and the dev team turly listens and directly adresses player feedback in regular livestreams and forum 'community hot topic' posts. So I highly recommend it for the long term player despite it's struggles. The community also tends to be mostly baddies who don't use cover, don't aim at weakpoints and have no grasp of basic tactics. Sorry if jimmies are rustled but it's true. If you can cut it playing team survival games like Killing Floor or have experience with shooter games and can reliably get headshots, you will find getting started in this game far easier and less 'grindy' than people describe. Seriously. I'm not even trying to say that I'm any good, most people just treat it like it's Tabula Rasa 2 and run around shooting stuff center mass and comparing DPS all over the forums. If you are into action games you will just  all over warframe. Try it. Not P2Win. Everything is available without money except cosmetics and you can trade stuff to other players for the in-game currency they bought. Not PvP. There's basic dueling and some little arena stuff, but the game isn't balanced for it at all. Max players in a game is 4. Don't buy game currency full price. Wait for a sale or login reward coupon. It's like $10 for a gun buying small amounts at full price.

review: Awesome co op Third Person Shooter. Note : Think of warframs as Mech suits.. just for this review.. there is a rather tangled lore behind this game I am not going in to for spoilers sake. Quick over view.. Space ninjas. Yes that picture is actually what they look like in game! Pros, OMG it looks awesome for a space game, All the Warframs and weapons look like they could be 3d printed right now. Co Op is very fun, Almost like Borderlands 2 but less of that slap stick humor Some what customizable You can change colors for your warframe and your weapons, Though the color choices are small to start with and unlock more as you level you will still have to spend real monies to get more colors. This being the only thing you can't unlock in the game. Play style flexibility So far it has your basic flexibility, until you unlock other warframs. So close range, mid range and distance. My current load out is Bo staff, shrunken, and bow and arrow. Three starter warframes.. Tank / close range Distance long range with lighting and a jack of all trades. This will expand in to a wide range of warframes including one that is support and one that is Healer. Pyro / frost / gravity driven warframs Exploration This game rewards you for exploring.. doo it .. free running is your friend ninja run up walls and across gaps.. find the thing. Con's FTP, Grind to win.. Or you can just PTW. yes it is a PTW game. This can be a real turn off for a lot of people. But being in Beta maby they will add a way to earn currency in game Its in Beta.. Bugs, incomplete animations, but hay its in beta it is free PS4 vs PC So far it is sported on two platforms but they can not cross play yet. Just like ESO it is not yet ready to talk cross server. Difficulty scaling may be a tad harsh. I am playing Solely with Kit, so we are 2 manning it ( can up to 4 man it) I think if we were soloing it it would be much harder. This may be to nudge people into paying for upgrades with currency, and make grinding harder. Playing coop we are fine, just noticing my bow (sniper weapon) is no longer 1 shooting mobs. Learning curve This game has a bit of a learning curve... the in game tutorial doesn't really tell you how to do things it mostly just point and says figure it out. This only make a HUGE difference with the mods. Fusing the right cards, can make some unbelievably powerful mods.

review: A really good fremium game. Have really enjoyed the 'Space Ninja' style game play with differeing level difficultly and the ability to create new warframes from just playing rather than spending is a real positive. Lagging is sometimes an issue with this game, but happy to take that as an issue in 'beta'. Would recommend to anyone.

review: CO-OP game, repetitive and grindy, lots of farming, however, still in beta, constant updates and a unique combat system with interesting mechanics. PVP is there, but the main focus is PVE. Also PVP is unbalanced, no pay 2 win, however limiting for someone who doesn't pay money, can trade for currency to buy store items. Limited Customization for starters, being limited to 3 Warframes and a small pallete of colors, but still fair in terms of unlocking weapons and crafting other frames. Warframes offer plenty of playstyles, however, certain playstyles, like stealth, are unrewarding compared to just running through the levels with someone who can blow everything up. Certain weapons are useless, other weapons are OP, creating an uneven field and also making the game boring by having less variety until weapons are balanced. Unique movement system, however can be greatly improved upon if the devs worked on it. Current movement has wallrunning, sliding, and using melee weapons to turn yourself into a helicopter due to the speed boost from swinging it. Despite this, many viable playstyles and a decent amount of variety, but again, would be more variety should other weapons be balanced. Terrible AI, the AI is very dumb. Some AI are just faster than others and can perform different manuevers, however, they still lack a logical thinking process. Many will run up to you head-on, or will hide and take cover and allow you to pick them off, without thinking to move. Bosses have unique prospects, but are still pretty stupid. Game currently only rewards rushing, stealth is not possible, and few tactical options outside of warframe abilities. Very few variety between missions, there is defense, survival and extermination, along with another mission type which involves blowing up an object. There is also one where you run around and capture points, but that is only one ONE mission. Could use plenty more mission types.

review: First off, this game is free, so you should just check it out right now. Okay, with that out of the way, I love this game so much. If you are here for some of the best 3rd person combat (shooting & melee), solid co-op multiplayer, a fantastic leveling/upgrading system that really allows for some personal custimaztion based on your playstyle, and very (VERY) pretty graphics in an engine that runs incredibly well, then you are here for the right reasons. My biggest issue with the game used to be the lack of variety in environments, but that is no longer a problem. From when I started playing the game in closed beta, there are now 3-4 times as many areas. With the different mods in each area (now twice as many modes) and the randomly generated maps (as in the style of Diablo II & III), environments are very varied. Of course, with it a F2P game, you're likely skeptical about whether or not it is Pay2Win or not. While it isn't as fair of a model as Loadout or Path of Exile, it is probably the best model out there. I logged around 200 hours before ever spending money and I only used that money to buy weapon slots and visual upgrades seeing as how it's so much fun to actually earn weapons and frames in this game. I would say this game is 1 part Mass Effect 3's multiplayer, 1 part Left4Dead, and 1 part Prince of Persia/Mirrors Edge. If that sounds like a great time to you (I hope it does), then start downloading. Again, it is free and also the game is a pretty darn small file size. 5/5

review: I love this game, it is the one that I keep going back too, however I recently went back and looked at the new user experience, it was not as joyous as I remembered, the steps taken to introduce you with the tutorials were better than when I joined, but still I understand why so many people feel it is just too bewildering. Hopefully with the new user experience finally getting some major TLC this is going to make the whole process much more intuitive. The most striking thing to me, was how little damage the initial set of weapons do, and how few useful mods drop early on, I got through the opening missions on Mercury with others, my experience on these levels aided that, but the step up to Venus was horrendous, the osprey shields made trying to kill anything a chore. I was forced to go back and repeatedly run missions to rank up the mods I had managed to collect. However once you break through and get to Earth, this is when the game truly shines, better mods drop which made the whole game seem more palatable. The graceful movement within game is beautiful, the addition of melee 2.0 has added a whole new dimension to the game, making melee both viable and more importantly fun. It is worth the effort to perservere and to get fully acquainted with the mechanics of the game, it opens up a world of possibilities, the continual development is widening the scope of gameplay with each update. Definitely recommend accruing major game time.

review: I figured I ought to review this dynasty space ninjas of hellgate london. It's pretty good! For what you get at any rate. I've spent about twenty dollars into this game by now and I can honestly say I don't feel like it's been wasted time! It's a pretty grand game all things considered, it's simple, easy to get into, and the controls don't usually make me feel like a blind man groping for spilled change. At any rate, it's grindy, boring at times, but it's worth the occasional jump into for a purely cooperative experience. Don't you miss that? When games were purely Co-Op, or had a Co-Op focus? I miss that. What a shame.

review: Warframe's concept, when presented to the normal person, would seem unusual or unappealing. This can be forgiven since the concept is space ninjas on a solar mission of fighting giant brutes and strange merchantmen whilst holding back the invading forces of a mysterious infestation. Yet this game has proven to be hundreds of hours of fun for myself and my friends who would play it. The ability to go through a procedurally generated map while shooting Grineer platoons in a Defense or slashing apart an Infested swarm in a survival mission has produced unlimited amounts of fun. The game gives the player an ultimate suit of armor which grants them unimaginable power as they run, jump, slide, kick, shoot, grapple, punch, stab, and slash at enemies who give the player an actual challenge. The content is even more extrordinary as it is updated very often and is largely influenced by the community. Thus every player has a direct voice in what they want the developers to put in next. Thus for a game overflowing with action, adventure, community, and a sheer uniqueness not commonly found in the typical selection of modern games, Warframe should definitely be on the consumer's list! Did I also mention that it is free?

review: I have well over 700 hours of gameplay and rising, this game is very fun and can be very addicting. It has its ups and downs, but first I'll go over the ups. An obvious up is that its free to play, so you can try it out and if it doesnt fit you're gaming style then just uninstall. With it being free to play theres obviously going to be microtransactions, but let me asure you that there is nothing in warframe you cant get (including nearlly all cosmetics), even if you dont put a dime into the game. I havnt payed any money at all and I have some of the best gear, and a hand full of the cosmetic items. This is due to the fact you can trade in game items for microtransaction currency (for warframe its called "platnium"). As far as game graphics, they are amazing, not far cry 4 graphics, but definitely one of the best free to play game graphics I'v seen. Dont let that discourage you if you dont have a high end gaming computer, the game is suprising very optimized, and the devs work to improve it even more. The gunplay is as great, with a third person run and gun parkour style. Aside from guns there are also tons of melee weapons that are just as strong, not just a last resort if you run out of ammo. The depth of melee combat is amazing, collect different melee stances as you progress to match you're play style. Perform combos with the different stances, to cut down you're enemies. And one of the best things about warframe is the devs. The devs are super active and constantly pumping out content as well as streaming on a weekly bases. Their passion for the game is like none other. Ok, so the bad things about warframe. Repetition, this has been a problem for the game for quite some time, and the devs are doing alot to fix this. After playing for as long as someone like me or even far less, warframe will feel like a chore. This can obviously be prevented by playing with freinds or doing unconventional mission play styles, but can still get kind of dull. This is something the devs are taking alot more seriously and they have talked about various ways to improve this. I personally think that the devs can acomplish something to ease or fix this. The second thing bad about warframe is timed events. So what I mean by this is events that offer special prizes like guns, melee weapons, or mods (mods are items that you put into you're character to give them better stats or abilites, each mod has a unique buff), will only come once, and if not will come much later in the year. Meaning if there is a gun, melee or mod that you really want, but wasnt there during the event, you can't get it, unless its tradable, in which case you can trade for with other players. Over all I love this game and I love the devs, they work hard to deliver a great game and it is definitely one of my favorite free to plays. If you're still sceptical then just give it a try and see for yourself.

review: Warframe, a Third Person Shooter set in a futuristic style. Join me and hop into a "Warframe", its time to explore. From an ancient slumber you awaken, a slumber that would only be undone by a threat wich plagues the planets and solar systems. The Grineer have come to take you, it is time to do what you are supposed to do, save everything. Warframe is (again) a Third Person Shooter set in a futuristic style, you are able to control these solid and strong husks known as "Warframes", they range from Tanks who take a lot of damage to the more stealthy types, allowing you to complete missions without being seen. Warframe has you take on allot of farming at all times as to create Weapons, Sentinels who act as your companion and fight allongside you or even new Warframes. Weapons vary greatly, from low magazine count Twin Vipers with a fast fire rate and reload speed to Bows and Assault Rifles. There is always a weapon that will interest you, be it a sniper to fire from afar or a bow to get those silent kills. Sentinels are a great addition to the game, each equipped with their own Weapon. From poison darts to a fully automatic assault rifle. They also add a more in depth part of Warframe, each they come with various abilities, for example : Carrier has the ability to pickup loot within a specific radius of you. Whereas Deathcube will Vaporize enemies. Warframes are ofcourse the husks you control, ranging from Tanks like Rhino who has massive amounts of stomping power to the more silent Warframe like Ash. There is a Warframe for each style of play, so you'll be sure to find a Warframe to your liking. The enemies : - Grineer - Corpus - Infested The Grineer : The Grineer are an advanced race using weapons like Assault Rifles, Machine Guns, Cleavers and anything that would use normal bullets or slash through flesh. The Corpus : The Corpus are an even more advanced race that use weapons which work on energy like the Flux Rifle and their Electrified Batons. The Infested : The Infested as the name says are infected beings whom are mutated, they range from exploding enemies (Kamikazes), Ancient whom can heal their allies and infested dogs whom are fast with a strong attack. Each enemy has their own weakness leading to some interesting encounters, with "Boss" enemies that have been put into the game whom have the ability to shield themselves with ice to a fire blast knocking you back. The Farming : Warframe imo seems to be the game which you'd love to play if you enjoy some fun sessions in farming for resources. Each planet comes with its own resources, one better then the other. All in all, Warframe is a great game. Its something you won't find everyday and is defenitly worth it to take a look at and playing it. Warframe will be the game for you if you enjoy the joys of farming wich come with interesting missions, special bosses for each faction and the joy of brutally murdering enemies in various ways with the different Warframes abilities.

review: It's been almost two years since I first played Warframe, andI thought I'd update my review considering how much the game has changed (mostly for the better). The core philosophy of being a magic space ninja and juggling melee attacks, ranged combat, and special abilities still makes up the core of the game. While none of these aspects are particularly brilliant on their own, combined, they greate some seriously entertaining emergent gameplay. Switching between these forms of combat adds in a lot of variety and helps keep things fresh even hundreds of hours in game. More advanced players can perform manuvers like zorencoptering (while sprinting, jump, then crouch, and use a melee attack) to gain extra mobility. The game's arsenal has also become much more interesting as Digital Extremes has rounded out the arsenal by continously adding in exotic weapons. We have unique guns including: a tentacle shotgun,a freeze ray,a flak cannon, a wrist-mounted laser beam, and more. Messing around with all of the weapons and discovering which ones you enjoy playing with is always fun. The game now has over 20 different warframes (classes), allowing you to play pretty much any role you want from a melee berserker to a stealthy assassin. Thanks to some great visual design, pretty much all of the warframes are fun to play as, and discovering which one suits your playstyle best is a great experience (<3 Rhino). The overall aesthetic of the game is quite striking as well. All of the frames have their own unique visual flair (the paladin Oberon has a long slender body with very natural deer-like look) combined with some nice Japanese and Sci-Fi flair. Even 500 hours in, the game is still incredible to look at. The soundtrack and audio design are great, especially if you're into "pew-pew" Sci-Fi sound effects, although many of the abilities sound quite powerful. That being said, you will probably want to play your own music after a couple of dozen hours into the game, since the soundtrack does tend to repeat itself. Now, let's talk about one of the game's biggest strengths and weaknesses: the grind. Like Diablo or Destiny, Warframe is a game all about grind. You grind resources to craft weapons, grind resources to level up mods, grind planets to obtain frame/weapon drops, etc. For the most part, the grind is reasonable and rather enjoyable due to the strength of the game's combat. Even hundreds of hours into the game, I still had a blast zipping around the maps and picking off enemies with my insanely specced out weapons and warframes. However, at times, the grind can be overwhelming as you try to unlock that one specific part that you need to complete a warframe or a gun, only to get something completely useless instead. Also, ranking up level 10 mods can be an extreme chore. To this day, I do not have any rank 10 mods on me. That being said, the grind never feels too overwhelming like in other F2P games I've played before, and paying to circumvent the grind really isn't necessary in Warframe. Another one of my complaints concerns the massive power creep in Warframe. Since DE churns out so much content in such a quick amount of time, many of the warframes weapons will be either extremely weak or extremely powerful, to the point where several hotfixes are needed to get them to a decent shape (assuming they are patched). For example, Sniper Rifles are worse than bows in most cases, shotguns suffer from heavy damage falloff and long reloads, and frames that don't offer utility (such as crowd control, healing, buffs, etc) and focus on dealing raw ability damage suffer greatly. The game definitely needs a large balance patch to work out these issues. My third complaint is that Warframe doesn't seem to be going towards one direction. DE is focused so much on adding new content haphazardly, that it's difficult to see where the game is going. To this day, there is no campaign, only a handful of small quests. There is no real endgame, as it mostly consists of endless mission types. I have to wonder if we're ever going to get more meaningful content as the current mission types feel all the same: (kill a bunch of enemies but with specific conditions, such as capturing a target, rescuing a hostage, etc.). Plus, mission objectives rarely vary, so if you've played one extermination mission, you've played them all, and the same with the other mission types. Finally, the game does an awful job of explaining itself. Even with the new tutorial, the game does not explain all of its mechanics properly and throws new players into the open with little advice. Consulting the game's wiki or recruiting/region chat will make the experience for new players a much more enjoyable one. So despite all of my complaining, I enjoy Warframe quite a bit. At the end of the day, it's a fun game that has a great variety in content and allows players to pretty much choose how they play and set their own pace. It's a very fair F2P game, so there's little reason to not give it a shot. tl;dr + good aesthetic + fun combat + weapon and class diversity + mostly fun grinding + very generous F2P model - grind can be overwhelming at times - power creep - lack of story content and end game. - mission types feel very similar. - poorly explains itself

review: ~*~TO ANYONE WHO HAS PLAYED MASS EFFECT 3's MULTIPLAYER MODE IN THE PAST ~*~ I have to say this is what I wish Mass effect's Multiplayer mode would've been like. In Mass Effect you had your specific races, in Waframe you kinda play as one race the whole time -BUT- each "Tenno" has their own specific abilities and perks to help you get the edge over countless enemies thrown at you, and really helps make you feel like a total badass. You can even further enhance your Warframes with the "Mods" that are dropped from enemies as you complete missions from planet-to-planet. These mods can help with consuming less energy so you can use powers helluva lot more frequently, or make the effects last longer, more powerful, and add so many ways to change your preffered playstyles offering so much replayability, ESPECIALLY WITH FRIENDS! Remember all those times when you weren't able to jump in Mass Effect and instead only givng the option to jump down a certain ledge while getting chased by hordes of Banshees, Phantoms, & Collectors? Well in Warframe you can go all Parkour! Wall running across huge gaps to evade enemy fire, wall jumping to reach higher/secret rooms, the amount of places to use parkour is astounding if you use your imagination and experiment. I could go on & on about the added features and content they've added over the course of its life (Which is still considered in BETA by the way!), but overall I think this was the game I've been longing for and I really enjoyed my time with the ME3's Multiplayer experience myself which definitely left me feeling hungy for a more enjoyable Co-op game like Warframe has provided for me. Did I forget to mention this thing is Free-to-play? Give it a spin and you might just find yourself spending TOO much of your time in this game. XD

review: Let's go ahead and describe Warframe's plot in the most simplest form: You're a ninja. In space. Ok, review's over go home. Wait, you're still reading this? Alright, fine, let's keep it going. Frames at War is a third-person action shooter space ninja simulator where you and up to three other players test your mettle against three woefully unprepared factions: The Space Merchants, Heavy Metal Russians and the Zerg. You battle through waves upon waves of commuters on their way to work/home to provide for/see their families and slice/blast/shoot them to little pieces in your magical superman/woman body suit with your crazy monofilamentvibrobladeanthrax dispensers, which you can purchase blueprints for OR you can find parts in Goldfinger's space palaces to create blinged out versions of them. Speaking of blinged out things, this game is Free to Play, but actually done well. You can almost get ANYTHING in this game without spending ANY money at all and not feel jaded at the massive time you've wasted doing so. That is, until you want to feel special and buy a buttload of cosmetics. At that point, you can either blow money on Platinum or have some other dumb sucker do the same to buy junk from you in the trade channel. What I take away from the whole experience is that you're a monster who hurts people for fun and profit. I really like this game.

review: Its a 3rd person action/shooter with a fair emphasis on the grind. A lot of ppl will be put off by the rng nature of some of the items that you have to farm but at the same time if you go into this with a few friends the game can be extremely fun. Keep in mind I'm also a huge fan of monster hunter so my opinion is a tad bias in that regards. The cash shop isnt game breaking and it gives ppl without a lot of time on their hands a chance to keep up with those that play this game too much. All in all if you enjoy 3rd person action games I would recommend that you look into this one, just keep in mind that to get to a lot of the "end game" stuff you're either going to pay for it or invest a fair amt of time into it.

review: Do i recommend this game? Hell yeah i do. Great combat and movement. large selection of weapons and characters (frames) to build and/or buy. NO PAY TO WIN, Everything is obtainable from playing the game. though you can pay to skip and just have the items.. wheres the fun in that? Great Co oP game for 4players, lots of things to progress towards keeping you busy for hundreds of hours. THE VERY BEST SUPPORT OF ANY GAME I HAVE EVER PLAYED.... Any problems are VERY quickly patched out unlike alot of devs taking weeks to fix something they mess up these guys generally sort it in mins/hours sometimes a day or so and support tickets are always answered. for a free game... there isnt a better choice at the moment.

review: I can highly recommend this game to people who like third person shooters. It is a freerun (very good movement to get quickly around the maps), cop ninja space hack'n slash shooter. It has many different area's and in each area it generates a new order of chambers to make the completion run slightly different every time. Also it's free to play so why wouldn't you try it out? the PvP isn't really great, but it is mostly a cop PvE game anyway. This game is much about farming resources and bleuprints for new equipment, weapons and suits/characters. There is a trading system in game to make getting the prime bleu prints easier. You can ofcourse spend money on additional stuff (it isn't a pay to win game). That isn't necesarry to do so, by using trading you can get even those items anyway but it'll take way longer ofc. I played this game for more then 1120 hours and i never spend any real money on it. If you become really good in playing and speeding trough missions, it can become kind of a bore and annoyance to drag noob players across the map, if I play a non t4 mission with players that are not on my friend list, 99% of the games I play will result in me having done more 90% of all damage and me waiting at a door that needs 2 players to open.... Also there is not really much of an end game and if you want to play this game for melee mostly then don't, it's a shooter, at the point of writing this review melee is obsolete even for characters that are based around melee. Conlusion: It's good and free, by far my most played game on steam.

review: I figured I ought to review this dynasty space ninjas of hellgate london. It's pretty good! For what you get at any rate. I've spent about twenty dollars into this game by now and I can honestly say I don't feel like it's been wasted time! It's a pretty grand game all things considered, it's simple, easy to get into, and the controls don't usually make me feel like a blind man groping for spilled change. At any rate, it's grindy, boring at times, but it's worth the occasional jump into for a purely cooperative experience. Don't you miss that? When games were purely Co-Op, or had a Co-Op focus? I miss that. What a shame.

review: This game is somewhat interesting to recommend for a few reasons, but first the positives. The game itself is fun and is also an interesting consept for a F2P game, although rather repetitive after a while. The combat itself is above average, having you equiped with a primary, secondary and melee with a large amount of choice for each catagory. The movement system is what will be most interesting for new players, as i cannot see any reason why Doing a wall run, Gound slaming on a tough enemy then going into a slide and killing another enemy with kunai whist sliding past him wouldn't be entertaining. Now onto the negative aspect of this game, the 10 Km high barrier for new players that is *Drum roll here* Crafting and Farming. Despite the game puts you in a MUCH better position at the start that it did previously, the barrier is still there. A lot of the weapons that are good to begin with either require unknown and unobtainable reasources for a new player or be locked away from you untill you build the weapons that may as well require literal unobtainium for a new player, however, if you can find a group of people to play with you will have a MUCH more enjoyable and easier time playing. The crafting also uses a automated "This will be finished in..." sort of system, and some of the wait times are somewhat crazy, the worst being 3 days for a warframe, which needs you to build all 3 of it's parts first, with a minimum time of 12 hours if all 3 are crafted at once, So be prepared to wait, and brutaly maim someone with an axe while you wait. Over all the game does a good job of what it does, and that is to provide hours of play time to build and upgrade a set of weapons so they become powerful enough to kill the entire population of a country in a few minuites, but remember, if you get this game, you will learn to farm. Or get eaten by crazy rabid space dogs, your choice really.

review: Warframe is a very unique shooter, especially for a free-to-play game. Overall the game is solid and a lot of fun with its own unique style. Combat is smooth and fluid, and gameplay is overall a lot of fun, but repetative. There's only a few different basic game modes, but the game isn't about the objective or game modes; it's about running around slaughtering your foes with a large variety of weapons. Perhpas one of the games biggest features is the acrobatics feature. In the game you're a super space ninja, so you can run on walls, flying kick, and slide your way around the battlefield. You can run in guns blazing, sneak around the back way, snipe from aways away with a bow, and so on and so on; the game really shines in its way of dropping each encounter into your hands and you and your party figuring out a fun and unique way of dealing with it. Sure, you can treat this like a normal shooter and hide behind cover, but why would you do that when you can karate kick your way through the endless legion of space communists, or get into plasma kung-foo sword fights with their commanders? Ontop of this each warframe, the powersuits and effectively the class system of the game, plays completely different from the next one. Even the starter 3 warframes to choose from play completely different from each other, each with their own special role to fill in a party, adding for even more game variety. There's the Mag, the crowd control, the Excalibur, the swords expert, and the Loki, the stealth specialist for the cunning type, and these are only the 3 base warframes out of all of the many they offer. As I said before, no warframe plays like the next, so as you collect new suits it adds even more variety into the game. While the gameplay is incredible, there are the flaws. I mentioned before the repetition of the game, and this is because the game does the Diablo style level generator, where every level is randomly generated from a selection of room tiles. While the majority planets in the game has it's own set of tiles, be it the cyber-punk factories of Jupiter or the overran forests of earth, by the end of each planet you'll of seen each room a few dozen times each. On top of this, there is a lot of grind in the game, but the good kind of grind. There are two kinds of grind: there's the Borderlands 2/Diablo III post-game grind where you farm a boss for 6 hours to hopefully get a rare drop, then there's the World of Warcraft/Runescape grind where you set a goal in your mind and you slowly work for it until you achieve it, making slow but steady progress, and when you finally achieve your goal it was more than worth the grind. Warframe includes the second kind of grind. To get new weapons, warframes, or really anything you have to buy the blueprint and gather the reasources to build whatever it is you want, and even then once you build something you have to wait a decent amount of time for it to complete. A few days for a new warframe, 12-24 hours for a new weapons, etc., etc. But, of course if you don't want to wait, or even gather the reasources, you can spend real money to buy it on the spot, with no waiting time. The cost of new weapons and warframes is relatively cheap, but the costs will slowly add up if you don't want to grind. Personally, growing up primarily playing MMO's I actually find pleasure in the grind, especially because each game is unique and each encounter is a new way to creatively dispatch your enemies. On top of this, you cannot buy the best gear in the game. It's one thing to spend $60 and get all of the best items in the store, but even the best items have a better counterpart to them, known as "prime" items. The only way to get these items it to collect the blueprints and parts from the harder missions in the game, requiring a lot of skill. Another thing the game lacks in is story. The story is unique and different, but basic and could really use on improvement and detail. You play as a Tenno, a variation of one of the now 3 evolutionary paths human who's effectivley a superhuman ninja and is assisted with his or her superhuman power suit, known as a Warframe. Long ago when humans discovered star-flight humanity split into 3 faction: the Grineer, the Corpus, and the Tenno. The Grineer and Corpus have been fighting since the day they were formed, and the Tenno sort of flail under them. The Tenno, being the most technologically advanced went to deep space and froze themselves in cryo sleep so the Corpus and Grineer can fight, but one day the Grineer find the resting place of the Tenno and you, the player, is woken up by Lotus (the leader of the Tenno) to now fight in the intergalactic war. Oh and there's this race of creatures called The Infected that are basically Nekromorphs and The Flood put into one, but they play a suprisingly minor role in the lore. That's really it. It does go a little further in depth in the datalogs, and the story is only ever hinted at durring missions by Lotus. Now, note I said "story," and not "universe." The universe/world of Warframe amazing. In the description of the game it says "...set in an evolving sci-fi world," and this is very true. Certain missions of the game have the players hired by the warring factions as mercenaries to help fight for them, and depending on which faction wins the specific conflict changes which faction then resigns on that planet. This, and the fact that the developers are constantly working to bring the game new content makes for a very expansive world and brings a very immersive feeling to gameplay. It really feels like you're in a Warframe, infultrating enemy ships and running around the battlefields. All-in-all I give this game a recomendation, but in two seperate ways: If you're an MMO player I highly recomend this game, for you'll find the most joy out of it. Or, if you're not one for MMOs I recomend getting this game, but dropping the "free to play" label off and spending $20-$60 on a few Warframes and weapons. I give this game an 8/10 where it's at right now, but this game (as of writing this review) is still in beta and still has a lot of room to improve.

review: Warframe a really great third person shooter game. Developers are always providing with new content and regular updates. The community of this game can be said to be very large compared to other free to play games that are availabe through steam. Can be enjpyed Solo but of course playing with friends and messing around is always a lot of fun. This is not a pay to win kinda free to play game. Purcahsable Currency is an option, everything in the game is obtainable by all players with the in game currency. However, grinding would be a thing in the game. If you enjoy a hack and slash game this would be one of it.

review: Warframe is a game that is free to play, but no payment is ever really nessicary. I've actually only played the game for 100 hours, and I'm in end game tier equipment. The game is always open, and though uninteresesting at first, once you get some friends to play with, and talk to the game is a blast. Don't get me wrong, the game is a blast without your friends, but in a co-op game, friends is always the best way to go. The game has missions, about 20 per planet/moons. There are about 20 of these moons, along with random levels called "alerts", and "invaisons". There are 6 or 7 mission types. The levels are randomly generated, but the type will always be the same for the mission you selected. I've never seen the same level twice, though they will pretty much always have the same aethetic. These mission types really make each mission unique. Extermination is where you need to kill all the enemies in a level. Defense is like horde mode, but you're defending a certain artifact. You have the option to extract every 5 waves, with loot getting better, but enemies getting harder every wave and the potential to lose everything you're already earned. Moble defense is kind of like defense, but rather than wave based, it's time based with you having to take a core around to different static posts. This is the worst type of mission. Survival is a time based mission where you must survive (duh) as long as possible. The enemy will cut your life support at the start of the mission, so you must get life support dropped from Lotus. Extration is where you must mine cyotic, a special ore ice thing, used to freeze luxury Marsian Jellyfish (I wish I was joking). The game is always intense action, there's always something to do, and that's why it's so fun. Though Earth, and eventually Mercury are kind of boring, but once you get out of there, the game gets so good, it's unimagible. A great experiance, deserved to be played by everyone, with frequent patches, and constant attention. PLAY THIS GAME!!!

review: Warframe, a Third Person Shooter set in a futuristic style. Join me and hop into a "Warframe", its time to explore. From an ancient slumber you awaken, a slumber that would only be undone by a threat wich plagues the planets and solar systems. The Grineer have come to take you, it is time to do what you are supposed to do, save everything. Warframe is (again) a Third Person Shooter set in a futuristic style, you are able to control these solid and strong husks known as "Warframes", they range from Tanks who take a lot of damage to the more stealthy types, allowing you to complete missions without being seen. Warframe has you take on allot of farming at all times as to create Weapons, Sentinels who act as your companion and fight allongside you or even new Warframes. Weapons vary greatly, from low magazine count Twin Vipers with a fast fire rate and reload speed to Bows and Assault Rifles. There is always a weapon that will interest you, be it a sniper to fire from afar or a bow to get those silent kills. Sentinels are a great addition to the game, each equipped with their own Weapon. From poison darts to a fully automatic assault rifle. They also add a more in depth part of Warframe, each they come with various abilities, for example : Carrier has the ability to pickup loot within a specific radius of you. Whereas Deathcube will Vaporize enemies. Warframes are ofcourse the husks you control, ranging from Tanks like Rhino who has massive amounts of stomping power to the more silent Warframe like Ash. There is a Warframe for each style of play, so you'll be sure to find a Warframe to your liking. The enemies : - Grineer - Corpus - Infested The Grineer : The Grineer are an advanced race using weapons like Assault Rifles, Machine Guns, Cleavers and anything that would use normal bullets or slash through flesh. The Corpus : The Corpus are an even more advanced race that use weapons which work on energy like the Flux Rifle and their Electrified Batons. The Infested : The Infested as the name says are infected beings whom are mutated, they range from exploding enemies (Kamikazes), Ancient whom can heal their allies and infested dogs whom are fast with a strong attack. Each enemy has their own weakness leading to some interesting encounters, with "Boss" enemies that have been put into the game whom have the ability to shield themselves with ice to a fire blast knocking you back. The Farming : Warframe imo seems to be the game which you'd love to play if you enjoy some fun sessions in farming for resources. Each planet comes with its own resources, one better then the other. All in all, Warframe is a great game. Its something you won't find everyday and is defenitly worth it to take a look at and playing it. Warframe will be the game for you if you enjoy the joys of farming wich come with interesting missions, special bosses for each faction and the joy of brutally murdering enemies in various ways with the different Warframes abilities.

review: If you and your mates want some fast paced co-op action, tons of loadout options, lots of character options, smooth gameplay, great visuals, customizations up the wazoo. Here is your ticket for all that entertainment! This ever-expanding 3rd person shooter can provide countless hours of carnage, and a sick collection of characters and weapons that can be upgraded and modified to suit your gameplay styles. Solo is good.. Co-op is fantastic! I'd like to see more developers take a page from this book in regards to making Co-op more exciting. The PVP in the game could use a little work and expansion (fort captures and capture the flag). The biggest critisisms I could offer are that this game could use MORE and BIGGER boss battles. And a little bit of AI improvements on various enemies. Throw in a few more types of battle formats.. (like arena fights for instance) maybe a little vehicle warfare... (space ninjas on hoverbikes would be the bee's knees).. the current maps that are playable in the game make for good "instances" but a more open world approach would help bring more gamers to the scene without question.

review: Very in depth F2P game. Feels like a high speed version of Mass Effect 3 multiplayer with map exploration. The story is not very well developed however you have a general idea what the plot line is. What really shines is the game play, gun action, sword action, and character/player actions are all really nice. The graphics look very good, smooth framerate, and I haven't spent a single dime to play this game. Without spending a single dollar you have access to 10+ characters and well over 75+ different weapons, just need the components provided by missions to build them all. I would recommend everyone give it a few hours of your time, it is a fun and expansive game now and will only get better as more updates/content keep getting added.

review: Great game. Many hours of fun are to be had. Ranking is a bit of a chore for some things but the boosters which, in the market say 80 plat, can be purchasable for 40 plat for 3 days, which is actually -very- worth it. Game can be a bit buggy sometimes, especially when a new numbered update comes out (14.0, 15.0 etc) but they get ironed out. Plus, if you're an Unreal Tournament fan, Digital Extremes helped creating those games and put some easter eggs in the game, like the Bio Rifle (Stug,) Ripper (Miter,) Flak Cannon (Drakgoon)

review: After over 3300h of playing I've finally decided to write review. It may be little fanboy-like, but I play it so long for a reason. Let's start with developement. 2 years ago, when I've started playing game was really poor. There were two-three rooms connected in different combination to make it look bigger, almost the same type of enemies, grinding with almost the same weapons all the time. But that was two years ago. Thanks to regullary released updates game is now HUGE and I really mean it and it just keeps getting bigger. And constant updates make you wait impatiently for next ones, preventing boredom, Secondly, game is build not only by devs but also by players, that have huge impact on Digital Extremes' (developer's) decisions about "what to do next". It's like community is part of the studio. Third thing: nice community. I've played a lot of games and this one has really good community, compared to other games. Of course, there are some morons, that will try to ruin your experience, but there always has to be few of them, right? Next thing is huge variety of equipment. You play your way. There's no such thing as "best equipment" there. There are plenty of choices, to match your playstyle. Lastly, it's true F2P model. There are no things that are neccessary for good equipment, that are only availible through real money. Well, slots for your Warframes (characters) and weapons are limited at first, but you can always sell few things to players to get enough money (platinum) to get slots. Or simply just buy platinum once, when you'll receive 75% discount (it's really cheap then) and I guarantee you won't regret it. Otherwise, platinum is only needed for cosmetic items. The only disadvantage I can think of, as veteran Warframe player is lack of things that you can do at some point. But to reach that point, you'll have to play for at least few hudred hours, so I guess there's not much to worry about. To sum up: great game, great people, great developers that care about us, players. There are bugs, but they are getting fixed as fast as possible.

review: I find Warframe very fun and even though you can buy weapons and tennos with the use of real cash, you can still play the game using default weapons but I hate the limit of colours for customizing your character. Past that I do find the game very enjoyable and if your PC can handle high graphical settings then switch it to high its a beautiful looking game

review: Warframe is a great co-operative game. With many gamemodes, difficulties, customization, warframes and weapons, it doesn't bore me at all. However, it is very grindy and repetitive, and so it may bore some players. *Cough* Casuals *Cough*. Overall the game looks great, runs smoothly and is a ton of fun. Get it. It's free!

review: Warframe a really great third person shooter game. Developers are always providing with new content and regular updates. The community of this game can be said to be very large compared to other free to play games that are availabe through steam. Can be enjpyed Solo but of course playing with friends and messing around is always a lot of fun. This is not a pay to win kinda free to play game. Purcahsable Currency is an option, everything in the game is obtainable by all players with the in game currency. However, grinding would be a thing in the game. If you enjoy a hack and slash game this would be one of it.

review: There is one arguement that will be put up to this game; Pay2Win. I will say right now that it is not. While there are microntransactions, everything that contributes to actual gameplay can be acquired through playing the game. THERE IS GRIND IN THIS GAME. Putting that out there now because there are people who absolutely despise it. I for one do not have a problem with it. To be perfectly honest, there is ALOT of grind. The good thing is that the gameplay is just so much fun that it is actually enjoyable to play missions and its not just dull shooting ground after dull shooting ground. Looking at you Call of Duty. One kinda big problem i have with it is the inventory. To get more inventory slots you have to pay with Platinum, the microtransaction currency. This causes problems with having weapons and Warframes that you like and not having enough room to store them. The trading system slightly fixes that problem with being able to trade players for weapon parts, mods, and Warframe parts, as well as Platinum. If you are playing the game and find a really valuable mod, you can go to the trading tab and trade with players for it by putting up offers and looking if anyone wants something you might have. In summary this is a slightly flawed, but really enjoyable game if you don't mind grind and some waiting for things to happen. (To be honest what game isnt somewhat flawed?)

review: ( First, dont look on my steam hours, i downloaded warframe to steam just now. i have about 585 hours on the in-game profile) warframe is free to play game, still in beta but already a decent game that worth a try. plot : there is still many question marks, not all of the lore revealed, so i will tell some of the known story : you are, a tenno, twisted race who can control a warframe, a special suit that gains special powers to the wearer, you was awakend from cyro sleep by the lotus, we dont know much about her yet, she guides you and help you, you was awakend in a time of chaos, the grineer, a cloned race is taking over the system, you have to stop them, more is explained through the tutorial mission. alot of this game is about fun, while some players grinding the mastery ranks ( a level in typical mmo ) i found myself not doing this at all ( compare my 580+ hours to rank 11, some are already at 16 on this time ) this game have large varity of weapons and warframes, im taking the weapons that im enjoying to play, and playing with them, there are alot of unique weapons into this game, and there are typical rifles and pistols. this game is TPS ( third person shooter ) but combine some ninja elements ( wallrunning, sneaking even tho it still need rework, and as well, melee weapons - there are dozens of melee weapons in this game ) and that whats make it unique when comparing to other games. also about P2P : Trading system! never paid a single cent, now i got 10 warframes, all with reactors and dozens of weapon slots, just get stuff in void and trade for other players platinum so you want to enjoy? find things that fit your playstyle? ( and there is a huge varity of weapons, from lightning gun to rocket launcher, from dagger to jet powered hammer ) download this game, and start to enjoy!

review: All you need to know about this game is that the combat is AMAZING. There are a few glitches overall but the fluidity of the combat is something to behold. This is really the reason to play this game. The leveling system and ability to modify and customize your weaponry and warframes is also quite addictive. I'd also mention that playing with two person teams is ideal for MOST missions and more fun. Generally playing with four people turns into complete chaos and at least imo makes the game much less fun. The main gripe against this game is that its repetitive and the grind for certains mods/parts/etc can be kind of daunting and boring. After the shock and amazement of the combat wears off (will take a LONG time) you realize you aren't really accomplishing much -- just like other MMO's outside of WoW (which does a good job of constantly giving you a new story to unfold). The issue could be resolved with more oddball events, maybe even massive invasion missions with thousands to slaughter, etc. I find that the game shines the brightest when you face wave after wave of enemy that you can cut up into tiny pieces or (as an Ember) ignite the world on fire and melt their faces (its really satisfying trust me). But when you get stuck doing really drawn out missions like mobile defense the game gets kind of tedious. I also find that while most of the warframes are incredibly fun to play - they are not well balanced. Like Nova for example is WAY too powerful and frames like Frost, Zephyr, or Excalibur are not really effective (fun but not effective for moving along in the game). Often, if playing with friends, one or two people will kill like 70% of the stuff and run around doing so while the two others will spend time collecting loot and hoping they arent shot in the face by heavy Grineer, Infected, or Corpus units. With all of that said I do recommend the game because its a lot of fun to build new weapons/frames/research abilities and get out there and kick some butt. Just beware of the horrible team gameplay due to imbalance and the repetitive nature of the missions. Perhaps in the future they will create missions that require more cohesive gameplay but until then just have fun slicing things into tiny bloody bits or shooting holes through their torsos with shotguns because it will make you grineer to ear. (done intentionally) Also I should mention that this game is NOT P2W at all but it doesnt hurt to buy some platinum from time to time if you want to proceed faster than the game otherwise allows. Clearly the system is rigged in favor of profits but if you know that going in... you'll be better able to handle it.

Selling parts for plantinum goes a long way. Every single thing in the game is achieveable with a little patience.

review: The game is terrible, here is my reason. So im playing ton's of missions and after a hard days work im very tired (you know with all the wall running and sword fighting etc) and I just want to sit down, well my ING space ship can travel faster than a space shuttle but atleast a space shuttle has some EN SEATS! Then If I want to sleep all ive got is my floor which isnt exactly comfortable. I deal with alot on a daily basis and they couldnt throw in these basic things? Yet they give me some  AI called R2-Weatley9000 who just tries to kill and is annoying, I'd trade it in if I could just for one seat, like I'll give you this broken AI for a broken trade k? The worst problem though is without a doubt the lack of a bathroom. I've been using Earth as my personal toilet since the  Tenno wont give me one I've been forced to. They think the grineer have been trying to poison the planet well actually its just my "Garbage". I give this game 5 simcity 2000's out of MLP FIM episode 2 season 55 revenge of the muted deaf kids.

review: BEWARE: Wall of text incoming. First of all: I started playing Warframe like 2 weeks ago, so i'm still kinda new to the whole thing. But i gotta say: I LOVE IT! Warframe is a sci-fi action game that gets the rating AWESOME right at the very beginning of the game: You're a freakin space ninja! And a pretty damn mighty one. The gameplay can be described as somewhat similar to mass effect but focuses a lot more on pure, epic action. It's co-op so you're going to be able to slash through dozens of enemies with your friends, which is pretty great due to the fact that there aren't that many co-ops game out there. So... let's just look at some pros and cons: -----------PROS------------------ -Absolutely epic graphics ( i find myself quite often just standing around and enjoying the great visuals) -Great programming concerning perfomance (you are able to run the game in high details with just a mediocre set-up) -Exciting fast-paced co-op gameplay -A whole lot of content (several planets with different mission types, tons of weapons and warframes, extra missions which you can accsess by crafting keys) -You are able to join and form clans and build clan dojos! (This is a point i'd really like to highlight because the dojos are such a cool feature. Basically you can build all kind of different rooms in your dojo, including labs, duel rooms, obstacle courses, absolutely beautiful decorations rooms with japanese theming, an awesome planetarium and other stuff.) -Great fluid gamefeel (you can perform several moves like wallrunning, dashing, backflipping and basically everything you'd like to do as a space ninja!) -completely fair f2p concept (almost everything in the game can be accomplished without spending real money, excluding additional itemslots (that are quite cheap), cosmetical items and items to supercharge your weapons and warframes.) -The developers are great guys who really give you the feeling that they care about their game. Warframe got so many details and features that the game itself wouldn't necessarily need, but just make it better and more thought out. (The earlier mentioned clandojo is a big example for this!) - DAT PATCH REDTEXT (if you played the game for a bit, you know what i mean) After the pros, let's get to the few, but possibly heavy for some people, cons. -------------CONS---------------- -Warframe is terribly bug-infested. The main chat loves to freeze from time to time, the UI can get stuck, missions won't start and many other problems might appear... I'd say these kind of bugs don't make the game unplayable but sometimes REALLY get on your nerves and take away from your fun. The Devs really gotta do something about that since Warframe is already out for some time and this serious amount of bugs shouldn't be present after that . -The game gets quite repetitive after a while due to the fact that all of the missions just repeat and the only thing new about each planet is the level tileset and different ressources you are able to obtain there. -GRIND GRIND GRIND (seriously, the whole game is actually based on grinding and farming ressourses to be able to craft new weapons, warframes and keys to access the orokin missions. This might be a very bad thing depending on the type of player you are. For me personally it's not a big deal since grinding in warframe is freakin fun thanks to its action packed gameplay. In other games i have always lost interest after collecting the 10th kodo wiener...) Sooo... Here's your TL;DR: Warframe can be a really great game that is full of action, tons of content and give you the feeling that the devs care about us players. On the other hand you might get bored pretty damn fast due to its repetitive gameplay and the amount of grinding you have to do in order to craft new items. Depending on the type of player you are you're going to have TONS of fun with warframe or going to quit after 2 hours saying "jesus, this is so boring" Having written all this the only thing left to say is:

review: WARFRAME is a fast-paced space-shooter, combining elements of MOBA, Parcours, third-person combat and Co-op into a shiny Ninja-Adventure. Although it can be quite a grind if the player chooses to compete for the very best equipment, it is the best bang for your buck if you want the best of all worlds and look for a game where both casual and dedicated gamers can have fun. With some of the best coders in the world (Unreal series, Bioshock, Dark Sector) Digital Extremes has managed to provide stability and constant progress, and delivering high-quality content based on the Evolution Engine. WARFRAME in its current state is quite capable of challenging and competing with the current AAA titles of all major game-companies.

review: Too many times I have approached a game and found that the stress on PVP is over done and there is no way to play with the same feel and not have to worry about long term players or bots. Warframe changed all this for me. A shooter game with more than one twist I fell in love almost immediately. The lore is limited (they are building on it as we speak, it's in an exciting phase) and it does look pay to win... on the surface. It is not. The crafting is a secondary feature of this game. It's a something to do with the parts and the materials you gain. I've lost count of the number of frame's I've stumbled over the resources for and the amount of weapons I've crafted because they look like a bit of fun. If you think the focus of the game is to be completionist and own all the things... then you've missed the point. The point is to play, and play you can. Warframe runs you through an ever increasing series of different mission types from the need to stealth missions to succeed, to defense, attack and outright destruction. They listen to their fanbase and the game grows through the love from the fans and the developers. Winner of MMOBOMB's MMO of the Year (2014) something has to be going right here. For those that love the thrill of the fight, to fantasise on their own lore as the game develops and to watch an already fabulous beta blossom into greater things, this is the game for you. Grab your rifle and your sword and get to killing things.

review: In the Past, when I first tried this game, it was awful. Each level was long, difficult and had very little variety. It was so mind-numbingly boring that WarFrame became difficult to play. Each level was the same layout with a slightly different skin on it. One would play a level, and the next level would be the exact same thing but with ice! Ohhh! Exciting! except it wasn't at all... Since then, WarFrame has improved a tremendous amount, and is legitimately rather fun to play. finding new areas and little hidden sections while exploring a map is fun, and often results in some (more or less) useful resources. The flow of the game is alot smoother, and enemies do not indefinitely respawn, which made the game much harder before. I've had some pretty great times with WarFrame and it's much better than it once was. Though the "copy and paste" level layouts are still the same, it doesn't feel as empty and dull as it did in the past. Two comments that I must make however, is the amount of time it takes to gather resources needed to advance in strength and level; and playing with a controller. The Controller layout is absolutely horrid, and you must redo it all and test with it before you can find something that works. The sensitivity is way too high, and the button layout is simply difficult and hard to understand. Overall, I give this game a 7/10. It's a good game, but players that don't like alot of grinding, and hate some repentition will quickly get bored of it.

review: Milos, a retired porn star, leads a normal family life with his wife Maria and six-year old son Petar in tumultuous Serbia, trying to make ends meet. A sudden call from his former colleague Layla will change everything. Aware of his financial problems, Layla introduces Milos to Vukmir - a mysterious, menacing and politically powerful figure in the pornographic business. A leading role in Vukmir's production will provide financial support to Milos and his family for the rest of their lives. A contract insists on his absolute unawareness of a script they will shoot. From then on, Milos is drawn into a maelstrom of unbelievable cruelty and mayhem devised by his employer, "the director" of his destiny. Vukmir and his cohorts will stop at nothing to complete his vision. In order to escape the living cinematic hell he's put into, and save his family's life, Milos will have to sacrifice everything - his pride, his morality, his sanity, and maybe even his own life.

review: Warframe. It is most definately one of the best -free- multiplayer third person shooters I have ever had the honor to play. I would honestly reccomend this game above many triple A titles. The game itself has a decisive and interesting backstory. many playable "Warframes" with unique and interesting mechanics that give your specific choice meaning in a varity of mission settings. Also perhaps one of the most important features. It's a constantly evolving game, new missions and interesting additions are being added in -monthly- giving this amazing game a ever-changing face and the fact you'll be supported by three additional "Tenno" Three other players all working towards the same goal, means the missions the people and the very game itself is ever changing depending on the people you join with! ... It also has some interesting end-game content that relies far more on teamwork and less on pure shooting and running off on your own this can make it it even more complex and interesting later game. So remember folks, Gun or Blade are not a Tenno's best friend, trust in your Warframe. But even more. Trust in your allies.. "I am the lotus, I will guide you but we must hurry. Vor is coming for you. I see the cryo-sleep has taken your memory, It doesn't matter. you are Tenno. I will prepare you..."

review: Often described as a "pay to win" game. I found that not to be the case. Warframe is a third person shooter that is easy to pick up and rewards players who put time and effort into the game. The initial learning curve is set quite high, but can be made easier with help from the rather polite online community. Missions can seem repetitive at times, but the constant addition of new content and game mechanics make Warframe always feel fresh. Being still only in beta, there are a few minor bugs that stop it from being one of the top free to play games around. These issues however, hardly detract from the game itself and are only noticible because the rest of the game feels so polished. Overall, Warframe is a genuinely good game that has a lot of things going for it. I look forward to the developers Live Release and whatever additional changes accompany it.

review: Very Fun game. For a Free 2 PLay game, it is my favourite there is. Basically it is ninjas in space, but it is a good concept. No story, but it does have a rich lore. Why yu no have Warframe huh huh huh? Got Warframe. Do it for the Shibes Doge Translation: Such Wow, Such Space, So Violent, Very Ninja, Such fun.

review: Ever feel like being a space ninja? Well this is basically it. Ninjas flying through space, saving the solar system from the Grineer, Corpus and Infested. It has boss fights on almost every planet. Modding systems gives players a chance to mod their weapons and warframe according to their play style. Vaious mission types that are actually fun to play. Developer support is great. Constantly fixing bugs while releasing big updates. I love the fact that you can grind for "prime" items to be sold for "platinum" which is the in-game currency that is obtained by paying with real money. Allows people with basically no money to spend a chance to get those items that have to be purchased with platinums. Speaking of platinums, there's many customization. Syandana (capes), colour packs, skins, armor parts and helmets actually gives players the ability to customize their warframes to suit their own taste. TL;DR: Simply the best free game I've played before and I 100% recommend it

review: The gameplay is solid, the game is fun... at first. Depending on your tolerance for grinding, it can either stay that way forever, or get boring really fast. There will be a point where all you can do is grind and try to have fun shooting the same AI monsters over and over again for unlikely minor upgrades. I recommend trying it, it's free; but don't expect to be entertained forever.

review: Honestly an amazing game for a free-to-play MMO. Quick third-person-shooter gameplay is complemented by interesting free-running and mobility mechanics. Digital Extremes really want you to feel like a space ninja with Warframe. Perhaps Warframe's greatest allure is the lack of restrictions many MMO's seem to have taken on as staples. For example, there is no mechanic to explicitly limit the per-day play time of 'free-to-play play'ers, but rather a 4-revive per frame per day mechanic, and players can still continue when these are consumed. This also ties into Warframe's focus as a team game, with up to three other players present in a squad given time to revive you at no cost. In-game items can be purchased with credits (rewarded for normal gameplay) or Platinum (paid for with micro-transactions). Several rare weapons, rare items and cosmetic skins can be obtained through real-time Alerts and Operations, and certain weapons can only be obtained from special 'Void Runs' made possible with keys found during play. A 'Daily Reward' system offers increasingly valuable rewards for consecutive log-ins, and can even provide players with generous discounts on Platinum. Those looking for a 'But...' should be aware that Warframe is still in open-Beta, and still has issues such as the occasional clipping-through-wall trap, as well as some connectivity issues. But these are being discovered and addressed by the very active and actively-monitored community. The growth of the game with each update is obvious, and the developers have regular livestreams to discuss new and upcoming content. Warframe is a brilliant action game that is DEFINITELY worth a look. Just don't choose Loki as your starting Frame.

review: Let's see. We got ninjas, space marines, space zombies, space potatos, farming, space traders/scientists, space explosions, space space, and an update every week. All in all, I'd say it's a pretty good game so long as you put some time in to it. It doesn't have the instant gratification a lot of games do, and that might be a big turn off for people. But the more time you put in to it, the more fun you'll have. Trust me, I'm a space potato farmer.

review: In my opinion the greatest game release in the past two years. In one years time the game size has grown from 1 gig to 6. The game population has grown from 100k to 10 million. The core of the game has snowballed and grown without sacrafice. It is legitimately playable for free; you can beat the game with the starting gear; you can obtain any gear in the game without paying. It looks amazing, has low requirements, is played as coop or competative based on how you want to play. It brings no new concepts that i am able to observe, however it brings concepts together that have never been combined in mass or on this scale. It combines these pieces with a precision and dependability I have never befor encountered. I would go into description of these details but they are to numerous to name, and are best observed by playing the game. If you don't like warframe now, you should check back in one year. As it will have likely doubled the types of human experiences available in that time period. The most impressive game of a age.

review: Warframe is a fast paced F2P game that rewards long time players over buying in-game items. Warframe may seem hard at first to play but the game only gets more easy the longer you stick with it even offering some of the best in-game weapons for free during events (that are more often than you think) and special dates like christmas,easter etc. Warframe has a massive amount of content to explore including frames,weapons and even pets. The way to aquire these items is through collecting materials throughout the solar system and at first glance it would give the impression of too much grinding but it encurages you to explore and seek out new planets and rewards. Warframe does have a paid for currency that allows you to buy nearly anything in the game BUT, what warframe has that others games dont is that you can trade for that currency with rewards you have earned by playing the game. Warframe does have problems though with some of the best content being far to hard to get even for long time players and, balancing on weapons and frames is a very rocky path with some of the best content being reduced to mastery fodder. Overall warframe is not for everyone but is lots of fun to play and is updated every wensday with new content and provides lots of enterainment, its a must play F2P game.

review: All I can say about this one is that I am shocked that a game like this one is Free to Play actually; I can really see myself spending money on this game! However, like any Free to Play game, it is packed full of micro transactions, making it so you can buy the things you want. However, this game seems more generous in that aspect, you can either buy it with real money, or you can keep playing and earn credits in the game to aquire the same things that people would buy with their own cash. The graphics in this game are top notch as well as the overall gameplay. The game has been built so you can experience this game alone or with your friends and random people online who would wish to accompany you on your quests. This game is very much worth looking into if you are in anyway intrested in a futuristic cenario which takes place in space. The game on top of looking good also seems like it is willing to offer a lot of gameplay, both through many planets and objectives through the solar system as well as replayability to either find resources to rebuild your character or just replaying a map as a newly built character. It seems you can build your character to either be a spectre in the shadows, taking enemies out without anyone knowing you were even in the area; or a blood lusting banshee, screaming through and leaving death in your wake. However, if this was too long; one word to sum this game up really, Space Ninjas. Go play it.

review: One of the best games I've ever played. It flows well, the third person camera may be hard for some people to adjust to, but this game would be very hard to play in first person. While it is a bit tough to get started, you gain momentum pretty quickly. There is almost always something new to get or unlock. This game might sound like it is trying too hard with ninja-cyborgs-in-space, but it makes it good. Extremely good 10/10

review: so far i have really like this game. the game play and the customizabilty are awesome. As of right now, the only constructive critizism i have is that when you are in front of an enemy, plainly in thier line of site, they dont see you if you are outside of a 5 meter radius roughly. so the only thing i would change to make it more realistic would change that enemys will engage once you are in thier line of site within a reasonable distance.

review: This game is really fascinating, the graphics, gore and getting to create your character with upgrades with melee weapons and ranged weapons. It's one of the best free-to-play games I have ever played, and I never stop playing it. As you kill more enemies and completing missions on the solar map, your level progresses and once your bar reaches to the next level you have to prove your skills in a training area to go up the next level. Having abilities for example like: Snow Globe, you create a globe with a snow storm inside and when enemies go inside they slow down making it much easier for you to stay alive and kill as much enemies as you can. Also protects you from enemy projectiles coming towards you. Soul Punch to knock your enemy back with one hit (If they're a low level). Terrify to scare your enemies away so you can slaughter them with pleasure :) Melee weapons like: duel blades, duel daggers, long swords, one handed swords, scythes, duel scythes, axes. all for the best of blood and gore. Ranged weapons like: Shotguns, pistols, duel pistols, rifles, sniper rifles, machiene guns, bow and arrows, throwing knifes. Really good fun for sneaky missions and loud party missions too :) Mission types like: Sabotage, when you go to the base core and destroy it leaving no enemies behind. Eliminate, not leaving one single enemy alive. Spy....when you....spy (not good for explaining that lol). Capture, when you capture the enemy and kill enemies in your way to escape. Rescue, to free a prisoner and protect him as you run back to safety. Assassinate, when you kill the enemy boss and his/her guards. But the whole game is really fun and I suggest you give it a try, thanks for reading ^.^

review: Absolutely Brilliant! This game is amazing with awesome gameplay and great mechanics! Also all the weapons and characters that you can buy for real money are also obtainable by gathering resources for the item and crafting it. This makes the the game far from pay to win which i absolutely love. The only real major problem i have with the game is that you can quite often get a very bad host and that makes the game unplayable. But leaving and rejoining that mission fixes it if you get a better host OR host yourself. But all in all it's a great game with a lot of potential and its growing quite fast! It's absolutely worth a try because you get a really great game for no money! That's amazing!! :3

The story isn't the best thing ever but its still engaging and doesnt bore really quick. The controls are smooth as is the fighting. The feeling of chopping a grineer in half or blowing out the side of an enemy never gets old. PLENTY of weapons, upgrades, warframes, abilities, and other intersting things to keep any 3rd person shooter interested in for many hours. Some levels are a bit easy, but it gets tougher. I haven't played a ton of Warframe but out of the 18.2 hours i've played, i've enjoyed all of it. 10/10 would Recommend.

review: Right so let's start this out with a negative, after a big update, avoid this like the plague for a week while they iron out the bugs. Now then for the review: Of all the MMO's i've played both big and small, new and old, Warframe is the most addicting. With all it's constantly updating and increasing features it still remains the most player friendly, fun, and the cheapest "free" to play game on the market, I have spent over a year now playing it, met nice people and joined a terrific clan when it was just created and small, now it's one of the top clans in the game and I enjoy the company of everyone in it. I've fought all the bosses done all the events and even found that my "gotta' catch'em all" mentaulity can easily be achieved with little or no money spent on my part since outside of most cosmetic's EVERYTHING can be gained by just playing the game, and with a good friend or clan, you can get it all in no time and have a blast the whole way through it all from start to finish. So to sum my review up, it has bugs and the storyline is still being made as we all go, and it's an mmo so you'll feel small and lost at the start, but this game is worth playing.

review: You Got Lustful Friends that Loves Co-op MMO'ish ThirdPersonShooter games and Loves spending Hours lustfully grinding/farming items N Stuff?! This game is perfect for you and your friends baby!! I mean its pretty much a hack and slash Space Ninja third person packED co-op MMO'ish TPS series game but it ain't just some mainstream MMO'ish TPS.Its Packed with uniqueness in it,its like a Left4dead in space similar in some ways but with more kinds of enemies,stories,quest as well as you can buy/craft weapons ,colour,skins,customization,modding(In-game weapon/warframe Modifications) and ironmansuits(so called "warframes" which you as a player in an ironmansuits fighting against enemies from different factions around the solar system),etc. Along with amazing combat animations,warframe abilities,parkour,weapon/melee skill combinations and highly detailed graphics,etc.There's also PvP in it which is okay in my opinion it still needs a bit of improvement tho.Aside from that This game is a masterpiece to those who favours Co-operative based games. With that said this game Overall 9.8/10,you should play this game although it might have a bit of bugs in an early stage but still,i truly admire the work of the game developers to create such an amazing game!! Therefore they are TRULY working their 'a''ss off with the next upcoming update ''The Archwing'' which makes it look like gundam later on. So yeah!! have some friends and start playing!!!! what ARE You Waiting For huh!? Gooooooooo!!!! Play!!!!!! Pros- Maneuver Capabilities Fun Graphics Gameplay Weapon/Warframe "Extreme Modification capabilities" Many Combinations A sense of Creative capabilities For players Cons- Bugs(will soon be fixed)~~constant game updates Connection Lag (depending on which player hosts)~~solves by being a host yourself but others might lag if their latancy is crap or your internet. You can also prefer soloing if you're having connection troubles for the time being End-Game Cons: Drop Rates(some are impossible to obtain) Takes time to grind Fixed body shapes for warframes (cant make body shape modifications/adjustments) except colours,Skins,Helmets and warframe accessories Skins only changes the patterns on your warframe which sucks,they should make it like a new body or something(Wished if you can Create your own character inside your warframes Like those in mmorpg's or perhaps able to modify your warframes from head to toe)

review: F2P (Free to play) third person sci-fi shooter. You take control of so-called "warframes", which are basically robots with unique skills, depending on the frame. There are plenty of weapons, going from simple shotguns to mining equipment that uses lasers to cut enemies in half. The game is relying strongly on the player investing his time in farming and grinding resources to create weapons. As with any F2P game, the premium mechanics include a currency that can be bought via ingame-transactions and then spent on new weapons, special gear and cosmetics.

Being a dude who overplayed Warframe and walking around the city might be quite dangerous. Stalker Cop , Harvester Chichuachua or three CoD players who sleep with your mother might get you. I said this game mixed tons of good games? Well, here they are : -Like in DotA 2, on most of Europeans servers you will see "" in chatlog when they die and you don't have time to revive them... -Imagine Crack and Civilization series have sex with each other. Well, this is the result... -Mirror's Edge was one of those parkour games that everyone enjoyed.Faith was able to carry and run with weapons those weighed grams.In Warframe you can also run fast with Gram... which weighs about 100 kg... -This game ain't racist at all, you are just a black, skinny guy, which often steals stuff from dead bodies... -You can see that Earth Planet is occupied by Russians. Why? Because in Soviet Warframe, Earth missions rapes you... To sum up, OP game, never give up if you just can't get Cronus blueprint. 10/10 , would collect 7 dragon balls to play this game without often DDOS attacks.

Well, this is the result... -Mirror's Edge was one of those parkour games that everyone enjoyed.Faith was able to carry and run with weapons those weighed grams.In Warframe you can also run fast with Gram... which weighs about 100 kg... -This game ain't racist at all, you are just a black, skinny guy, which often steals stuff from dead bodies... -You can see that Earth Planet is occupied by Russians. Why? Because in Soviet Warframe, Earth missions rapes you... To sum up, OP game, never give up if you just can't get Cronus blueprint. 10/10 , would collect 7 dragon balls to play this game without often DDOS attacks.

review: Really good looking , a lot of lights and special effects for a free-game. Real money don`t really change anything , just make the game faster for making itens and etc...Good in the theory , but after some time it`s get boring. They make some really nice events , but even with some friends I don`t have pacience to play.

review: Warframe is a form of FPS shooter/close-quarters combat game that is intensly immersive and very well designed between the way combat works and the amazing graphics, there are quite a few classes and you can do many different things from assainations to all out kill everything that moves, you can play with meele or charge around with your guns n stuff SIngle player: Playing alone means less mobs and easier missions all around very fun to do, and sometimes better to play as for certain things Multiplayer: massively amusing and you can play with freinds and just cut down hoards with help Overall i would give this game a 8/10 and would recomend you download it esp since it's free and for a free game this is astounding

review: How can I put this into words... If you took the multiplayer co-op from Mass Effect 3, then gave them three extra years to produce and tune it into a full-fledged multiplayer experience; then, you take that game and force feed it piles of amphetamine and hallucenogenic substances. In it's drunken, ball-tripping state, you then force breed said game with Ninja Gaiden. The resulting spawn from this unholy union of games is: WARFRAME. Tripped-out, beautiful, intense, challenging, strategic, with incredibly well-developed depth, and... fun. Really one of the greatest all-around co-op experiences I've found. Can't recommend this one enough to anyone I've ever gamed with. If I had to balance this review with one caveat, it would be that the game is only marginally "free-to-play". New players are going to be at a severe disadvantage if they're unwilling to drop a bit of cash on it. This doesn't bother me in the least; I'm of the generation that doesn't mind paying someone for their efforts. Especially when the final product is this great. Let me put it this way: I've put a lot more money into much less deserving titles, with much less value to show for it. That's all for now. Do yourselves a favor and check this one out. TL;DR download Warfame

review: As a veteran with 1100 hours of playing this game, I simply don't recommend this. This is nothing but a grindfest and the devs have repeatedly acknowledged about this but nothing has changed to lessen the grind. Every time they say that they are working on reducing grind, they put in another grindwall which always bigger than the previous one. Here is a quote from a veteran who had already quited the game just like me:

Up to 4 player Co-op in an intense 3rd person PvE action game. And its all free!

review: This game is a highly addicting game. As you progress onwards into the game this F2P game becomes more and more P2P with the fact that you will realize that you do not want to spend another week farming the same one type of enemy, boss, or mission to get that item that you want. It becomes very repetitive very fast. If you like losing money and wasting your time or love grinding for 8 hours every day for 3 weeks just to get one upgrade, part, or item, then this game is for you! If you are not a crazy person who wants to play this game then here are some other suggested factors that will soon come into play once you embark on this horrific adventure... : You will start to loose free time in your day :You will start paying for a F2P game : You start to shrug off friends to play a computer game :You start to become an isolationist : You start getting in arguments with your wife :You get a divorce with your wife :You skip your court date to ensure that you get to ever see your kids : you block out all interactions with the outside world: You forget to pay your bills : You loose your car : You forget to pay for your house loan : you loose your house : You then revert to public libraries and coffe shops to set up your computer in : you get kicked out of coffe shops and libraries : You still go back to coffe shop and libraries : you get your computer confiscated :You then sleep out side inside a tree hut : You think you are a space ninja and practice jumping and running from tree to tree : You fall and break your legs : You goto hospital : You sneak on hospital computer during the night to play Warframe : You are then sedated by security gaurd : You wake up in jail : You remember that you couldnt pay medical bills : You can't resist the urge to play Warframe so you try to escape from jail as a Space ninja : a man on Meth helps you escape : you get out and then buy Meth from that man : you are now addicted to meth : You think you are a real space ninja : You jump from car to car : You then jump from bridge to car : You are on meth so you dont realize that the car is moving : You get hit by the car : You loose all Limbs : You cant play Warframe or be a space ninja : You revert to eating dirt to stay alive : You then get pissed on by a homeless man who is on meth : You realize that you are now below a man that is on meth : A giant Eagle picks you up : You are then carried to the Eagles nest : You then are eaten alive : Then you are puked back up by the Eagle : You then are given to the baby Eagles as food................ Don't Be A Limbless Man Who Has Had Their Life Ruined By WarFrame..... UNINSTALL OR DELETE ALL TRACES OF WARFRAME NOW AND SAVE YOUR SELF BEFORE THE METH KICKS IN!!!

review: This game is basically about grinding for new ''cool'' stuff. There is not much motivation to make you complete missions other than to level up, and grind your gears. The events are pretty fun, since then there is stuff to do, like... a quest or a good mission. Other than that, this game falls flat. Not because of the bugs or glitches, but because of the lack of entertaintment, unless you liek grinding alot for stuff and look cool.

review: This game is one of the largest wastes of time you could invest in. Despite the fact that the sci-fi elements are intriguing, and promise a feeling of exploration and satisfaction, it satiates neither thirst. The game instead reduces the player to hacking and slashing, or firing guns blazing at hordes of faceless and uninspired 3D models, that don't deserve the title of enemy. They run and shoot towards you blindly, almost as blindly as you attack them, to an insignificant goal. Your rewards are next to none, assuming you don't invest over 150 hours a week (in which case this game may satisfy your urge for bland weaponry). If you so desire either weapons or new "warframe" suits, then you must resort to dedicating your career to this abomination or you must purchase the over-priced "platinum" currency. "For only $15 USD this single weapon could be yours!" is a paraphrase of their store's radio jingle. If you desire a pitfall in your life, then by all means sacrifice your wife and child's well-being to grind for that new "warframe" suit, but if not, don't subject yourself to the boredom and microtransactions.

review: I was only thirteen years old, I loved warframe so much. I had all the Weapons and Frames. I prayed to Warframe every night before bed thanking it for the life I have been given. "Warframe is love" I say, "Warframe is life." My dad hears me and calls me a . I knew he was just jealous of my devotion to Warframe. I called him a . He slaps me and sends me to go to sleep. I'm crying now and my face hurts. I lay in bed, it's really cold. A warmth is moving towards me... I feel something touch me... It's Rhino! I'm so happy. He is my favourite Warframe He whispers in my ear "This is my ship." He grabs me with his powerful hands, and puts me on my hands and knees. I'm ready. I spread my keyboard and mouse for Rhino. He penetrates my TV screen. It hurts so much, but I do it for Rhino. I can feel my screen cracking and my eyes start to water. I push against his Iron skin and armour, I want to please Rhino. He roars a mighty roar as he fills my screen with love. My dad walks in. Rhino looks him straight in the eye and says, "It's all Broken now." Rhino leaves through my window. Rhino is love. Rhino is life <3 10/10 Ruined my life

review: Hey there, Tenno! Looks like you're interested in playing Warframe. Maybe its sleek character designs and world aesthetics that ring equal parts Japanese sentai ranger/tokusatsu superhero and Western science fiction caught your eye. Or maybe the promise of an invigorating third-person shooter experience meshed with light RPG progression elements got your attention. If you enjoy: - Endless grindwalls and microtransaction temptations at every meaningful gameplay decision - A vacuum of engaging content beneath those grindwalls - Undocumented stealth nerfs and obfuscating excuses for these changes by developers - Unfinished projects explained away by the promise that these features will be fixed "at some point in the future" - A lack of transparency between developers and players - A clear lack of direction for exactly what the game wants to accomplish - Game developers who constantly run away from their mounting self-created problems Then you will probably like Warframe. Enjoy your stay. If not, I would suggest playing another game.

review: Ok, Pros: Fast paced shooting mechanics, decent sword mechanics. Good mobility, customization not that good but workable. Teamwork, can still play solo however. And a stealth and free-run mechanic. Nvidia graphics and Physics! Cons: You will NEVER get into PvP becuase of "Your inventory ### doesn't meet the requirements." Unfair, if not almost cheating AI. Cash store always dangled in front of your face. When the game adds a new playable Warframe, it feels like "YOU MUST PAY." in order to play it. Feels unrewarding. Buggy beyond beleif, but that's because its an MMO. Near impossible to join a guild/clan. Notorius time waster. Lotus voice. Overall: I enjoyed this game for a few days, but between DRM, lack of commmunication with other players, and cash store ads. I reached my Pain; enjoyment thresh hold. It just seems like a time waster, and you never feel like you accomplish anything, unless you sink in $$$ of course. If you need to waste a few hours go ahead, but it just felt to as if there was no point to doing ALL of the same repeating missions OVER AND OVER again. It's up to you.

review: Set in the far reaches of outer space during a new Dark Age, WARFRAME introduces the Tenno, a race on the brink of extinction after being enslaved by the Grineer for centuries. Players enter WARFRAME on the cusp of the Grineer's victory over the Tenno until they begin to arm themselves with WARFRAMES - an ancient exo-skeletal technology only they can operate. Hidden within the Orokin Derelicts of a lost civilization, new WARFRAMES lie dormant and undiscovered. These artifacts are the Tenno's only hope for survival. With the lack of a Pay to Win system and easy engagement for new players, Warframe offers some quality time. As a free-to-play game, Warframe is a nice surprise that sets the base for a promising future. Warframe isn't anything special. It's not revolutionary, exceptional or timeless. Still - every time I returned to the game, it kept playing for at least an hour (without regret). Digital Extremes has made an enjoyable, engrossing, spectacular game. Especially, when you find yourself a team or - even better - invite some friends. If you need a new opportunity to slaughter aliens, you should try Warframe.

review: Let's get one thing perfectly clear: The trailer for this game lies. It does not actually represent the gameplay accurately, and this is turning away many who would otherwise greatly enjoy it. Here's what the game is actually about: You, and up to three of your companions, in high-grade military light power armor, insert into a space station or groundside base (that is procedurally generated!) with an objective. You are outnumbered. You are outgunned. You are in unfamiliar terrain. Accomplish your objective by any means neccessary. Good luck.

review: Warframe is a very well made free to play 3rd person PVE co-op action game, set in a futuristic version of our solar system. Currently in beta and it has been for more than a year but do not let that put you off, this game deserves at least a moment of your time. You take control of a Tenno, a member of a mysterious race of long forgotten warriors. The name Warframe refers to the suits of exo-armour used by the Tenno in battle. The idea for Warframe grew from a 2008 game by Digital Extremes, Dark Sector. The two games share the same universe and there is some evidence to support the theory that Dark Sector's protagonist is still alive in some form in Warframe's far future. Missions in Warframe come in several flavours; extermination, survival, defence and boss battles are just a few of the challenges you can expect to face. The levels are procedural generated from tile sets so even if the same level is played repeatedly there will be map variations every time. Although PVP does exist in the game (conclave and a duelling room) the main focus is PVE, 4 player squads versus all this grim future has to throw at them. There is so much content in this game, I'm only going to scratch the surface. Customisation is vast and varied with new content added frequently. All the standard guns you would expect are here, assault rifles, pistols, shotguns, sniper rifles and much more. Bows, bizarre energy weapons, flame throwers and a huge amount of melee choices. Weapons and frames can be modded too, need more health and shields? No problem, apply the mods to your frame and then level them up for more health and shields. There are hundreds of mod cards to boost or add stats, elemental damage mods can be mixed to create different effects and a refined melee combat system has been added recently. There is no shortage of customisation in the looks department either, colour palettes, alternate helmets, badges, skins and a tonne of accessories. Looking good in Warframe does come with a real world cost, most of the cosmetic upgrades will require you to buy platinum. Of course Warframes are different beyond their appearance, each frame has 4 special powers bound to it, these range from direct attacks to team heals, mind control to invisibility, team buffs and enemy de-buffs. The list goes on and on. Each Warframe has different base stats. All frames can run, slide, jump and wall-run. There are plenty of hidden areas and shortcuts that can only be accessed by chaining together jumps and wall-runs. The graphics look great and really come alive during combat. Environments range from murky swamps to the divine radiance of the Void. The soundtrack and sound effects are also of a high standard, weapons sound like they look and feel. The drum heavy ost helps to keep the action pounding along and that first 10 seconds of music on the login screen will always make me think of the Terminator theme, another plus for WF. Character animations are fluid, character physics are a bit floaty. I have seen the handling of Warframes compared to "steering a boat" but personally I've never had a problem with it and the at times Wile E Coyote like momentum. There are downsides too, this game is a time sink and the only way to avoid those long hours spent grinding is your money, buy some plat and get that stuff instantly. Loads of my friends have quit playing when they find out about the 12hr wait on the parts needed to build a new Warframe then the 3 day build time on the actual Warframe. Again this has never been a big issue for me. I could easily keep going for another 700 words, more pros and cons, explain more about the game and expand on those points I've mentioned but this is the bottom line. Warframe is a fantastic game that has done nothing but improve in the time I've played it.

review: An excellent little gem of an MMO, this Free-to-Play has no point that demands you to enter PvP or cough up for some premium currency, though, both are an option. This is only further complimented by the mix of platformer and third-person shooter that's balanced just right. The only reasons you could hate this game would be if you couldn't stand the lore, or simply don't like the game's composition. There are sections that cater to every level of skill, and force nobody to stay within or go beyond them. Get into Warframe, but bring friends if you want a crew to work with you for more than one or two missions.

review: This is what happens when you marry the excitement of the Mass Effect Trilogy to the Gears of War Franchise, you would have Warframe. If you enjoy both those games, the visuals of Mass Effect, and all it's Sci-Fi goodies, and just want hords of baddies coming at you. Get this game.

review: I went into Warframe thinking it'd just be another ORION: Dino Horde. ...After about 6 hours of nonstop gameplay, a lack of a need to purchase in-game items with real money, jumping into bulletfest after bulletfest, and an utter addiction to being a proper freakin' gun-and-sword-weilding space ninja, I said otherwise.

review: This game is proof that the whole 30/60fps debacle is utter . This game is just one frame, a warframe, and it still looks really good. It's obvious that fps is completely irrelevant to the smoothness of the visuals in a game. Just one frame is enough to make a game look and run smoothly.

review: Free to play game with a large and unexpectedly nice community. This game is good for people who have been looking for an alternative to the multiplayer of Mass Effect 3. Just worthy of note that the game has an extended grind once you get into the mid-to-late game. Also noteworthy is that melee is not as gratifying as other games in the MMORPG scope. Gory, yes, but repetitive after going through all the different animation sets available for melees currently in the game.

review: I downright LOVE this game! It's chaotic fast action with space ninjas! Play however you want with a wide variety of weapons and abilities, which you can then further customise with mods (add-ons to your weaponry and Warframes that add effects such as increased stamina or fire damage). Honestly one of the best free-to-play games on Steam, AND IT'S STILL IN BETA. However, I do recommend a decent computer.
game-hours: 209.9
review: You're a space ninja with an obsession for grinding, you grind for more space ninjas and space ninja weapons so you can grind for better grinding weapons, the end game consists of trying to grind the hardest and surviving literal hours against waves of increasingly more difficult versions of enemies you've fought before, possibly over thousands of times before. I've lost control of my life/10
game-hours: 337.8
review: Great game with a unique aesthetic, frequent content updates, and fun combat. Unfortunately, the lack of an overall story or objective tends to make it feel like an endless grinding simulator. If you can look past that, Warframe will provide hours upon hours of free entertainment. It's a good game to kill time and have stupid fun.

review: Let me be clear: Warframe is not a free to play game. It isn't. It says it is on the tin, and you can download, install, run, and play the game without paying a dime, but if you like the game and continue to play, you will pay. This makes the game more of a free demo with a flexible spending model. The premium currency is not inexpensive, and while everything gameplay-related can be made just through play, the time to grind and craft the mats is somewhat prohibitive. What makes the game less free to play is that weapon and character slots are severely limited and can only be unlocked through premium currency. Don't get me wrong, I still recommend the game. Even if you only play it a little bit and put it down. Four player coop through semi-random levels with a few diverse mission types. It's fun, if a little repetitive. Okay, after a while it gets damn repetitive when you know the layout of each individual block the level is made of and you're tired of your Warframe or weapon choice but can't even spend the time to grind for new ones because you don't have any more slots available so your only option is to delete one you already own which not only requires you to buy/craft it again if you want it back but also resets the level on it. I like this game, I do, even though it gets repetitive, but I don't want people going in to this thinking they aren't going to pay. I've already shelled out at least 20-30$ on this thing, and if I keep playing I'll wind up shelling out more. It's a pay-as-you-go and pay-if-you-want style game. If not being able to unlock everything through enough play time bothers you, this will drive you nuts. If you're willing to shell out occasionally because you like the game and think it is worth an amount of money from you, you might be okay. If you have problems with impulse control and have to have everything gameplay related, well... this'll be rough on your wallet.

review: Warframe is a co-op thirdperson action shooter. The player is given a nice variety of weapons they can work towards, though knew warframes will be what you spend most of your time working for. This is as this is a very heavily grind based game, and you will revisit the same missions over and over, depending on what you need to make your next item. The acrobatic mechanics add a very nice ascpect to the combat, allowing flips and wallruns. All of this is very nice, but in the games current state it lacks variety in enemy an missions, an the lore, which seems very nice, is given to you very lightly, leaving the best part of the game obfuscated. Warframe -7/10 Good! What is "Stalker?"

review: One of the most interesting projects of 2013 that flowed into 2014 that I've seen. The game has all what a gamer needs. Guns, fancy karate gimmicks, swords. Two words: Space Ninjas. What is actually good that the game even tho is F2P but it does not follow a shadowy P2W path. You might be confused in the beggining, as getting the stuff, crafting, locations and controls. But when you get over it, you might as well like it. Another aspect that drives the attention. Constant new content updates from very friendly Developers. I might add that DEVs do take in considiration players ideas and implement ideas and throughts into a real thing. Almost all the stuff ingame can be aqquired just by playing the game, you just need to get over the beggining. BUT this game is still in beta. There could be bugs, there could be flaws. Currently DEVs implement tons of content every two months (aprox). In general this is a game that you might totally like or just play for two minutes and uninstall. Playing with friends is recomended.

review: With no doubt, one of the best F2P games. First of all it is actually free, meaning, everything in the game is obtainable without spending a single penny thanks to the in-game trading system.

review: This is one of those rare games that isn't addictive because you're grinding for the best gear, or hunting achievements, or any of the other conventional gameplay gimmicks; it's addictive because simply playing the game is so damn fun. The gunplay and swordplay, mixed with fluid parkour-style movement around the maps, makes the action in this game very dynamic. You'll want to log in and bash baddies not because you need materials to make that new gun (although that's also a worthy goal)... you'll want to log in because playing the game is like living out your own personal sci-fi action movie. With ninjas. In space. Space ninjas. Almost forgot to put that part in here.

review: Before you read into this review, let me ask you one question. Do you think fun is the most important thing in any game? If you answered yes, stick around and keep reading. If you answered no, you probably wouldn't like Warframe. Warframe gets a lot of flak for being repetative, but I personally feel that the reviewers who complain about the gameplay being repetative are failing to see the bigger picture. Warframe is not about a deep, gripping narrartive or memorable characters, it's about action, fun, and pretty crazy weapon variety. Warframe is a very specialized game, focused on action, flare, and fun. And boy oh boy does Warframe nail action and fun. With over a dozen unique Warframes(Powersuits used by the player, each with their own unique abilities and stats) to choose from you're sure to find one that you really enjoy playing as. And then there's the weapons. Oh boy, the weapons. This game has almost every kind of Sci-Fi weapon I can think of. We have small scale particle cannons, Beefy sniper rifles, plasma casters, living weapons that shoot everything from Electricity to streams of deadly viruses, an insanely powerful rocket launcher, a Grenade launcher with remote detonation, powerful bows, a gun that shoots spinning saw blades, and of course the obligatory pew-pew assualt rifles to ease new players into the experience. Oh, but that's just the Primaries. In every mission, you will have the option to carry a Primary, a Secondary, and a Melee but you can choose to carry only 1 or 2 if you please. The Secondaries include but are not limited to: Living weapons that shoot Corrosive darts and poison gas, a goo gun that shoots sticky globs of acid that eat right through armor, 2 deadly hand cannons, one of which shoots many metal balls in a shotgun spread while the other shoots a spread of radiation blasts, Miniature plasma casters, rapid fire dual pistols, a spread-rocket launcher that they somehow compressed into the size of a pistol, a pistol that shoots bolts that can pin enemies to walls, deadly and accurate burst fire pistols, pocket snipers, Revolvers, a Lever action beast, Throwing knives, Throwing stars, and a Standard semi-auto pistol to ease new players in. And then there's my favorite weapon class, the Melee. We've got Greatswords that can hit numerous enemies in a wide arc, more conservative longswords that swing fast and allow better mobility while attacking, Dual daggers which generate an incredibly fast flurry of slashes and stabs, whips for when you want the range of a greatsword but the mobility of a longsword, there's also the polearms, Heavy axes, Heavy hammers, ROCKET HAMMER, and even the Thrown melee weapons, useful for killing at a distance while conserving ammo and for stealth kills. More recently Digital Extremes added in 2 Katanas and a set of claws that pop out of your arms like Wolverine. Melee has become much more prominent lately now that DE has completely revamped it. No longer do you simply mash or hold E, now you can perform different combos that require different inputs. These combos are assigned to stance mods that you can apply to your weapon. Each melee weapon class I mentioned above has at least 1 stance mod, and each mod comes with it's own unique combos that are useful for different purposes and situations. My favorites are the Katanas with Decisive Judgement as the stance. I use it to make my tenno look and fight like Vergil from Devil May Cry 3. So yes, Warframe can seem repetative to some people, but not to me. I greatly enjoy the vast arsenal that is placed before me, and I truly believe that these tools of destruction make up for the lack of deep narrative. That said, I thoroughly recommend Warframe to anyone who likes Shooters or character action games, or anyone who likes having fun. It's a game about space ninjas destroying space nazis and futuristic EA representatives. I don't think I need to say any more here.

review: The game is great , one of the best Free to play games I've ever played - only played 123 hours so far. The amount of grinding that needs to be done and missions to complete of different difficulties makes it so that the player can never say "i've done everything" without properly playing the game for hours upons hours. A good selection of warframes (different characters basically) to make and use. Missions like survival make it fun to play with friends for a long period of time and with so much bosses and items to collect one can not be bored. I'll give this a 8/10 due to the fact that I haven't tried the PVP nor have I ventured deep enough in the game (i.e. the HIGHIEST missions) to give a full review. I'll mostly give this a 9 after venturing further and maybe a 10 once i get in to the PVP and so fourth. Also there are many glitches and beta issues that pop up from time to time, for example people getting disconnected as soon as a game starts / people getting kicked from the party at "extraction" and so fourth. But Overall for a BETA - this game is pretty awesome. So 8/10 for now and it can only get better in my opinion, TRY IT OUT!

The arsenal well more than makes up for the repetitiveness, and the combat system In my opinion is well designed. they continue to update Warframe on a monthly basis (one major update a month), and they recently added player ships, Kurbrows, which are basically our equal of dogs, a new Warframe, dual machine pistols similar to the Russian Micro Uzis, and last update they added Katanas (Nikanas). I cannot wait to see what DE comes up with next. well done. -9.5/10

Many players has given it the nickname grindframe as you have to grind for materials to build big and beter equipmnet; but it gets beter and more fun as you play.

review: This is a grindy f2p game, so if you don't like to grind, then you should turn back. You can buy the weapons and Warframes you want right from the start (excluding the primes) if you're willing to dish out the cash, or you can buy them with the platinum you can get by trading items in-game. I worked my way up to rank 14 by grinding, and the feeling of accomplishment is worth it. Anyways, the game might get boring once you get to rank 8 and above, cause they don't really have many weapons that are unlocked with high ranks, so basically, when you reach rank 6, you'll be able to get the end-game stuff. The game is constantly updating with hotfixes or new content every week to keep the game from feeling too boring. I would like it if they added newer game modes, which they have done a couple of times before, so it is expected that they will bring more later on. The community is bustling, and you can make clans and alliances. I like being able to edit your own dojo, but once again, that gets boring after a while, and also takes a LOT of Forma, this resource in game that can only be grinded after you grind for keys, and it's not like you get Forma a lot. Anyways, besides the tedious grinding, it adds to the experience, unless you're really far into the game, otherwise, it might feel more like a hinderance. Loyalty to the game is also rewarded for logging in every day, and you get stuff like weapons you can only unlock from the daily rewards, and also discounts on platinum. Loyalty is also rewarded if you check the updates or site often, cause they usually put up these events with exclusive rewards that you can only get by doing the missions. Newer players may have missed many vandal weapons, but there are other weapons that are better than them in-game, so you're not missing out much. The only things that you may be missing out on are the exclusive mods from the events, where they could go for 100+ platinum in a trade. If you want to get stuff like this, just be sure to check the site occasionally. I highly recommend the game, it's fun. The community is pretty good, but once in a while, you may run into a troll or show-off, so yeah. Anyways, I hope this review was helpful.

review: What more is there to do than recommend this game? First of all, it's free to play. This means you don't have to pay money to play it. It does not mean it will run like those flash-games that represented what was free to play just 5 years ago. (Although free to play used in the manner as it is used in Warframe it means you can play without paying, but paying could make the experience better. Nonetheless, as a non-paying user, I think for myself that it plays just fine for free.) Warframe's looks are equal to or better than most AAA releases and the gameplay is likewise. It might take more than a few hours of playing it to understand how to work it properly, and it doesn't always tell you excactly how to pull off every move, but this also leaves a lot of room for experimentation, which I think is one of the points where this game shines rather brightly. If you like ninjas, sci-fi, shooters, stealth actions or slashers, Warframe is likely to hit you in at least one good spot.

review: Now Warframe is a special type of game: its about you and the so called Teno. The Teno is a high technological grupe thats like assassins and guardians. They are all master of parcur. The nice thing about this game is that nomatter what your into there is usually somthing you will like. Fighting: There are plenty of maps to play and there is wave maps if you get board. Builder: You can get a clan and if you have a clan you can get a clan dojo which is this giant space ship you can build rooms in. Supporter: You can gather recorses to build on your dojo or make wepons and warframes. The downside is that when you have picked your first warframe(playermodle) you cant change it unless you buy a blueprint and make a new one or buy it for platinium. also the level decine is annoying becaus its the same goddame thing your running through the first 4-7 maps. But else then that the game is great and if you got friends you got a epic team.

review: I was a bit cautious about playing this game because I was afraid it would be Pay-to-Win.. But is actually possible to get everything in the game through standard gameplay. Weapon Mods, Parts, and Blueprints can be sold to other players in exchange for Platinum (the premium currency). The game is very fun to play, and there are Guns and Warframes (essentially characters) to accomodate just about any playstyle, whether you enjoy sniping from afar while cloaking yourself and sneaking around, running around shooting lightning from your ****ing hands, using magnetism to crush your enemies into oblivion, running in guns blazing and raising hell, getting up close and personal with your enemies and ripping them to pieces with one of the many, many melee weapons. Weapons, Warframes, and Sentinels can be built, leveled up, and modded with special abilities and perks with a surprising amount of customizability. All in all this game is very, very fun and I would highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys playing Third-Person Shooters with online co-op. The community seems generally nice and willing to help out new players from what i've experienced.

review: Seriously: The only f2p title that ever kept my attention. First I thought: "Ugh, another 'pay to win' title" and worse, being kind of a Mass Effect ripoff. Then: Hey, whatever it is, its fun!!! It is tremendous fun. I like the fact that it is only PvE and PvP doesn't factor in at all. Most of the community is nice and fun, even if there are some di**s around, so even playing with random people is fun. Playing with friends is the best.

review: As I near my near my 200th hour in warframe, I still consider this one of the best games I have sunken my time into. MMO's are sort of my thing, I have played hundereds of hours in many diffrent games, and Warframe is by far the best I have played. Part of what makes it even more increadible is that they are still olny in Beta. I have been around since alpha, roughly patch 9.0 and I have been impressed with every minute. I love the feel of the game, the weapon system, the seemless incooperation of melee weapons, and especially the movement system. I alos appreciate that as a free to play, they have a live pay market, but that they have managed to make it possible to earn or craft nearlly anything in the game, making it not pay to win. As it stands I consider this one of the best Sci-fi games on the market, one of the best MMO's, and by far the best F2P MMo. It is especially great if you enjoy small group multiplayer, friend olny squads, and resource based crafting. While it currently lakes in story, hopefully to be fixed soon, it makes up for it in shear quality of game mechanics. I rate this roughly an 8.75 to 9.5

review: Plays like most FPS with smooth graphics and more coop missions. Few real solo-only mission so ban open upmost any map to let others spawn into you game and work as assault teams. Custom mods allow for a lot of variety (from weapon upgrades to cosmetics). Like many other games this can quickly go pay-to-win, however it is not required if you want to go slower and enjoy the experience as free-to play. Very pretty and fast graphics.

review: Easily one of the best looking free to play games on the market which is also not pay to win. On the other hand, this game is nothing but grinding. It is literally a grinding simulator at this point where you grind for resources to build equipment to more efficiently get more resources. It has gotten better, however, with added features and interesting ways to grind added since I last played several months back, with even more, even sexier grinding machines (Warframes) now. If you love grinding, this game is definitely for you. I personally like fun grinding. The game is supposedly in beta right now and I am quite interested to see what directions the developers are taking it.

review: This is my favorite free to play game of all time. Actually, this is my favorite game of all time. Not a "pay to win" and the game has come A LONG way from when I started playing back in June 2013 as the game is constantly being updated with new warframes, weapons and cool features (plus bug fixes!). I was initially drawn in to the ability to jump kick your enemy in the face and perform a finishing move; this is still my favorite manuever. Grab some friends jump in - it's free!

review: Sci-fi online shooter/slasher, oriented on cooperative gameplay. Missions with varied difficulty, assasination/espionage missions, various abilities to improve your character and weaponry (as well as levelling system for both your character and each weapon you use). Free-to-play, though you gonna pay some real money for some classy weaponry and characters, though it's totally okay to level up your starter set of weapons and your first character to a state of a kickass killing machine without no money spent at all! Not to mention crafting system - do missions on specified regions, collect resourses and make these weaponry and chars by yourself for free (and in-game funds). Good luck, have fun!

review: Okay, so Warframe...What to say... Well first off, its a fun progressive game. More you progress the better you can play... With this being said It isnt in the slightest like other games that do the same deal. Warframes combat and just just overall friendly feel will keep you coming back. As many times as Ive tried to take a break from it, it ALWAYS managed to pull me back in. The community in-game is amazing...Most helpful bunch youll ever meet. Overall its an extremely addictive game, and vets might aswell connect your warframe to Steam for the free acheivements. Its definately worth it, I debated it for a bit but finally broke down and Did so. The game lately is going through some awesome changes, With a new melee system, New damage system and above all the new GUI and Upgrades to what the games been for awhile! Events that give you some neat and pretty powerful gear, Voids can grant you the power of an ancient race of beings through weapons and Frames. Unlike alot of FTP games it isnt P2W. Everything can be earned in game with time played. YEs there is a transaction option for people with less time and those who want to overall just support the devs. Need I say more? I possibly can't without writing a would be book! Try it for yourself, its constantly updated with new gooodies. Go on, download it :)

I recommend spending enough time to create your own "Warframe" after running through the tutorial to get a feel of all the customization available. This is one of my favorite games, with a great matchmaking system, good loading times and cinematics, as well as skins and colors available for purchase if you want to personalize your Tenno even more.

review: I've played this game more than any other Free to Play game. The reason is: It gets you into the action immediately Everything is free aside from weapon/warframe slots and Orokin Reactors and Catalysts and purely cosmetic stuff. It looks beautiful Great weapon variety Great playstyle variety Fast Paced action and quick loading times Decent enough community to help you when you need it There are a few issues you should know about: The game is a bit buggy and sometimes will crash (Doesn't happen very often) Anyone who is not a hardcore gamer will be turned off by the large amounts of repetitive gameplay and grind. The game is a bit on the easy side and whatever isn't easy is usually cheap. There's no real balance of difficulty Your favorite weapons or warframes might (or already have been) nerfed to the ground making them almost useless Overall I enjoy the game though and recommend it

And-- all the good stuff in the game can be researched and built by you. The only thing you 'have' to have real money for, is cosmetics, and extra 'hanger' slots if you can't bear to sell back old weapons. TLDR: It's Chinese Space Ninjas in Space. Flipping out, cutting people's heads off, and being awesome.

review: I went into Warframe thinking it'd just be another ORION: Dino Horde. ...After about 6 hours of nonstop gameplay, a lack of a need to purchase in-game items with real money, jumping into bulletfest after bulletfest, and an utter addiction to being a proper freakin' gun-and-sword-weilding space ninja, I said otherwise.
game-hours: 311.2
review: A surprisingly fun game. The combat is fluid and intuitive. The pay shop is essentially unnecessary as the different "frames"(characters) can be unlocked with a little bit of play time. Even so the need to play as a different character doesn't overly change the experience because gear progression is persistent between classes. Ignore the preconceived Free-To-Play stigma and just give the game a decent shot. Teaming up in 4 man missions to defend and objective, exterminate a level, or just survive is reminiscent of the fun had while playing Killing Floor, but in 3rd person, with ninjas, and a bunch of different guns, and powers.... OK its nothing like Killing Floor but its a hell of a lot a fun and it costs nothing to give it a try. Some good quotes from the Goons forum: "What is this game? Warframe is a free-to-play co-op third-person shooter with some melee combat and loot-collection elements set in the far, far future where you play as an eyeless, mute space ninja (here, have some lore). Gameplay comparisons tend to gravitate to Mass Effect 3's multiplayer and Hellgate: London. Major features of the game include procedurally generated levels, fast action with a focus on mobility and looking like the badass space ninja you are, as well as a fairly sane F2P model which generally doesn't make you want to recoil in horror (crazy, I know). The game is currently out on the PC (via the official website and Steam) and PlayStation 4 (via PSN). Warframe's developer is Digital Extremes, previously known for their work co-developing the Unreal series alongside Epic. More recent titles have been somewhat less illustrious, mostly helping with console ports of Unreal-engine titles such as Bioshock and developing multiplayer components of various other titles. Their proprietary Evolution Engine was developed during this time and has been used in Dark Sector, the Darkness II, and now Warframe. ... GAMEPLAY ========================= Warframe is a fast-paced over-the-shoulder 4-player shooter with an added emphasis on melee attacks. Every player is equipped with primary and secondary weapons, as well as a melee weapon. Each class, or Warframe, has up to four useable skills that are unlocked as your character levels up. Your weapons also level up independently of your frame and can be sold for credits or used freely on another frame you own. As you progress with your weapons and frame of choice, you'll gain the ability to customize both for added effectiveness and cosmetic taste. In general, your missions are to invade a ship or outpost to perform a certain task, then escape once that objective is completed. .... ========================= Monetization: No, you don't really need to spend money on the game ========================= Free to play, more like free to pa- oh wait no, never mind. Seriously, though, you don't. Nothing with a direct impact on gameplay (now literally nothing, since you can get plat through the trade system) requires you to spend real money on it, though doing so may prove very convenient. If you end up liking the game and playing for a while you may want to drop a few bucks to get some extra frame and/or weapon slots (you start with 2 slots for frames and 8 for weapons), but aside from that, you can grind out most of the non-cosmetic stuff. If you want to spend money on the game but are on a limited budget, coupons for discounted platinum ranging from 20%, 50%, or 75% off will occasionally show up as a login reward, and promo codes occasionally pop up for sale. If you have spare rare mods/prime parts that are in demand, you can also fleece pubbies of their plat through the trade system. And by spending intelligently, a little platinum can go a long way. Don't be fooled by the prices of weapons and frames in the market, the stuff you'd want to spend money on is actually quite reasonably priced!

review: Warframe, an amazing third person game which would be pretty accurate to say is the epitome of robot ninjas, which in turn, makes this game extremely fun to play. Besides the repetition of levels and the occasional glitches, this game has everything pretty much down pat, from awesome graphics to a solid fighting system which makes this game even better to play, and its all for free!! So I highly recommend adding this game to your library, and you will get quite a few hours of entertaining moments out of it.

review: Warframe is not only my favourite game of all time but it is also a game where legends are born my friends, let me explain why. This game is where patience and dedication is needed because most of the time you will need to gather resources to build the weapons and characters which suit your play style. How this game works is that you the player must travel across the galaxy and battle against the three main fractions which are constantly fighting each other and you. You the player are known as Tenno who are this BADASS super race which existed in the past generation and have just awaked from a deep sleep. From here you fight enemies and gather different resources to build your equipment to use depending on the enemies your are against. There is a HUGE verity of weapons which are never ending because as we speak more weapons are coming out, you have three different weapons at your disposal. The main weapon, your secondary weapon and your melee weapon. I can sit here all day and go in GREAT DETAIL but that would take forever, let's just say the combat system is so in-depth its like sitting a science exam, ITS SO INDEPTH. The weapons you have are insane, we're talking cannons, laser rifles, swords, axes, scythes, gauntlets, rocket launchers and even weapons made from the flesh of your enemies (I'm serious). There are so MANY weapons in this game there is something for everyone...even cowboys. But I'll be honest here the main thing to make this game shine is time...allot of your time. As I've already said you need to gather resources to craft your weapons. Different planets have different resources so you will have to farm for your equipment. So if you thing you can go all badass right at the start YOUR WRONG! This is not that type of game. If you don't spend time gathering resources then this game is not for you. If you're not nice to the game, the game will piss you off and trust me. It's very easy to get pissed off with this game. As long as you are patient enough you will start to get the ropes of the game and you will be smiling the whole time. There are different mission in the game to add some verity like capture mission, exterminations and defence so you won't get board anytime soon with just one type of game mode. And this game had events that appear from time to time which reward the player which especial and unique rewards for completing the mission. For this reason you will be constantly be login to the game to see if anything special comes up. You can play with three other people friends or no so you always have someone covering your back but the option is there to play alone but I wouldn't recommend it. If your liking this stuff so far then it gets WAY better. You can craft different types of character you can play as which are called Warframe, that's where the title comes from. Warframe have special abilities they can use in battle to change things up. One Warframe controls fire while another controls ice. Once can controls the minds of their opponents and one can even raise the dead to fight for you. The characters are AWSOME and have so much unique play style you will never bet board. Through the game you will collect pickups known as 'mods'. These mods drastically change the gameplay in Warframe, they can be used to upgrade your Warframe and your weapons. Upgrades like more damage or more health. There are HUGE amounts of mods in this game so you can customise your Warframe and weapons to suit your play style. SPEAKING OF CUSTOMISATION! You can change the colours and appearances of your weapons and characters so you can SWAG your way thought the universe in style. For those who are interested in the setting of the game its defiantly interesting. It's a sci-fi universe but there is just something about playing as the Warframe who are pretty much GODS which gives this game a really different feeling. The graphics are top quality and the soundtracks are solid. IT DOSN'T END THERE! You can also create a clan for your friends which you can trade and make deals with, or even fight against each other to see who's the strongest. Clans can even make alliances with other clans and best of all. Clans can claim part of the galaxies by participating in missions knows as 'dark sectors'. This is where the higher level players play at. Completing and conquering the dark sector means your clans symbol will be displayed to all other player to show that your clan is one of the best. There is so much more to talk about but for the sake of my hands and your interest I'll just stop right here. This game is never ending and is constantly being updated and fixed with patches which also give new weapons and characters to play as its endless. Give this game a try, there is something for everyone but as I have already said. You MUST but the time into it. One more thing for those IDIOTS saying that this game is 'pay to win'. NO! These are the types of people who don't know how to farm for their equipment. Anyway I'm done. PLAY WARFRAME!!!

review: I'm enjoying Warframe immensely. The cooperative atmosphere among the players is refreshing, and the gameplay is varied and fun. Your loadout will become tuned to your playstyle in so many ways, it's astounding. I have a good friend showing me the ropes and helping me get some of the items, but it's just as playable with random strangers. You'll quickly learn some things, and slowly learn others. A few bugs speckle every play session, but not enough to frustrate me out of playing. Highly recommended.

review: It was this game that introduced me to my girlfriend..well kinda, and for that only its awesome. But talking about the game itself: The game has an awesome community always helping each other, if you find someone rude its maybe cuz hes new to the game and probably a kid. Its a free to play and NOT A PAY 2 WIN! You can get everything (but cosmetics) for free, obviasly you will need to grind and meet nice people to help you with that, which wont be hard. And even the PLATINUM the "real money" so to say...english blahk...even that you can get without spending any money. Yes this game gets a bit boring at times, with all the grinding, and its probably a bit too much info to take in when you start the game for the first or second month but dont worry now theres a nice how-to tutorials about everything, so yeah dont worry you'll be fine. The DEV team behind the game is very active and they hear our call for help if something needs fixing or tweeking, they also do Devstreams and they play the game live for all of us to see and laugh at them. From those streams you can get platinum (if you are lucky) . So go ahead try and play and dont forget...RELEASE THE NINJA IN YOU! And kill a lot...I mean really A LOT!

review: Great game with loads of playtime. The only problem with it is its highly repetitive. There is no real end game. The whole point is to upgrade to better equipment but after a while you have it all and are left waiting for the next patch to provide something new to farm an possibly never use. Even with that, this thing is amazing for a group of friends, or even solo. Attempting to Stealth every misson can provide months of fun. The graphics (assuming you have the capability to run on hig) ae amazing. Even at LOW rendering.

review: If you got time this is the best f2p third person shooter/action game out there, market is expensive but almost everything can be obtained by playin the game. Laking real end game content is it's main downside at the moment, you can quickly obtain most end game items by grinding it for a couple of days or buying it off the player market for in game currency (or trade items you have collected). The RNG will make you come back for more or turn you completly off.

review: I can easily say this is the best F2P game I've ever played, discounting TF2. The gameplay is fun, it's fast paced and tricky. Your character moves in amazing ways with awesome parkour. Combat can be a little dull at times due to just having lame guns for a while to start but the melee combat is excellent. All in all, it's free, it looks great and it plays great. Rally some friends and give it a shot if you're bored. Oh and you can be like Raiden.

review: DIS GAME. Started days after it went into Open Beta, was stable as if it were a Final Version commercial release. Absolutely wonderful to play with friends, although the objective fun in it is in setting your sights on a new Warframe and working towards it. With 13 frames, there's a lot of work ahead for you to keep you busy, and it doesn't require too much money to get you those 11 extra slots!

review: Although this game does get extremely repetitive, I find this to be a brilliant game. Why? Community - Most games that I have played or even heard about has got a bad, annoying community with people raging, whining and trolling, However this game has a freindly community with people that will respond and have a bant ;). I do think that this mught be due to the fact of the game not being PVP and that you are able to be OP. Updates - I love it when a game does recent updates with new items and this game does this precisely. With new Equipment, weapons, warframes and missions; most people will never get bored. Always being Busy - Warframe doesn't really have a objective so you need to make your own which is what I love but some might not. This might be from Farming xp to trying to get a rare mod. What annoys me? Slow - Having to constantly go to the same mission to get new materials or mods is the most annoying thing for me. Grinding to get the things you want can bore you or make you determined to get what you want. I've been trying to go from rank 6 to rank 8 for 2 weeks now and still working on it which is a  but I am determined to get there plus it makes time fly. Repetitive - For the game being slow to start with; the game can get very boring as it will be repetitive. Having the same maps as well get boring as you want every map different for a new experiance which could make the game short for some. Costing - For me I am unable to put money in a game so I want to be cautous of what I buy. However the market of Waframe is very expensive which would put alot of people off. I deffinitly would not call this game "Free to Play" as you would easily spend 40 quid in a short time. Luckily most items can be made with credits and materials can be found in and after missions. Overall I have been playing this game for a long time and I love it. This is definitly a game for people who always want to be busy, determined and who want a nice comminity.

review: This game is alot of fun and quite addictive when you get into it. The game is constantly being butchered to death, balance wise, by it's developer though. There are also a ton of bugs and really strange design choices that wonder if the people in charge are mentally handicapped or have actually ever played any video games before. Great game overall though. Just be prepared for bugs bugs and more bugs. Be prepared for things being nerfed when they don't need to be and things that do need to be nerfed being left alone.

review: A fun, 4 player, co-op game that is relatively easy to understand. Been a favourite amongst my friends and I for a while now, would recommend! The gameplay is wonderful, bringing together elements from third-person-shooters, RPGs and MMOs and combining them into something new. The graphical design is nothing short of beautiful, dazzling the players with a variety of levels and effects! The audio quality is great. There is nothing nicer than hearing the drums of war start to play rhythmically as you enter battle. Finally, the community is large, diverse and friendly.

review: Love this game, been playin since befor I used Steam and was using Raptr. Awesome gameplay, easy to use controller support, vived lush graphics, excellent voices, tons of content with new content added regularly, and fun co-op. Super fun game to play for free. Now for gripes (Though Very Few), The story is very lacking, its not really in your face you have to be looking for it but there is one, also this game gets seriously repetitive and if your not playing with friends or a team that talks as you play... You get bored and last but not least.... This game is a Epic GRIND. If you dont wanna spend money to get other warframes or speed up the process of leveling and crafting this game will eventually make you put it down because of repetitive grinding. That Being Said... This Game Is Awesome and I recommend anyone give a shot... Its free for Goodness sake! And lets not comment on the epicness of playing this on a Big 1080 TV with surround Sound, and Dualshock 4, and Steams Awesome Big Picture mode!

It would have been fine with some really great stuff that you have to pay for, but it seems like it's everything. Other than that it is a pretty great game. There is a story, co-op, choose which levels you do first. This game would have been my number 1 if it wasn't for all the money you had to pay to get stuff.

review: Amazing movement and combat system unlike any before but does cost money eventually no matter what and will need to have its finishing quality added. The character leveling and custimization is great but once you realize theres not much more to do once you have a couple warframes and a good couple levels up you realize all of the work you put into making a badass godlike superhero ninja is only to continue puting more time and money into each character and there is never any sort of player to player recognition for your time invested in your character. games like world of warcraft have all of the intricate mini parts of the game, like warframe, but no matter what you get tangled up in you always know grand total the game is still alliance vs horde(primarily) and warframe and its creators. needs to finish with its own distinguished main reason to play the game. something that makes you take all the time you spend making your guy just as awsome as you want him and then actually lets you use him for a purpose other then more leveling or material farming. My vote is for hundreds of warframes to eventually meet in head on 360 degree warfare in online servers on the supposed new part of the game. control points, weapons and warframes would be great!

review: The game is fun and has a bit of innovation. It's free to play aspect gives players a free way to play and you really don't need to buy anything for it. Is it worth paying? Sure. You can get things you want like in any game. However, this isn't a MMO, many people i talked to say it is. It's a coop game where people have the option of hop in hop out features. The things i don't like about the game is it is linear, you have minimal options on where you can roam. The game play is repeatitive and i know most games are like that but this game really has nothing but the same sword slashing and gun slinging as any other game i ever played. For a free to play it is fun, but even the levels lack creative imagination. They look like they're basically the same level over and over again. Players- well you get good and bad players for all games but the ones on here will leave in the middle of a session and leave you to fight hoardes of enemies by yourself, and they lack the consideration to revive you when you die. I give it a thumbs up for a free to play game... however if it was a pay to play game or even a game to purchase i wouldn't recommend it.

review: Warframe is an amazing game. Its a third person co-op sci-fi shooter space ninja extravaganza! Its a little slow starting out (if you have the money, i recommend getting affinity and credit boosters), but once you get past the first planet or two, you really start to have some great fun. With a good team and communication, this game offers hours of never ending entertainment. Each Warframe (playable character) offers its own unique play and fighting style. With (Currently) 16 Warframes and 3 prime variants (the 4th, excalibur prime is no longer attainable), over 100 primary, secondary, and melee weapons, and 5 sentinels (robotic companions), this game has massive replayability. The very best part is, its free! So why not try it out? P.S. Dont stop after the first couple missions, I promise you'll find its an amazing game!

review: A very enjoyable fast-paced shooter (when played with others). With the option of stealthy slow solo play as well. Some repetitive maps and scenarios but still with enough variation to not feel "grindy" (until you're trying to get something specific to drop). Can be played entirely free but a little cash injection certainly can boost the fun.

review: It is a action game with a realistic engine(both graphically and combat-wise),with lots of hack-n'-slash ,resembling Devil-may-cry 4 with more space ninjas.It is perfect but for the lack of stealth,but hell,IT'S PERFECT! Edit:Now with the new GUI and the new stuff from the mad Cephalon onwards the game is IMHO terrible.I just don't know what to do in it anymore.For veterans<--- DON'T COME BACK For new players<----PLAY IT! you might understand something from it...

review: All and All, great game. Cant say its perfect, but it will keep you occupied for a long time. The combat is fun, fast paced (even if some of the enemy mechanics are often a bit cheap) and feels rather rewarding at most times. There is a light grind wall, but all the objects in the game (other than cosmetics) can be obtained without any real money, so with a good time investment anything can be obtained. Even cash shop items. Highly recommend it as the game is constantly improoving and more content is added. Just a small advice, find someone else to play with as that will make the experience much better.

review: Back in April 2013 when I first played this game upon initial open beta status, this game was absolute garbage. Environments were almost totally dark, textures were crap, AI and physics were VERY subpar, no minimap or objective markers and the list went on. However, it's now July and a friend got me to give the game another shot. There have been MASSIVE improvements and I really think they initially made it open beta too early. They've likely lost a lot of potential players due to bad reviews and bad experiences, but GIVE THIS GAME A SHOT. As long as you have friends to play with, this game will provide hours of group fun even when doing something as mundane as farming materials for crafting items. I think Warframe's devs have made a lot of improvements and more are coming. This game is gong to be around a long time. ADDITIONS 6/21/14: So the game has continually been updated, things like Damage 2.0, Melee 2.0, new weapons and warframes(characters). The game has some issues still and certain changes they've made recently that I don't care for. BUT, and this is a big but(haha), this game has something truly unique: Devs that for the most part listen to their players. Even if they don't actually make changes or additions suggested, they DO read them. When things have been added to the game the community hates, DE(Digital Extremes) will jump up to fix them. They understand we keep them going. They don't take us for granted. They're adding in new enemies and weapons that players have suggested and provided concept art for too. They're even adding in a new player experience in a couple of weeks with Update 14 along with an actual pet system. As in we get a space dog and have to actually take care of it. It's not just an extra piece of equipment, but a companion. All in all, while some mistakes get made or bugs happen, those're bound to happen. We still are lucky enough to have a developer that actually cares what its players think of their game.

review: How I Lost My Life to Warframe To me, for the longest time it was one of those games that I'll see and hear about early on and decide, "Nah, that's not my kind of game, I won't bother getting into it". Anytime it pops up the same thought is there, and nothing budges. Eventually, lots of friends were getting into it, playing all the time. "That game has never seemed fun or my kind of game, I still wouldn't like it so I won't get into it still. Even though they're playing it so much, they're prolly just overhyping it, I've always felt it won't be fun to me." But then I decided, for whatever reason, "Hell, I'll try it out at least." And now, I'm on the other side, as friends watch me play constantly and wonder how it's even possible. It's just a plain fun game, pretty to look at and play, and even its F2P tactics feel good in the long run. I was pessimistic about the waiting and grinding involved, but pacing your gameplay helps to enjoy things longer, without burning out on things right away. Don't wanna wait 12 hours for a weapon to build? Just take a bit of control, sleep it off, wake up to a nice new shiny toy. There'll be more to do in the meantime, the new player experience is just a bit slow to get you off your feet is all.

review: Warframe is a good game, it may dont have a story or exact campain. But hey! it's an open beta, what are you waiting for?...This game contains an XP system, if you keep using your char (Excalibur, Loki, Ash, Rhyno, etc.) it will lvl up, with each lvl up you can add mods that you can find on missions, they are very unique and the mods depends of how you equip them. if you are lvl 4 you can add a mod that is lvl 4, lvl 3 or lvl 2 with another lvl 2. The missions are pretty big after an update, you can spen from 30 to 1 hours at exploring the big map, it worth it because you can find more ammo, health and credits. killing enemies with a specific weapon it makes it worth even more, because if you only kill with your braton mk l your rifle will lvl up and you can add mods to your wep, you can use a primary weapon, a secondary wich its always a pistol and a melee that you can use if you spam that damn E button. after you finish a mission you will recieve extra points. You can only recieve this points if you killed a lot of enemies or depending of how much enemies you killed, this extra points will not help all your weapons to lvl up, it depends of how much you kill with them. Lvling up your Tenno and your weps makes this game very entretaining and long! and please....dont go to a mission where the enemies are lvl 50 and you are lvl 20 with lvl 10 - 20 weps...they will kick your  so fast...so lvl up everything you can before doing those missions. Go for them tenno! Yes i know i didnt "review" the online stuff...buts who cares just click on the big blue button that says "ONLINE" and choose if you want to do your missions alone, with a friend or public forgot to mention. This game actually have Bosses..witch them are generals or bigass robots, they are very hard to kill, so if you are a high lvl guy go for them, if you are not...join or make a lobby and let your tenno buddys help you with the damn general or robot.

review: Amazing free to play-Action rpg "shooter" (Warframe needs a genre description of its own,don't make the mistake of thinking of the usual  quality for f2p-shooters,this is something else.) + Great quality for a f2p-game with constant updates and improvements. + It's completely free,you don't have to spend any money on anything unless you want to (no restrictions) and all of the platinum purchases are convenience. + There's a wide selection of Warframes,weapons and cosmetic items and new stuff is constantly getting added. + Tons of content,altho quality of the content varies,it is mostly lobby-based indoor tunnel-shooting missions and levels can get repetetive since there isn't an awful lot of variation in environment and mission types. But again,new stuff is getting added on a regular basis and the developers are good at their jobs and listen to the community. + Great for Coop-play,up to 4players in a squad,different outloads and frames can work well together and make things easier,and there's plenty of challenges such as survival and endless defense missions with waves of increasingly difficult enemies. -The community is a mixed bag but still a LOT better than most f2p shooters. But since it is a free-to-play and literally anyone can pick this up (+console players) you'll still see a lot of kids,spamming and allcaps attentionwhoring. If you haven't played this game I can only recommend you try it out,you've got nothing to lose but potentially a bit (or lot) of your time^^ It's surprisingly good for a free to play and oozing quality.

review: "Oh boy another FTP game, bet it's pay to win...." I'm pretty sure that's what you're thinking right now but I would possibly come over, slap you with a glove and say "No." Well....It does have some pay aspects to it but that's only if you're the speedy type who don't like to wait. I'll go into detail over this in a second. All in all the game is still in beta, and it has been in beta for a while so don't expect it to come out of beta anytime soon. That being said, Digtal Extremes (Here on in this review will be known as [DE].) Does interact with the comunity of players new and old. From talking to others in the forums and holding weekly Twitch Livestream events they do it all. They even give shout outs to the user submissions as well as join some players sessions. I can personally vouch for this when I had a fangasm when [DE]'s on Rebeca joined in on my game during a mission. (If you're reading this Rebeca it was amazing to co-op with you. ) You're probably thinking "Why has it been in beta for so long?" Well [DE]'s still working on stuff like performance improvements in networking, maps, AI, etc. and overall performance of the game mechanics it self while tossing in new enmies, more content and more lore. They also hold events in the game for extra nice things too like rare mods for your warframes, weapons, and sentinel pets. Co-Op? Plenty of co-op, you'll run in a team of four, it can be with your friends, or random people who can quickly become friends with considering the userbase is full love lively people. (You know who you are. >;D) "What about PvP?" There's PvP in the game as well, though I don't dabble to much into that so I couldnt tell you much about it. CLAN WARS! YES! BRAND NEW! CLAN WARS! Get up with a clan and go take on other clans by destroying thier 'Solar Rails' which are things that allow you to go into other parts of the game for extra things too. "What about customization?" Here's where I'll get personal, I LIKE TO CUSTOMIZE! From Macho Man Randy Savage zombies in L4D2 to motherhumping Thomas the Tank as dragons in Skyrim. It makes it all the better to me. Now there's no client mods for Warframe but you can customize your stuff in the game itself. Either by paying for currency called platinum, which isn't all that expensive, and in my opinion, wait untill you get a discount from login rewards, oh yeah, did I mention there were login rewards? Because there are. And the more you log in, the better they are. ANYWAY! The cosmetics in the game can be bought with platinum or be recived through alerts, login rewards or events. Also, you can 'technically' earn platinum by trading rare item drops for them. Oh yeah you can customize your weapons damage effects too, nifty eh? :D those you don't have to pay plat for that. "I THOUGHT THIS WASN'T PAY TO WIN! YOU LIED TO ME TOYO!" No I didn't. Also, turn off caps lock, it's not getting you any brownie points. Weapons come in two different flavours, you can pay for one, and get it right then and there with a booster to allow more damage customization or you can buy the blueprints with ingame credits, grind for the needed resources, and build the item and wait for a bit. You wont get that boost like I mentioned before but you can get those via login rewards, alerts and NPC faction wars. Jsut gotta grind and build those too when you recive the item. The game's set up where you don't get a winning advantage just for throwing money at the game. The only thing that does is get you cosmetic items and such. [Though I will admit I have thrown money at the game for some shiney things. I'm not proud of myself, but at the same time, I look totes cool yo!] "What about end game stuffs?" There's one right now, and it will be a grindfest...well the entire game is a grindfest if you really think about it and don't mind waiting for your stuff to finish building. They're actively adding more content with weekly updates to the game with various fixes, tweaks and new items which, for me, keeps the game refreshing and not so stale like some other F2P games I know but wont mention. All in all it's a VERY fun game to play and as you can see, I played the game fairly religiously [Drank the kool-aid maybe? I dunno] So yeah that 750+ hours isn't just having the game runing in the background. That is actual game time where I physically played this game. It's free, so what do you have to loose? Besides not be a badass ninja with a badass sword and parkour skills? 10/10 Will keep playing till my HP hits 0 irl....and maybe in the afterlife....hopefully...wonder if they got pcs in the afterlife...?

review: Where do i start with this game to hold your attention? Warframe is a fast phased, action packed thrill ride with marvelous graphics in an ever expanding universe with it's own level up system, upgrades, parkour, magic, spaceninjas, you name it. And the devs who brought this game are very talented people who do their best to daily bring new things to the table. However, this game does lack a proper endgame as of yet and suffers from repetition, but it's the constant content which will keep you coming back for more, it really is a great experience with lots of potential for years to come.

review: I haven't played this a lot but for the time I have played I enjoyed it. I wanted different Tenno though but that's really grindy and really hard to get if you don't have a good group with you. The controles may seem wonky but if you change them to your liking then they're amazing. The only thing bad I can really say is the melee. It's weak and everywhere, but if you know how to make your Tenno, it's strong and everywhere and sometimes the only freaking thing you use. The maps are practically all the same but different routes, the weapons are the same just different stats just like Dust 514, and it's easy to get out of control thinking you're a badass and getting yourself mauled. Overall it's a pretty good game, not something I'd play all day every day but still good enough to catch my attention, especially considering I don't like super fast paced anything or third-person games. Oh also the lighting, the lighting is too extravegant, so if the flare bothers you turn off lighting effects, it helps speed up the game and its better on the eyes and makes it feel more natural.

review: Warframe is a fantastic free to play game about space ninjas with seemingly endless weapons, and unique character abilities. While some may find the third person combat repetitive, the gunplay is satisfying and solid. Every weapon feels different, and provides unique challenges, for example the Phage fires multiple converging beams of energy, which inflict enemies with a debilitating viral infection, in contrast to the graceful power of the Paris, a bow which magnetically accelerates arrows through your enemies. There are also an astounding number of melee weapons, with equally high variety, with a surprisingly deep combo system, and several acrobatic maneuvers to keep things interesting. Perhaps the most interesting parts of the game are the "Warframes" themselves. Each character has four abilities, much like a traditional MOBA game. These abilities range from a grappling hook which can be used to tear enemies in half and navigate the terrain, to a power which reanimates the enemies you've killed to fight for you. Each frame is vaguely themed around an animal, or element, and fill different roles on a team. Zephyr (a hawk-like fighter) specializes in mobility, and high burst damage, while Rhino (a heavy tank frame) excells at soaking up damage, and crushing enemies that get in his way. The art design in the game is fantastic, and provides a unique "organic armor" feel, with distinct enemies and factions. This is complemented by the solid sound design, which aids in the immersion. Perhaps my favorite thing about this game is the random encounters. As you complete missions, you may find yourself at odds with a specific faction. You'll get a message in your inbox, warning you that further actions will have consequences. Further defiance will result in the appearence of assasins, who will track you down and appear in your missions, creating a sort of mini-boss fight. There are frequently community "events", which feature special rewards, and game modes, requring players to work together to accomplish a larger goal. "Alerts" appear several times a day, providing more of a challenge for a specific award (often special items that normally require premium currency. ) While the game is free to play, it does not suffer from many of the typical problems of the genre. This game is NOT "pay to win". While the weapons given to you at the start are clearly inferior to end-game weapons, they are still relatively viable. Literally ALL non-cosmetic content is avaliable without paying a cent. Daily alerts can sometimes reward players with special rewards which are normally only avaliable through the marketplace. Boss fights will reward players with otherwise locked weapons, etc. The only downside is that this results in a good bit of "farming". Although, depending on your preference, this may not be a bad thing. Sometimes, you may just want to load up an easy mission, and slaughter hundreds of soldiers, other times, you may want more of a challenge, and the game provides the means to do this. Lastly, the developers are incredibly open about their work, providing one of the most transparent development cycles I've ever seen, often taking advice directly from their users into consideration, and providing a livestream about the game's progress EVERY WEEK. Patches are released nearly weekly, and significant content updates almost monthly, adding new missions, bosses, and reworks which address the concerns of the community. I would highly recommend this Warframe. Keep in mind, this game is in open beta, so there are bound to be problems, but being free, I'd say it's worth a shot, even if this isn't your type of thing.

review: Pretty fun game I'll admit. It's satisfying to get a kill once you get the hang of all the neat tricks you can do. The only con about this game are the microtransactions. The microtransactions are annoying and limit very much to your gameplay, they keep you from getting better, and cooler items. As a decent game, I give it 7/10, gotta make money somehow right?

review: I really wish the community was larger for this game. It was such a joy and of course it can seem repetitive but, the community that did play was helpful and it never felt like a grind. I would definitely give this game at least an 8/10 if not higher. The graphics are amazing and the gameplay is smooth and enjoyable. There are exploits to movement and such which make it easy though there still is enough challenge for it to be a great time! I hope for this game to somehow grow once again

review: I have spent (unbeknownst to me) over 300 hours playing this game and I have nothing but positive things to say. Despite the fact that many free-to-play games often require you to pay in order to progress, this isn't true with Warframe. As I've learned from the very beginning you could play for hours-upon-hours without having to spend a single penny. It wasn't until I was nearing 100 hours that I realized how much I enjoyed this game. Not only that, but I also thought that investing in (platinum for) the game would only help make my already-pleasant experience even better. Warframe has evolved alot in the small amount of time that I've played it. Through player purchases the developers have added new maps, new mods, a killer melee battling system, and outstanding and unique missions and modes that only add to the spontaneity of this game. Just imagine a game that mixes Ninja Gaiden with Call of Duty with Vanquish. From my own personal experience, it's worth checking out - especially if you're a college student (like myself) and are strapped for spending money on the new games coming out every-so-often. Give this game a shot and I'm sure you will come to find at least a few things that make Warframe a fun, great, and unique experience. Game On. - Lenny

Alright after that your here for the review my experience with the game is amazing other than that annoying So called "Crafting" the game is great. Melee 2.0 reveloutionized the games melee system giving it a whole new aspect, First Heavy Weapons actually have a purpose other than more damage, They have different attacks but still more damage. Smaller weapons such as the glaive attack faster and deal less damage and is throwable. This pretty much wraps up the review one of the best prequels to a game ever not storyline wise but gameplay wise. 9.5 Out of 10

review: This game. I played it when I had no idea what I was doing, got frustrated, and left for a month or two. But then, I took some time to think about it, and I've played almost every day since that month or two ended. The controls are amazingly fluid; nothing is more satisfying than dashing through a room full of Grineer and slicing them to shreds. Not only that, but all the weapons, sentinels, and non-cosmetic gear is all free, and incredibly worthwhile to earn. I was the little level 12 loki staring in awe of the rhino prime with a shiny boltor prime and carrier sentinel sucking up all the useful items. I'm currently working on getting Loki Prime, and I've built a sentinel all on my own. The grind to get all the rare materials was worth it in the end. All in all, this is a game to keep an eye on (not even out of beta yet!) and play for a bit. Who doesn't love space ninjas?

review: How I Lost My Life to Warframe To me, for the longest time it was one of those games that I'll see and hear about early on and decide, "Nah, that's not my kind of game, I won't bother getting into it". Anytime it pops up the same thought is there, and nothing budges. Eventually, lots of friends were getting into it, playing all the time. "That game has never seemed fun or my kind of game, I still wouldn't like it so I won't get into it still. Even though they're playing it so much, they're prolly just overhyping it, I've always felt it won't be fun to me." But then I decided, for whatever reason, "Hell, I'll try it out at least." And now, I'm on the other side, as friends watch me play constantly and wonder how it's even possible. It's just a plain fun game, pretty to look at and play, and even its F2P tactics feel good in the long run. I was pessimistic about the waiting and grinding involved, but pacing your gameplay helps to enjoy things longer, without burning out on things right away. Don't wanna wait 12 hours for a weapon to build? Just take a bit of control, sleep it off, wake up to a nice new shiny toy. There'll be more to do in the meantime, the new player experience is just a bit slow to get you off your feet is all.

review: Warframe is a good game, it may dont have a story or exact campain. But hey! it's an open beta, what are you waiting for?...This game contains an XP system, if you keep using your char (Excalibur, Loki, Ash, Rhyno, etc.) it will lvl up, with each lvl up you can add mods that you can find on missions, they are very unique and the mods depends of how you equip them. if you are lvl 4 you can add a mod that is lvl 4, lvl 3 or lvl 2 with another lvl 2. The missions are pretty big after an update, you can spen from 30 to 1 hours at exploring the big map, it worth it because you can find more ammo, health and credits. killing enemies with a specific weapon it makes it worth even more, because if you only kill with your braton mk l your rifle will lvl up and you can add mods to your wep, you can use a primary weapon, a secondary wich its always a pistol and a melee that you can use if you spam that damn E button. after you finish a mission you will recieve extra points. You can only recieve this points if you killed a lot of enemies or depending of how much enemies you killed, this extra points will not help all your weapons to lvl up, it depends of how much you kill with them. Lvling up your Tenno and your weps makes this game very entretaining and long! and please....dont go to a mission where the enemies are lvl 50 and you are lvl 20 with lvl 10 - 20 weps...they will kick your  so fast...so lvl up everything you can before doing those missions. Go for them tenno! Yes i know i didnt "review" the online stuff...buts who cares just click on the big blue button that says "ONLINE" and choose if you want to do your missions alone, with a friend or public forgot to mention. This game actually have Bosses..witch them are generals or bigass robots, they are very hard to kill, so if you are a high lvl guy go for them, if you are not...join or make a lobby and let your tenno buddys help you with the damn general or robot.

review: A fast-paced action-packed third person shooter that will entice you within minutes. The range of available characters and weapons to unlock and build really add to the game's possibilities of ways to play, fight and win. The only "negative" thing I have come to notice is that you can't really unlock other warframes to use until mid to late game (unless you spend real money), but even that just encourages more gameplay and more fun! But a word of caution: This game does not have a running storyline after the first missions, so if you are looking for a plot to get involved in, this is not the game. Needless to say, overall, this game is a great action-filled TPS that will have you hooked for life and the fun will go on without end.

Well many many updates later it's safe to say that this game is still growing in surprising and exciting ways. It's still a game that feels that you have to dump a couple bucks into every now and then, but it never feels forced: by the time you feel the urge for some platinum you've probably put a hundred more hours into playing, so why not? Money you spend should be based on the fun you're having, and Warframe is promising to keep entertaining for a long time.

review: Space Ninjas? Powers? Guns? FREAKING SWORDS!? The only thing this game is missing is gratuitous nudity... *Crosses fingers* Update: October 28, 2014 So, it's been over a year since I reviewed this game... AND IT'S GOTTEN EVEN BETTER! Where to start... The Dev team is slowly incorporating more story elements, especially for the new players who need guidance as to what they're doing. Part of this new drive was the implementation of the "New Player System" which is a quest to introduce the player to Warframe's basic mechanics while informing you of some of the basic lore. Other quests now added include Howl of the Kubrow to get your very own death-dealing, cuddle-loving furball, Hidden Message to unlock the Warframe known as Mirage, Limbo Theorem to unlock the IMPOSSIBLY fun Warframe Limbo, who can walk on a completely different plane of existence. And, last but DEFINITELY not least, the Archwing. Gundam lover's will just about soil their shorts when they get their hands on this space combat system. Remember the Death Star run from Episode 6? You'll get to experience it yourself. Note for all those interested in the game, if you play for free it CAN be a -very- heavy grind, and wait times on building items can be brutal (3 days for some things). But, if you have some patience, this game's high speed combat mechanics are fantastic. But, if you don't mind a bit of grind, you can even alleviate that some by selling rare mods and Prime parts for Platinum in the player trade system.

review: Honestly an amazing game. Once you get past the kinda crappy starter gear and into things you like more, it becomes really fun. The biggest pushfactor for most players is the crafting time. Once you get over the fact that you can't always get what you want right away and learn to deal with it, it isn't an issue anymore. Overall, a really fun, unique game. I'd reccomend it to anyone into any kind of action game.

review: I absolutely love this game. It is the definition of a amazing free to play experience, although you will need to spend some money to get the full experience. It is very much worth it in my opinion! also supporting indie devs gives you a nice feeling :) But the meat meat of the gameplay is the third person ninja shooter. Being a space ninja ou are very agile and can pull off parkour with ease. the gunplay is satisfying and has a lot of impact with great sound assests make hearing and feeling the pop of a headshot! i cannot reccomend this game enough! but the gripes i have is that the entry level is massive with most of the weapons and frames being very daunting for new player, along with some grind. It could need patience.

review: Warframe Warframe started as a decent co-op shooter. On early beta it had some game breaking bugs, but it felt like it had a lot of potential, that potential is still there and i doubt it will fade away easily. The level design is pretty amazing, the tilesets have as much quality as a AAA title but they get very repetitive with time, the "endgame" void missions can be described as "kill mobs, loot the room and occasionally look for secrets, rinse and repeat", The Bosses started out as pretty meaningful and provided an actual challenge, nowadays they're a means to earn blueprints of specific frames and are incredibly hard, with the inclusion of a specific set of bosses that have a specific weak spot which only works half of the time. The best boss fight is in my honest opinion Lephantis. Every update they release there are more bugs than additions, though most of which get solved pretty fast. The game has become quite a farm fest, earning the game the term "Warfarm". The Devs are terrible at balancing the game, specificly by overly nerfing frames and weapons and hardly ever buffing others. The grinding involved in farming for frames is extreme and is a great drawback of the game. Crafting weapons take usually 12 hours, companions and rare materials take up to 24 hours. the new Archwing takes 36 hours to build, and frames take 72 hours. Its tedious to wait so long for new gear. This New Archwing update is lame, the new tileset in space is devoid of content, its literally the same map. starts in the same place, ends in the same place but has you go through different pathways to achieve your objective. But to be quite honest, i've went on and on about how terrible this game is, but its still one of my favorite games and i have spent up to 8 hours in it alone, playing with friends. It's got its share of  sure, but they still somehow manage to deliver on a great time which is quite a feat, ive not exacly been easy on the examples of how terrible it is. I'm not gonna rate this game on a scale of any sorts, its a great game to spend some time in, but its below average in key aspects and needs improvement, and a lot of it, then again it's still in "open beta" so we might see some positive changes over the course of development.

review: Look, I'm not typically one to support F2P games, but if you enjoyed Dark Sector, this will be right up your alley. It is F2P so there are microtransactions (which can be on the expensive side!) but very few non-cosmetic items are purchase-only. Essentially, you can play all of the content of this game without paying a cent. (Minus some color choices and various conveniences like extra weapons or warframe inventories) Its primarily a PVE affair, though there is the ability to go to PvP "conclaves." This game is solid, mindless, space ninja fun with a lot of variety on weapons and warframes.

review: A lot of people have varrying views on this game. There have been bugs in the past which have annoyed some. my friends included. But i love this game. So many hours just spent playing it. They're always updating and adding new stuff, whether it be different warframes or weapons and new areas. Community missions are fun to try and rack up some points. The warframes themselves are unique and fun to play around with. My favorite being Saryn. That poison op. Just about anything you can get by just simply playing the game. which cant be said for most free to plays. Run on walls, shoot, jump, slam and explode your way to victory xD

review: A lot of fun albeit repetitive. If you're looking to purchase additional warframes for plat, don't. It's far more economical to purchase plat during Steam sales or when you get 75% off during a login reward THEN buy the items you want from other players. ...or grind your butt off! Nearly everything is available for free however the catch is that you only have a certain number of slots to store your frames and weapons. You can save additional Platinum by getting items from alert missions. D/Ling the WF Alerts app is highly recommended. Also, Loki is amazing. Choose that frame after your tutorial. The Wikia is your Warframe bible. There is theorycrafting and optimal character building in this game and you'll find this reference highly valuable. Complete maps then do nightmare modes for rare dual-stat mods. Some are much easier than others and you can abort and restart if you get things like "no shields" opon starting the mission. Hit me up in-game!

review: I've been playing Warframe for a while, and i have to say that it is a pretty good game. Any bugs that are found in-game are almost instantly fixed by the next day in their very frequent bug fixes and updates. I feel that this shows a dedication to the consumers to provide a very enjoyable gaming experience. I feel that the gameplay is very invigorating and engaging, keeping you on your toes most of the time. Its a multiplayer game, even though you do have the option of playing solo. You have a wide variety of customizations for your warframes cosmetically, and stat wise. Overall, i think that this game is great, and that anyone who reads this should give it a try. Its free to play, even though you can pay real money to make micro-trasnactions in-game for special items. I give Warframe a 9/10

A recent update allows people to build up a dojo which is a housing for your clan where you can perform research, build new rooms, etc etc. As you play, you upgrade your gear, install new mods onto them and upgrade your mods. You can also farm materials and craft equipment and other things from them. Each Warframe has a different set of skills and there are several warframes to play. Join me in this awesome game and join my dojo!

review: First person shooting games have become a bit stale of late. "Generic Shooter XVIIXXII - The Return of the Bad Guy" has become a true blight on gaming. So when another developer takes a stab at FPS, one has to sort of roll their eyes and wonder when people will learn. But then you actually 'play' warframe. And you realise that this is not "Generic Shooter" material. What you have here is a game with a lot of potential. Free to play also suffers a lot of abuse, but again, in the hands of this developer the concept works. You can actually own any weapon or suit that you could buy for real world money. And everyone has to level up thier stuff the same way - by shooting a variety of scaling, tough and creepy monsters in the face (or crotch). You take the role of a Tenno operative, a ninja in space. You'll wield melee weapons, fire pistols, rifles, shotguns and throw shuriken and find yourself giddy with the pleasure of running along a wall to drop down and impale and enemy. The story is vast and the difficulty scales with your ambition. The learning curve of this game is severe, but nothing is as satisfying as building your first warframe and taking it out for it's baptism of fire. Central to the game is the "Warframe". Different suits that allow you different abilities and powers, which you'll need to shoot aforementioned baddies in the afroementioned faces. The game is still in Beta, but that should not affect your decision to play this game. It's fun, with constant and expanding content that is well balanced and responsive. Get it, get in and take your place among us, Tenno. We're waiting.

review: I have put in nearly 200 hours and still counting. I quite fancy this game. The different environments and classes of enemies bring some interesting variety to the table. All the maps are randomly generated so farming for those materials to build weapons or new frames isn't quite as tedious. Equippable mods can make you that super serious player to kick some bum or that silly player that shoots exploding arrows which just might kill you too. This game is still in beta so things are constantly changing! Whichever your play style, I believe that there is a little bit for most everyone to enjoy this game. Not enjoying it?

review: Warframe is truly a wonderful games that ticks all of my boxes. It's god the best Sci-Fi feel, best action and of course the Ninja feeling to it. You can choose what you want to do when it comes to missons, want to go in guns blazing? Go ahead or if you prefer a more stealth approach to it then again, go ahead. The sound has improved dramatically over the years of Warframe and is really been a milestone for the developers to be proud of. They always surprise us with every update whether it be small or big. The music is perfect, it really does add the best theme you can get to battles and of course the music varies from battle to battle. The design is just the key symbol of Warframe, why you ask? See for yourself, it's just perfect. Every little detail Digital Extremes puts into the game always made the game more beautiful. The lighting is very dynamic, it's not too bright and not too dark in missions while keeping the good mix of lights to create the desired atmosphere. Gameplay in my opinion does need a bit of working, I just think Warframe is really hard to get into when you start as it only gets good when you start getting a real challenge. Digital Extremes did a good job when it came to Ninjas, I mean come on, you get to do Parkour. You get to run on walls while shooting and perform attacks with your sword in mid air flight. That's all I can say really, well there is one more thing. Get the game. You'll wish you played this game a long time ago. 10/10.

review: This is essentially Buggy McGrindwall: The game. If you're into latex coated space ninjas then its certainly one of the best options out there and can be loads of fun, but beware as once you decided there is an item/weapon/etc that you want, you will be forced to grind countless missions to get the parts, credits, and resources for it. In the case of prime items, you need to grind for keys, and then grind the keys for the parts, and then grind certain bosses for resources (which can be up to 30+ runs in total for certain items provided you don't get the drop every time as usual). Over all, this game can be extremely tedious, the stealth is half- and impractical, but has many other fun elements that make it worth it for the gameplay. Provided of course your UI doesn't bug out and stop you from clicking anything 5 times in an hour.

review: So I played Warframe a lot during the Beta. Maybe a little to much to where I out did my self on the game and then it just got boring. It started to get boring though when Shotguns came into play and anyone who had one could whipe the floor of any mission. Later on I come back and see they changed EVERYTHING. While some is nice I hate most all of the changes made. Not to mention the gameplay is still Boring however All Co op style games are boring and are even more so if one person is able to do all of the work for you. kinda like Boarderlands 2 its dull as hell. I havent yet beat it because after the first 30 mins its just straight up boring to me. Warframe is Fun playing it alone though as a single player or sometimes with one other person if they do not have something Overpowered. I got this one guy in my clan into the game...he is addicted. He has over 3K almost 4K hours into it.

review: One of the most interesting projects of 2013 that flowed into 2014 that I've seen. The game has all what a gamer needs. Guns, fancy karate gimmicks, swords. Two words: Space Ninjas. What is actually good that the game even tho is F2P but it does not follow a shadowy P2W path. You might be confused in the beggining, as getting the stuff, crafting, locations and controls. But when you get over it, you might as well like it. Another aspect that drives the attention. Constant new content updates from very friendly Developers. I might add that DEVs do take in considiration players ideas and implement ideas and throughts into a real thing. Almost all the stuff ingame can be aqquired just by playing the game, you just need to get over the beggining. BUT this game is still in beta. There could be bugs, there could be flaws. Currently DEVs implement tons of content every two months (aprox). In general this is a game that you might totally like or just play for two minutes and uninstall. Playing with friends is recomended.

review: This game is an example of free to play done (mostly) right, which is very rare. You, a member of the Tenno race, are equiped with suits known as Warframes, each with unique stats and powers. It is your mission to aid in the war between the Tenno, Grineer, Corpus, and Infested. Admitadly, the game plays like a standard third person shooter, where it really shines is all of the different weapons and mods just waiting to be discovered, like Bows to assault rifles, Health increases to abilities. It's not without it's problems, though. The game is LITTERED with microtransactions, and while optional, grinding isn't fun unless you have friends. Oh yeah, this game has a standard 4 player co-op system too, which it is usually designed around. Overall, I would suggest getting this game with a very open mindset.

review: After watching The Legend Of The Drunken Master starring Jackie Chan and every Bruce Lee and Tony Jaa movie known to man I was finally qualified to join the Warframe community. After picking my first warframe (Loki) I traveled across the stars slaying untold horrors. But my blade was sturdy and my spirit strong, Infested, Grineer, Corpus I cut them all down. Hordes of enemies like a flood would droun me if it weren't for my amazing ninja abilities I would have been defeated. Warframe is amazing, and it's FREE! Only other game on my Steam Library with over a few hundred played. It is well worth it. The graphics are just beautiful for such a game and they don't even put stress on your computer, the Warframe varities, levels, modifiers, weapons and customization leave you satisfied. Not to mention the many different game modes to choose from and massive amounts of planets to trek across. You are a badass ninja fighting through the galaxy with your amazing suit (Warframe) abilities and destructive weapons that can all also be modified with Mods you find. Best free game I know of. I highly recomend it.

review: Started playing this game two days ago, and has been running smoothly so far. The co-op gameplay is really impressive and fun to play. There's always the option to get into a mission by yourself and hope that people are going to join you, but some missions aren't well-balanced for solo play. The graphics of the game is okay and most critically, there's no lag or ping display anywhere. There's a good variety of guns to choose from, including really powerful bows that can pin enemies against the wall, I think the swordsman archetype was a little overplayed, the melee combat here is also satisfyingly weighty. Charged attacks that can cut enemies clean in half are their own reward. One of Warframe's significant issues at the moment is its failure to display important information, especially in the mission-select interface, other than that the game was pretty well made and I will recommend this game to all who are looking for some fun in co-op gameplays.

Choose your playstyle! Stealthy or plain Rambo, this game allows either! Smooth interface, incredible graphics, an immersive selection of mulitplayer and solo missions... And extremely satisfying mechanics! The only way you can be disappointed is if you don't have a good enough PC! This game is flat out amazing! The best part... All of this for free!

review: Its a pretty good game , but gets a bit repetitive and the level designs of the first two worlds seem to be quite similar. The ninja movement is quite fun to experiment with , as their isnt really any tutorial to tell you each individual jump. Either way this is a good game to play with others or even on your own. I recommend this game to anyone whos into ninja mechanics and tps'.

review: Warframe is a co-op game (up to 4 players) inwhich the player choses 3 warframes upfront being vangaurd, volt, and loki to start their adventure through the galaxy. You are an ancient warrior designed to do specific tasks. You will go through levels solo or with your team completing various objectives, finding loot, and leveling up your gear and it never gets boring; the levels randomize every single time so you will never play the same map on any level. Though, only 3 warframes can be used for free upfront, that does not mean they are the worst, some consider them to be the most powerful or atleast equal to the others in their various playstyles. There are roughly 6-8 other warframes currently which can be made in real time (3days) by blue print bought from the marketplace with credits, and parts dropped from bosses or platinum bought with real money. Platinum is extremely expensive and I do not reccomend buying it to get a warframe or gear. You'll be able to craft everything(as far as im aware) though it will take some time, you save the money in your pockets. (trust me, i've made this mistake) There are tons of things to keep the player intwined with this game for hours between difficult missions, random events, and playing with their friends. The only cons about this game thus far are the high priced platinum and the beta stage bugs that occure but not very often. It seems that each day there are bug fixes. There is much more to be described about this game but due to the lack of space i have left >.> i can not go over everything. Another con that some might not like is how long it takes to level your avatar, ive spent well over 12 hours and im only lvl 1, though everything availiable to you right now only needs lvl 2. Your avatar lvl is seperate from the gear lvl which goes much faster and maxes out at 30(from what i've heard). For a free to play game and a quick download I HIGHLY reccomend this for you and your friends.

review: Veteran Warframe player here. This game is very fun to play with friends however becomes dull very quickly if you're playing alone. The game itself has great graphics and controls however the gameplay grows dull as the maps are generated using a tile system and you'll see yourself fighting the same enemies. However this is made up by the vast amount of weapons in the game as well as the damage rework that the staff did. The staff really listen to the community and try to respond to the best of their ability. I would say that Warframe has one of the best staff for not only listening and responding to the community but also doing livestreams and giving away Platinum. Platinum is Warframes in-game currency that can only be bought with real world currency, as expected from a f2p game. However there are little to no paywalls in this game. For me, I didn't have to spend any money on this game however the only aspect that I would count a paywall is the limitation on slots for weapons and warframes (the suits). You are given free platinum when creating an account which can be spent on buying slots for more weapons and warframes however once you start spending more time and creating more items you'll see yourself running out of space. This game however is a f2p game and getting hundred's of hours out of it is worth spending money on. In all however you start to see yourself just grind for weapons, materials, and levels through the same tiles over an over again so the game becomes very dull and boring which is why I recommend playing this game with friends as well as to treat this game as something you would just play casually.

With an unique art style and fun, fast paced gameplay, this F2P game is fantastic and you should try it out. (What's there to lose?) Don't worry about "pay to win" as there is really nearly nothing you can get with paid currency that you can't get through playing.

review: Got a ton of hours, LoL and Dota2 just not filling your daily grind, and like to jump around being tech ninja? Then Warframe is chances are for you. A game still rising up from a Beta status, it's pretty damn repetative for sure, but it at least offers you some goals to reach out towards. Better gear, upgrading gear, upgrading cards to enhance gear, and the long grind to get just ONE more warframe suit to use. It will take you HOURS, inclduing after the recent updates, to see progress, but in a F2P enviroment, that's kinda given isn't? On that note, for the MOST PART, it is pay to go faster, as ( anything outside of colors and extra slots ) can be earned without spending a cent onto the game...if you are pacent enough anyway...

Although it is almost impossible for low level players to solo most of the maps, it is a online game..so....why not make a team with other people.

review: Warframe is one of the best multiplayer games out there which is worth playing it. The game is simple, you play a role as a Tenno and fight enemies in outer space. When I started playing the game for the first time, I found it a bit hard to understand the interface especially on how to mod your warframe & weapons, how to use the foundry to build tools, how to obtain resources(played before update 11 was out)... because it somehow lacks the tutorial for such(i guess its one of the cons). Excalibur was my first warframe(actually it was Loki but then I made a new account to link with Steam and chose Exca instead). After a few rounds, I found it being addictive especially when playing with friends or random strangers online. The graphic is good and lovely. The dev really put aan effort to make the game more realistic despite making it fun and enjoyable to play. It kinda has this Mass Effect feel to it due to the space environment and being a 3rd person. The beautiful environment really brings up my mood to play the game more. Getting credits to buy stuff in the game can be hard since the items in the market require a lot of credits. Plus, most of the items sold require platinums, which you can't never get in-game and have to use real money and purchase it online. But that doesn't stop you from obtaining cool items like premium users. Instead of buying directly, you can buy the blueprints of the desired weapon from the market and build it in the foundry but you have to spent quite a lot of credits on the blueprint, excluding the materials you need to build the item and of course building cost and a long waiting time. Some items like Warframe can take up to 3 days to be built in the foundry and require rare materials such as Orokin cell, Neural sensors etc which is time - consuming. So if you can't buy the weapons straight away, you can use the alternate way, but it'll cost you. I don't think this game has any storyline but somehow it can be related to Dark Sector(previous game made by the same dev). So I can't say much about this because you don't have any clear goals other than fighting enemies, bosses and farming materials. But this game is always updated by the dev so there are surprises coming(new mission, warframe, weapon, boss etc) so keep yourself updated. So far I really enjoyed playing it, got new warframes and weapons in my inventory and unlocked a few systems. Overall, I would say it's a pretty decent game and I suggest that gamers out there should try this game. Play solo, or with friends or with random users, it can never seize to amaze you. So Tenno, get framed up and fight 'cause NINJAS PLAY FREE!!!

review: In all honesty and entirely an opinion, this is a very well made game. Having patches pretty much every week or so, DE manages to pull off some amazing things with this game. Now onto the game itself, it's a sci-fi third person shooter. This is one of those rare F2P games which can be enjoyed with friends,random people or just going in solo. The gameplay is pretty much what you would expect from a TPS, but you have a lot of movement and actions to pull off in this game, making you have that "ninja feel." If you're a person who does not mind farming for items or rather just enjoy that, this game has plenty of that. But after all that and finishing up your warframe or weapon, you'll have the satisfaction of just playing with a new toy you made. You have a wide variety of "Warframes" consisting of different powers to pretty much choose from and see what interests you the best. Weapons are always being put into the game to make things more interesting, from kunais,dual swords,scythes rockets, etc. The lore is another eye candy for those who love to read into games to learn their story. Now onto the topic of paying real money. You really don't need to give money to play this game. This game in no way is a P2W, I would say 70-80% of the items in the shop can be bought with in-game money or "alerts"(missions in which will give you special drops from time to time). But if you are to pay money it's only for cosmetics or space in your inventory, which in all honesty is not that bad since you can delete weapons which you don't feel you like anymore and move on.

review: Probably my favorite free game our there right now, others include Path of Exile, Ghost Recon Online, League of Legends, and Loadout. This is a great example of how the business model in a F2P game should be. Any item that you can buy for real money, you can easily get for free. Anything that you can't get for free is purely cosmetic. Graphics are great for a free game, and crafting a new gun or warfame just never seems to get boring. It is kind of a grindfest though, and after spending almost 200 hours into this, i'm starting to get burnt out... It's still in beta and I've heard that the devs are gonna start to change things a bit, make it more interesting. As it stands now its a must play. It's free, so theres nothing to lose :).

review: Warframe is a great sci-fi thirdperson shooter. The shooting feels great playing in the suits or "Warframes" feels great. The abilities are fun to use. And it seems to run fine on my old laptop. The game is still being updated and there are events quite often. There is actually a story in the game, not the best, not the worst. The game uses a easy-to-use card-based modding system to up your abilities, weapons etc. Plus: -Great variety of weapons and Warframes. -Everything in the game can be get without purchasing, except Warframe and weapons slots. -You get 70 Platinum (In-game currency.) to use when starting. I recommend spending them on weapon and Warframe slots. -Clan system and customisable dojo. -Big and easy-to-use card-based modding system to upgrade your gear. -Lots of different planets and missions. -Play with your friends using the in-game invitation system or play with random people via the in-game matchmaking. -Randomly generated levels. Cons: -The levels are randomly generated but they look the same a lot. -The prices in the shop are sometimes absurd. -A few bugs and glitches here and there but the game is in openbeta. -Some of the mechanics are sometimes unexplained. Like the parcour mechanic. -Foundy crafting is really irritating. -Joining a session via matchmaking is sometimes pretty irritating and sometimes just doesn't work. The game is still receiving updates and new weapons, Warframes etc. I give this game a 8.5/10.

Who can destabilize the atoms in enemies so they explode? Nova can. Who can suck enemies into a crushing ball? Vauban can. Who can summon the kraken to wreck havoc behind enemy lines? Hydroid can. Who can tank and ram trough enemy lines? Rhino can. Who can slash an enemy in half in mid air and make a gracefull landing? You can. Over 19 unique warframes to play with, each with a distinct playstyle. Craft new weapons to suit your playstyle, from grenade launchers to flame throwers to ninja stars. Oh and they have pistols too ;) Collect over 300 mods to customize your warframes and weapons, strengthen abilities and even add elemental damage types (fire, electricity) to your weapons. Fight against bosses, do alert missions which are only available for a limited time. Or help one of the two enemy factions in operations. The opposing team will not be happy with your interference and will send someone special after you at a later time... Or maybe you encounter the feared assassin named the Stalker? Replay certain missions on nightmare mode for an extra challenge, with a rare mod as a reward. Or will you go out into the Void to explore its secrets? Void towers are filled with loot, traps, parkour courses and hidden chambers. Go into a void ship to unlock the vault, and collect the secret artifact locked within. I could go on like this for a very long time, suffice to say that I really like this game! It may be a bit grindy at times, especially with newly added systems, but if you are willing to look past that it is a really good game. The devs have a weekly livestream and really listen to feedback and suggestions from the community. (S)Alad V for president! Enjoy your greedy milk!

review: This game is an absolute must if you are looking for a quick and dirty third person shooter. From free running mechanics to a huge selection of weapons, this game features lots of customization options, great graphics, and a back-story that gets extremely strange when the fans have dealt with it. (Space potatoes, anyone?) You can sink some real world money into this game, but it is far from required in order to progress. There are server errors from time to time and occasional disconnection issues. Coming form a game in open beta though, Warframe does a great job of offering what could very well be a finished project. "Sensors show a security force coming your way. It's the Grineer..."

You wake up from a pod to find that there is a massive galactic war between two factions; Corpus and Grineer. You fight your war through to survive forging your own path to either fight to unite the surviving Tenno and be the war monger species that kept the universe under control with ancient technology known as Warframes or to fight only for the riches. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Character Design- The characters you play are soundless agile ninja that you get almost full customization of. You re guided by a burden navigator known as "Lotus" She is used to guide you and warn you of oncoming danger in game, however, like all Navi talk through, they are just annoying. Bosses can be exceedingly hard and there is a good amount of enemy variation between the Corpus, Grinneers, and Infested. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Sound & Artwork- The music is enemy triggered and it is seemly soundless when you're not being hunted down or in fire fights. There is barely any musical style to the game. Sounds are basic with Armor clashing against blade and bullets burrowing through flesh into bone. You can hear a good lot of the damage you inflict. Visually the game is gorgeous, even on the lowest settings the environment and characters always look shockingly great. A thing to note down is the blur effects that can happen when in huge skirmishes. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Gameplay- With all the cons of the style of the game this is where it takes my heart. The gameplay is amazing, with a ton of map variation that is not the same a good portion of time, the hack and slash feel mixed with strategic gun play and puzzles. It makes me feel like I am playing Ninja Gaiden with better controls and guns. Fast passed loot fest action and incredible special abilities make for an amazing rush. there are a few bugs right now due to it being in BETA. The customization in Warframe is wide but complex when it comes to upgrading. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Conclusion- All in all I'd have to give the game an 8.75/10 Due to all the faults it has. Even with it being in BETA. The replay value however will be 10/10 because if you like it you'll stick with it through the whole thing for awhile. I know I do. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

review: Its diffrent from most games but its sooo fun. The only problem i had so far is how many warframes and weapon slots you can have. Its annoying cause you have to spend money for more slots. But from that its one of my top games atm.

review: I have spent (unbeknownst to me) over 300 hours playing this game and I have nothing but positive things to say. Despite the fact that many free-to-play games often require you to pay in order to progress, this isn't true with Warframe. As I've learned from the very beginning you could play for hours-upon-hours without having to spend a single penny. It wasn't until I was nearing 100 hours that I realized how much I enjoyed this game. Not only that, but I also thought that investing in (platinum for) the game would only help make my already-pleasant experience even better. Warframe has evolved alot in the small amount of time that I've played it. Through player purchases the developers have added new maps, new mods, a killer melee battling system, and outstanding and unique missions and modes that only add to the spontaneity of this game. Just imagine a game that mixes Ninja Gaiden with Call of Duty with Vanquish. From my own personal experience, it's worth checking out - especially if you're a college student (like myself) and are strapped for spending money on the new games coming out every-so-often. Give this game a shot and I'm sure you will come to find at least a few things that make Warframe a fun, great, and unique experience. Game On. - Lenny

review: Rating: ++++ Very fun game, however you do need to put some time in it and get into the game to get good gear and stuff like that. one very big plus of this game is that all gear can be crafter with resouces you gain troughout the game, so even if you dont have the money you can still have everything that somone who pays also has. with the exeption of a few decorational stuff wich does not affect gameplay.

review: A fun co-op fps with leveling elements. In addition to your characters, your account, weapons and minions gain levels as you progress. With higher levels, you can apply modules to your items, increasing various attributes in them. Modules themselves are drops, and the module collecting and building your gear mechanics feel like deck building in a collectible card game. The game is peer-hosted, which probably helps keep the game free to play, but also means that you will sometimes end up playing on a server that is hosted on a connection that can't handle the bandwidth requirements of four players. This can be somewhat resolved with ping-filtering peers, especially if you have the connection and cpu power to host yourself. Almost everything in the game can be obtained without paying real money (except character/weapon slots), but as usual, time is money, and helps you progress faster.

review: I downloaded it initialy becouse it was a free game on steam. it sat there after my first few mision for a couple months, i practicly ignored it at first but then i relize people in my guild wars clan were enthralled by it, since then I,ve played it for about a week and it brought me closer to people in my guild i sooner hadent even known funny how stuff like that can work. to really love and understand this game you need to know a few things the current priceing for a few packs like excaliber prime is a project to give people limited time weapons to further increase production of the game as awhole. this game is currently in open beta and as such has some bugs most of wich are negligable. the currency system gives players the ability to buy everything no grind required get your warframe your guns and off you go to be some kinda crazy space ninja. the most importent part of the game however is that if you purchase the high end 200$ bundle your ideas can truely play an ear and major roll in development. some can say thats a bad thing but howmeany opertunitys to you find now a day to actualy controle the content in your persistent world. in closeing the game is majorly focused on co-op not pvp in fact the devs words pvp will go as far as friendly sparing nothing more. i think thats as far as i can stress how awsome this game is and can potentialy be its free you have nothing to lose

review: Amazing free to play-Action rpg "shooter" (Warframe needs a genre description of its own,don't make the mistake of thinking of the usual  quality for f2p-shooters,this is something else.) + Great quality for a f2p-game with constant updates and improvements. + It's completely free,you don't have to spend any money on anything unless you want to (no restrictions) and all of the platinum purchases are convenience. + There's a wide selection of Warframes,weapons and cosmetic items and new stuff is constantly getting added. + Tons of content,altho quality of the content varies,it is mostly lobby-based indoor tunnel-shooting missions and levels can get repetetive since there isn't an awful lot of variation in environment and mission types. But again,new stuff is getting added on a regular basis and the developers are good at their jobs and listen to the community. + Great for Coop-play,up to 4players in a squad,different outloads and frames can work well together and make things easier,and there's plenty of challenges such as survival and endless defense missions with waves of increasingly difficult enemies. -The community is a mixed bag but still a LOT better than most f2p shooters. But since it is a free-to-play and literally anyone can pick this up (+console players) you'll still see a lot of kids,spamming and allcaps attentionwhoring. If you haven't played this game I can only recommend you try it out,you've got nothing to lose but potentially a bit (or lot) of your time^^ It's surprisingly good for a free to play and oozing quality.

review: Warframe while not being the best f2p games I have played is defiantly one of the better ones. While it is true that you spend alot of time grinding, and that the silver(ingame currency paid with real money) is oddly expensive those do not take away the fun of the game.

review: Warframe is a special type of game as compared to other games... There are few games that will make you fell quite as much of a badass at level one before abruptly reminding you that well youre just that level 1. With your little rifle and weak armour. Then as you work your way up from there you begin to fell that badassness from day 1 creeping back up your spine youve finally crafted your own weapon and are slaughtering endless waves of enemies with it while your teammates (in your imagination anyway) Stand there in awe of your awesome power. Warframe is a very interesting experience. It doesnt have any pay to win mechanism but more of a pay to shot theings fast mechanism. The fact that you can most probably (With the right set of friends) Play the game from level 1 till youve finished mnost of the game so far, without spending any money at all is a good sign. the item crafting can get a bit tedious sending oyu off to systems that you quite frankly are affraid of you will find that that sweet joy of finally crafting a weapon to your likeness, or finding out that the weapon you just spent hours crafting if of no use what-so-ever. Can be almost enjoyable. The story and the quests following a sort of Space ninja group known as the tenno is slightly watered out to make way for all the awesome looking graphics and weapons(Pew pew all the way). But that isnt saying that the story is weak not at all. I have found myself at some points almost talking to the lotus(The AI entity that will guide you through the game) and its heavy reliance on co-operative play (I tried single player... Died on every mission) makes you sometimes feel a bit depressed as you sit staring at the mission you want to play while the next wave of players steadily approaches. All in all Warfarme is a very balanced game although the pay-to-shoot-things-faster-mechanic can get quite annoying, no game is perfect right?

review: This game is alot of fun and quite addictive when you get into it. The game is constantly being butchered to death, balance wise, by it's developer though. There are also a ton of bugs and really strange design choices that wonder if the people in charge are mentally handicapped or have actually ever played any video games before. Great game overall though. Just be prepared for bugs bugs and more bugs. Be prepared for things being nerfed when they don't need to be and things that do need to be nerfed being left alone.

The gameplay is wonderful, bringing together elements from third-person-shooters, RPGs and MMOs and combining them into something new. The graphical design is nothing short of beautiful, dazzling the players with a variety of levels and effects! The audio quality is great. There is nothing nicer than hearing the drums of war start to play rhythmically as you enter battle. Finally, the community is large, diverse and friendly.

review: Love this game, been playin since befor I used Steam and was using Raptr. Awesome gameplay, easy to use controller support, vived lush graphics, excellent voices, tons of content with new content added regularly, and fun co-op. Super fun game to play for free. Now for gripes (Though Very Few), The story is very lacking, its not really in your face you have to be looking for it but there is one, also this game gets seriously repetitive and if your not playing with friends or a team that talks as you play... You get bored and last but not least.... This game is a Epic GRIND. If you dont wanna spend money to get other warframes or speed up the process of leveling and crafting this game will eventually make you put it down because of repetitive grinding. That Being Said... This Game Is Awesome and I recommend anyone give a shot... Its free for Goodness sake! And lets not comment on the epicness of playing this on a Big 1080 TV with surround Sound, and Dualshock 4, and Steams Awesome Big Picture mode!

review: This is a fast paced 3rd person shooter. In the short time I have been playing this game, there have been 2 major updates. Both have improved the game play and longevity of the game. I have enjoyed both of the live events I was able to participate in. Generally this is a game where you are going to have to experiment with different Warframes ( classes) and wepon combinations to find your happy place. Once you learn the intricacies of useing and powering up the mods for your warframes and weapons you are sure to have some fun. This is a free to play game with a cash shop, but never fear you can find most everything, other than cosmetic items, through game play.

review: Warframe is a great way of playing some F2P 3rd person shooter action. Warframe is still in beta, and it seems that the devs are happy to take on board advice from the fans, so hopefully a few of the details that could use polish still have a chance to be completed. With the price of entry a flat nothing, it would be a shame to miss out on quite a bit of fun to be had here.

review: Warframe is essentially a grind-fest with fantastic gameplay and visuals. It borrows heavily from Diablo-style loot drops, although none of this is explained in-game. I recommend using a wiki if you fall in love with this game, as it has a suprisingly deep character customization set, though don't expect to get much visual upgrades as most of the "mods" that drop function essentially like a MMO-talent tree. Lots of fun, but bring friends if you plan on sticking around.

Over 19 unique warframes to play with, each with a distinct playstyle. Craft new weapons to suit your playstyle, from grenade launchers to flame throwers to ninja stars. Oh and they have pistols too ;) Collect over 300 mods to customize your warframes and weapons, strengthen abilities and even add elemental damage types (fire, electricity) to your weapons. Fight against bosses, do alert missions which are only available for a limited time. Or help one of the two enemy factions in operations. The opposing team will not be happy with your interference and will send someone special after you at a later time... Or maybe you encounter the feared assassin named the Stalker? Replay certain missions on nightmare mode for an extra challenge, with a rare mod as a reward. Or will you go out into the Void to explore its secrets? Void towers are filled with loot, traps, parkour courses and hidden chambers. Go into a void ship to unlock the vault, and collect the secret artifact locked within. I could go on like this for a very long time, suffice to say that I really like this game! It may be a bit grindy at times, especially with newly added systems, but if you are willing to look past that it is a really good game. The devs have a weekly livestream and really listen to feedback and suggestions from the community. (S)Alad V for president! Enjoy your greedy milk!

review: really fun, can get repetitive, but you will be too addicted to getting new weapons to notice, the gameplay is great. you will need to put a lot of time into this game, unless you want to pay your way through, i havent wasted a single cent and i wreck people in pvp. Runs very easily, even in not that great machines, a good 500mb video card should do the trick, but still, great graphics

review: I reccomend all peoplle to at least try out Warframe, it has a bit of a rough start, but once you get into it, it is an amazingly fun game. Microtransactions are not required at all, and the only thing that can't be bought without money is slots and cosmetics.

review: This game is an absolute must if you are looking for a quick and dirty third person shooter. From free running mechanics to a huge selection of weapons, this game features lots of customization options, great graphics, and a back-story that gets extremely strange when the fans have dealt with it. (Space potatoes, anyone?) You can sink some real world money into this game, but it is far from required in order to progress. There are server errors from time to time and occasional disconnection issues. Coming form a game in open beta though, Warframe does a great job of offering what could very well be a finished project. "Sensors show a security force coming your way. It's the Grineer..."

review: The Facts- Game rating based on the ESRB Single-player and Multi-Player [Online] Platforms: Microsoft Windows and Playstation 4 Developer: Digital Extremes Genre: Third Person Shooter/ Hack n' Slash ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Plot- You are a survivor of a alien species known as Tenno, thought to have been extinct long before the games start. You wake up from a pod to find that there is a massive galactic war between two factions; Corpus and Grineer. You fight your war through to survive forging your own path to either fight to unite the surviving Tenno and be the war monger species that kept the universe under control with ancient technology known as Warframes or to fight only for the riches. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Character Design- The characters you play are soundless agile ninja that you get almost full customization of. You re guided by a burden navigator known as "Lotus" She is used to guide you and warn you of oncoming danger in game, however, like all Navi talk through, they are just annoying. Bosses can be exceedingly hard and there is a good amount of enemy variation between the Corpus, Grinneers, and Infested. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Sound & Artwork- The music is enemy triggered and it is seemly soundless when you're not being hunted down or in fire fights. There is barely any musical style to the game. Sounds are basic with Armor clashing against blade and bullets burrowing through flesh into bone. You can hear a good lot of the damage you inflict. Visually the game is gorgeous, even on the lowest settings the environment and characters always look shockingly great. A thing to note down is the blur effects that can happen when in huge skirmishes. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Gameplay- With all the cons of the style of the game this is where it takes my heart. The gameplay is amazing, with a ton of map variation that is not the same a good portion of time, the hack and slash feel mixed with strategic gun play and puzzles. It makes me feel like I am playing Ninja Gaiden with better controls and guns. Fast passed loot fest action and incredible special abilities make for an amazing rush. there are a few bugs right now due to it being in BETA. The customization in Warframe is wide but complex when it comes to upgrading. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Conclusion- All in all I'd have to give the game an 8.75/10 Due to all the faults it has. Even with it being in BETA. The replay value however will be 10/10 because if you like it you'll stick with it through the whole thing for awhile. I know I do. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

review: You should try Warframe if you like: - Third Person Shooters - Run 'n' Gun - PvE - Co-op You shouldn't try Warframe if you: - Don't like grinding. - Don't want to spend some money in-game. ----- Pros: - Awesome Graphics (Support for some nVidia Physx effects) - Awesome gameplay (Awesome acrobatic stuff! Also, the melee system is going to be overhauled soon so keep an eye open for that) - Wide variaty of Warframes & Weapons (Primary, Secondary and Melee Weapons) (AND IT JUST KEEPS INCREASING!) - Great co-op experience! I've had hours of fun with friends. - Frequent Events that can last up to weeks, with unique weapons/mods as reward. - It has a promising future. Lots of great stuff to be added to the game! Cons: - IMO the game is not 100% enjoyable without spending some $//. All Weapons/Warframes are obtainable without spending real money, but you will feel limited because of the amount of Weapon/Warframe slots available from the beggining. I'd say... Tops 20 $// would be more than enough to make your Warframe experience better. But it is worth it! - The grinding... As I said, everything can be obtainable in-game but that doesn't mean it is EASY/TIME CONSUMING. Some stuff will be very frustating to get. FINAL NOTE: Should you try Warframe? YES! It is an amazing game, built mostly with the funding of fans of the game. It is free to play but it will become fully enjoyable after spending some real money in-game. But as I said before it will be worth it!

review: This a great game and fun to play with friends. The powers, acrobatic, and gunplay and swordplay are amazing. But this game is money hungry, to get weapons and different classes you'll have to to wait and pay alot of in-game currency and it tempts you to buy another in-game currency that you have to buy with real life money which allows to buy weapon and classes and not have to wait hours to make. If you can look past not having all the great weapons(not the best) at the begining or for a little while this game is for you.

This game is an amazing looking game that when I feel like going outside I just go on the earth map and stare at the sun but for not to long because I dont want to go blind. The relistic feeling about being outside is really amazing that it hurts less that I haven't left my house in 3 years.

review: Takes forever to get new equipment, but its an overall fun game. The developers are churning out a decent amount of new content on a regular basis, which is nice considering more f2p games dont get as much attention. Once you get the blueprints needed for new gear, finding materials to craft it can be a bit of a bother. Once you find the materials, you have to wait hours and sometimes days to craft the item you want. Real time. That really kills the momentum of the game when youre forced to wait so long to continue playing with the items you want. Of course, if you can afford the incredibly expensive platinum currency, waiting wont be an issue. They have to make money somehow, right? The only other negative I can think of is the melee combat. For a game based around it being known as "Mass Effect Online with Swords", it doesnt have much going for the melee. Attacks can sometimes be difficult to land in rapid succession, and the damage done doesnt warrant using anything besides jumping and charged attacks. Everything besides that is great. Graphics, sound, controls, everything is appealing and easy to pick up. Definitely one of the best free-to-play games I've ever enjoyed.

review: Extremely fun, particularly with friends. New tilesets are being added almost every update, and where once there were a handful of re-used levels, they're moving rapidly towards one or several unique looks for every planetary sector. Player customization, while unfortunately heavily cash-gated, is constantly growing. Weapon variety is everything you could want, and again, is still growing. Enemies and bosses are varied, and even with that variety, the devs have confirmed a FOURTH hostile faction to be added at a later date. In short: this game has quite a few strong points that grow stronger with every update. One caveat: be prepared to exercise either patience or your credit card. New stuff is either crafted very slowly or bought for an assload of dosh. I can forgive the bugs because it's still open beta, and they do correct them fairly quickly. However, the frankly absurd exchange rate of "Platinum" versus actual goods bought hurts it in my opinion, as that gating has turned almost a dozen of my friends off from joining. 8/10

review: What can I say about Warframe that hasn't already been said? Space ninjas. Grinding. Awesome combat thanks to Melee 2.0. (Look it up, or better yet, play it!) I would recommend joining a clan though, the best gear is clan research. The grinding can be reduced by buying boosters or actually buying the items from the store. However, that's horrifically expensive and makes me think that the devs WANT you to grind and PLAY THE GAME. The shop's there for the few impatient people who NEED everything and need it NOW. tl;dr, play it, it's free.

review: This is a great FTP game with ways to earn all the weapons and suits that you want. The paid transactions allow you to gain access to items faster, cosmetic items, and credit and affinity (XP) boosters, but in a game that is mostly about cooperation, it does not affect the overall balance. The developer is good about getting out bug fixes on a regular basis, as well as the major updates. The overall community is great and are very helpful. There are a great variety of maps throughout the whole game as well as weapons and character types. There is some PVP elements, but they are still a work in progress. The only issues that have cropped up are the random (and sometimes amusing) bugs and some of the newer areas they add do not have a lot of areas to randomize and they will repeat more often than not. Overall, this is a great game for coop play and well worth any time and, if you so choose, money.

review: This is one of the best free to games that I have ever played. Basically it's about space ninjas and every ninja has its own powers and stats. You can also build your own weapons, which is really fun to do because you have to travel to all differant places to get the resources required to make the item you want. The game gives you a lot of things to do but it is a little rough to get into. Totally deserves a better rating.

review: With good visuals and good combat mechanics, this game shifts the player interest rather quickly from the grinding for leveling up and grinding loot, to spend more time creating new weapons and armors in the furnace or customizing the dojo, a spaceship every clan can create and personalize in order to exchange mod cards, train together and develop new weapons and tactical gear. The RPG-like character and gear customization side of the game is what keeps the player to look into the mechanics for some time, looking for the best mods to upgrade the armor and weapons efficiency with loadouts for specific enemies or jack-of-all-trades combinations of effects. With every update the variety of environments seems to increase, partially making it up for the lack of variety in the mission types available and the lack of cinematic events happening during the missions. One of the most important things this game still really lacks is a more involving storyline, and even though some special events added new characters and new story details from time to time it's still not enough. It also does have a PVP component that adds variety, but it still needs to be balanced better since higher level players can easily own lower level ones in a matter of seconds making it less about fighting skills and more about crafting and choosing accurately the best gear available. Even if it still sounds good in theory it can also end up in unfair fights unless the two sides decide the gear to use beforehand. Warframe is a very nice free to play game to try and play casually, the grinding for specific loot can give some hours of mindless fun with big explosions, fast nicely coreographed action and a good feel for the weapons and powers, it's not that heavy in terms of HDD space since the levels are assembled randomly by the game engine every time, and in time eventually the developers will be able to add that extra depth and balance for story and gameplay so that it will become a game players will be able to invest more time into, without getting bored by its repetitiveness.

review: Highly recommend it, definitely the best free to play game I've played so far. It's hard to imagine them not charging people for this game. The co-op play is a bit lackluster compared to the single player experience though because the quality of gameplay depends on which user is hosting. So if the user has a very slow upload speed, you could be thrown out of the game or fail the mission because of that. Game levels go by very quickly in co-op, but for a very scary and intense immersive experience, I highly recommend just changing the game mode to single player.

review: Do you like ninjas? Do you like killing hundreds of dudes with guns, swords, rocket launchers, laser beams, electro-grenades, shurikens and super powers? Do you need a cohesive narrative to tie together one murdering spree to another? If you answered Yes, yes and no, then WARFRAME is the game for you! This game is a fast paced slaughter fest, which pits you and 3 optional teammates against hundreds of soldiers all out for solar conquest. You run around randomly generated "tile sets" completing various objectives, gathering resources and mods for crafting and upgrading your equipment respectively, all while performing some amazing acrobatic moves. There's a vast array of weaponry available to you, from the simple yet efficient gun, to laser miniguns, to stealth grenades and jet-powered maces. Due to the game being free to play, all these weapons are available to purchase with real money. However every weapon and character in the game can be built using the aforementioned resources. There are over a dozen characters to collect, each of them filling out a unique role for the team. Every role from your damage-sponging tank to your healer is available, including some more interesting roles such as the berserker or necromancer. The missions are all available on a star chart, which will put you in a randomly generated map with certain pre-determined conditions, such as enemy faction, tile-set, available resources and mission type. There is no kind of "story mode" where you gradually progress through a narrative. You spend a lot of time doing these missions trying to level up your gear, and ultimately yourself, which makes more weapons available to you. Overall, an amazing shooter game to play on your own or with friends. It can get a bit repetitive at times, as tiles will eventually get repeated, but it is a great way to kill the time (and also hundreds of guys)

This game is all about playing for fun,unlocking new content, having a clan , socialize with people and more fun. This game is a team-based game , with a Co-Op feature , a Private feature and a Solo feature.You begin as a poor tenno,then you will become a master of the old ways. You will find yourself with other people hunting for rare items or even going to kill the Bosses that terrorized their army.This game if fun, I recommend it!

review: This game is seriously the best Free to Play game i have seen come out in awhile. Its really fun being able to play with your friends or just others online. However I noticed that plaing solo can be challenging for new players, and the whole upgrading your warframe, weapons etc. isnt very clear. it took me about a week to finally figure out how upgrades really work and how you use them. The graphics on this game are amazing even at the lowest setting. the levels never really get boring, and its chalk full of different ways to play. Me personally i like to sneak around and kill unsuspecting enemies. Overall the game is a well put together game. (note: this is a 3rd person, so keep that in mind based on your preference) If they had put this game up for sale, i would buy it. thats how great this game is. even if your not a 3rd person kind of player, i suggest downloading it and just play 1 or 2 rounds, you'll understand why there is so much hype for this new game. Now the other con to this game is that many of your weapon arsenal will have to be paid with real world money, which is sometimes for those budget gamers, "a pain in the " but they give you an option to buy a blueprint, find all the things needed to build it, and then actually build it, this doesnt cost real worl money, but it costs game money, which is fairly easy to obtain. once you really get into the game you really wont notice that your gun is bad, in fact they can stand a really good chance against most enemys, so having a new gun isnt a "must have". you can make your warframe look amazing, you choose skins and all different kinds of things. you start with 50 p and later you would have to go buy more with actual money if you want to customize more. hope this helps you guys out.

review: Beware Tenno your ability to be a true space ninja might be greatly hampered! Warframe is a Free to play third person shooter with light RPG elements (that's a whole lot of things) but what it boils down to is this. You are a Tenno, a secret race of space ninjas awakened by the lotus to bring back peace in the galaxy. You do this by operating warframes. Warframes are combat suits and have different combat capabilities, at the start you must choose from three different frames. The missions themself are fairly straight forward, things like exterminate, rescue and defense are your standard fair in these kind of games. The weapons are fun to use and more unlock as you gain higher ranks. This game is an absolute blast with 2 or more friends (4 people per mission) and really soaks up hours without you noticing it. Not everything is right in the land of space ninjas however, questionable DLC and design choices might have you wonder if investing your time is really worth it. Let me begin by saying that pretty much everything you can acquire ingame can also be bought with real life money converted into platinum. This might seem alright on paper, but the prices for these weapons, warframes and other items are questionable. Then again you could also forego this and just grind yourself to a better place in the space ninja ranks. Another thing that hampers the experience is the slew of bugs still present, while the development team has been pretty consistent with bugfixes there are still issues with things and the dev team has a tendency of bringing back old bugs on accident, while they had been fixed a couple of patches ago. Your experiences may vary with others but be prepared. Last but not least is the music, if you like a game with a good soundtrack, this one is not for you. There's only a small amount of tracks and they are all rather dull to listen to. You're better off building your own soundtrack for this game. If all these lowpoints haven't scared you off, I'd suggest you try it out. The game is free to play after all.

review: A pretty fun, free to play third person shooter taking place in corridors of space stations and planetside colonies. Each suit (Warframe) has different abilities to mix and match, and there's a wide variety of guns and melee weapons to collect and level up. The movement is fun and the wall-running, rolling, dodging, sprinting all feel fun to pull off and look pretty cool to boot. There are fairly regular major updates, and the level layouts - although using a lot of the same assets - are somewhat randomly generated, as to keep the gameplay from getting too stale. However, to obtain the higher level gear takes ages collecting materials and crafting, or for you to pony up some cash to just buy them. It's grindy as all hell if you're going for the end game experience and don't want to shell out for high level gear, but it's still a fun time killer that you don't have to pay for if you don't want to.

review: Great game, especially for a F2P. You don't need spend money to enjoy or advance in this game, everything's pretty much available through plans to assemble items and mats are quite easily farmed in game. Varied missions and goals, mobs, and boss fights. The addictive part is leveling your character and its weapons.

review: Warframe is a very good F2P TPS and has a wonderful community of gamers that are easy to get a long with. The game play is smooth and nice graphics but the only problem is there are a lot of maps that seem like you have seen before, Meaning it seems like there are maps that they used before but just put a few new things in it. Also you can drop a lot of money in the game if you get into it because of different customization for warframs and sentinels. You can also buy weapons with your plat but for the player that just wants have a fun game with not droping a dime there is goos news for you. almost everything you see in the store you can build in game with no real money charges it just takes longer to obtain that item. So i give WarFrame 8.5/10 and recommend you give it a try!

review: This game is one of the best Fps co-opperation games i have played.From dense action to ninja like silence is the game filled with some bosses have a very unique design and a good back story and few information about their mechanism can turn the table. Weapons have their own unique mechanism stats and complex design that every weapons i worth a try and mastering the style of use is a key the battle ground.Neither good or evil the Tenno stands never alone against his foes the Warframe is the strongest weapon and deep story can hide behind the shell what is known is that they are hunting for us fellows Tennos so be on the look out.To not get hunted down by the Stalker.

review: This game is absolutely beautiful, and criminally overlooked. the developers, though very new to the MMO scene, have been constantly and tirelessly listenning to community input and giving out tons of awesome things to the players that have been around forever, not tomention has somehow predicted almost everything i wanted out of a shooter gae back when i was in like 8th grade or something and to top it all off it's 100% free to play, meanng there is no excuse to at leas try it yes it's buggy, but it's still in it's beta test stage. Digital Extremes has put their all into making an extremely diverse, unimaginably expansive and all-encompassing gameplay that brings several core gameplay types together in a way that synergizes like no other game i've seen, and they manage to do it with a sense of dirty humour that lightens the mood before those pesky server updates that make people restart their games i whole-heartedly recommend WARFRAME to anyone interested in a fun, albeit grindy, experience did i mention it's on PC, PS3/4, and XBOne? 9.999999999999999999/10 because the menu hub is really laggy for no reason on any computer i've used to play the game, but it doesn't interfere with the gameplay in any way

review: Over 700 hours played uuuh.... guess I like it Best way I can describe this game is "Borderlands 2" mixed with "Hellgate london" In space, with Eve-Online Progression. 4 person Co-op "over the shoulder" shooter, with Ninja jumps, wall running, sliding flip kick hammer attacks, bows, Shotguns, assault rifles.... and each frame has 4 Abilitys, Invisibility/Aoe heal/Aoe disarm/Aoe stun/Charge/Knockdown/Aoe Death!/Melee attack boost/dots/teleports/deployable shields The game exists in the Perma "Open Beta" like dungeon defenders did for 2 years and like every game released now does, so they have the excuse "hey its only beta" for comicall game inballance and garbage skills Its totally Free to play, and you "can" acsess ALL CONTENT.... totally free But it will take you a few months, there are currently 13 warframes to unlock and 31 weapons, you can unlock them by farming the bluprints, Farming materials and spending 3-4 days crafting or spending 10 pounds for each frame and 3-9 pounds for weapons. You start with a choice of 3 frames, A standard frame Excalibur with a Very powerful aoe melee slide attack and decent aoe, Then a Stealth frame Loki that is really good mid and endgame, but will struggle early on And a high shield caster frame, with more utility that damage Mag. There are over 100 Missions to complete and unlock but mostly they are the same type repeated in a different ship, and a couple of them blur into take this here Raid - Rush in steal somthing Spy - steal data from 4 computers around the zone Deception - plant a bomb in the ships engines?? Extermination - Kill x bad guys Defense - Defense a pod/core against waves and waves of baddies can carry on forever if you choose after 5 waves Mobile defense - run about defending multiple points and finally 1 point while a virus is uploaded or a computer is.... Assassination - Murder one of the 10 or so big boss mobs in the game and Void key missions which follow one of the above formulas in a really pretty zone, wth a little puzzle solving. since the last few updates there are about 6 new mission types and more planets There are 3 races each with multiple mob types .... Currently I think the game Is hard to get in to, you need to get new warframes to experiance alot of the fun, your really need to spend at least a little money on a warframe to get you started, alot of the "Fun" weapons require mastery, which needs a few days to get up. Your starting weapons are crap and you need to upgrade them fast or you quickly get bored There is also a log of missing in game information. you get a screen of 30 weapons Wham in the face, and all they say is, Accuracy 10, Fire rate 3, damage 40. What they don't say is Weapon A has armor ignoor and Rapes lines of mobs, Weapon B has 10 shots in its clip and pisses them out meaning you can only use it as a backup, Weapon C has a hidden charge attack stat that does 4x more damage! Wikia helps alot Big online commuity turning into guilds... and.... MMO.... but not needed Fun game, worth trying and its Free, it really is... unless you want a bright pink sword that will cost you 3.99 to unlock bright colour pallet I reccoment steams warframe starter pack, then watch

review: Slicing and dicing your way through hordes of enemies never felt more satisfying. I highly recommend this for people who love hack and slash games or people who love strategy and planning, this game's got plenty of both. I think one of the only cons are that if you have an average (Not for gaming, or average Laptop) computer, you might want to go to through the graphics settings and turn off all of the motion blur, flashy lights, and lens flares.

review: This game is tons of fun. The devs obiously listen to their players, and the re-playablity is good, and it has to be considering it's kind of a neccesity for the game. I mean we ask for trading, they give us the Trading Stand. You can't trade weapons or warframes, so not exactly what we wanted, but, hey, they're trying. In fact, i actually had a friend who didn't like the game because there was no PVP, and that was the case for most people. They asked for it, and they received. The fact that the game devs actually try to please their players is what makes me recommend this game to anyone who is on the fence about playing. The only reason i can see people not liking this game or not playing it is because of the gore in it, and i would hardly call it gore. I mean, there is definatly worse out there. Also, the gore is brought upon by the player, not by the game. If you don't want gore, then don't use a katana. So, for any parents reading this, i wouldn't be too worried about this game. For more information on what happens in the game itself, look

review: Great game, with a lot of fun to be had. You'll have much more fun if you choose to play as part of a group, however. This is not a solo game by any means (even if you reach the point where you can overpower all content outside of the void), and leveling is much faster as part of a team. The game needs more difficult content, though. A well coordinated squad with strong weapons and frames trivializes ALL content currently in the game.

review: This is a just wonderful game, I've seen no other like it. All the maps are procedurally generated, the rooms are the same, but arranged completely different every time, and the map could be long one play through, and short the next, on top of all that, every planet in the system has its own environment type, so you'll come across many interesting landscapes, and every playthourgh of a mission, there's a chance of there being a different penalty, for example, if there is ice in the level, it will reduce your maximum shields, and sometimes there'll be fire, making the terrain hazardous.. Every piece of equipment, including your warframe, has its own level, and your account does too. There are several different warframes/classes for you to find and build, and one of them is bound to suit your playstyle, not to mention a large arsenal of weapons to choose from, but you must earn the credits to unlock these. Eventually, if you get enough credits, you can buy a Sentinel, a small floating robot that'll hover over your shoulder, and support you any way you have it configured. Also, every piece of equipment has specific mods that will work for it, such as damage types, fire, ice, shock, armor piercing, rate of fire, reload time, and many more,, you can also level every mod up to a certain limit to increase its potential. There is an extensive crafting system, you find certain materisl in each system, and you use these to complete blueprints you've found or bought with credits, in order to create new gear, or even warframes. If you get really good, you can run along walls, and keep jumping to other surfaces, to speed your self up far more than a regular run would. It takes some decent aim to to a good job, and good reflexes, so come on and give this game a try, it is very fun indeed.

review: I have played it for 3 days now. Recreating my review. This game has a bittersweet taste of fun and pay. At first it feels like you have to pay for everything, but after some time playing it, I've found out that you can get probably every item you could buy with real money, or the ingame currency "Platinum" which is bough with real money, also with just some time. And that is the real reason to play this game. It's not really about killing every boss or playing every mission or getting every achievement. It's about spending time ingame. And for me, playing this game, is getting new warframes and crafting new weapons. And after getting them, leveling them is the next part. But as lovely as it is to play this game, it's also a bit annoying that you can only have 4 warframes at a time without spending a single coin. And spending money in this game makes me kinda angry. There is an online rating for the ingame currency "Platinum", which says that 75 Platinum is around 5$. Most Warframes cost around 225 Platinum and some of the cooler ones cost 375. Most of the Warframes are gainable through resource gathering and buying the Blueprints for them with Credits (The other, ingame gainable, currency in Warframe). One problem there is, you only have 4 Warframes slots if you don't want to pay for this game. That means, you can have 4 Warframes at a time, while players who pay can have a pile of them. The game is called Warframe, why would you do this with the items the game is called after? I'd prefer a way to gain these slots ingame. All in all is this game a nice longtime game with a lot of cooperation between players. The community is nice aswell. Hell you can even ask them if they taxi you to a mission you don't have access yet. I will keep playing this game and might aswell put some money into it to get more Warframe slots.

review: Many gamers have "THAT" game. The game that you will spend hours on, farming for one item. The game that you would willingly spend more time than sleeping on. For me, that game is Warframe. I origianally started Warframe as a skeptic. The name is somewhat vague, and the gameplay looked fairly ordinary. However, the pathetically high number of hours I have logged are evidence of why I'm glad I stuck with it. Warframe calls itself a Beta so they can get away with major changes to the game that a full game wouldn't. That being said, I haven't seen an update I disagreed with. Not even the almost complete rewrite of the damage system. It was a wierd adjustment but I feel it works better now. If you want a game that is a full polished product then you should skip over Warframe The name itself is a little strange, that is until, you get into the game when it is explained. A "Warframe" is the armor that you, a Tenno wear into battle. Each Warframe is equipped with unique and powerful abilities. These abilities include; a time shattering stomp, invisibility, setting the world on fire and sooo much more. On top of these insane powers, you bring weapons into battle as well. A primary weapon, which can be a rifle, shotgun, sniper, laser cannon, or even a bow and arrow! Your secondary can be a pistol, dual or single wield, a hand crossbow, throwing knives, and there's even an exploding gel gun for chrissakes! The melee weapons get just as fun. There are of course swords and daggers, but you can also wield an energy whip, dual hand axes or a freakin hammer! There is very little PvP in Warframe, it's really just for settling Big  Contests and for friends to test their new gear. The game is entirely based around PvE. Whether you're slaughtering an endless horde or trying to take out one specific VIP, there's always something to shoot, smash and generally  up. If you've read this far...thank you. But despite my praise there are a couple cons to this game as well. The game can be hard to start for one thing. The beginner weapons are beyond noobish, and if you pick the experienced Warframe as your starter and don't like him.....leveling up will be a complete pain in the . Adjusting to third person can also be a problem for some players.....it was for me. Another problem I do have though, is with the grinding. There is a lot. Sometimes you need one material to make the last piece for your new Warframe and you just can't get it. This can get demoralizing, but just take a break. Play something else for a day or two and come back fresh. Also, tramwork is sometimes in short supply. Many players are just grinding for materials or trying to finish off a planet. Because of this you rarely find anyone who will run with you. This is less of a problem it could be thanks to independant looting. If a rare mod is dropped, it's there for everyone, and most players will run back to revive you, should you down. If you want to talk though....you had better have some friends. All in all Warframe is a great game that never really gets old. The Devs keep in regular contact with the gaming community to fin the problems and fix them. As well as cranking out new updates with weapons, and events on a regular basis..I honestly think DE could charge people to play Warframe. You won't regret downloading this gem.

review: Warframe is really freaking fun. Imagine a good 4-player co-op game like Left 4 Dead. Now make it 3rd person, and add in a whole load more weapons, from magnums to assault rifles to boomerangs with spikes. And give those weapons a levelling option so you can add in extra traits like elemental damage, increased ammor or fire rate, or scenery penetration. Then to finish off instead of redneck hicks or token female college students, make the player a magical cyberninja. In space. Gameplay is fast and slick, and your Warframe is very responsive. The core game is a huge amount of hacky-slashy fun, especially with friends. You can play solo and that's enjoyable enough now and then, but the game adds in more and tougher enemies the more players there are, much like Diablo 2 did. You can choose one of three Warframes at the beginning, but there are another ten to collect, which is mostly a matter of completing assassination missions that reward you with the requisite parts. You can spend real world money if you like, but it's genuinely fun to run the same mission a couple of times because the action is pretty intense, and the levels are randomly generated, so surprises do happen. Play Warframe, it's very enjoyable, and it's free. What more could you want?

review: I'm not trying to hide anything. This game is all about grinding. If you hate it, you should probably move on. I'd like to see which kind of f2p games that requires NO grinding whatsoever, even the paid games is having a lot of grinding elements these days. If you're new to this, you'll suffer at the early stage of the game because you're lacking of mods/blueprints/credits/resources/level. But all of it will go away once you spent enough time grinding. If you've already played this game before and felt like this game is all about pay-to-win and you're not going to reach their level, you're wrong. You can actually trade rare mods/parts/prime warframe parts/prime weapon parts for platinum (in game currency). [ How to Trade? ] You'll need a clan with a Trading Post in the clan's dojo. Yes, you'll need to build stuff (more grinding+time) in the dojo, you can however pick the easy way by joining a fully built up clan OR build everything by yourself/with friends etc. Kindly use platinums for your slot since you can't get extra slot without using plats, only use plats to buy the Orokin Reactor/Catalyst If you can't wait for the Reactor/Catalyst blueprint alert. Trust me, you'll save a lot more if you wait for the alert. And if I may, please refrain from dropping your Orokin Catalyst on trash weapons, if you're doing it just for the #fun #3op5u #yolo #swag, it's your funeral. I believe I've gave out the important stuff, and I hope it helps. Have fun being a space ninja. The good stuff is over and now i'm going to put on some heat. This game had problems with strictNAT/upnp/udp porting for some people (meaning you can't invite or join a session). And once it happens you'd better pray your fixing works or else you'll have trouble playing with other users. It's all over the official forum and the developers is obviously not going to fix it. It has been issued since March 2013 up till now, I'm one of those people who experienced it. TL;DR: Ninja in Space, and the best part: Free-to-Play! (If you sacrifice enough time)

review: I decided to give the Warframe free-to-play a shot way back in September of 2013. Its Mighty Morphin Tenno Rangers promo vids on Steam were horribly uninteresting so I was resistant to give it a try when it first came out (watch the newer vids on the Youtubes instead). The cheesy "Ninjas Play Free" motto on the promos also threw me off. However, the fast-paced, third-person shooter & melee, high-tech space ninja, gameplay and creative design are both solid and entertaining. I am thoroughly hooked and addicted now. I've played quite a few free-to-play titles, and so far, Digital Extremes is my favorite f2p design team, with constant updates (weekly, plus hotfixes) and the right mix of Canadian humor & sarcasm thrown in to their interactions. Their customer support is also top notch (although limited to weekday business hours rather than 24/7). People complain about grind, but I am used to Korean and Japanese MMO grind, so the grind is near non-existant here for me, comparatively. You'll usually get the drops you are looking for after a few runs, especially as DE continually tweaks and finetunes the drop tables. The procedurally generated levels & spawns keep things fresh, too. Hardware: Nvidia card recommended. It'll run well on GTX 400 series or better. I run it on a GTX 680 on max settings. There are issues with AMD cards. You'll need to fiddle with the settings in the launcher and elsewhere to get an AMD card from crashing your game. The same goes for trying to play on older laptops. Speaking of settings, turn off Motion Blur from the game settings. Do this now. Warframe Motion Blur is not traditional gaming Motion Blur but "destroy all retinas" Motion Blur, especially when you get some scrub Volt PUG spamming its Speed ability back to back like it is its only power or something and making your screen unplayable. You will more than likely need to forward ports on your router to play with others, especially if your router is a few years old. You can select which ports are used in game and go from there. I used to get connection errors from time to time (even with in-game UPnP switched off) until I got a new router with better UDP protocols. Now I have no issues. Getting Started: Steam has some excellent Beginners Guides. I also found the Resource Farming Guide invaluable when I was leveling. I also recommend having the Warframe Wiki bookmarked as well. Good hunting, Tenno!

review: Warframe is a sci-fi based third-person shooter. It is a very fun game with replayable stealthy or action played levels. Co-op mode is very fun and interactive apart from the fact people steal my kills >.<. Other than that i like how i can change my armor, customize my weapons, and use different colors on my character and my trusty blade. Me, personally i like to play it stealthy on all missions, but if you're not that type, that's your way of playing :) Overall, i love this game with its parkour aspects where as i can run across walls to get to the other side of a pit of lava or acid and i can climd up on a box to straddle over a railing to find myself six feet from an enemy. Very fun and lots of cool features i highly reccomend it to shooter fans. :)

review: For being in an open beta stage, Warframe is an amazing game to play. It is really fun, but sure, it takes some time and effort to get into it, that is if you craft or earn everything. In some aspects, people can view it as a "pay-to-win" kind of game, but people tend to craft more than buy (besides blueprints). You can craft every single item in the game too, and some of which you can craft, you cannot buy. But anyway, I am not about to go into a full depth description of the game.

review: When it come to free-to-play Warframe really stands out. Everything in the game (except for exclusive offers that DO NOT make the game pay-to-win) can either be purchased with either time or money. If you want a character asap you can purchase them, or if you're more patient you can find all the parts and build them yourself. Everything from the combat to the graphics have been done amazingly and are always being improved. I've watched this game develop over the past year and it's almost unbelievable what this game has transformed into. I missed the chance to become a founder and everyday I regret it. There's a huge variety of weapons, warframes (characters), powers (each warframe has their own), power ups, maps, and game styles that make Warframe addicting. They have recently added challenges that are loads of fun to play with others online that greatly pay off. They have also listened to their fans and have added pvp matches even when they said they did not see pvp in their vision of Warframe. The developers know what they're doing and their ears are open to their players. If you have not played Warframe yet then I highly suggest that you get on it right now! This game is so much fun and can be even more fun if you play with your friends. If you have played Warframe but it's been a few months then you should give it another chance; there have been many updates and the game has been improved in every way.

review: This game is very fun, it was one of the first f2p i tried and honestly it's one of my favorite. You play a a in space ninja, running on walls, awesome tile sets, fun clan system, fun to just mess around in the clan or the void. Only dowsides is that some weapons are clan research, or some are only possible to get though the use of platinum which is real money. And that once you farm for dayz to get the needed resources you must wait for either 12 hours up to 72 hours or 3 days to get the item you farmed for dayz to get. But other than that i think it is an awsome game well worth the time you spend on it

review: Warframe can be buggy at times, but the devs are always coming out with new content and hotfixes. Warframe has a bit of a steep learning curve and can seem confusing at first, to understand the damage mechanics of the game, but there are plenty of tutorials online, and there are few guys within the comminity who create really excellent videos that can help you understand the different weapons and warframes and how to mod them. The game can be quite grindy, but the rewards are sometimes worth it. I personally love playing Warframe, it has a futuristic feeling, with a large and ever growing assortment of weapons and gear to chose from and the game is quite challenging. You can play parts of this game solo, but it can become very diificult at higher levels so you must work as a team in order to finsih missions. Would I recommend this game ? Yes, I do recommend this game and quite highly. It is not for everyone, but it is free so you have nothing to lose by trying it out for yourself.

review: In short: This game is fun and you should try it. It satisfies a lot of action itches, and it's always improving. It's not hyperbole to say that either; the devs are constantly updating core systems to work and feel a lot better. Not as short: You can read a summary of the game from this page or other reviews, but the concerns most folks will have are about it being F2P, and if the game is fun enough to sustain interest. WF's F2P model is summed up as a well-modeled wait-gated, mild resource farming game. Don't be scared off just yet. You can play as much as you want for free. The game doesn't limit you with tokens to play, or waiting to heal yourself. What you wait for are things like crafting times. Resource requirements for most things are pretty mild (3-5 runs of a map should get you most stuff). You can even trade other players for platinum, the game's premium currency. Game play is a lot of fun, and if you played before and got tired of it, it might be time to try again. The melee system was revamped, missions are much more engaging now rather than mostly fetch quests, story and lore are told much better than it used to be, and the game even has a few end-game elements such as warring factions (not PvP, but rather setting up defenses for invasions). The game focuses well on PvE, even though there are some options for dueling and 2v2 sparring. If you never played, the game has more than enough to keep you busy (and more importantly, interested). If you left a while ago, you can return now. The game has changed so much that most every system that you thought was lacking is now quite robust. The game isn't done improving yet though, and it's technically labeled a "beta" still, but the reality is that WF will keep changing and improving, and it looks like it's all going down a good path.

review: Let me start off by saying this game is addicting!!!! It is not only an exemplary example of a third person action/shooter but of a game utilizing a F2P model!!! Digital Extremes has done a wonderful job, ensuring balance across the board, whether it's between the credits/platinum or between the weapons and Warframes themselves. In addition, they have written a narrative, that is dare I say it relatively fresh and original, while simultaneously tying in Dark Sector, for which this game is a spiritual successor to. I am genuinely excited to see where Warframe's story and Digital Extremes shall take fans of this game next!!!

review: Imagine if a moba and a third person shooter had a child, now add space ninjas. Its a free to play game and its great people. Stop reading the review and download it already. Its great, its not pay to win and if you think it is your probabley insane. Just go download it.....like right now.......stop reading this....... What else do you want? there are ninjas, a great clan system, ninjas, a fun variety of powerful yet intresting weapons, ninjas, parkour and etc. At the time of writing this the game has a update every wensday (not counting hotfixes) adding new weapons and other various changes. Everything is always fairly balanced and the characters all feel unique and different from one another. I could go on for a long time about how much I enjoy this game but to sum this review up, DOWNLOAD IT NOW WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR? If you already downloaded the game i have no clue why your still reading this review, the developers tend to be very active in the community and livestream on twitch every 2 weeks to talk about various things, feel free to watch that and learn about various things like sneak peeks about new weapons and stuff. Its free to play so if you hate it the only thing you really wasted is your time and thats not really so bad now is it? and honestly if it is then you shouldn't of been playing a game to begin with dummy.

review: SPACE NINJAS! This game is really good. It has a nice fast pace,interesting story,atmosphere and characters and awesome gameplay. The guns and swords feel so good to use and it provides a nice challange to those looking for one. There are some issues that bother me since i last played (was a while ago) but leveling up and getting money takes FOREVER and i feel that with the third person camera there should be a cover system of sorts. Not to mention the few bugs here and there but that arent gamebreaking 9/10 "It was okay" -IGN

review: With the game updating so often it's hard to write a review that talks about what features are best, but the constant updates and the fantastic Devs and Community are reason enough to get into this game. Warframe, more fun than you can shake a Space-Katana at! For those of you scared away from F2P games let me say that this game does it as well as it can be done, it is ABSOLUTLEY NOT Pay-2-Win everything available to paying members is obtainable by non paying. Paying saves you a little time in building stuff and you have a few more colors to use on your avatar with but there are no stat bonuses for paying.

review: After playing it for 145 hours, I can say that it was really worth my time so far. I don't know why the Metacritic Score is pretty low, but it's probably because the reviews were from back when the game was... well... not so interesting. It's a third person shooter with parkour-elements, filled with missions around defending, assassinating a boss, exterminating a level and so on. There is a gigantic list of weapons, all of them can be further be changed in appearance, while mods will change how they behave. A Flamethrower can turn into a Gasthrower, heavy melee weapons can turn into fast weapons of destruction. There are also different warframes - pretty much classes in other games. Each Warframe has 4 Skills, most of them very useful, others very situational. Weapons and Warframes can either be crafted via ingame money and resources or bought with real money. Crafting will also take real time to complete, from half a day with most weapons to 3 days when finalizing a new warframe. It's clearly a way to get you to buy stuff, but as soon as you have some missions under your belt, the waiting time isn't really that annoying. Just as a warning: The game isn't easy at the beginning. You will die often and hard. But after that initial hurdle, the game gets really good. My only problems so far are the high prices of some things you can buy and that there are only 4 enemy factions so far. You should check it out if you like third person shooters. You should also check it out if you liked Borderlands, as it is somewhat like that with Leveling up and modifying weapons. It is free 2 play, but you won't get slapped with a paywall until you're like 20 hours into the game. And by that you will probably know if you want to play on or not.

review: The game is awesome and pretty much fun but just one recomendation; they give you 50 platinum (purchasable currency) to use in what you want. Only use it on slots for your warframe or weapons. It is wasted on resources. EDIT Okay I gotta edit this review for plenty of reason: 1) I have sunk way too many hours into this game, I am serious, over 300 hours! 2) This game has become something of a wonder, it's mechanics are good, it looks good and the developers are we tied with the community. 3) The game is just incredible really, annoyingly grindy, bit of a platinum  and they give you way too little warframe slots for 20 plats but if you get beyond that the game just takes over and you both learn to love eachother.

review: Starts slow, but honestly, this is a diamond in the rough. A game that needs to be played to be understood. I never knew I what fun it was to play a space ninja, but after about 15 hours, it's got a few hooks in me, and not bad for free. I'm in my mid twenties in rank with the starter gear and am pondering the grind for new equipment or simply cashing out and having $10 or $20 to ride on for a while. The missions of Mercury are a bit dull, but once you get the Venus, the missions open up a bit and become a bit more engaging. In terms of polish, it isn't the shiniest stone but it isn't the buggiest by far. I would put it on par with a Payday 2 or Tribes Ascend sort of feel.

I would definitly recommend it to people if they asked me, there is alot of action intense gameplay as you progress and lots of great characters to choose from. At first it seems a little slow and grindy but when you work hard for what your aiming for it really makes it seem worth while, where as some games just hand you the best stuff in a day. Definitly a good time killer when you get bored, or you can always play it in between games.

Honestly, a fun game if you're looking for a time-sink, as it is fairly grindy. All weapons need to be levelled up, as do suits, and you have to gather materials to improve stuff or make stuff better. Like I said, grindy, but... still entertaining.

review: Warframe is truly a wonderful games that ticks all of my boxes. It's god the best Sci-Fi feel, best action and of course the Ninja feeling to it. You can choose what you want to do when it comes to missons, want to go in guns blazing? Go ahead or if you prefer a more stealth approach to it then again, go ahead. The sound has improved dramatically over the years of Warframe and is really been a milestone for the developers to be proud of. They always surprise us with every update whether it be small or big. The music is perfect, it really does add the best theme you can get to battles and of course the music varies from battle to battle. The design is just the key symbol of Warframe, why you ask? See for yourself, it's just perfect. Every little detail Digital Extremes puts into the game always made the game more beautiful. The lighting is very dynamic, it's not too bright and not too dark in missions while keeping the good mix of lights to create the desired atmosphere. Gameplay in my opinion does need a bit of working, I just think Warframe is really hard to get into when you start as it only gets good when you start getting a real challenge. Digital Extremes did a good job when it came to Ninjas, I mean come on, you get to do Parkour. You get to run on walls while shooting and perform attacks with your sword in mid air flight. That's all I can say really, well there is one more thing. Get the game. You'll wish you played this game a long time ago. 10/10.

review: This game is an example of free to play done (mostly) right, which is very rare. You, a member of the Tenno race, are equiped with suits known as Warframes, each with unique stats and powers. It is your mission to aid in the war between the Tenno, Grineer, Corpus, and Infested. Admitadly, the game plays like a standard third person shooter, where it really shines is all of the different weapons and mods just waiting to be discovered, like Bows to assault rifles, Health increases to abilities. It's not without it's problems, though. The game is LITTERED with microtransactions, and while optional, grinding isn't fun unless you have friends. Oh yeah, this game has a standard 4 player co-op system too, which it is usually designed around. Overall, I would suggest getting this game with a very open mindset.

Looking forward to how this game develops over time.

review: Warfrmae is a game ive been following since alpha and like many other games i never loose intrest in playing it, Yes this game isnt for those who just 'want it all now an not wait' but i think that the grind and trial to obtain warframes without using real money makes the warframe that more rewardable, the game just amazes me every day, its one of the only games that actually feel like a living breathing world every weekend has a new global event where the developers have us go up against a grineer vs corpus rivalry or a sneaky corpus tradesmans escort. Every warframe adds a new field to play with within the randomly generated levels and i love all the customization and loadouts that are avaliable you can play how you want to play; Be a tanky rhino and destroy the fron lines or a Nova who assists the whole team in a damage amplifier or be a sneaky assasin like loki or ash and stealth an entire mission. Oh and dont get me started on U11, in the lastest update they have added more amazing rooms and decoration to the clan built dojos. Alot of the content in warframe is not visble at first glance but if more people gave this game a chance i promise they would love it. Plus its FREE!!

review: Once I had regained my password, Warframe had still turned out to be a grind. You will spend ages rerunning levels and hoping for drops for specific pieces or patterns to unlock equipment. For those of you with fat wallets and little time to earn the gear legitimately, you can pay to unlock the weapons. It's a bit of a shame none of the vanity items can be earned in game though. Luckily, the game is still fun in a very visceral sense. Gunning down grunts while they swarm at you on defensive missions is one of the best parts, though it does appear they've rebalance a large portion of the game since I last played. The emergence of a story that does not require you to go browsing forums and creators notes is refreshing as well. 7/10 Would be better if you didn't have to spend so damn long (or so damn much) to unlock some of the gear.

review: Every second you spend reading this review , is a second not spent playing this game . So you want a better explanation of this game eh ? Then lets get the biggest negative point out of the way first . This game has grinding like you've never seen before , but if you really can't wait you can always pay to speed things up . Most of the time you'll be doing this for the crafting , and trust me crafting in this game isn't on the level of most RPG games where you gather materials from hunting a lot of the same enemy and finding a crafting table to make it . This game's crafting is on the level of mobile games , everything takes time to complete , most weapons take 12 or 24 hours to complete while a new frame to play takes at least 3 and a half days . But of course you can skip all this by paying . There is one more negative point , but this can be viewed as also positive so I'll explain it in a moment Still with me ? Good , on to the good part . Each frame has their own individual powers ranging from turning invisible to shooting ice or fire to turning every enemy against each other to summoning the dead . And this gives each frame a new way of playing each mission . Leveling in this game isn't like other game either , you don't get stronger by gaining exp and leveling up you frame and weapons . This is where the other negative point comes in , you see this game contains something known as mods , you use these mods to increase damage , range , efficiency or even give your weapons an elemental effect . But in order to futher make you weapon or frame stronger you need to level up those mods , and the only way you can do that is by fusing spare mods with it , because of this some mods can take over 1000 hours before you hit it's maximum level , or Rank as this game calls it . But you don't get to just throw any mod in all you like for there are 2 limits that you need to follow . See every weapon and frame comes with a limit and that is 8 mods maximum with the execption of Frames and melee weapon who have 9 . Plus they all have a Mod capacity ( think of it as a weight limit that you can't go over ) that fills each time you put in a mod , and the stronger the mod the more it fills up . Of course there are ways you can increase this limit such as doubling it ( only once though ) and installing something known as a Forma . The game itself is rather rollercoaster like , Sometimes you'll find youself running and shooting so many enemies you'll happilly say "Holy crap it's only been 2 minutes ?" when you find out very little time has actually passed sometimes and sometimes you'll be so bored because of how slow things are that you'll find your self dismally saying " Holy crap it's only been 2 minutes ?" and for a specific mission known as survival where you need to kill enemies and hope they drop life support for you to pick up so you can replenish you own life support so you can stay longer but they don't drop any life support and you realise your life support getting dangerously low and you Scream " HOLY CRAP IT'S ONLY BEEN 2 MINUTES ?!" If you want to pick up this game i suggest finding at least 3 other friends you can play with cause this is a game thats more fun in a group of people you use skype or the in game mic to talk with . In the end i highly recommend you playing this game . it's a great game now and it's only getting started .

review: This co-op shooter really gets to you unlike others. The storyline isn't that great, but who cares when you can have weapons and skills that can slaughter enemies by the hundreds. I put it many hours into this game and it is well worth the time and money if you are into the pay to get latest item first kind of people. If not, just normal play is very addictive. So, if you think shooting with style is your thing, then Warframe is for you!

review: By any objective measure, it's terrible. But I can't help but have fun doing stupid flips and shooting nameless grunts with ridiculous guns. And then I get stuff to build more ridiculous guns to shoot nameless grunts with. Very much one-note, but it's a note that tickles something deep in my lizard brain. Starting out kinda sucks, though. The upgrade system (your primary way of getting more powerful) is poorly explained, and the essential mods aren't parceled out to new players. Starter gear is almost universally terrible, so it can take a while to get going. By the time you're zipping around with a grappling hook and blasting apart mooks with a rocket launcher that shoots exploding acid, your crappy newbie rifle will be but a distant memory. Buy a Braton (not a Braton MK-1) from the marketplace as soon as you can. It is an upgrade in every way. The storefront is kinda whack. Platinum (the real-money currency) prices are all over the place. Weapons and warframes tend to be extremely overpriced, even if you're only buying platinum at a 50% or greater discount. But Orokin Reactors and Catalysts (very important but limited items) aren't too expensive and with the trading system you can pick up the essential mods for about a quarter each. The rest of your plat will likely go toward buying inventory slots. Fortunately, everything except inventory slots is available without paying real money. The crafting system seems like a huge multipart grindfest, but once you get in the habit of collecting materials while you're doing missions for other reasons you'll end up with a surplus of resources. Warframe is very generous with free content. A small amount of cash ($8 in my case) and a bit of frugality will get you everything you'll ever need. Content comes thick and fast. Major updates hit about every two and a half months, with smaller updates in between dropping new equipment and special events . If you enjoy the basic gameplay, then Warframe will give you no end of goals to achieve by parkouring through hallways and murdering bad guys. If you don't enjoy the basic gameplay, then it's not gonna change drastically. Try it out, pick Mag as your starter, see what the fuss is about.

review: Set in the far reaches of outer space during a new Dark Age, WARFRAME introduces the Tenno, a race on the brink of extinction after being enslaved by the Grineer for centuries. This game is very addicting, play as a space ninja running around throwing energy and running up walls. Defend against a ton of different mobs, grind for hours and craft new weapons and frames. The community is awesome and the gameplay is amazing. I would highly recommend this and we haven't even touched on the graphics. The only problem I can think off is that the DLC is overpriced, just my opinion. Otherwise this game is 10/10!

review: The reason I tried this game is because it's constantly in the top 15 most played steam game list. I was skeptical about its popularity at first, but it was soon dissipated when I started playing. The basics classes are warframes, each frame has three components you can collect from boss drops at the end of the boss level. It's rather fast to collect these components, no need to buy them from the real money market. In which the frames are quite expensive to buy, there is no real need for that. Most weapons can be bought with in-game credits from the market, and built with resources gained in game. Again, no need to buy with real money. There are some end game weapons / frames that can be collected from end game content, you can't buy them in the market. The frames and weapons are augmented with mods, which are dropped in game. They give stat changes, such as increased damage, fire rate, reload speed, health, etc.. Mods can be combined with other mods (such as duplicates to the same mod) to increase their level, which increases their potency and the cost of using the mod. The higher the level of the frame / weapon, the more mods you can augment it with. The only things worth spending money on are frame and weapon inventory slots, which are quite cheap. Then after that, there is an item that can supercharge a frame / weapon, gives you more space for mods. Which can be obtained in game, but is quite rare. Then there are cosmetics items, which are purely optional. I got about 1800 plantinum for $25, after 20+ weapons and 4 frames, and some cosmetics, I only used up 400 plats. The missions are randomly generated, at the end of each mission you collect in-game credits, mods, and resources. You can alternate between your primary (rifle, shotgun, sniper), secondary (pistol, throwing knives), or melee (swords, dual swords, heavy). The movement is fluid, you can wall walk, slide, slide jump, slide spin attack, leap attack, etc. It makes you feel fast and like an assassin. After 70+ hours in game, I'd say this game is ninja with guns/swords in space, a third-person diablo-like item collection game. Although repetitive, when played in co-op, can be quite satisfying mowing down large amount of enemies.

review: A fun co-op fps with leveling elements. In addition to your characters, your account, weapons and minions gain levels as you progress. With higher levels, you can apply modules to your items, increasing various attributes in them. Modules themselves are drops, and the module collecting and building your gear mechanics feel like deck building in a collectible card game. The game is peer-hosted, which probably helps keep the game free to play, but also means that you will sometimes end up playing on a server that is hosted on a connection that can't handle the bandwidth requirements of four players. This can be somewhat resolved with ping-filtering peers, especially if you have the connection and cpu power to host yourself. Almost everything in the game can be obtained without paying real money (except character/weapon slots), but as usual, time is money, and helps you progress faster.

review: I downloaded it initialy becouse it was a free game on steam. it sat there after my first few mision for a couple months, i practicly ignored it at first but then i relize people in my guild wars clan were enthralled by it, since then I,ve played it for about a week and it brought me closer to people in my guild i sooner hadent even known funny how stuff like that can work. to really love and understand this game you need to know a few things the current priceing for a few packs like excaliber prime is a project to give people limited time weapons to further increase production of the game as awhole. this game is currently in open beta and as such has some bugs most of wich are negligable. the currency system gives players the ability to buy everything no grind required get your warframe your guns and off you go to be some kinda crazy space ninja. the most importent part of the game however is that if you purchase the high end 200$ bundle your ideas can truely play an ear and major roll in development. some can say thats a bad thing but howmeany opertunitys to you find now a day to actualy controle the content in your persistent world. in closeing the game is majorly focused on co-op not pvp in fact the devs words pvp will go as far as friendly sparing nothing more. i think thats as far as i can stress how awsome this game is and can potentialy be its free you have nothing to lose

review: Warframe, a Free-to-Play cooperative game, that implies the title of "Free-to-Play." The story of Warframe? Not too much is known, but a basic understanding of it is - it's a spiratual sequel to Dark Sector, which pulls some ties in from said game like the Technocyte Virus etc. You are Tenno, a species of human mutated from the Technocyte Virus. The suit, known as a Warframe is the suit that gives the user increased power. The Lotus, the one who guides the Tenno, asks of you to restore the balance to a universe at war. That is a very broad understanding of the story. There are various bits and pieces of lore in the Codex, but I'll keep the story asset brief. The aesthetics of the game are pretty original, mostly harkening with the Warframes especially. Everything looks sleek and organic. It's charming to say the least. As for the game itself, it is pretty fun. While people start out with a minimal amount of equipment, which can be considered a subtracting point, the player is given fifty starting paid-for currency, enough for a mixture of Warframe slots and weapon slots. These slots allow you to acquire more Warframes and weapons throughout your career as a Tenno. The starter equipment aforementioned which excludes the unique choice of Warframe, is nothing to write home about - a slow-firing automatic rifle, a basic sidearm and sword. But those aren't your only weapons you can acquire; a plethora of weapons can be utilized at the players own discretion. Things like "heavy" automatic rifles, to whips, to lightning-chaining weapons. The only problem being with the weapons, are the same-y aspects of them. Most bullet-based weapons behave like a laserbeam; accurate at all distances, with little felt recoil. As well, most of these weapons aren't "unique." Very few can be considered unique, but that doesn't stop the same aspect as above. The Warframes themselves are unique. Each one respects a different element in themselves. While it may take a few runs to get the components (this will be elaborated further), they are a powerful addition to anyone who can utilize them effectively. Ember can use her flames to scorch the masses, Frost can utilize his abilities to protect hardpoints or teammates alike. Things like these help make the game varied with different ways to play. With weapons and Warframes comes building them. You can buy these from the in-game market, coming in two flavors - the Platinum (paid) edition, or the DIY edition. Buying with paid-for currency, not only yields the weapon/Warframe in question, but it being supercharged (more mod points), and a free weapon/Warframe slot. DIY is where you need the components and resources to build said item. Things like Alloy Plate, Plastids, to a Warframe Chassis, Helmet and Systems, all funnel into the crafting system. The crafting system is not state-of-the-art, as you cannot create multiples of the same item (Ie: I can only build one Health Restore, wait until it is finished building, then craft another one...), but this is where all of the aspects show the Free-to-Play mantra. Everything can be acquired in the game trough the usage of in-game currency and time. If you want to build a Warframe? Do you have at least a few days? You can build him/her. Want that shiny new weapon? Have twelve hours to a day to spare? Build it. To elaborate further, weapons and Warframes can be enhanced even further with the use of mods. They are just basic alterations, that can squeeze out more power out of your weapons. Basic damage upgrades to elemental damages, things like that can help you progress even further. Simple as that. Getting an Orokin Catalyst or Reactor will fuel more mod points into your weapons and Warframes respectively. But that doesn't mean that there are "essential" mods, which make certain mods more useless than others. I won't go into detail into that, but some mods are unquantifiably essential than others. Another part of the game is... Grinding. It is part of every game to increase the longevity of the game. RNG rules all in this department, whether it is to get a component or a mod. This might be a slight turn-off point for many, and is a slight brick wall. You'll have to do a lot of said act to acquire the best gear. It takes a large sum of time to get maximum power. To lessen this is trading. You can trade mods or paid currency to get those mods you can't get, or cheese through the effort of getting one. All in all, Warframe is fun if you can get passed the grinding. Better with a group of friends, as most games are. The only problem is the early-game, grinding and some of the wait-times. Would I recommend it? It is free, so why not? If you get this far, then thanks for reading. Have fun!

Freedom of movement with immersive parkour elements, a massive variety of weapons, enemies, terrains, playstyles, and customization pair well with an incredibly dedicated development team that not only updates the game on a regular (weekly) basis, but also listens to the community when implementing changes, additions, or removal of game content. New players and veterans alke consistently enjoy Warframe to the fullest possible extent. On top of that, it's absolutely free, with in-game options to obtain the premium currency without monetary purchase if so desired.

review: Warframe is a very well made free to play 3rd person PVE co-op action game, set in a futuristic version of our solar system. Currently in beta and it has been for more than a year but do not let that put you off, this game deserves at least a moment of your time. You take control of a Tenno, a member of a mysterious race of long forgotten warriors. The name Warframe refers to the suits of exo-armour used by the Tenno in battle. The idea for Warframe grew from a 2008 game by Digital Extremes, Dark Sector. The two games share the same universe and there is some evidence to support the theory that Dark Sector's protagonist is still alive in some form in Warframe's far future. Missions in Warframe come in several flavours; extermination, survival, defence and boss battles are just a few of the challenges you can expect to face. The levels are procedural generated from tile sets so even if the same level is played repeatedly there will be map variations every time. Although PVP does exist in the game (conclave and a duelling room) the main focus is PVE, 4 player squads versus all this grim future has to throw at them. There is so much content in this game, I'm only going to scratch the surface. Customisation is vast and varied with new content added frequently. All the standard guns you would expect are here, assault rifles, pistols, shotguns, sniper rifles and much more. Bows, bizarre energy weapons, flame throwers and a huge amount of melee choices. Weapons and frames can be modded too, need more health and shields? No problem, apply the mods to your frame and then level them up for more health and shields. There are hundreds of mod cards to boost or add stats, elemental damage mods can be mixed to create different effects and a refined melee combat system has been added recently. There is no shortage of customisation in the looks department either, colour palettes, alternate helmets, badges, skins and a tonne of accessories. Looking good in Warframe does come with a real world cost, most of the cosmetic upgrades will require you to buy platinum. Of course Warframes are different beyond their appearance, each frame has 4 special powers bound to it, these range from direct attacks to team heals, mind control to invisibility, team buffs and enemy de-buffs. The list goes on and on. Each Warframe has different base stats. All frames can run, slide, jump and wall-run. There are plenty of hidden areas and shortcuts that can only be accessed by chaining together jumps and wall-runs. The graphics look great and really come alive during combat. Environments range from murky swamps to the divine radiance of the Void. The soundtrack and sound effects are also of a high standard, weapons sound like they look and feel. The drum heavy ost helps to keep the action pounding along and that first 10 seconds of music on the login screen will always make me think of the Terminator theme, another plus for WF. Character animations are fluid, character physics are a bit floaty. I have seen the handling of Warframes compared to "steering a boat" but personally I've never had a problem with it and the at times Wile E Coyote like momentum. There are downsides too, this game is a time sink and the only way to avoid those long hours spent grinding is your money, buy some plat and get that stuff instantly. Loads of my friends have quit playing when they find out about the 12hr wait on the parts needed to build a new Warframe then the 3 day build time on the actual Warframe. Again this has never been a big issue for me. I could easily keep going for another 700 words, more pros and cons, explain more about the game and expand on those points I've mentioned but this is the bottom line. Warframe is a fantastic game that has done nothing but improve in the time I've played it.

review: An excellent little gem of an MMO, this Free-to-Play has no point that demands you to enter PvP or cough up for some premium currency, though, both are an option. This is only further complimented by the mix of platformer and third-person shooter that's balanced just right. The only reasons you could hate this game would be if you couldn't stand the lore, or simply don't like the game's composition. There are sections that cater to every level of skill, and force nobody to stay within or go beyond them. Get into Warframe, but bring friends if you want a crew to work with you for more than one or two missions.

review: Ah yes, Warframe. The game that did beat my favorite game in that one MMOBomb tournament. So it is only natural that I try the game to see how it works. For the record, what happened with that MMOBomb tourney is all said and done, and what was said will be the last time I mention it in this review. Looking at it for the first time the game doesn't really stand out. It's a third person shooter set in space, and while space games are a viable genre, it's a known genre. You take control of a Warframe, out to defeat a faction hell bent on taking complete control of the Solar System or a massive weapons manufacturing company wanting to exploit secrets of a past life being, one of which is your Frame, or tasked with wiping out an infestation of mutated beings from the first two factions. Sounds pretty run of the mill, but it works. Graphics are solid; the Frames themselves seem realistic (or as realistic as they could be for a sci-fi shooter) and one can definitely sense the textures used on their suits. The environments are nice looking as well, ranging from industrial grit to high-tech polish to overgrown biomass strewn all over the maps. I can't say that I was too immersed in the game, but with a game like this, immersion is almost impossible so what the game does it does well. I do feel that a few of the newer Frames do seem out of place - they're over designed and have too much going on with them, leading to messy textures to gaudy coloring - but for the most part everything feels solid. The weapons are nicely modeled and textured as well; weapons that are from a particular faction look the part though some do stick out a bit, namely the Infested type weapons, which don't seem to fit in the game as well as the others. Sounds are good as well, though I do feel that the enemies - namely the Corpus - do get annoying with their gibberish. Turning the sound off is easy enough however. The UI is also good in this game; it's clean, easy to read, and unobtruisve, which is what every UI should be. I have seen screenshots of the game in its infancy and I am glad they changed the UI to what it is now, which makes the game look a lot more professional looking than before. The gameplay is where the game does shine though. As stated, this is a third person shooter, so the game isn't too groundbreaking. However, what it does it does well. Everything seems to fit seamlessly together, with intuitive (for the most part) controls and fluid motions. Using melee is a bit awkward at first; to use it quickly one presses E and one has to bind a key to switch to melee altogether, but in the end it makes sense as E is readily accessible. There are a few more problems though; wallrunning is a bit akward, especially if one is trying to run up into a vent. It does not always work and often leaves me annoyed. Another is switching weapons, which is done using the F key (rather than the middle mouse wheel like other shooters) but I am assuming that can be rebound. Crafting is straightforward enough. In order to make something, you need a blueprint and materials. Blueprints are often bought from the marketplace (the rest farmed from missions are bought from your clan dojo) for in game currency while the player farms for the materials. Simple enough, and once that is all done, you hit build and wait about 12 hours. I do find that the time is a bit silly; 12 hours for a gun? On top of that, there are few weapons available that can be bought with credits, which is the in game currency. The majority of them are bought with Platinum, which is the Cash shop currency, though Platinum can be traded between players. It feels cash grabby and arbitrary to have those timers, as one can rush build them for Platinum. Now for the drawbacks of this game. One is the mastery system, which requires players wait a full 24 hours before each attempt, especially the first test where new players are screwed because of the starting gun. This could be solved in many ways - one, attempt the test as many times as you want if you fail. This is a video game; why should you have to wait? Two, give new players a better gun, or three, make the test somewhat easier. I know many are thinking that I suck because of the gun being used, but for the record, I have switched to a better gun and as expected, I passed. Normally I would say that it depends on player skill for these tests, but with the damage system in the game, it's the gun that makes the difference moreso than the player. In short, remove the 24 hour restriction; it is pointless and all it does is add frustration, or if DE wants to keep it, give new players a better gun or make the test easier. The next drawback is the elevators in the game. They seem simple enough; call for the elevator, get in, wait for your team, and trigger it. Except almost every team I ran with forgot the third part; wait for the team. I know that this is more to do with the players, but DE could put in a way for everyone to tag the elevator BEFORE it can be triggered. Otherwise - and this is what happens usually - you have one person who shows up too late and misses the elevator. If it's a short ride, this is no problem, but in some cases waiting can be a real pain and all it does is thin out the party. DE has a checkpoint system with the dual locked doors, but something in the elevators that forces everybody in the party to tag it before triggering would work wonders. Third, and probably the biggest drawback of the game, is the fact it runs out of steam VERY quickly. What I mean by this is simple; one can reach the end of the game pretty quickly, even with lower levelled items. This could be for many reasons; the build timers could be one, or the fact that certain materials that are required for some weapons are far off and by the time you get the materials you either have a better weapon than the one you want to build OR that you have your weapon modded enough that the one you want to build is actually worse. It feels awkward, and makes me want to play the game less. Why would I want to repeat the process with a Frame or weapon that is worse than the one I have? Maybe it's just me, but I feel the game just runs out of steam. In all, Warframe is a great game. It's not anything groundbreaking, but what it does it does well and makes for a fun hack-and-slash game that can keep you entertained. I do hope that it is expaned on in the future though, and not just with events but things that acutally expand the gameplay. Aside from that, it's definitely a game to check out.

review: Story: Game has lore, but not much of a story line. The devs do put a nice touch on lore with the ever frequent events. Gameplay: Movement is my favorite part of the gameplay. From wall running to dodgerolling out of enemy fire, with a creative mind you can get almost anywhere. Gunplay and melee is also great. The massive amount of weapons in the game allow for you to have any type of build. Run and gun? Pick up an assault rifle. Like to pick people off from a distance? Plenty of long-range weapons. Feel like going Rambo and shooting exploding arrows? Go ahead. Warframe has enough weapons to satisfy hundreds of hours of bloodlust. F2P vs. P2W: Probably the best reason why you should give this game a try. The devs are extremely careful with how the microtransaction system works on the game. Every weapon, warframe, and sentinel are easily craftable via-ingame. Or you can help the devs out a bit by purchasing them in the market. The only thing that isn't available via crafting are some cosmetics and exp/credit boosters. Overall: Warframe is a great F2P game that has a vast deversity of niches you can get yourself into. The community is great although a bit quirky at times. The developers also take great care in working and communicating with the community in order to make improvements on the game.

review: It's a bit like pve third person quake with mmo-elements. You run through linear level and gun/cut down lots of enemies. Enemies drop ressources, credits and modifications with which you can upgrade your warframe (class) and your weapons. Ressources and credits can be used to build new warframes or weapons. Weapons and Warframes level up, which allows them to use more modifications. You can build new warframes and weapons with ressources and credits, both found in missions. Quake because the gameplay is pretty fast, warframes are very mobile including options for running up walls and sliding. The controls are well done, one of the few shooters where i didnt change the settings by much. The f2p-mechanic is really f2p. While you can buy pretty much everything with real money in the game, the game doesnt force you to do so. The gameplay is always nice and the farming isnt very time consuming until very late in the game. The only thing i would critizise are the few slots for warframes and weapons, but it's possible to somewhat negate that with the starting platinum (platinum is the real money ressource and you start with a 100 of it, so you can spend that to get more slots). The gameplay is somewhat repetitive though. there are about 10 enemy types per faction with 3 factions and 6 mission types. 4 of the missions play out very similarily, and the other 2 are pretty much the same. It also doesnt really matter if you play an exterminate mission against grineer on one planet or another (aside from the enemy-level). The developer has added 2 recently more which play a bit more uniquely. The weapons and warframes somewhat off-set that, because they play out differently. The endgame is pretty bad from what i can see though. Some weapons and warframes are really overpowered, one faction is heavily underpowered. So once you get your angstrom or ogris and max it out, there is no real reason to play the game anymore. Especially since the game is a bit to easy if you play it with 3 friends anyways. The graphics are pretty good for a f2p game. It isnt really performant though and quite odd in that regard. It runs more fluid on a computer of a friend of mine even though my computer is stronger for example. so overall: +nice gameplay with lots of options, you can melee, shoot, sneak (somewhat) and are pretty fast +fun +fair f2p model +big amount of content +good at not frustrating people. Mods are reuseable, discarded weapons give you a bit of money back. No f2p tyranny. -repetitive -bad endgame -bad balancing -bad difficulty scaling with more players I give it a 9/10 for a f2p game. I would give it a 6.5 if i paid for it. Try it out if you have time to kill and dont hate science fiction or third person shooter.

review: Surprisingly good game with co-op. Sort of like the Mass Effect 3 multiplayer, but good, and with free-running space ninjas. There is almost no PvP in this game, which is wonderful for all of us sick of wonderful PvE games being ruined by devs focusing solely on PvP, but if you're too much of a  little gremlin to play cooperatively with other people you're not going to like it very much. As someone who's dumped a lot of time into this game already, I should point out two things going in: it takes about 10-20 hours before you'll get the hang of all of the craziness (so read up on the wiki), and it *is* primarily designed to be a cooperative game (so find a group to play with, because it'll go much faster and be more reliable than playing with players from matchmaking).

review: Ever wanted to become an unstoppable force of destruction? Then try out this third person shooter, set in a futuristic universe. With the broad spectrum of weaponry and warframes (classes), you can be sure to find a build that truly fits your playing style, if its being stealthy and quick or just run into the middle of the action guns blazing and tanking while you dish out the hurt, you decide. Ranged weapons to fit your every need, shotgun, sniper, submachinegun, machinegun, semi-automatic and automatic versions of the weapons, not to forget the Bow that shoots with such force that it impales your enemies to walls or eachother if you line them up. Slice, bash or punch your enemies to gory bits with the various melee weapons if you want to get up close and personal. Fists, Hammer, Dagger, Axe, Sword, Dual Axes, Sword and Dagger dualwield or go for the Greatsword. There is much more in this game than just this, each warframes set of abilities that aid it in battle. leveling up system joined with the Mod system that improves your various weapons damage output or perhaps your warframes ability to tank better. Craft your weapons or warframes by picking up blueprints and materials when completing missions and fighting bosses. And finally an AI that doesnt just stand out in the open, taking hits without retaliating. No, Warframes AI makes good use of cover systems and strategic vantage points, to give you a better challenge. When they first notice something is wrong, they will alert the entire enemy force of your presence, so being stealthy has its perks but also takes skill to pull off. 9.5/10 -NexusNemesis

review: This is one of those rare games that isn't addictive because you're grinding for the best gear, or hunting achievements, or any of the other conventional gameplay gimmicks; it's addictive because simply playing the game is so damn fun. The gunplay and swordplay, mixed with fluid parkour-style movement around the maps, makes the action in this game very dynamic. You'll want to log in and bash baddies not because you need materials to make that new gun (although that's also a worthy goal)... you'll want to log in because playing the game is like living out your own personal sci-fi action movie. With ninjas. In space. Space ninjas. Almost forgot to put that part in here.

review: Before you read into this review, let me ask you one question. Do you think fun is the most important thing in any game? If you answered yes, stick around and keep reading. If you answered no, you probably wouldn't like Warframe. Warframe gets a lot of flak for being repetative, but I personally feel that the reviewers who complain about the gameplay being repetative are failing to see the bigger picture. Warframe is not about a deep, gripping narrartive or memorable characters, it's about action, fun, and pretty crazy weapon variety. Warframe is a very specialized game, focused on action, flare, and fun. And boy oh boy does Warframe nail action and fun. With over a dozen unique Warframes(Powersuits used by the player, each with their own unique abilities and stats) to choose from you're sure to find one that you really enjoy playing as. And then there's the weapons. Oh boy, the weapons. This game has almost every kind of Sci-Fi weapon I can think of. We have small scale particle cannons, Beefy sniper rifles, plasma casters, living weapons that shoot everything from Electricity to streams of deadly viruses, an insanely powerful rocket launcher, a Grenade launcher with remote detonation, powerful bows, a gun that shoots spinning saw blades, and of course the obligatory pew-pew assualt rifles to ease new players into the experience. Oh, but that's just the Primaries. In every mission, you will have the option to carry a Primary, a Secondary, and a Melee but you can choose to carry only 1 or 2 if you please. The Secondaries include but are not limited to: Living weapons that shoot Corrosive darts and poison gas, a goo gun that shoots sticky globs of acid that eat right through armor, 2 deadly hand cannons, one of which shoots many metal balls in a shotgun spread while the other shoots a spread of radiation blasts, Miniature plasma casters, rapid fire dual pistols, a spread-rocket launcher that they somehow compressed into the size of a pistol, a pistol that shoots bolts that can pin enemies to walls, deadly and accurate burst fire pistols, pocket snipers, Revolvers, a Lever action beast, Throwing knives, Throwing stars, and a Standard semi-auto pistol to ease new players in. And then there's my favorite weapon class, the Melee. We've got Greatswords that can hit numerous enemies in a wide arc, more conservative longswords that swing fast and allow better mobility while attacking, Dual daggers which generate an incredibly fast flurry of slashes and stabs, whips for when you want the range of a greatsword but the mobility of a longsword, there's also the polearms, Heavy axes, Heavy hammers, ROCKET HAMMER, and even the Thrown melee weapons, useful for killing at a distance while conserving ammo and for stealth kills. More recently Digital Extremes added in 2 Katanas and a set of claws that pop out of your arms like Wolverine. Melee has become much more prominent lately now that DE has completely revamped it. No longer do you simply mash or hold E, now you can perform different combos that require different inputs. These combos are assigned to stance mods that you can apply to your weapon. Each melee weapon class I mentioned above has at least 1 stance mod, and each mod comes with it's own unique combos that are useful for different purposes and situations. My favorites are the Katanas with Decisive Judgement as the stance. I use it to make my tenno look and fight like Vergil from Devil May Cry 3. So yes, Warframe can seem repetative to some people, but not to me. I greatly enjoy the vast arsenal that is placed before me, and I truly believe that these tools of destruction make up for the lack of deep narrative. That said, I thoroughly recommend Warframe to anyone who likes Shooters or character action games, or anyone who likes having fun. It's a game about space ninjas destroying space nazis and futuristic EA representatives. I don't think I need to say any more here.

There are people willing to help, there are constant updates to keep you interested, and has an immersing UI system. The endless possiblities of modding your weapons or frames, the amazing color packs (if you decided to get extra's), and the actual visual gameplay. I am proud to say that DE has made me hooked on this game. Good job and congradulations to any awards you guys may win. I look forward to playong more of your creations. :)

review: Warframe is a PVE focused cooperative scifi action shooter game where you get to play as one of this Spec Ops people with exosuits who are infected with technocyte virus that gives them supernatural powers. It's meant to be based on the Dark Sector universe, but in a distant dystopian future. There's about 5 female and 5 male warframes currently with their own unique abilities and appearance, and still more coming. You can go around collect cards which work as weapon or warframe upgrades from the missions you play, level up your warframe to be able to equip more of those upgrades and fuse the mods together to make these upgrades even more powerful. Nearly anything can be obtained through ingame progression and be crafted after a bit of grinding and farming so you don't necessarily need to spend any real money to get the "good stuff". There are several yet similar game modes and environments, most of them fun and replayable, but still has room for more improvements. All that being said the game has near to no customisation aside from alternate helmets and colour palettes. There's no genderswap option which is a huge downside for me personally. And the upcoming PVP feature {much much later} which I don't care for in the slightest. This game is definitely worth a try if you've got friends to play with, PUGs aren't an option as everyone seems to be either "speedrunning" or trying to be a , going solo is always an option though if you want challenge. Updated August 2013: The company behind the game seem to want to turn the whole game into a tedious repetitive grindfest cash-cow where you'll just get stressed or bored enough and resort to buying what you need from their store. Rather than a replayable funfest. It's their first MMO and they're "learning" that's all fine, but I'm afraid they're learning from the wrong people. Stay away unless you don't mind the grind, otherwise still a regularly updated fun game.

Also, this is not a Pay to win game, since all in-game items can be crafted or won in in-game events without spenidng a dime. The graphics are great, and sometimes I just play because of them!

review: Warframe, a Free-to-Play cooperative game, that implies the title of "Free-to-Play." The story of Warframe? Not too much is known, but a basic understanding of it is - it's a spiratual sequel to Dark Sector, which pulls some ties in from said game like the Technocyte Virus etc. You are Tenno, a species of human mutated from the Technocyte Virus. The suit, known as a Warframe is the suit that gives the user increased power. The Lotus, the one who guides the Tenno, asks of you to restore the balance to a universe at war. That is a very broad understanding of the story. There are various bits and pieces of lore in the Codex, but I'll keep the story asset brief. The aesthetics of the game are pretty original, mostly harkening with the Warframes especially. Everything looks sleek and organic. It's charming to say the least. As for the game itself, it is pretty fun. While people start out with a minimal amount of equipment, which can be considered a subtracting point, the player is given fifty starting paid-for currency, enough for a mixture of Warframe slots and weapon slots. These slots allow you to acquire more Warframes and weapons throughout your career as a Tenno. The starter equipment aforementioned which excludes the unique choice of Warframe, is nothing to write home about - a slow-firing automatic rifle, a basic sidearm and sword. But those aren't your only weapons you can acquire; a plethora of weapons can be utilized at the players own discretion. Things like "heavy" automatic rifles, to whips, to lightning-chaining weapons. The only problem being with the weapons, are the same-y aspects of them. Most bullet-based weapons behave like a laserbeam; accurate at all distances, with little felt recoil. As well, most of these weapons aren't "unique." Very few can be considered unique, but that doesn't stop the same aspect as above. The Warframes themselves are unique. Each one respects a different element in themselves. While it may take a few runs to get the components (this will be elaborated further), they are a powerful addition to anyone who can utilize them effectively. Ember can use her flames to scorch the masses, Frost can utilize his abilities to protect hardpoints or teammates alike. Things like these help make the game varied with different ways to play. With weapons and Warframes comes building them. You can buy these from the in-game market, coming in two flavors - the Platinum (paid) edition, or the DIY edition. Buying with paid-for currency, not only yields the weapon/Warframe in question, but it being supercharged (more mod points), and a free weapon/Warframe slot. DIY is where you need the components and resources to build said item. Things like Alloy Plate, Plastids, to a Warframe Chassis, Helmet and Systems, all funnel into the crafting system. The crafting system is not state-of-the-art, as you cannot create multiples of the same item (Ie: I can only build one Health Restore, wait until it is finished building, then craft another one...), but this is where all of the aspects show the Free-to-Play mantra. Everything can be acquired in the game trough the usage of in-game currency and time. If you want to build a Warframe? Do you have at least a few days? You can build him/her. Want that shiny new weapon? Have twelve hours to a day to spare? Build it. To elaborate further, weapons and Warframes can be enhanced even further with the use of mods. They are just basic alterations, that can squeeze out more power out of your weapons. Basic damage upgrades to elemental damages, things like that can help you progress even further. Simple as that. Getting an Orokin Catalyst or Reactor will fuel more mod points into your weapons and Warframes respectively. But that doesn't mean that there are "essential" mods, which make certain mods more useless than others. I won't go into detail into that, but some mods are unquantifiably essential than others. Another part of the game is... Grinding. It is part of every game to increase the longevity of the game. RNG rules all in this department, whether it is to get a component or a mod. This might be a slight turn-off point for many, and is a slight brick wall. You'll have to do a lot of said act to acquire the best gear. It takes a large sum of time to get maximum power. To lessen this is trading. You can trade mods or paid currency to get those mods you can't get, or cheese through the effort of getting one. All in all, Warframe is fun if you can get passed the grinding. Better with a group of friends, as most games are. The only problem is the early-game, grinding and some of the wait-times. Would I recommend it? It is free, so why not? If you get this far, then thanks for reading. Have fun!

review: This game has come such a long way since release. Now I can't stop playing it. Everything in the game can be unlocked as long as you put some time into it, so even if there are a lot of purchasable items and equipment, you can still be on par with those players. The combat is extremely fluid, physics are wonderful, graphics are fu**ing amazing, and the diversity in the frames and weapon builds make it fun to show off to your friends.

review: I'll try and keep this short When i started playing Warframe, i never expected it be a truly free-to-play game. It was only after ~40hours of aimlessly grinding the first 4 planets that i figured out how to play this game, progress and become stronger. I realised after becoming bored with my (weak) starter gear and building a ton of new ones to try out for  and giggles, that crafting your first few weapons is what gets you out of the frustration zone. The game was almost instantaneously opened up to me, (especially after upgrading my newly crafted gear) and I now found the gameplay to be quite satisfying and fun. I started to become more skilled at playing and was offered a spot in several clans. I picked one, and found its members to be some of the most helpful people out there, and I quickly learned how to trade some of my stuff, how to find rare and valuable items, and how to properly prepare my equipment for each mission. It wasn't long before i had enough Platinum to purchase my first cosmetic upgrades and extra slots for weapons and warframes. Dropping into a mission next to a friend, and catching their reaction when they see your hard-earned individuality - The alternative helmet, the "Syandana", the new vibrant colour scheme, and the intricately detailed weapons - is a HUGELY satisfying experience i cant describe =) Its even more satisfying to make their day by telling them you haven't spent a SINGLE CENT on the game. There are CONSTANT updates to this game that fix bugs, balance current content and add new content for you to enjoy, and it's not slowing down. It continues to grow and grow, and become more amazing just about every week; giving it a rather "polished" feel for an open Beta. It's going to be huge one day, and there's no reason that you shouldn't play this and be a part of its amazing development. TLDR; Dont listen to people who say this game is pay to win. They are simply stuck in the same place i was in: They want to progress, and Platinum deals are becoming more and more tempting with each passing day, as they struggle to find the answer that is literally staring them right in the face. I could go into detail about how the in-game Trading channel can you make enough Platinum to buy anything you want for absolutely none of your cash at all, but i did promise i would try keep this short =) So give this game a try, get involved in everything it offers and really go for it. I mean, who DOESN'T wanna be a badass space-ninja of untouchable epicness? (that's a huge plus right?) 11/10

review: okay the question that humanity has been asking itself over and over again(you aready know what it is off-course) is... wait for it... what happens if you mix 3rd person shooting and space ninjas. well you get WARFRAME. its got over hundred randomly generated space station "dungeons" making every game different you have awesome ninja skills like wall running and kicking enemies in the face. and on top of everything, this...game...is...bloddy...free!!. now, to the seriuos review. the game is currently in beta, that means there will be bugs and glitches, i have never found any game breaking bugs though. there currently is 17 classes (warframes) to chose from. this includes healers, tank and mind controllers and all that fun stuff. you will find 3 factions to shoot in the face (sort of 5 but that doesnt matter) the controls feel pretty good to me. overall this game (in my OPINION) is a very, very and yet another very good game

review: 9/10 This game is just fun to play, also a bit addictive since you can't stop getting more gear and customizing your 'Warframe' (in-game character), I give it a 9 because at the beggining it's a bit overwhelming for new players, so many features and options, not to mention things to do. Anyways I played in an old account after dropping this game some time ago, and may be that's why it was so overwhelming. It's free, fun and the community is great. Give it a try!

review: Gomenasai, my name is Vogue-Sama I'm a 22 year old American Otaku (Anime fan for you gaijins). I draw Anime and Manga on my tablet, and spend my days perfecting my art and playing superior Japanese games. (Warframe, World of Warcraft, Persona series) I train with my Dual Ether every day, this superior weapon can cut clean through steel because it is folded over a thousand times, and is vastly superior to any other weapon in the solar system. I earned my sword license two weeks ago, and I have been gaining affinity every day. I speak Japanese fluently, both Jupiter and the Saturn dialect, and I write fluently as well. I know everything about Japanese history and their no-guns code, which I follow 100% When I get my Jupiter visa, I am moving to Neo Tokyo to attend a prestigious High School to learn more about their magnificent culture. I hope I can become an animator for Studio Ghibli or a game designer! I own several warframes, which I wear around town. I want to get used to wearing Zephyr before I move to Japan, so I can fit in easier. I bow to my elders and seniors and speak Japanese as often as I can, but rarely does anyone manage to respond.

review: Ok, Pros: Fast paced shooting mechanics, decent sword mechanics. Good mobility, customization not that good but workable. Teamwork, can still play solo however. And a stealth and free-run mechanic. Nvidia graphics and Physics! Cons: You will NEVER get into PvP becuase of "Your inventory ### doesn't meet the requirements." Unfair, if not almost cheating AI. Cash store always dangled in front of your face. When the game adds a new playable Warframe, it feels like "YOU MUST PAY." in order to play it. Feels unrewarding. Buggy beyond beleif, but that's because its an MMO. Near impossible to join a guild/clan. Notorius time waster. Lotus voice. Overall: I enjoyed this game for a few days, but between DRM, lack of commmunication with other players, and cash store ads. I reached my Pain; enjoyment thresh hold. It just seems like a time waster, and you never feel like you accomplish anything, unless you sink in $$$ of course. If you need to waste a few hours go ahead, but it just felt to as if there was no point to doing ALL of the same repeating missions OVER AND OVER again. It's up to you.

review: Set in the far reaches of outer space during a new Dark Age, WARFRAME introduces the Tenno, a race on the brink of extinction after being enslaved by the Grineer for centuries. Players enter WARFRAME on the cusp of the Grineer's victory over the Tenno until they begin to arm themselves with WARFRAMES - an ancient exo-skeletal technology only they can operate. Hidden within the Orokin Derelicts of a lost civilization, new WARFRAMES lie dormant and undiscovered. These artifacts are the Tenno's only hope for survival. With the lack of a Pay to Win system and easy engagement for new players, Warframe offers some quality time. As a free-to-play game, Warframe is a nice surprise that sets the base for a promising future. Warframe isn't anything special. It's not revolutionary, exceptional or timeless. Still - every time I returned to the game, it kept playing for at least an hour (without regret). Digital Extremes has made an enjoyable, engrossing, spectacular game. Especially, when you find yourself a team or - even better - invite some friends. If you need a new opportunity to slaughter aliens, you should try Warframe.

But the items that you can buy for free? Not cool, bro. I find it funny this games "a beta" and if you have friends or strangers and the good guns. You can have some extreme fun, or just hangout in your clan dojo. Or shoot a random army down. And I played this game 2 months after "beta" release. So I know what I'm doing. This game is phenonmal. I can't imagine whats in the full version. Lost out.

review: Ive been on this game for several months now and have found it addicting. There was recently a large update so there are some bugs. But as with any game bugs are part of the landscape. I wouldnt say any of the bugs that remain are a deal breaker with this game. The development team tries to fix bugs as they are reported. They prove that they love and care for the game and the community behind it. To me the graphics and soundscape are wonderful and easy to the eyes. I have gone from a computer that was the bare minimum to run this game to a full fledged beast that can run it all on high. On both ends of the spectrum this game is still gorgeous. No matter what the settings are that you need to run it on. Give it a try and have some patience and you will find a game you will fall in love with.

review: Pros + Good Customisation. + Good Combat. + Sound Quality is excellent. Cons - No clear story, your just thrown into the battle with no real reason to kill the enemies apart from your told to and that they're shooting at you. - Repetetive Environments (Jungle, factory, maybe if your lucky..... a bright factory). - Odd Weapon unlock system. Overall i would reccomend this game for the combat and customisation alone however if you look for fun and story telling in a game then this isnt the game for you, the gore may give you some giggles for the first few times you make an enemies torso fly into space team rocket style but once you've seen one decapateted enemy sliced and diced like mince meat, youve seen them all.

review: Warframe is great. Its lore is fantastic, the setting and artistic designs are excellent and its gameplay and re-playability are quite recommended. I easily found myself wanting to know more about the Tenno, the Lotus, the other factions, the Infestation viruses and mysteries within the solar system (Orokin and the Void, anyone?)... but the game explains very little outside the mini-solo Vors campaign. This game could have easily been my Game of the Year if it wasnt for so many issues regarding its game design. The most infuriating one being -> it's clearly a NOT PLAYER FRIENDLY game. - You're early forced to choose a single warframe and weapon composition at the very beginning of the game and commit to it whether you like it or not. - The Vor campaign feels like a mini tutorial. It's a fantastic way to explain the game mechanics and part of its lore, yet once it's finished, the game feels kinda empty plot wise and very little is explained. -Failing a mission will result into a TotalTimeWaste inc. - Playing stealthy is pointless. I found myself going sneaky bow, bo and kunai fighting when, to my surprise, the matchmaking kept throwing players at my game gun-blasting and speeding throughout levels, therefore ruining the solo experience I had enjoyed so far. - Soloing survival / capture / defense missions is a titanic task. Matchmaking is then mandatory. And it may result into god-like 1000+ grinded hours players or Hi, I just killed Vor and I barely know how to Warframe, bro players, so good luck! -Grinding for crafting materials throughout the solar system in a wide variety of missions is fun. Grinding a concrete annoying boss (Im talking about at you, Alad V and your pesky Zanuka) for a rare material that may or may not drop in order to craft an important part of the game such as Warframes Helmets is not. -80% of the mods you find are just salvage / vendor meat. -Map repetitiveness, predictable AI from the enemies and very little purpose on doing some missions makes you lose eagerness to login daily quite easily. -Learning curve is quite blur, and once you master the sprint + slide + melee attack drill, thats pretty much it, aside from Warframes powers. Dont get me wrong. Most of what Ive played from it is incredible for a F2Play game. Combat is fluid, build options are quite wide (2-handed, shotguns, spamming lightning Warframes, stealth, tanky-melee, etc.) and co-op features (clans and the like) will have you willing for more. STILL The game grabs you in, hooks you up for a while and tries to milk the platinum out of you. At some points, youll feel like playing Dark Souls 3000: some missions are plain *t to go through alone or no money invested. Again, having to wait 3 days for your new hard-earned Warframe to come out of the foundry or not being able to customize it with the colour you like (cosmetics aside) is not cool, yo!. I wouldve definitely paid 40+ bucks for a solid well put together single player campaign and a patchable online mode with 100% of the content reachable by crafting. But since the game offers the chance of not paying, I will continue to login every now and then and grind with no purpose at all (since the real cool stuff like Orokin reactors, Formas and its like are something out of the plebs' reach). At this point, and considering all of the above, Im quite certain to say that Free 2 Play model has screwed Warframe up. See you next patch, Tenno

review: Two words. Space ninjas. In all sincerity though, Warframe is an excellent title, it has great gameplay, smooth visuals, and works well even on somewhat older computers. Being a free to play game, you'd figure there would be "pay to win" items using micro-transactions. While micro-transactions do play a part in this game, it is entirely co-op, not competetive, so you aren't going to get wiped on the floor by someone because they shelled out some cash for goodies, because they will always be on YOUR team. And every equipable item in the marketplace that can be bought with premium cash can be crafted using blueprints, which you can buy in the marketplace for in-game credits. There are even some items only available through finding the blueprints for them in missions. All in all, Warframe is an amazing co-op experience, and while the game is technically still in beta and has a few bugs and glitches here and there, the developers are always on top of the situation, and regularly converse with members on the forums to weed them out. I would definitely reccomend a quick download of this game right away. After all, NINJAS PLAY FREE!!! :D

review: This game is just awesome. You can choose from just a few weapons when you start, but then you have the chance to craft your own weapons (and there are like, alot). The graphics are awesome too, about how it looks and how efficient they are. you can easily get +40 fps with a fairly old computer. The detail I personally like is that its not P2W (atleast not completely, if you get KIA, you can spend a revive, wich is bought from the market; OR you can be revived by a teammate in Coop). The only things I dont like about it are the unstability of the game servers and just a few bugs in the connection system and in the Steam launcher.

review: One of the best-if not THE best-F2P games I've played. To get this out of the way, this game is NOT Pay 2 Win. In fact, the best gear is only obtained through playing; cannot be bought. Warframe strongly encourages working in a team, though that doesn't mean that you can't go solo (there's a whole option dedicated to that). And with a large list of weapons and Warframes to choose from, there'll always be something to do. The only bad thing I could say is that if you're looking for a story or indepth game, this is definitely not for you. The missions will get tedious for those that don't like killing things over and over again. Still, it is a very well developed game that delivers several hours of ninja fun.

review: I was pleasantly surprised with this one. It's a great pick-up-and-play game Since I do not have a lot of spare time, I love being able to grab a quick half-hour or fifteen minutes. Having played many player-vs-player games, I've found I do prefer co-op since it encourages unity rather then turning on each other. Warframe fits that goal perfectly, together everyone achieves more than alone even though the option to solo is there. The variety of warframes seems small at first, but I quickly learned there are dozens of types and I can see there being a lot of evolution over time as I play this game. Being able to fight my way through the planets of the Solar System is really fun, and you can always go back and replay old missions with better equipment. That can benefit beginners and veterans alike. A great thing about Warframe is being able to play it on my HP G56 Laptop which is not powerful and yet I turned down half the graphics to minimum. That was a mistake and it looked pretty awful, then I turned all the settings to minimum including resolution, turned off anti-aliasing and suddenly it looked a lot better. So the point is if you're going to turn down the graphics, turn all of them down. Once I did that the game was smooth, and I can play without any framerate drops and no detectable lag through wireless connection to a Sky Fiber modem in the UK. All in all, a great game that should not be underestimated, I can see there being 'FrameCon's! And people re-producing their frames in RL at conventions, that seems like fun to me. This game should also be made into a live-action movie! I can't wait to find out what happens next! Oh and the AI is pretty interesting! I found myself chuckling at their behaviour which was unexpected. Five stars!

review: This is an awesome game. Has fast game play, and will keep you on your feet, especialy with all the work the developers are puting into it. It is still a game in progress though, so expect the bugs to be here and there. The UI has been a big issue. They been working on it a ton, to make it not only look better but run better as well. It does have that feeling of a pay to play sometimes, BUT you can get 95% of everything through grinding and playing. Money just get's it faster. Great multiplayer as well. Only complaint would be that some classes don't even have a slight apeal because thet are not balanced, or not worth the grind to get them. Otherwise this is a great game. If you like shooters and intence action with fun co-op this is the game for you! 9/10

review: I cannot recommend this game enough, it is the only game I have been willing to spend over 100$ on, I didn't need to spend any of that on anything besides the colors, the game is not pay to win at all, sure you can get a lot of gear just by paying for it, but that's just because you are allowed to trade blueprints with other players, so you can buy them from others (which you still need to build) and any weapon you buy in the store you can get with just a bit of effort without paying for it (weapons are around 300 plat), the gameplay is great, the new update made the new player experience amazing, and now you can get freaking puppies, PUPPIES!

review: 1100+ Hours and still loving it. I will post an honest Review about this Game, Some people might not like the cons section, hey even i don't like it but this is true about this game and you can't or even i can't deny it. Pros: - Developer Interaction with community. - Hotfixes/Updates every Wednesday. - New content almost every month. - (Huge Pro) It's not a pay to win game, you can get every single warframe, weapon, sentinel and even that Prime without spending even a single Benjamin's or i can say those green Notes. (Exception is Customization or i can say those sparkly stuff to make your warframe, weapon or sentinel look nice). - This game rewards you for playing, what i mean is go on missions farm some mods, weapon or warframe parts and then sell them in trading post for in game premium currency. - This game has one of the best clan/dojo system i have ever seen. - Not to forget about future updates that'll include player ships, new tile sets, Hubs, Focus System and much more. - My final thought on pros section is that this game is highly Addicting and no pay to win bs, if something that effects gameplay like weapons, warframe, sentinels then you can get it for free. Cons: - Relies heavily on RNG, which can be a pain in the behind. (Devs know about this issue but still they don't do nothing, instead they use RNG more and more and recently they introduced it in events, yes i am talking about recent Breeding Grounds Event). - Sometimes devs have tendency to listen to new new players and implement changes that are not necessary and useless, (i mean who can give more clear and important feedback, a guy who just started playing and thinks everything in game is OP or the one who's been playing for 100's of hours). - If you don't like grinding for stuff then items that you purchase from market for premium currency (platinums) in this game are way too exepnsive. - Major issue this game has is RNG, My final point in Cons section is that, if you don't have problem with RNG and Grinding then this game is for you, and if you have problem with grinding and RNG then you'll end up buying stuff in market, which is expensive (i mean one weapon can cost you up to 250 platinums or about 15USD), Now it's up to you what and how you want new stuff in this game by grinding or by paying. Overall this game is highly addicting, stuff that effects gameplay is free and sparkly stuff will cost you money (Developers have to make money too right), RNG can be a pain in the behind but with the help of friends and clan mates this issue can be resolved. New stuff that developers have planned for future major updates is extremely awesome, Overall i HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS GAME.

review: Pretty exciting and offers many ways to get even the strongest gear. While purchasing platinum is a MUCH faster way to obtain things, almost everything is obtainable without purchasing anything. The frustrating thing about this game is definitely the net code and the irritating amount of customization options that are totally locked unless you purchase them with platinum ( on that note freebies are given away at random holidays ie. christmas and valentine's day. )

review: This game is by far one of the best games i have played i dont normally care for shooter games i like racing games and open world games that pretty much have cars in them like NFS games and GTA granted GTA is considered shooter game but basically Warframe is most deffenitly an exception the graphics are great and the animations good and its also addictive AND it's free to play. Their is only one thing that seems to be a problem though and that is not only can you play with other people you can also play solo which is great BUT when your not connected to the internet and you want to play Warfame in solo you cant apparently you have to have the internet in order to play at all which is basically my only complaint but even at that i most deffenitly recommend this game

review: The game is great overall but with just a few little problems... Its extremely repetative. Almost the exact same place everytime with just a slightly different objective. The weapon and character mods are really only what keep it interesting. Also once you run out of platinum you have to pay for more... If it wasn't such a fast paced shooter then I would have stopped playing within the first hour but once you start you just cant stop! So even with the cons I would say get it because it is a pretty decent free game and is great if your just a casual gamer looking for some fun fast paced gameplay.

review: Warframe is.... It's kinda..... You know, I honestly can't describe this game and it's uniqueness, or, atleast, what uniqueness it has, which is a LOT. All in all, this game has everything, it has tight controls, a variety of map structures, for example, if you played first mission once, it will be a different map set-up each and every time, with the exception of the objective room, that will always look the same, HOWEVER, the layout is always different. There's a large variety of weapons, and warframes. Warframes, the games name. Warframes are...odd, I honestly have no idea what they are, they could be robots, or, remotly controlled, or even a person in a suit, no one really seems to know. As for controls, you can do MANY different combat manuvers, here's a few of my favorites: Backflips. Wall run.(Up and side) Front flips. Flying kicks. AND SO MUCH MORE! Not to mention, this is the most well polished free to play game, with the best model of it, you can get everything for the paid currency, OR, you can craft it, for FREE. Simply put: I freakin' love this game to peices. 9.5/10 The crafting takes 12 hours on normal things(Weapons, components) and 3 DAYS on warframes.

review: This game impressed me so much that i nearly fell of my chair. the first time i saw warframe i thought to my self,how great can this game be. Then i played it,man did i injoy it <-------did?,what am I talking about I still love this game. The graphics is good (by that i mean insane)the gameplay is surprisingly awesome and it has a nice touch of team work. if you die your freind can still help you from getting back into that insane battelfeild. Of course you can play offline but thats.....how do i put this,cinda hard(yep allot).This game is very fun aswell from shocking a Corpus to cutting Greneer in half. This game is all about going mad (insane if thats what you whant to call it). So hack and slash your whay through warframe. Give it a try

review: By now I have hundreds of hours in Warframe and I can confidently say that it is a great game... If you don't mind grind. Oh My God the grind. It isn't "New Spiral Knights" level grind, but it is not uncommon to run missions for hours for a single rare mod that drops from one type of enemy. But the gameplay is pretty solid, the game looks great, and the devs are more than willing to listen to the community about things that need changing or fixing. Content is regularly being added and DE does its best to keep the community involved and in the loop (including letting the fans compete to design weapons). Overall, 8/10 because it just keeps pulling me back in.

review: I do recommend this game to anyone who doesn't have a crappy computer. It's free to play, so let's keep this in mind as we go along on this wonderful journey. Warframe, in my opinion, has beautiful graphics and scenery. It does lack in the story department just a tad. However, it makes up for it in it's fun style of game play, and etc.. etc. Overall if you spend more than 3+ hours on your computer... This is a game to get~ One thing I might mention though is the new player experience, be cautious... ^-^ Have fun Tenno~ (P.S. This is probably a crappy review seeing as how it is my first game review. It may also be extremely crappy because Im bored. ENJOY DECIPHERING IT!)

review: Think of Castlevania HD on the xbox. It's the type of game that you would not enjoy if you are playing it solo. However, add a couple of friends in the mix, and you got yourself a rootin' tootin' time. The game lacks a true story mode or a single player experiance, but makes up for it in the sheer amount of content. Various types of mission have you and your friends going through shooting baddies and collecting material to build your next mass murdering machine. The game even has boss battles that put your Warframes and gear to the limit. Although the game Free to play (F2P), most content can be obtained with a little effort on your part. You can even go as far as selling that hard to find mod (modification cards to increase the stats of warframes or weapons) or insanely difficult blueprint (used to craft new material) and obtain money from a willing buyer in the community that can be used to obtain weapon slots to add more weapons to your arsenal or buy some cosmetic items to make your warframe a fashionable kililng machine. There's nothing to lose when playing this game, so it won't hurt to give it a try. Like said before, this game would be geared towards someone who is looking for that new multiplayer experiance with friends.

review: I have put near 500 hours in to this if that says any thing about it, a masterful game with strong game play and with a high skill cap, plenty of gear and levels to play war frame is best played with buddys, and id recommend dropping five or ten bucks on it and forgetting the Free to play. You can earn any thing in the game by playing, events offer any thing from new guns to cosmetic items but buy plat will make getting started a lot more easy, the only draw back to Warframe is the truly insane crafting times to build new Frames a and clan gear, but that is vastly out matched by it's meany other achievements. At it's base Warframe was made by People (And Scott) who love ninjas and space and robots and zombies and pirates, and made the perfect combination hack and slash and shot and space magic with rouge-like elements and rpg to bring you Warframe a game about having fun!

Missions with varied difficulty, assasination/espionage missions, various abilities to improve your character and weaponry (as well as levelling system for both your character and each weapon you use). Free-to-play, though you gonna pay some real money for some classy weaponry and characters, though it's totally okay to level up your starter set of weapons and your first character to a state of a kickass killing machine without no money spent at all! Not to mention crafting system - do missions on specified regions, collect resourses and make these weaponry and chars by yourself for free (and in-game funds). Good luck, have fun!

review: Are you a space ninja? Do you want te be a space ninja? Have you ever had a weird fantasy involving space, ninjas and maybe a couple of digestive biscuits? If so, look no further than Halo Rea.. I mean Warframe. With advanced sliding phisics, over 2 melee weapons and hundreds of bullets at your disposal, this game is really a revolution in dungeon crawling. I would highly recommend this game, to all players of literally any type of game, because if you dont like space ninjas, you probably dont like life.

review: This game is a great oppertunity to burn a few hours and have tons of fun doing it. For a game in beta it is fantasticlly built, they have a great community and is in a very fast paced setting. AND ITS FREE TO PLAY! When the developers release an update they pack so full of fixes and additions to the game youd think that they were adding a mod. (But then again a update is basiclly a mod) I enjoy playing this game for two main reasons: 1. the fact that it is very fast paced and requires lots of thinking in the now, because the AI is very sophisticted and reactes accordingly but could get some improvements. 2. the amount of fun that i have just grinding away to get a cool item. I personally spent 40+ hours grinding away to get two really cool items in the game and i really enjoyed grinding that. When i dont know what to do in the game I go and play with my freind the first few missions. Im now going to write about some minor issues in the game :D When i played the tutorial it was preety laggy the first time, so you might want to take that time and change settings Ive only chrashed twice for no appernt issues but on review of those logs my PC stopped two important files from working. But i recommend this game greatlly and i can't wait to see where this game goes.

review: One of my top games at the moment. It is currently in open beta (it has been in open beta for a while). Pros: -There are very few bugs I have noticed -A massive variety of classes, weapons, and sentinals (basically pets that attack) -Accompanies many play styles -Many ways to travel around, freerun, stealth, charge, what ever you like -A insane amount of mods!!!! Cons: -You can only have 2 warframe slots (a warframe is basically your class) unless you pay more -Also a limited number of weapon slots -Annoying to play without using any money on the game -Other than the in game lore tab you can read there is no story running hand in hand with the game.

review: Let me start off by saying this game is addicting!!!! It is not only an exemplary example of a third person action/shooter but of a game utilizing a F2P model!!! Digital Extremes has done a wonderful job, ensuring balance across the board, whether it's between the credits/platinum or between the weapons and Warframes themselves. In addition, they have written a narrative, that is dare I say it relatively fresh and original, while simultaneously tying in Dark Sector, for which this game is a spiritual successor to. I am genuinely excited to see where Warframe's story and Digital Extremes shall take fans of this game next!!!

review: Warframe is a free to play 3rd person shooter and basicly u play as a ninja in the future, so you are a tenno and the tenno are specail because they can use the specail suits called warfames and every warframe is diffrent so it's good to try a couple to see which maches your play style, and as you play your warframe and wepons gain xp and level up and this is where a important mechanic of the game comes in becase when a wepon or warframe levels up you get a point for your mods and some mods cost more than others baseline so go level some more to make yourself and yor wepons stronger because YOU shape YOUR tools in this game!! then you can fuse mods and the selected mod will get better BUT will cost more points, so you have to find a balance between survival and damage stamina or energy (energy is used for your warframes ablilitys) so YOU shape YOUR tools and i find this mechanic fun and entertaining in games (btw you can PARKOR you know wallruns valting and other ninja things :D)

review: recommended for: group players. grinders. stealthers. i paid into this game very early on and i was glad to see it find its way to steam. the exciting dynamic of this game is, imo, its main draw. it is exciting and fun to play this game. the number of tactical variances is staggering. aside from the brute force approach, in my experience, most maps can be stealthed (by that i mean goals approached w/ minimal enemy threat drawn). incremental advance seems the most useful but YMMV. a good group of tennos can go very far and i think this a good weekly game for clans/friends/groups. if not daily. also i like the item affinity progression. this game meets my requirements for a viable free-to-play game.

review: Quite the grindfest, but still enjoyable nonetheless. Has a lot of different abilities and items to collect and level, making customization another strong part of the game. The game can be played without spending any money. However, the largest roadblock is the limited number of slots for storing weapons and warfarmes (classes). One needs to spend real money to unlock these slots. However, the slots are reasonably priced, and I am happy to support the developer. The game is continually changing and having new content added. It is still in "beta", so we don't know if the developer will put forth the same effort once the game is released. Overall, I've had a lot of fun with Warframe, even though it does get repetitive.

review: Alongside of being addicting and fast paced (alongside of a stealth aspect being possible), the game introduces a challenging and in-depth grinding system that makes it a non pay-to-win game. Essentially a third-person Destiny, only free. No complaints here.

review: A fun game, especially with friends. It's a bit boring at first since you have little gear, but once you start leveling and collecting more, it becomes hard to stop. The game picks up at higher levels where enemies are more difficult. Overall a good game, definitely worth playing.

review: Been playing since Closed Beta Testing. Strongly recommend playing this! The multiple "Warframes" and weapons give the game unlimited replayability, whether you use the micro transactions or earn your suits through the Foundry crafting system! Customizing the weapons and suits, both with different colors as well as modifications to skills and stats, allow every player to have an experience unlike any others!

review: So I played Warframe a lot during the Beta. Maybe a little to much to where I out did my self on the game and then it just got boring. It started to get boring though when Shotguns came into play and anyone who had one could whipe the floor of any mission. Later on I come back and see they changed EVERYTHING. While some is nice I hate most all of the changes made. Not to mention the gameplay is still Boring however All Co op style games are boring and are even more so if one person is able to do all of the work for you. kinda like Boarderlands 2 its dull as hell. I havent yet beat it because after the first 30 mins its just straight up boring to me. Warframe is Fun playing it alone though as a single player or sometimes with one other person if they do not have something Overpowered. I got this one guy in my clan into the game...he is addicted. He has over 3K almost 4K hours into it.

review: With good visuals and good combat mechanics, this game shifts the player interest rather quickly from the grinding for leveling up and grinding loot, to spend more time creating new weapons and armors in the furnace or customizing the dojo, a spaceship every clan can create and personalize in order to exchange mod cards, train together and develop new weapons and tactical gear. The RPG-like character and gear customization side of the game is what keeps the player to look into the mechanics for some time, looking for the best mods to upgrade the armor and weapons efficiency with loadouts for specific enemies or jack-of-all-trades combinations of effects. With every update the variety of environments seems to increase, partially making it up for the lack of variety in the mission types available and the lack of cinematic events happening during the missions. One of the most important things this game still really lacks is a more involving storyline, and even though some special events added new characters and new story details from time to time it's still not enough. It also does have a PVP component that adds variety, but it still needs to be balanced better since higher level players can easily own lower level ones in a matter of seconds making it less about fighting skills and more about crafting and choosing accurately the best gear available. Even if it still sounds good in theory it can also end up in unfair fights unless the two sides decide the gear to use beforehand. Warframe is a very nice free to play game to try and play casually, the grinding for specific loot can give some hours of mindless fun with big explosions, fast nicely coreographed action and a good feel for the weapons and powers, it's not that heavy in terms of HDD space since the levels are assembled randomly by the game engine every time, and in time eventually the developers will be able to add that extra depth and balance for story and gameplay so that it will become a game players will be able to invest more time into, without getting bored by its repetitiveness.

review: Warframe is perfect if you are the type of person that enjoys team cooperation. You may not like it if you don't like having to work for your equipment and things like that. For a Free 2 Play game Warframe is amazing. Therefore I would give it a 9.5/10.

review: Many gamers have "THAT" game. The game that you will spend hours on, farming for one item. The game that you would willingly spend more time than sleeping on. For me, that game is Warframe. I origianally started Warframe as a skeptic. The name is somewhat vague, and the gameplay looked fairly ordinary. However, the pathetically high number of hours I have logged are evidence of why I'm glad I stuck with it. Warframe calls itself a Beta so they can get away with major changes to the game that a full game wouldn't. That being said, I haven't seen an update I disagreed with. Not even the almost complete rewrite of the damage system. It was a wierd adjustment but I feel it works better now. If you want a game that is a full polished product then you should skip over Warframe The name itself is a little strange, that is until, you get into the game when it is explained. A "Warframe" is the armor that you, a Tenno wear into battle. Each Warframe is equipped with unique and powerful abilities. These abilities include; a time shattering stomp, invisibility, setting the world on fire and sooo much more. On top of these insane powers, you bring weapons into battle as well. A primary weapon, which can be a rifle, shotgun, sniper, laser cannon, or even a bow and arrow! Your secondary can be a pistol, dual or single wield, a hand crossbow, throwing knives, and there's even an exploding gel gun for chrissakes! The melee weapons get just as fun. There are of course swords and daggers, but you can also wield an energy whip, dual hand axes or a freakin hammer! There is very little PvP in Warframe, it's really just for settling Big  Contests and for friends to test their new gear. The game is entirely based around PvE. Whether you're slaughtering an endless horde or trying to take out one specific VIP, there's always something to shoot, smash and generally  up. If you've read this far...thank you. But despite my praise there are a couple cons to this game as well. The game can be hard to start for one thing. The beginner weapons are beyond noobish, and if you pick the experienced Warframe as your starter and don't like him.....leveling up will be a complete pain in the . Adjusting to third person can also be a problem for some players.....it was for me. Another problem I do have though, is with the grinding. There is a lot. Sometimes you need one material to make the last piece for your new Warframe and you just can't get it. This can get demoralizing, but just take a break. Play something else for a day or two and come back fresh. Also, tramwork is sometimes in short supply. Many players are just grinding for materials or trying to finish off a planet. Because of this you rarely find anyone who will run with you. This is less of a problem it could be thanks to independant looting. If a rare mod is dropped, it's there for everyone, and most players will run back to revive you, should you down. If you want to talk though....you had better have some friends. All in all Warframe is a great game that never really gets old. The Devs keep in regular contact with the gaming community to fin the problems and fix them. As well as cranking out new updates with weapons, and events on a regular basis..I honestly think DE could charge people to play Warframe. You won't regret downloading this gem.

review: Initially looked at warframe because I had nothing really to do until Dark Souls II released. Though after playing for a while I found that the game is very enjoyable albeit micro transactions if you want extreme customization (i.e skins more color options or heads) The game does start you off with 50 or so platinum which is enough to buy an acessory or color set which is cool. There are very few things you can't get unless you pay for, you CAN pay to unlock weapons without needing to grind for parts which is good in all some weapons might require you to be a certain rank to be able to even buy the blueprint for (in game currency of course) or alternativly you can buy them with Irl cash. Getting new characters can sometimes be taxing but in the long run it's worth the time it taxes to construct the new character ( 12 hours for each of the 3 pieces then 72 for the actual character). Daily rewards are very nice as well you can get anything from 50% of your next platinum purchase to weapon blueprints or even exp/affinity/credit boosters. All in all Warframe is a very fun game to play.....crap now that I think about it I didn't even mention the gameplay O.o

review: This game is what people always dreamed of becoming, a friggen space ninja. Warframe is interesting right from the get-go, it gives you full customization of your character, weapons, accessories, sentinal companion, colors and badges. While the game sort of centers highly around useing real money to buy things instantly, you can also just play the game and get everything for free the hard way. Which if your able to I would reccommend, buying the in game money is fairly expensive. There are many characters to play as, that are all fairly unique playstyle wise and even more so look wise, personally I went with Nekros, being a space Grim Reaper was too good to pass up. :3 While Warframe does glitch from time to time, generally it's not a game wrecking thing, a lot of the time the glitches are actually kinda neat or funny, and the gameplay is really enjoyable. Ranged weaponry is very diverse and melee weapons are neat and a complete neccessity at the same time. From the very beginning your able to run up and along walls, do flips and rolls, utterly destroy enemies and even lose. Teamwork is a big thing in this game and you'll find that beating a mission on solo isn't so easy, you gotta be sneaky, because conserveing your health and being spareing with your equiptment is important. Four people to a mission, and the people are able to support, and revive their team members, while many of the different characters powers help your group as a whole in firefights. There was a update to the game adding Dojo's and clans, meaning you get a normal MMORPG thing here. However interestingly enough, you help create the Dojo, you wonder around your Dojo, and you interact with your Dojo, you wind up feeling connected to the game. In it's entirety, yes I would reccommend this game, it's free and if your able to, you can get everything in the game for free, but if you do wish to buy the points, make sure you think about how much your spending, you could buy a couple games for the amount it charges you sometimes. Hope this helps someone. V^w^V Space Grim Ninja Reaper VOwOV

review: ==**NEGATIVES**== =While V-Sync is enabled, there are some SERIOUS lag issues. =The first few levels are easy, but I have no idea why but after those BEGINNER LEVELS, I started getting wrecked every 5 seconds, the game gets so obnoxiously difficult! WHAT THE HECK. (I play solo only) =The "Upgrade" system doesn't come across as good, to me. Kind of boring. =For a PC game, it has a lot of weird controls. It makes me feel like im playing Mortal Kombat, I HATE MORTAL KOMBAT. =Theres really NO direction at all in the game. I feel like I'm playing CoD, get thrown into a bunch of enemies and kill them, and win. (Although CoD does have a tiny bit of story and direction) ==**POSITIVES**== =While V-Sync is off I play on max settings and it plays, looks, and feels like a great game. =The melee weapons are nice, and it feels nice to hack and slash at enemies in a game full of guns and robots (YES, TO ALL YOU GAME DEVS OUT THERE, THERE ARE SUCH THINGS AS MELEE WEAPONS IN FUTURISTIC GAMES), although they're kind of weak.. =It has Multiplayer AND Solo. (I hate Multiplayer-only games...) =There are TONS of playstyles (Warframes) to pick from, which makes it hard to say "I hate this game because I can't play how I want". =Unlike other futuristic games out there, this game DOESN'T TRY TOO HARD. I really hate it when developers take a futuristic game and make it TOO futuristic and just ruin the game. =IT'S FREE. For a free game you'd think "Oh, theres no reason for the Devs to make a good game because they're not selling it, they're just giving it away." That's the exact opposite. I, personally, think this game should be sold on Steam for just as much as those mainstream $60 games. It has tons of content, seemingly endless gameplay, and it has tremendous replay value.

review: I decided to give the Warframe free-to-play a shot way back in September of 2013. Its Mighty Morphin Tenno Rangers promo vids on Steam were horribly uninteresting so I was resistant to give it a try when it first came out (watch the newer vids on the Youtubes instead). The cheesy "Ninjas Play Free" motto on the promos also threw me off. However, the fast-paced, third-person shooter & melee, high-tech space ninja, gameplay and creative design are both solid and entertaining. I am thoroughly hooked and addicted now. I've played quite a few free-to-play titles, and so far, Digital Extremes is my favorite f2p design team, with constant updates (weekly, plus hotfixes) and the right mix of Canadian humor & sarcasm thrown in to their interactions. Their customer support is also top notch (although limited to weekday business hours rather than 24/7). People complain about grind, but I am used to Korean and Japanese MMO grind, so the grind is near non-existant here for me, comparatively. You'll usually get the drops you are looking for after a few runs, especially as DE continually tweaks and finetunes the drop tables. The procedurally generated levels & spawns keep things fresh, too. Hardware: Nvidia card recommended. It'll run well on GTX 400 series or better. I run it on a GTX 680 on max settings. There are issues with AMD cards. You'll need to fiddle with the settings in the launcher and elsewhere to get an AMD card from crashing your game. The same goes for trying to play on older laptops. Speaking of settings, turn off Motion Blur from the game settings. Do this now. Warframe Motion Blur is not traditional gaming Motion Blur but "destroy all retinas" Motion Blur, especially when you get some scrub Volt PUG spamming its Speed ability back to back like it is its only power or something and making your screen unplayable. You will more than likely need to forward ports on your router to play with others, especially if your router is a few years old. You can select which ports are used in game and go from there. I used to get connection errors from time to time (even with in-game UPnP switched off) until I got a new router with better UDP protocols. Now I have no issues. Getting Started: Steam has some excellent Beginners Guides. I also found the Resource Farming Guide invaluable when I was leveling. I also recommend having the Warframe Wiki bookmarked as well. Good hunting, Tenno!

review: Warframe is a sci-fi based third-person shooter. It is a very fun game with replayable stealthy or action played levels. Co-op mode is very fun and interactive apart from the fact people steal my kills >.<. Other than that i like how i can change my armor, customize my weapons, and use different colors on my character and my trusty blade. Me, personally i like to play it stealthy on all missions, but if you're not that type, that's your way of playing :) Overall, i love this game with its parkour aspects where as i can run across walls to get to the other side of a pit of lava or acid and i can climd up on a box to straddle over a railing to find myself six feet from an enemy. Very fun and lots of cool features i highly reccomend it to shooter fans. :)

However, if you can ignore that, and don't mind the grind, there is much fun to be had in this game. These types of games are always fairly addictive, as you are rewarded for EVERYthing, and always feel a sense of progression to almost force you to keep playing.

Not Pay2win in anyway really since the game is all PVE. You can unlock all the Frames by doing missions and crafting them.

review: Warframe is an entirely new asthetic, instead of taking cover to dodge bullets you make cover, stealth around, or even dodge bullets (and lasers) with your "mad ninja skillz". Warframe is a thrid person shooter, with emphasis on grinding, and on teamwork. If you seek to play this (amazing) game, I'd recommend a team of four (you and three of your ninja'est friends) with some form of vocal interaction such as "Teamspeak" or "Razer Comms" as I've not gotten the vocal settings figured out in game yet. If you enjoy the "grind" like in Monster Hunter, or Phantasy Star, you'll love Warframe, and remember: "Space Ninja's play free"

review: Surprisingly good game with co-op. Sort of like the Mass Effect 3 multiplayer, but good, and with free-running space ninjas. There is almost no PvP in this game, which is wonderful for all of us sick of wonderful PvE games being ruined by devs focusing solely on PvP, but if you're too much of a  little gremlin to play cooperatively with other people you're not going to like it very much. As someone who's dumped a lot of time into this game already, I should point out two things going in: it takes about 10-20 hours before you'll get the hang of all of the craziness (so read up on the wiki), and it *is* primarily designed to be a cooperative game (so find a group to play with, because it'll go much faster and be more reliable than playing with players from matchmaking).

review: This game honestly wasn't what I epected when I started playing. I figured, "Oh an action MMO, so we're looking at a massive world full of people all doing random quests only with guns". Wrong. The world is divided into small maps that you play with teams and completing each map unlocks the next. The combat is fast, requiring you to go back and forth between shooting things to slicing them up with melee attacks. The sheer depth of customization options you have is astounding, and the way that skills are handled is a nice addition. The graphics themselves are nice, and players can drop in to a map in the middle of play so you may start a map with only you and another player but end it with 4-5 people. There is an element of grind present, as to manufacture gear once you have the blueprints you need materials for which you'll either have to pay Platinum (the real-monet currency) or play maps over a few times to get what you need from enemy drops (easier to do on Survival levels). Also, leveling up yourself is a seperate things from leveling weapons and frames, and ranking up as a player requires completing "challenges" which you need to wait 24 hours to try again if you fail. I have a few problems with the game; First, you're kind of thrown to the wolves when it comes to initialy setting up your character, but the Wiki helps. Secondly, I feel that, while the graphics are wonderful and the visuals themselves nicely done, the bio-mechanical look of the game could have been done better. That's not to say that it looks like crap, just that the disproportionate bodies of the enemies can look out of place compared to the avatars of the you and the other players. Sometimes the game won't remember the mods I've added to weapons/frames after I exit that menu, but that might be something I'm doing wrong and not the game itself You're best option, if you try the game and enjoy it, is to buy the $40 starter pack. You'll seriously need the in-game and real money currencies as well as the other bonuses to help get yourself started, otherwise you're stuck with the most basic of basic gear for quite a long time.

review: I love this game, its well made. Good graphics and fighting mechanics, all bugs are dealt with quickly, so they aren't much of a problem. A wide range of missions, well suited for leveling up, as it doesn't rise too fast, nor too slow. A massive selection of weapons, with challenges to get the materials to craft them adds even more fun to the game. I really do recommend this game to my friends and the public, especially since it is a great game for being free. Get it now! You're missing out on all the ninja fun!

review: TL;DR: Really good Space-Ninja game. 11/10 In this game you're this alien thing in a suit called a Warframe, and you do cool stuff like murder alien robots. This game is almost 100% Free, with most of the in-game purchases being optional. You can even craft most of the premium items for free. 8/8- IGN 11/10- Me

review: Currently one of the best F2P (Free to Play) games available right now. Warframe has top of the line Graphics, controls, content, Dev team quality, sound and even unusual lore. This game has got everything going for it right now and no downside what so ever which is almost unheard of. Suffice it to say its doing right what 99% of the current gaming market is doing wrong. It's also in beta but for a beta product its more complete than most high end titles in the past 5 years or so. Also, While the game does sell weapons and equipment in the cash shop it is usually far easier to obtain in game than the cash shop price which actually puts cash shop users at a near disadvantage. How uncommon! If all of this wasn't enough the rate at which updates are cranked out in nearly over polished form is quite amazing. Warframes cranked out more content, updates, changes, balances, new items, armors, maps and AI types than many high end MMO's do in a year and they do it with a much smaller team too. This game is a shinning example of what "should be". Suffice it to say Warframes cutting its own bloody path to true fame and glory among both F2P and P2P games alike. This one is a definite must try for any scifi, hack&slash or shooter fan. Easy 10/10.

review: Exceptionally good. The game provides a fairly unique mix of elements that produce for the player a huge experience through procedurally generated maps against a fairly wide range of enemies. The developer support for the game is active and ongoing; this isn't a game that receives updates only rarely; events are often, and new content is plentiful. For a new player, you can expect to be working your way through things for weeks, and even months before you will start to see the edges of the game. Bugs exist, but they are not as common as you might anticipate from forum posts; the game is reliable enough to play with satisfaction. Balance is also an issue in some small cases, but for the most part there is no 'right way' to play, aside from a select few very-end-game situations, where inevitably certain strategies are more favourable. If you are determined and skilled enough, you can make anything work, and have fun. There is a second currency aside from that earned in-game, but it should be noted that Warframe has managed to entirely avoid the notion of pay-2-win. You -can- buy weapons and frames with real money, but in every case, you can also obtain those items through gameplay. There is a trading system that also allows players to trade that currency to one another; if you play enough, and are smart about it, you will never need to spend any money at all, a fact that I almost feel guilty about, having established more than enough fortune to see me through for years to come, I will likely never need to give another penny to the developers. Potentially this only means that someone else has, however. The action is as fast-paced as the player will demand, the demand of skill progresses comfortably as the player attempts higher-level missions, and there is also a tangible sense of progression the more you play, as you acquire new gear and upgrades. The only criticism I have is the 'archwing', a recent addition that is in dire need of certain tweaks. It progresses comparatively slow, at a snail's pace, to the rest of the game, and it is only loosely integrated with the rest of the game. There are many opportunities where it would fit to have a mission progress into this gamemode, but for either practicality reasons, or the devs haven't thought of it, archwing exists as a fairly separate entity. Regardless, Warframe is a fantastic game, with plenty of interesting ways for a player to blast, snipe and slash their way through the universe. From me, this game receives a rare "highly recommended"; it is an example of what a free-to-play game should aspire towards. Edit: Oh yeah, you play as a magic space-ninja. Are you kidding me? What more do you want?

I call that a win-win. Maybe also contain some rage inducing Orokin Cells.

review: Warframe is unique, in many good ways and in many bad too. The premise of the game itself is brilliant, space ninja-samurai that fight robot-men and plauge beasts, it's radical and filled with flashy effects that you'd expect from a third person shooter mixed with a spectacle fighter, with an interesting and in-depth lore to boot it's hard to fault Warframe for what it offers and the price it offers it for, free. There is however something to note, Warframe features a cash shop that allows you buy anything within the game for Platinum, your Platinum account is charged by real world money and doing so gives you a huge boost within the game, I want to stress though that everything, every single item can be gained in game without the use of Platinum. To do so though, makes the game a massive grind. Starting solo and venturing into the game for the first time, my personal experience was that this game truly comes close to forcing you to have to pay for some item to break up the norm of running the same mission over and over again in order to gain new weapon upgrades, before spending any money on the game I was on my way to gaining my Prime Warframe, but purchasing a pack of Platinum surpassed all build times, item requirments and even allowed me to double my modification slots. A great, free game that becomes grounded by a borderline questionable payment methods, if you can deal with the occasional grind, it's well worth it. And I can totally deal with the grind.

review: The only downside to this game is that there is no open world or even sandbox type environment to expand immersion within the world. In virtually every other aspect, the game is a dream-like playground for fans of games like mass effect, unreal tournament, or in some ways even Prince of Persia and Ninja Gaiden. There is wall running handled in a well executed manner, there is melee combat complete with actual combos and timing as well as blocking, there is evil space creatures and factions to kill and hate, and there is a huge array of both weapons and warframes to choose from and collect in order to diversify your experience. Even recently a new system of flight combat was added straight out of a space shooter sim hybrid. While it is true the game is VERY light on story line or explanation, and can become quite grindy after a deep binge of obsessive exposure, the core systems of the game are bieng constantly improved and there is NO pay 2 win mechanic because anything you can acquire through the shop except for a very few cosmetics are all obtainable in game. PvP players be warned however, this game is not about PvP, at all, and the PvP aspect of the game is not very well realized or implemented at this point. While PvP is playable, it is certainly not for everyone and is not what the game is focused around at all.

review: At least a year and a half ago, I saw this game for the first time. I still remember what I was thinking while watching the trailer: "My god, this game looks too complicated, you must have to mash combo after combo of keys to do that flippy thing" After this and some thought, I figured I would think about it and wait to see if a friend recommends it. I regret not signing up right away. A week or so later, a friend I had met on Left 4 Dead 2 starts playing the game, and I ask him, "Is it good? Is it worth making the account for?" He said, "Hell yeah, this game is crazy... I still don't really get the game, but it is pretty cool." So, I set up my account and started playing. For the first few days, I played a little here and there, still pretty clueless and felt Planetside 2 needed my attention more. But one Saturaday morning, I had a sudden realization that I could get more weapons and even Warframes than just my good old Excaliber and Mk-1 Braton. I started playing much more after that, and I still remember my very first crafted weapon: my beautiful Orthos. Next came the Furis, and finally the Boltor. I was all set up, and at that point completely hooked. This was all a year and a half ago, too. That game has come SO VERY FAR from that point, and I am still playing today like I did before. The gameplay was and still is loads of fun and extremely fast pased. If you are looking for a good game to play, I recommend clicking "Download"

Between alerts, drops, and blueprints, you are not required to spend any money. One of my favorite games ever.

review: A decent F2P 3rd person shooter. I'll start with the positives first. Visuals are excellent. Warframes (classes) are varied and each have a unique look and application Lot's of mods (or items that will change your weapon, sentinel (pet), or warframe) Decent amount of Lore for those that look hard enough (the game is kinda like Dark Souls in that the story isn't presented directly to you, instead it's mentioned in a few conversations, events, and the codex) Fast pace, but easy combat. You can easily hit enemies while running along walls, doing slides, etc. Easy game to hop on and play a couple rounds and hop off when you feel like. Provides challenging levels for both experience players at higher levels, and casual gamers at lower levels with no real need to go to higher levels except for the challenge. Consistently update the game and have DE have devstreams that shows what they are trying to do and what is planned on being implimented next (always good to watch) Now for the negatives: It's grindy...very grindy. You'll spend a while at later levels trying to get a Forma (a high level material that's needed to either let you re-level your warframe/weapon with added benefits or to build good weapons from the dojo, or guild hall) Levels repeat in both layout and mission type (defence, capture, rescue, survival, with a few others). Luckly recent updates have been giving planets their own look so the layout problem is being fixed. You get laggy games more often then some other games as it is P2P. On a 1-10 scale I'd give the game 7.5 in it's current state. Fun gameplay but repetative.

review: Easily the best free to play game I've ever played. I started playing back when they released it on Steam last year and it's still something I play most days for at least a bit. With constant new content (every week or two), extended and new features frequently, the option to get EVERYTHING in-game without spending a penny and a pretty helpful and fun community, this game is fastastic. Over 100 weapons as of right now with over 20 warframes, quite a few pets and hundreds of mods. It is a game that's 100% about grinding and waiting for your items to craft so you have to be patient. If you like grinding and such (which I do) this game is definitely for you. Download it.

review: Pros: + Good Graphics + Cool variety of different weapons + Combat System + Fast Bugfixes + Many variety of different characters to play with + Different types of bosses and enemies + SPACE NINJAS Cons: - Grinding (seriously if you dont like grinding you will not enjoy this game) - Not noob friendly - End game dont exist yet (only survival and defense mission that can last for 40-60 min) - Repeated map tileset - Confusing Maps - Pray to RNG god a whole lot, you never get what you want - A bit of event to win (so dont miss events) Be prepared to sink tons of hours like I have if you want to experience everything that warframe has to offer. This game is not friendly to new players cause all weapons and warframes takes many resources to build, so expect many reruns. Despite all of its flawes its still a fun game with loads of contents for newer player, so if you have time to play many hours I can recommend this game for you.

review: Easily one of my favourite Free-To-Play's, due to the nature of the in-game purchases and how much fun it is to grind levels/gear. I actually can't think of another FTP game that is FUN to GRIND. Runescape was probably only the other fun game going back to its classic days, but even that has basically become pay-to-play, disregarding the fact that they still advertise it as a FTP game. You can aquire anything in the game without real world money, and it isn't ludicriously hard like it is in competitor games. Furthermore, your far better to spend your money on additional Warframe (characters/suits) and weapon slots as initially you are pretty strapped for space. However by the time you reach these limits you will know if your money is worth it. Keep it mind however that the slots are incredibly cheap aswell, for 2 weapon slots sell at at 12p (p is platinum, the ingame premium currency), and 1 warframe slot a tad more expensive at 20p. Definately give this game a try if you haven't already, it won't cost you a cent - literally!

review: Overall for a new player this is a very good game, and i recommend getting it. In fact i'd recommend everyone at least tries it once, because it truly is different to any other game out today. Now i did greatly enjoy this game, i've donated quite alot of money during my time playing. However this game suffers what many games still do; Once you have everything you want, or are just satisfied with what you have, the only reason you play the game is to try look better than your peers. [Can also be explained in the endless cycle formula- Grind to get better weapons, to grind with those better weapons, to grind with those better weapons to get more weapons to grind with, to grind to get better weapons (loop here) = Insanity] It basically becomes a great big pissing contest between the pro's, including endless hours of grinding for weapons that 'the other players don't have' yet the weapon is most likely not even worth the grind. Yes I admit this game is still in developement, however I am just pre-warning, this game is yet to offer a great amount for the good/old players. As for actuall gameplay, i'd give it a 9/10. Fun Factor, 9/10, but decreases overtime. Unless you don't mind grinding. As an added bonus i'd like to praise the Technical Support team, they are the nicest and most helpful support i've ever encountered. <3 you warframe, even if you annoy me.

review: A fast-paced action-packed third person shooter that will entice you within minutes. The range of available characters and weapons to unlock and build really add to the game's possibilities of ways to play, fight and win. The only "negative" thing I have come to notice is that you can't really unlock other warframes to use until mid to late game (unless you spend real money), but even that just encourages more gameplay and more fun! But a word of caution: This game does not have a running storyline after the first missions, so if you are looking for a plot to get involved in, this is not the game. Needless to say, overall, this game is a great action-filled TPS that will have you hooked for life and the fun will go on without end.

review: I'm not a huge fan of FPS. So, having the melee attack & bow option is great. The graphics are amazing as well. I also like that anyone can be recruited into a squad or you can even select solo..as I'm more prone to soloing.

You don't care about how you feel and grind dem items for cool guns/warframes. 7. Wasted all dem hours. 8. Worth it. 9. Only play it because of 3.

review: Pretty fun game, especially if you are into sci-fi stuff. It becomes even better if you are playing with frinds as squad. The main defect is that it can be boring if you want to craft weapon/frame and you need to get materials- it takes long time and you have to play on same maps again and again.

review: l -ABSOLUTELY- recommend this game. Incredible fun. Co-op too, so pay to win is almost out of the question. Go solo or go with friends, even go online and you'll have a good time. ;) Choose a weapon that suits your playstyle, and choose a frame to go along with it. The game is amazingly free to play - however you want. All in all the game is great. l can't explain much with this text alone, and if a picture is worth a thousand words then that must mean actual gameplay is worth 100,000. Go try it out now, you'll be glad you did. It's only 30 minutes to download, and 36,000 of fun. ;)

review: If I could spam the utter living hell out of the thumbs up button, I seriously would. I never thought I'd like a game like this, but it's absolutely amazing! The graphics, the gameplay, the mechanics of the game, the stories (missions, really0 are pretty cool, the variety. It's basically the father to Destiny, but better. I love Destiny, DO NOT get me wrong, I really do, but all the exotic things Destiny promised are actually here in Warframe. The weapons have deeper variety and the cutomization is pretty freaking awesome. They're still adding new things to the game (Like the hounds they added to the game not too long ago called Kubrows) as it keeps going and it's all incredibly awesome! And there is so much to do, I hardly have enough time in my day to do it all. If you like Destiny and the Mass Effect series, you'll love Warframe!

review: Let me make this clear. I love Warframe. I started playing it a few years ago, way before the whole Archwing, doggeh companions and Ordis. All this stuff added to the game has made it even better. My only problem? I CANNOT LAUNCH IT FROM STEAM. Something has screwed Warframe up for my steam, or the computer I'm on, and I've tried everything to get it to work. I can only get the game to launch fully by going into the game's folder and running the launcher outside of Steam. Now if only I didn't have damn lag, then I'd be content. So if your computer is better than mine, which it probably is, and if you love games that you can feel epic and badass in with only an option to spend actual cash, download Warframe now and become a space ninja. The grind for items and stuff is still there, but all games have item grinding so, why complain about that unless you enjoy being a negative little whiner. You know who you are, you whiners.

review: This game is fantastic, the devs are extremely active in the community, there is a massive variation in weapons and warframes (characters). The levels are randomly generated with premade tile sets, so levels are hardly ever the same. The only thing i have against the game is the fact that it is a grinding game. Although honestly it's not to much of an issue. The gameplay is smooth and satisfying. The best part is that this game is still in Beta, so it can only get better. Warframe doesn't deserve a 67/100 from metascore.

review: 97/100 + Pretty good controls once you get the hang of them. + Very unique abilities for each frame. + Many strategies are usually viable for every encounter. + Frame balance has improved a bit since my last review. + Good F2P system - everything can be obtained, somehow, for free(minus a few cosmetic things). + Unique, diverse enemies, especially the bosses. + Generous difficulty curve. + Very fast gameplay that adequately punishes for inattentiveness. + Receiving constant updates, frequent events and timely developer responses. + Gmod ragdoll physics. + Story and lore content actually exist now, and it's constantly evolving with every update. + Voiceacting is pretty alright. + The music is great. + Astronomical replayability. + Nifty weapon-modding system that actually does allow for a significant degree of customization. ~ The Archwing "space combat sans spacecraft" crap is incredibly disappointing. ~ PvP is b r o k e n. It does exist, though, in case you want to rally some friends and ban the ridiculous weapons. ~ Fairly smart AI... for a multiplayer game. ~ Extremely expensive paid content. ~ Long "crafting" times for items, but you can "rush" them for premium currency. ~ Grinding is a mildly significant part of the game. ~ Hosted client-locally, rarely leading to nasty lag. This also means it will hose your connection if you are the host and you have a terrible ISP. ~ Severe Chronic Power Creep is a recurring theme. ~ No official soundtrack available for purchase... - STILL very buggy. Most bugs don't last too terribly long, but they introduce new ones pretty regularly. - The code that handles the intial connecting to other players is horrible. - Poor weapon balance. - QA basically skips over the text.

review: This game just keeps getting better. Sometimes you need to farm for resources but even farming is fun! So many classes and weapons I don't know what to do with myself. I totally reccomend this game and can't say enough good about it. It's better then pizza (and pizza is amazing). This game has so many hours worth of gameplay to it and yet it's FREE. My life is so simple and happy now that I have Warframe. :D

review: I got the game in july 2014, i've had steam since january 2014. Between getting this game and now, i now have more hours in warframe than all my other games combined in the last year. This game has taken the throne of my favorite game ever. Something about it keeps me from burning out on it, but then again, minecraft did that for a while to, and i haven't played it in months, so i may burn out on it, but i don't see it happening in the near future. The game is free to play, and when people hear or see a free to play game they are afraid of it because of pay to win games. The great thing about this game is, some of the best weapons in the game, are only achievable through gameplay alone, while still giving people good incentive to pay. The game Looks and, although it took me a while to get used to, controls great. My computer, not the beefiest in the world, and warframe can still keep a good fps, maybe some lag if alot of things are happening, or i have a bunch of other programs running in the background, but overall, lag free on my average powered computer (I5). another thing that could draw people in is the mostly co-op multiplayer... when i first ran TF2, I got killed over and over by people much much better than me. warframe is a mainly coop multiplayer, meaning, that if a n00b, you may feel like a noob when you see your scores compared to others, but, don't have to worry about the same things as in competitive games... and if you like, there are still conflicts and dueling arenas where pvp is possible. The amount of content is amazing, how this game runs on my computer is amazing, and the awesome devs keep adding more, and keep the community somewhat hyped for new content with livestreams and feeds. I've played 322 hours of this game, and i am still learning more and more. The community is great, I probably wouldn't still be playing if i hadn't played woth or met people that were nice, and helped me get better at the game. all sorts of guides and hepful content exist for this game. Alot of my friends have burned out on this game but, me and one other continue to play it more and more. i believe this is just how you plaw games. One friend of mine plays games as though he is a game reviewer, plays about 5-10 hours, then gets a new game, he spent about 150 in warframe and stopped. I on the other hand, could never do that, if the game allows i can spend months (nearly two years in the case of SSBB) practically only playing one game and not having an urge to play any others. the same happened with awesomenauts, minecraft,TF2, and Other console games. That got a bit rambly, but, how long you remain playing this depends on you, but it is definetly worth picking up and playing atleast 10 hours...

review: If you dont have money to burn. you are in for a LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOT of grinding. also has a form of virtual hats. so theres that. Fo srs version Pros: Space ninjas, concept 10/10 Warframes have good designs and diverse powers so two frames dont feel like they play the same but with a different unicorn hat good fun to play with friends that kill you in the dojo after you find a bug in the sparring place. Enemies are unique and dont feel that much like pallete swaps of the same guy with a gun. Lots and lots of weapons. (its got whips. WHIPS i tell you) Bosses usually require a full party of people. even the first one. (cheap ) WOAH DUD DEM GREEPHIKS (they is k) Cons: Farming Simulator 2013 Warfarme edition. Leveling is really tedious for frames and weapons alike Usually need high level players to help grind money/EXP/Resources ect. Makes you feel slightly like dead weight. Its not pay to win, its pay to get any godamn variety It takes about 3 days to get a new weapon/warframe without spending money Suffers from Payday 2 disease, they have a big update but if you dont have money to spend have fun running around the same missions over and over again to get a small chance to get the parts then farm for the components and then wait days to craft it. GOOD UPDATE HEY KIDS, YOU WANT SOME NANO SPORES (400,000 of them currently too much) Most of the cons can be filtered in to "Farming simulator" complaint. Mercus rating game of ratingness 2/5 Get friends to play it with you, or it gets lonely. also technical sequel to dark sector. and thats cool

review: FREE and NEVER ENDING FUN! What more could you ask of in this game. Basically speaking, this is a free to play game where 95% of the in game items can be obtainable, of course excluding limited items (events) and exclusive items (beta tester and founders who supported the game when it first started) and some appearance options like colors and syandanas (capes) for your warframe. THIS IS NOT A PAY2WIN. There are two currencies in game, and one is called credits while the latter is called platinum. Platinum is used to purchase cosmetic items like colors and syandanas. It can also be used to rush wait times (when you build things it takes real time to craft the items, but it actually isn't much of a bother and is a reasonable wait time, you'll see when you play the game). Other than that, platinum does NOT affect performance wise on who is better. Credits on the other hand is earned quite easily (do missions, kill stuff, open lockers/chests), but is needed alot of to craft and mod your warframe. I also want to add that if you get the right mods or prime parts of a warframe, you can actually go to trade chat and sell those items for platinum, which can be used for purchasing those color options and syandanas (I've yet to spend a single penny on this game, which I probably will since the developers of this game are amazing, which I'll get to that later in this review, and I have easily 5 syandanas, color palettes, lots of inventory spaces, and potatoes-which expand one's mod slots on a warframe/weapon ) The sheer variety of customization and the amount of weapons at your disposal is insane. This game has been severly criticized for being repetitive, and what people don't see in this game is the amount of options you can do to have FUN. You are quite literally a ninja who can parkour around all the maps and use from machine guns to pistols to the simple kunais and katanas ninjas use, and thats just a start. You can choose to go in guns blazing, or even take a more stealthier approach by being invisible and performing assassinations. The graphics I have to say are really really top notch. There's nothing I can really say about running it on high graphics, other than to either experience it yourself, or maybe look up a youtube video of how high end the graphics are (but that isn't really the same experience). This recent update even added in more companions in the form of kubrows (dog-like allies) to be at your side, in addition to the sentinels that were floating around helping you in various ways. Not only is the game amazing, but this game offers the most amazing staff of developers and amazing community one can ask. The developers actually listen to their players and read forums to give us what we want to see in a game. For example, Nova (a warframe or powersuit as you might call it) was created by the players. The new sword and shield weapon called the silva and aegis was also created by a player whose design was noticed by the developers, in addition to two more weapons that are currently still in development. The developers even hold streams or prime times in which they interact with the players and talk to us about their upcoming ideas and updates. If you're even curious about how dedicated the developers are to this game, look up on youtube for an update 14 update the night before the update is released, and you can tell how many of them had little to no sleep working on this massive update. TL;DR - FREE game where you can get 95% of all items (excluding founders exclusives and limited edition items that came most likely from events), has good graphics, has an amazing developer staff and community, FUN, NOT A PAY2WIN

review: With beautiful graphics, great gameplay, a variety of missions to complete, many scenarios, many bosses, strong RPG elements, good reasons to fight bosses, and great Co-Op gameplay earns this game a huge thumbs up, not even considering the fact it's free. With events, frequent updates, and even more stuff promised it is a great game and I heartily recommend it! The only downside I can think of is the need of 'platinum', money you'll have to purchase with actual money. This should be resolved with rare chances to gain platinum, other than that this game is magnificent. Ignore the metagame score, it deserves much more! Update on this review: Warframe's a gift that just keeps on giving. Currently it has 6 factions of varying sizes, a codex system, a revamped damage system, tons of weapons, 20 warframes to choose from, a variety of missions, a whole starmap to fill, tons of leveling up, frequent updates, frequent events, hidden areas, and at least 8 variations of randomly assembled tile sets. It's an amazing game with a bright future.

review: Got the game in early may. must say that the game has come a long way since then. content adding has been doen very well and the addition of special events on a monthly basis has made the game a lot less repetetive than what it used to be. the only thing i really dislike about this game is as much as all the essential components in warframe are able to be obtained for free using the crafting feature, there is no possible way to abtain free inventory slots for extra weapons other than the 10 you get from the start. As for controls, they are pretty good, although the vertical wallrunning feature can bug at times. the recoil system is what to expect from a 3rd person shooter but they have made each weapon have it's own recoil trend. Fps gamers will have no trouble adjusting. controls can be changed in game as always but be wary of when you do it as changing in some cinematics will cause a CTD UI has changed several times since the release and the latest one has been the best one yet. the missions are put into a web starting from mercury and spreading to the other planets. the other features in the main menu are placed accross the top of the screen. the UI has several minor and rare problems with locking. Gameplay is really unique. not like any other 3rd person shooters ive every played. there is a good diversity in game types and the leveling system is fair. the game is very forgiving in early stages being a little too easy with an almost extreme bend in difficulty after the first few planets, where it comes to the point where missions may be unplayable solo and will require a team complete, epecially in higher T3 void missions and derelict. Every warframe has its own unique characteristics from health and shields to abilities and appearances, which can be enhanced and/ or altered using mods and apparel customisations found in missions or purchased in store using micro transactions in the game. For a free to play, i must say it has some AAA title qualities in it and can be a fun game to play with friends. you will have to pay a little money down the track if you want to keep all your weapons in the future. Overall, nice experiment. it's coming along nicely, some good features. Content 7/10 Updating 9/10 Gameplay 8/10 Controls 7/10 Graphics 9/10 Compatibility 8/10 Stability 7/10 OVERALL 7.8/10

review: You can look at my game time and I've only had this game for about 3 weeks now. I only played a couple of hours the first week then got addicted to this game. It's a very fun, sci-fi based, robot alien killing, fast paced, co-op game. It does have some features that make it seem like you need to pay but you don't. Here's the run down: You can spam/farm void missions to get in game currency e.g. selling prime parts(from void missions) for platnium anywhere from 4p to 250p+. This game is either wait to get it or pay to get it instantly.

The most important thing i would have to say is that know your warframes before you play the game. It was kinda difficult when i picked my warframe (hint:I picked Volt).

review: Warframe is a great game. Playing it by myself for a while made it seem horrible, but then I started playing with friends from school. It became one of the most played games in my library. It's a perfect game to nerd out with. This needs more than an hour to get used to and to start having a lot of fun (Unless you're lucky and someone gives you a ton of gear. It is a definitely a game you have to play over a long period. It may take a while getting used to the odd playstyle.(I just wish there was a bit more lore in the game!). This game is absolutely not Pay to Win, but it is pay to look good. Nearly every weapon that can be bought with platinum has a blueprint version that can be bought with credits. I myself enjoy collecting resources and building the blueprints more anyway. Again, great game 9/10

review: WarFrame is a lot of fun whether you like to play Solo or Co-op. It's a Freemium game, so if you don't want to drop some dough on cold, hard Platinum (Paid currency) you will be grinding like crazy. Everything functional can be researched/built/found/won/etc. whereas aesthetics are all Plat-purchased. Game looks great, plays great and is constantly receiving updates and new events happen regularly. Get it, play it. What do you have to lose aside from some time you would have otherwise wasted anyways?

review: Okay, where to start. To all the people looking at my hours? Yeah I know... I played this game on the website Client alot more before steam. Onto a dead honest review. I have been playing this game from before open beta (Almost a year and a half) and I have seen all of its ups and downs. This will be honest. Back in the day, you would start off with a choice of 3 warframes, either Excalibur (Mr. Coverboy) Volt (An electric Wizard) or Loki (The trickster who loves being invisible) Back at this time, the game was simple. You shoot stuff, you get xp and mods, and you get better right? Well, now, there are 20+ warframes (Or so I think) and their "Prime" versions (Superpowered versions) Certain things avalible in the game back then are not avalible now, such as the Snipetron (Sniper rifle) and Excalibur prime (Shiny Coverboy) These items are now no longer avalible. Ever. Great news huh? There are too many weapons to count, and I own almost every one, and have playtested every one. I own every Warframe (Class) except one. I could harp for days, but lets move to the present. Classes +Non-linear, you can play any Warframe with a sniper rifle. +Each Warframe has its own unique abilities, with some Warframes more suited to tasks than others. +Modability, meaning you can build your Warframe for anything you want, even if it is not reccomended. +Customisation, meaning you can re-color your Warframe to your own wants, even if its Pink. -Very few different skins -Color packs are pay to play -Different skins and helmets are pay to play -There is an unobtainable Warframe (Excalibur Prime) Weapons +Tons of choices, legitly a thousand plus different combinations. +There is a tentacle gun... +Different classes of weapons (Shotguns, Pistols, Sniper rifles, Melee, FRIKIN BOWS) +Customisable, yeah, pink guns mofo. +Modability, modding your guns for different stuffs, yeah! +Most model designs look amazing! -Very few guns have alt-fire -Some guns are unavaible to obtain, like, ever... (Snipetron, ect.) Companions +Puppies! Fuggin' Puppies! +Compainions, such as little robots or mutants (Djinn) to follow you around and shoot stuff -Very few varients (4 dog classes, and 7 companions) -Most are useless in combat, unless putting work into it (Not including dogs) -Dog companions take an amazing ammout of time and effort to obtain Controls +Fluent, non choppy controls +Combo keys for different reactions in-game (Ie wallrun/sliding melee attack) +No input lag even for lower-end computers (You press w and you walk forward god darn it!) +Easy to get used to -Control setup is slightly unorthodox. Level design +Each level is randomly generated from a selection and tileset of rooms. +Each type of faction has its own level designs. +No level is the same. (Unless you have played like, 10,000 levels like I have, and you got one damn one that was the same) -The Tileset of rooms gets repetive -Some areas bug out the map Graphics +Ambient atmosphere when needed. +Physics can be hilarious (I have 10 hrs of playtime just pinning people to the wall...) +Enemy design is intresting (Especially the zombies) +Weapon design is amazing -Low end computers will have to down the graphics... Alot... Economy This is where a checklist is redundant, as I may have to rant. I will start out by saying that "This game is completely free to play, and any item in the game is obtainable by putting work into it, including the pay to pay items" This will hold true throughout my rant, although I will probably complain alot. In essence, this game is run by crafting. You craft weapons, Warframes, companions, ect. There are three kinds of people who play Warframe. There are the legit, F2P players, who get everything legitly, and obtaining P2P items through trading. The second kind of people, (Myself included) are the people who have put money into it, but not extravagant ammounts. Usually $10 to around a top of $300. (This goes out to you, TF2 people.) And then finally, the Wallet-Warriors. Yes, you. You know who you are. You are those people who have put insane ammounts of money into this game in order to have everything you want then and now. (I have a friend who has put well over $1000.00 USD into this game...) Those are the different types of Warframe players. As stated before, this game can be completely F2P, but as in almost every F2P, spending money makes things faster, and gives you an unfair edge. For example, a F2P gets 30 spaces on a maxed out Weapon, while a P2P can purchase an item that gives them 60 spaces on the exact same weapon. This item can be obtained through trading, but can be time consuming. There is one thing that all players do, and that is grind. Hollllllyyyy shiet, 7/8 of your hours on this game will be just repeating the same damn mission over and over to get materials. Yeah... Grinding... Other +Space missions, yeah your in space. +Your base is in a spaceship +The staff of the game are very understanding and focus more on community wants first than their own wants +FRICKIN SPACE NINJAS :D Overall Yes, this is an amazing game overall. The only fallout point is that after playing for a long time, it gets very, very boring. For me? I only play this anymore when I'm asked to by a friend, or if a new major update comes out. (Volt Prime plz? <3) This game is amazing, and I still enjoy it, but not as much as I used to, due to overplaying. 10/10 P.S. If any reader has questions, feel free to add me. I love a good discussion!

Each warframe is unique in look and abilities. Excalibur, has a slash dash ability and stun ability. The others use stealth and or mob manipulation. This is something I enjoy about the game as well. You are not into a role or other limitations most shooter have. You can still build weapon from sniper to assault rifles. Once you have a character chosen you can modify it's colors on several layers of the warframe suit. F2P are locked in basic color scheme. But there is enough there to get creative. My sword used a nice red and white. To start, you will be happy with what you have. But you will run across some great looking warframes and that alone makes me want to put some money into customize! The Size of costomize is very good for a FPS game. Most games give you uniforms or character choices. Warframe has logical purchases and very nice looks. You can also change colors anytime in the game. Graphics: The animations create that dark space feel. It is not just corridors and tubes. There are open areas, small areas and Hangers. In Warframe, it is unique as well. The creators really developped a mark of it's own. The graphical setting are really unique and make you feel immersed in their world. You are sneaking in every mission, it also adds that "you are alien, and you are here in a wrong place. They could use just a LITTLE MORE interaction. More "living" elements to the game. Some spot feel abandoned or to cold. But all in all, it makes a great battlefield and perfect game setting. Game Play: You start in a planetary system and move along. As a space ninja, you sneak in at the start of each round and are given orders for your mission via com link. Each time you complete a mission the next path opens up. The missions include assassinating a target. Sabatoging the systems. Rescuing a prisoner. etc. One of my favorite things about Warframe is the map change. You can restart the map and it is a new map with new layout. Same mission! This randomization of maps is very nice. The UI is great. I could be assault that shoots and scoots. I could be mele and slash my way through. The UI is logical and makes use of your warframe. It is a compliment you and battle systems. And the other players Warframe builds compliment each other. That is the one word to summarize this game play: "Complimentary". A great shooter. The map progression is nice with a few places to stop and farm. A few bosses to stop and kill. A few events. You will be traveling the universe and looking for places. The leveling system unlocks new potentials and weapons for you. The game is based around Crafting. You can purchase to advance in the game, but over all it is F2P and requires you play and collect parts to CRAFT the items. Once the game takes you. You will be out to collect as many pieces to build as many warframes. There are several other warframes than the starter frames. To play them. You have to collect the blueprints, and then get the materials to craft each piece. This is true for weapons as well. Grouping is fun. Not just another body to zerg content. Some players can be jerks and just run and rush to the end and not care about the team. All in all. This is a great shooter that supports any kind of FPS role. Assault. Pistoler, bow and arrow. Sniper. Sword. Etc. I have not reached the end game, but my only worry is the rate of enhancements vs Content. If it requires all my cards are maxed and I cannot max them until I farm parts in the lower areas. But it seems everything is fine for the moment. The game seems to progress of the F2P and keeps you end gamers busy in crafting every frame and weapon available and testing it and tryoing out combos Sound: Wonderfull! The sound of the material of your suit sliding across the floor. The little "clink" of metal as you roll and your sword smacks the ground. The sounds of bullet casings dropping after firing. The sound of ambient voices and machinery. Economy and Crafting: Standard upgrades come in drops and rewards. They are like cards. You put this card into a slot on your gun. It has 4 rank slots. To increase the ranks you modify the card by FUSING it with other cards. You can purchase base weapons with in game currency as well but they are the base, the better weapons have to be built or purchased with cash. The enhancing of abilities starts to get difficult after 4 to 5 upgrades. I did not notice an auction house... But there is a trade channel... The currency seems balanced at the moment and the deals fare. You buy out right the parts in real cash, or build it yourself. Combos you add to your weapons. Cold + Poison gas = Poison shock. There are so many kinds of damage and effects to test and build, and try out on weapons. Some deal bonus damage to mutants. Others on robots. You can build in laser armor bonus to get resistant against laser fire. This helps with more laser dealing enemys.Or extra ammo builds for survival missions. Overall: I like this game. Rewarding, interesting, beautiful and a great space theme. It is not perfect. Has some unfair drops rates. Social aspect could be better. I would like to see more living elements in the maps. They already are doing a sort of base building and PvP structure... Sorry for my bad english. This is my review account, because the low playtime. Thanks for reading! If you Like my Review, give me a Thumbs up in Steam. Your help is greatly appreciated :)

review: Warframe is the most Badass game ever invented by mankind, it features cybernetic robot ninjas with epic weapons. In Warframe you are a rare species called the Tenno who have been in cryosleep for a long period of time, and during this time new factions have been built and are fighting conquests all over the galaxy. As a teeno you must go through each planet node and do each objective to weaken the enemy factions. The combo system is amazing and it only gets better once you find the Warframe that suits you the most. The graphics will most likely give you epilepsy and you won't be able to see due to the lights and motion blur distorting your vision. The free-to-play model used in this game gives no player advantage however this does not really matter due to the lacking pvp in the game itself. Overall Warframe is a good game however you may experience alot of grinding and replaying mission 7/10

review: Warframe is a cooperative Third Person Shooter which involves a strange blend of melee combat, shooting, and parkour. There, now that we've gotten the standards out of the way, Warframe is a good game, good meaning that it has its pros and it's cons. When it comes to pros, the graphics quality is amazing for a Free-To-Play game, everything stays moderately difficult (and even harder if you play like you're supposed to, you know, 2 or 3 friends all starting at the same time), and the parkour system is very smooth and easy to use, even for new TPS players. Since the last time I reviewed this game, it has changed greatly. Whereas before I was too scared to make a new weapon due to credit and resource restrictions, I've found that resources are much more common in most cases, so I've been free to experiment with guns and find the ones I like. (Latron I love ya baby.) Now I have a set of cleavers, two hammers, a machine gun, rifle, shotgun, several swords, and the list goes on. The best part about this, though, is that, since credits are more easily achievable now, I've been able to experiment without fear of losing much. Also, the way you earn warframes has also changed much. Whereas before, there was a chance that it may or may not spawn once every 5th moon after you've sacrificed your firstborn, now you're guaranteed to get a frame part after fighting the boss that drops them, so I've actually coughed up some plat and now have six warframes, all of which provide an incredible spin on gameplay, forcing you to change your playstyle for each frame. Of course, I've got a favorite, (Nyx I love ya baby.) but each frame is a refreshing take on the game that renews it completely. To continue, the levels are now actually changed. The levels change style depending on who's in control of the planet. Of course, if you play the same planet alot, then you may begin to notice that the levels are the same, but that can be expected of any game. However, it can still be a tad grindy at times, and several of my friends found the beginning of the game too hard a hurdle for them and quit early on due to the upper levels carrying them through the low levels and making the game boring for them, so if you're going to enjoy this game, it's a NECESSITY that you don't play public matchmaking. Players tend to rush through the levels and not allow the lowers to really enjoy the game or even get a kill, for that matter. If you're going to play, you either need to play by yourself or with friends. I Recommend this game, (Provided you've got some friends to play this with.) Zombie Chicken

review: Played this in closed beta, thinking of coming back. The time I spend with this game was a good time, a really good time. Then the inventory system changed alot and I just couldn't understand it so I left. The combat is alot of fun and most of the time pretty easy. The best thing however are the Ninja Skills/Parkour Tricks you can pull of, like wall-running and at the same time shoot someone's head off. Pure awesomeness. I also like the small cinematic scenes at the beginning and the end of a mission :3

The gameplay fast, furious and wrapped in good artistic style (and the gore is.....jolly good). Highly recommended if you like co-op game and or action game. The only gripe is platinums are a bit overpriced though redeemingly you do not need themt to craft anything in game except to buy slots for your weapons and warframes(armored suits).

review: I enjoy Warframe, i already play it for 2 months and its still fun, while most level have the same look, the bulid of the map changes everytime (with that i mean that, while the same rooms appear, its always random wich room is behind the next door) despite what some people might say, warframe is NOT Pay2Win, the ONLY thing you get with platin (Real Money) is getting weapons & warframes (classes) faster, dekorations,more stuff to customize, and buying slots for more items, and even then, you can buy platin from other players if you have rare items (in most cases, Prime items from the void) as i said, you can get almost everything for free in terms of money, If you try to get Platinum for free prepare to invest alot of time. You want platinum but have no way of buying it OR want to trade with players? even THEN, you still have 2 ways of gaining it, are you creative? check the forums and see if a community event is running, the Winners (not just 1st place) gain some Platin, and the top 3 winner are, depending on the contest, either get thier idea, fanart, or voice added to the game, or are Presented in the Live-Stream you aren't very creative? well then watch the live stream, you can watch a video, right? because you can get 1000 Platinum (around 50 Bucks) just for watching the thier Twitch-stream, that is if you are one of the 3 lucky people (sometimes 4) who get choosen. but hey, free money! buliding weapons and stuff can take up from 12 to 24 hours, and buliding warframes can take up to 3 days. and while the game can get repetitive, the Devs are constantly adding new and fun stuff to the game and include Events where you can win Special weapons and items that you in most cases will only be able to get trough the event. you should give the game a try, it is at least for the first hours alot of fun. Also, The Dev's are F***ing Awesome!

If you like FAST PACED, SCIFI, NINJA then this is for you and I recommended it. WARNING: You will get addicted to it and it's a grindfest but not that too much grind like Korean MMOs, newbies can easily pick the gameplay and it has a new tutorial for newbies. They keep updating the game and add new warframe, maps, game modes and weapons. So you'll never be bored.

I used to have a laptop that ran Windows but it broke unfortunetly and I now have a Mac which I recieved as a gift (not my choice really). I know you can run windows on a Mac but I have heard you can run into many problems including running out of memory (only have 4 gigs in my Mac and you can't change it out on mine). I would love if this game became Mac compatable and would gladly drop a few more $ on it as I have in the past. But with the time I had with the game, it was a blast!

review: This is probably the best Space-Ninja game you will ever play. If you want a quick recommendation, you have it. EDIT: Once upon a time there was a very long page here. Well many many updates later it's safe to say that this game is still growing in surprising and exciting ways. It's still a game that feels that you have to dump a couple bucks into every now and then, but it never feels forced: by the time you feel the urge for some platinum you've probably put a hundred more hours into playing, so why not? Money you spend should be based on the fun you're having, and Warframe is promising to keep entertaining for a long time.

review: Space Ninjas? Powers? Guns? FREAKING SWORDS!? The only thing this game is missing is gratuitous nudity... *Crosses fingers* Update: October 28, 2014 So, it's been over a year since I reviewed this game... AND IT'S GOTTEN EVEN BETTER! Where to start... The Dev team is slowly incorporating more story elements, especially for the new players who need guidance as to what they're doing. Part of this new drive was the implementation of the "New Player System" which is a quest to introduce the player to Warframe's basic mechanics while informing you of some of the basic lore. Other quests now added include Howl of the Kubrow to get your very own death-dealing, cuddle-loving furball, Hidden Message to unlock the Warframe known as Mirage, Limbo Theorem to unlock the IMPOSSIBLY fun Warframe Limbo, who can walk on a completely different plane of existence. And, last but DEFINITELY not least, the Archwing. Gundam lover's will just about soil their shorts when they get their hands on this space combat system. Remember the Death Star run from Episode 6? You'll get to experience it yourself. Note for all those interested in the game, if you play for free it CAN be a -very- heavy grind, and wait times on building items can be brutal (3 days for some things). But, if you have some patience, this game's high speed combat mechanics are fantastic. But, if you don't mind a bit of grind, you can even alleviate that some by selling rare mods and Prime parts for Platinum in the player trade system.

review: Honestly an amazing game. Once you get past the kinda crappy starter gear and into things you like more, it becomes really fun. The biggest pushfactor for most players is the crafting time. Once you get over the fact that you can't always get what you want right away and learn to deal with it, it isn't an issue anymore. Overall, a really fun, unique game. I'd reccomend it to anyone into any kind of action game.

review: I absolutely love this game. It is the definition of a amazing free to play experience, although you will need to spend some money to get the full experience. It is very much worth it in my opinion! also supporting indie devs gives you a nice feeling :) But the meat meat of the gameplay is the third person ninja shooter. Being a space ninja ou are very agile and can pull off parkour with ease. the gunplay is satisfying and has a lot of impact with great sound assests make hearing and feeling the pop of a headshot! i cannot reccomend this game enough! but the gripes i have is that the entry level is massive with most of the weapons and frames being very daunting for new player, along with some grind. It could need patience.

review: Warframe Warframe started as a decent co-op shooter. On early beta it had some game breaking bugs, but it felt like it had a lot of potential, that potential is still there and i doubt it will fade away easily. The level design is pretty amazing, the tilesets have as much quality as a AAA title but they get very repetitive with time, the "endgame" void missions can be described as "kill mobs, loot the room and occasionally look for secrets, rinse and repeat", The Bosses started out as pretty meaningful and provided an actual challenge, nowadays they're a means to earn blueprints of specific frames and are incredibly hard, with the inclusion of a specific set of bosses that have a specific weak spot which only works half of the time. The best boss fight is in my honest opinion Lephantis. Every update they release there are more bugs than additions, though most of which get solved pretty fast. The game has become quite a farm fest, earning the game the term "Warfarm". The Devs are terrible at balancing the game, specificly by overly nerfing frames and weapons and hardly ever buffing others. The grinding involved in farming for frames is extreme and is a great drawback of the game. Crafting weapons take usually 12 hours, companions and rare materials take up to 24 hours. the new Archwing takes 36 hours to build, and frames take 72 hours. Its tedious to wait so long for new gear. This New Archwing update is lame, the new tileset in space is devoid of content, its literally the same map. starts in the same place, ends in the same place but has you go through different pathways to achieve your objective. But to be quite honest, i've went on and on about how terrible this game is, but its still one of my favorite games and i have spent up to 8 hours in it alone, playing with friends. It's got its share of  sure, but they still somehow manage to deliver on a great time which is quite a feat, ive not exacly been easy on the examples of how terrible it is. I'm not gonna rate this game on a scale of any sorts, its a great game to spend some time in, but its below average in key aspects and needs improvement, and a lot of it, then again it's still in "open beta" so we might see some positive changes over the course of development.

review: Warframe a fresh new take on the third person shooter series of games. With futuristic weaponry and characters, I instantly got hooked on the game. Instead of being a PvP oriented game, Warframe focuses on co-op missions. You can team up with up to 3 players, forming a 4 man squad, to eliminate nodes on the map and receive rewards and experience. There is not much else I can say other than "you should definitely try this out." You'll have to experience this game for yourself to realize how awesome it is.

review: This game is probably one of the best MMOs out there. It's very amazing to play with friends, and just as fun when you solo as well. The gameplay is quite addicting, to the very point that it'll constantly draw you back into the mix if this appeals to you in any way. The beginning, like most games, is quite the grind fest, but once you get past that point, it only gets better. While melee is not the best in this game, they offer quite a wide variety of weapons and Warframes, which signify the classes. The game can get quite tedious, but try to look past that and you'll be addicted just as easily as I am. My only complaint about this game is that there are so many weapons and warframes that I can't have them all because you need platinum to buy slots, which they generously give you 50 to start out with for extra warframe or weapons slots. If you enjoy playing with friends, this is the game to download. Teamwork needs to be handled very carefully or you can end up failing a mission that you could have easily won. While the game doesn't have the best soundtrack, it makes up for it with the ambiance. I'd recommend you to try this game at least once if you are curious about it.

review: Overall a very VERY good game! Great graphics, epic and intense combat, and well...space ninjas! Aside from some bugs here and there my only complaint is the levels get repetative, but it's not a game breaker for me. HIGHLY recomend this game, it's a lot more fun then it looks, and it already looks really fun!

review: WArframe is an excellent game, with a lot of variety and great graphics. I think it could use some more mods, like one to increase clip size, and a few of the enemies could use a nerf, but all in all Warframe is a lot of fun to play, either alone or with friends.

review: This game is pretty kubrow. Seriously though. Every kind of weapon you can think of from the past or future. An amazing variety of characters (frames) to suit any play style and each one can be customized to suit you even further. The style is very unique and I love it. Go thousands of years in the future, and place ancient samurai-like warriors on a backdrop of chaos, genocide, and a very mysterious history. Sure, it can get repetitive and is somewhat centered around grinding and farming, but if you're a fan of shooting, slashing, and appreciating art, this is the game for you. Plus the community is great. I don't know if I've wasted too many hours of my life in the ferocious battleground of PvP forums and region channels, or if Warframe's PvE atmosphere is just special, but it is extremely refreshing to consistently run across players that want to help and work together. The dev team, too, is excellent at pushing new content and listening in on feedback from the players. Oh, It's free. There's no reason not to grab some friends and give it a shot.

review: The base gameplay of "shoot mans" is pretty damn solid and the devs are incredibly quick at releasing new content. Since the game was in closed beta it has become much, much better and very different. The devs even have some more massive gameplay changes coming that sound badass. The only problem I'd say this game has is that they don't balance some things very well (which isn't too big of a deal since its a co-op game and not competative) and the "catalyst/reactor" upgrade system (also not too big of a deal, but can be annoying). In short, the base gameplay is a blast and the devs are incredible at keeping it updated and fresh.

review: Do you like ninjas? Play this game. Do you like varying weapons? Play this game. Do you like intense faction-based assaults? Do you like dealing out damage inside of an agile "robotic" suit? Do you like having friends watching your back? No? Then you're gay. Get this game scrubs. EDIT; 2/16/15 Do you like tact bosses? Do you like several suits, several abilities, several ways to play? Do you like zapping a trooper and having your friend lift him into the air, slam him into the ground, and wreck him? Do you like color customization? Do you like lasers? Do you like a decent damage strength-weakness system? Do you like community events? If you don't, delete system 32. If you do, get this game.

review: It's a really fun free-to-play type game where you can unlock everything for free if you have the time and patience to do so or you can support the game by buying it now. (Not a big fan of Pay 2 win games but i don't really mind). If you have some time off i recommend this game to play with a friend or three and do some missions and/or some defense missions to level up fast(er). Also remember to press "g" to mark moudels and stuff like that :)

review: Warframe is, as you have probably heard, all about the space ninjas and is a really unique experience, but what really sets this game apart from the other Free To Play games out there is an incredibly invested dev team which is very in tune with what is going on in their community. I have been playing this game for little over a year and in that time it has gone through a transformation I wouldn't have thought possible exept for the fact that I experienced it first hand. When I first downloaded the game I thought that is was the prettiest game I had plaed that was under 1Gb. It started out as a very small and seemed to be just a curiosity to pass a couple of minutes, but as time went on the devs just kept adding and adding until it really doesn't look anything like the same game anymore. Im not really going to go into the finer details of what the game is like, because if you just look at a trailer you can get a feel for what the world is like and if you want to know more about the gameplay, your best course of action is to just download the game and give it a spin. The constant development and community reachout is the defining feature of this game and the best reason to get into the universe of WARFAME.

review: Basically a free to play version of Destiny, that came out before destiny. If you want a game thats fast paced & easy to play, and doesn't take allot of grind time to enjoy it then its worth the free install. BUT it is a typical console run and gun with a shinny appearance to hide the lacking of progressive storyline or variance in gameplay.

review: I've played this game more than any other Free to Play game. The reason is: It gets you into the action immediately Everything is free aside from weapon/warframe slots and Orokin Reactors and Catalysts and purely cosmetic stuff. It looks beautiful Great weapon variety Great playstyle variety Fast Paced action and quick loading times Decent enough community to help you when you need it There are a few issues you should know about: The game is a bit buggy and sometimes will crash (Doesn't happen very often) Anyone who is not a hardcore gamer will be turned off by the large amounts of repetitive gameplay and grind. The game is a bit on the easy side and whatever isn't easy is usually cheap. There's no real balance of difficulty Your favorite weapons or warframes might (or already have been) nerfed to the ground making them almost useless Overall I enjoy the game though and recommend it

And-- all the good stuff in the game can be researched and built by you. The only thing you 'have' to have real money for, is cosmetics, and extra 'hanger' slots if you can't bear to sell back old weapons. TLDR: It's Chinese Space Ninjas in Space. Flipping out, cutting people's heads off, and being awesome.

review: Warframe is a fast pace multiplayer first person shooter combining RPG and utilizing a Parkour system that gets your heart pumping even faster. Jump, wallrun, shoot, fly, slash, and climb your way to victory. Their are only 2 downsides in this game in my opinion. Weapon Slots and Crafting. For crafting, it takes 12 hours to craft a single weapon. The problem with weapon slots is that you can't buy them unless you're buying the weapon itself instead of craft them. Leaving collectors with a limited amount of space. Other then those, this is legitimately the most awesome game I'll ever played.

review: Warframe is a very good F2P TPS and has a wonderful community of gamers that are easy to get a long with. The game play is smooth and nice graphics but the only problem is there are a lot of maps that seem like you have seen before, Meaning it seems like there are maps that they used before but just put a few new things in it. Also you can drop a lot of money in the game if you get into it because of different customization for warframs and sentinels. You can also buy weapons with your plat but for the player that just wants have a fun game with not droping a dime there is goos news for you. almost everything you see in the store you can build in game with no real money charges it just takes longer to obtain that item. So i give WarFrame 8.5/10 and recommend you give it a try!

review: A lot of fun albeit repetitive. If you're looking to purchase additional warframes for plat, don't. It's far more economical to purchase plat during Steam sales or when you get 75% off during a login reward THEN buy the items you want from other players. ...or grind your butt off! Nearly everything is available for free however the catch is that you only have a certain number of slots to store your frames and weapons. You can save additional Platinum by getting items from alert missions. D/Ling the WF Alerts app is highly recommended. Also, Loki is amazing. Choose that frame after your tutorial. The Wikia is your Warframe bible. There is theorycrafting and optimal character building in this game and you'll find this reference highly valuable. Complete maps then do nightmare modes for rare dual-stat mods. Some are much easier than others and you can abort and restart if you get things like "no shields" opon starting the mission. Hit me up in-game!

review: I have put in nearly 200 hours and still counting. I quite fancy this game. The different environments and classes of enemies bring some interesting variety to the table. All the maps are randomly generated so farming for those materials to build weapons or new frames isn't quite as tedious. Equippable mods can make you that super serious player to kick some bum or that silly player that shoots exploding arrows which just might kill you too. This game is still in beta so things are constantly changing! Whichever your play style, I believe that there is a little bit for most everyone to enjoy this game. Not enjoying it?

review: This game is a great oppertunity to burn a few hours and have tons of fun doing it. For a game in beta it is fantasticlly built, they have a great community and is in a very fast paced setting. AND ITS FREE TO PLAY! When the developers release an update they pack so full of fixes and additions to the game youd think that they were adding a mod. (But then again a update is basiclly a mod) I enjoy playing this game for two main reasons: 1. the fact that it is very fast paced and requires lots of thinking in the now, because the AI is very sophisticted and reactes accordingly but could get some improvements. 2. the amount of fun that i have just grinding away to get a cool item. I personally spent 40+ hours grinding away to get two really cool items in the game and i really enjoyed grinding that. When i dont know what to do in the game I go and play with my freind the first few missions. Im now going to write about some minor issues in the game :D When i played the tutorial it was preety laggy the first time, so you might want to take that time and change settings Ive only chrashed twice for no appernt issues but on review of those logs my PC stopped two important files from working. But i recommend this game greatlly and i can't wait to see where this game goes.

review: Scavenging, shiny robots, fast paced universal combat, it'll get you hooked! I have friends who play this endlessly, and after joining all the hype, I don't regret it. If you've ever played the Borderlands series you'd get a slight feel for it when you notice all of the mods, ammo packs, etc flooding the ground. This game really immerses you into several atmospheres. For those who like to take it slow can go for stealth approaches in levels, adding a booming level of intensity. Patience is key, so be careful not to get caught! Then there is the tanking aspect, if you want to get a mission done quick, ring in your fastest and heaviest fire power, because you'll have hordes of enemies on you! Starting out though, try not to get too intimidated, I recommend tuning into the the storyline, as it can help a whole lot. Bring an experienced friend a long to help! Getting confused and put off is easy, as a lot of the game aspects fly right by you pretty quick. Overall this game is great, you have a long way to go before you end up getting bored because the variety will take you on so many experiences. 8/10

review: This is honestly one of the best games I've ever played. Ever. It has a very good play style, upgrades that fit every style of player, and graphics that can make many good gaming computers gasp. It is still in development, which means there will be changes and improvements, but that just makes me more excited since it means the game should only get better! I've put in quite a bit of time with this game, and I've been playing since the Beta release. I fully recommend it. It is a FTP that is better than most games I've bought. It supports single players, but is so much fun with a group of friends! The best part is there is no catch with the Free part, it really is all free. The only thing in-game you would ever need to spend money on are aesthetics. There is no content that you would ever need that you have to spend money on. The developers are pretty on the spot when it comes to fixing problems and updates come regularly. They also do frequent livestreams to keep players up to date on upcoming fixes and content. If you are even just a little curious about this game, give it a try! I don't think you'll regret it!

review: I love the fact that Warframe is a social game. Unless you're kind of crazy, most of the missions require a group to complete properly, and random grouping is easy and friendly. Lots of people in the chat are willing to help out newbies, and the community seems overall very friendly. The game is beautiful, with a sleek and clean space-age aesthetic that is a lot of eye candy. There really is a Warframe for everyone, with a variety of looks, feels, builds and abilities that are as fun as they are variable. There's still a lot of small glitches here and there (not being able to see the color of another player's ship is a current one) but nothing that impacts real gameplay, so that is truly a nit-pick more then a criticism. Overall, if you love a fun flash and bash space ninja game, this is really the one for you.

review: With the fate of your race in the balance, it is up to you and the few remaining Tenno to push the enemy out of the solar system. 8/10 a lot of fun with friends, gets difficult if you try to take on higher levels alone. The use of schematics to acquire weapons and Warframes makes the feeling of getting new equipment all the more satisfying. Although, if you are not a patient person the ability to purchase the equipment directly through the use of platinum (which is purchased with real money) can help you get the quick advantage over the enemy.

ITs one of the great free to play games u can go and at beggning doin solo might trouble u ...try pubilc host that would help to get ur way out of it . overall a great game u will enjoy ..

review: Good TPS. Good variety of weapons although some become pretty useless later on in the game. Fairly free to play but getting reactors might take awhile since they only come through alerts which you either get or miss out on. Warframe alerts is good for that but it's still a you're there or you're not.

review: Great game, unfortunately once your are a top tier (I am level 16, I am not sure with everything fully leveled you can even get to 17 yet), the game loses a lot of zest. The devs have nerfed the unique role based frames into WarSame.. the loadout matters, that's it.. if you have good mods and are a reasonable player, you only need a handfull of guns and melee weapons.. even amongst the Prime weapons they are not all end game weapons.. many of them are just meh (I have a braton prime that has been forma'ed 7 times, it's still  comapred to the soma, or bolter prime). Grinding orokin runs in the void the RNG is complete , running a mission 40 times to get a lex prime part and still not getting is is rediculous.. According to devs working as intended.. I guess if they want me to spend money and time elsewhere, then yeah it's working as intended.. I could go on and on.. it's a good game, but they need to make some reasonable changes, like a loot selector after so many runs, a real functional difference (think old frost, or Ember, in theory Trinity), Frames should matter more than guns, but fact is they just done.. it's a good game.. needs some love.. Welcome to WarSame.

review: First off I would like to say that this game is super adictive and fun. Secondly if you do play this game or want to start playing the game I'd suggest you look at a few tips and tricks to increase your productivity ten fold. For starters I suggest you get Excalibur, because its the most balanced and easiest warframe to learn how to play. TOP TIP: You just have to get rhino, that warframe just wrecks everything in the way. Overall i do enjoy the game and i would highly recommend it to anyone that likes '3rd person shoot and kill everything in you way with 3 other friends' yeah.

review: Look, i'll be honest - at the start i had some doubt about this game. 'oh dude, a 3rd person shooter where you grind for stuff!' But hey, it was free, i had time. Never even looked back. Digital Extremes has crafted one of the best games i've ever played, and everything is free! Can you imagine, a F2P game that isn't P2W? Hard to, yes, but Warframe does it perfectly. Not only that, DE keeps on improving and supporting their game with help from player input. Oh, and did i mention the space ninjas? No? Well, go play Warframe and see em for yourself!

review: I really enjoy this game, especially when it's played with friends. There is one thing i don't really enjoy, and that's the thousands of hours grinding for materials for a weapon\warframe. Most of the weapons are single blueprints and take about 12 hours to make, but each part of the warframe blueprint has a seperate blueprint. For eg.: Rhino consists of Rhino Helmet, Rhino Systems and Rhino Chassis. Every single part is a different blueprint and takes another 12 hours to make. If you can't afford to buy platinum, it usually takes about 10-15 days of grinding for the materials for every different blueprint. Doing the math, its 240 hours + 36 hours + the extra 72 hours to complete the warframe, it takes simply 348 hours (14 and a half days) to make a single warframe. But i still recommend the game, but if you don't spend a little money on buying platinum, you won't get very far very fast.

review: Warframe is an amazing game. Its a third person co-op sci-fi shooter space ninja extravaganza! Its a little slow starting out (if you have the money, i recommend getting affinity and credit boosters), but once you get past the first planet or two, you really start to have some great fun. With a good team and communication, this game offers hours of never ending entertainment. Each Warframe (playable character) offers its own unique play and fighting style. With (Currently) 16 Warframes and 3 prime variants (the 4th, excalibur prime is no longer attainable), over 100 primary, secondary, and melee weapons, and 5 sentinels (robotic companions), this game has massive replayability. The very best part is, its free! So why not try it out? P.S. Dont stop after the first couple missions, I promise you'll find its an amazing game!

review: A very enjoyable fast-paced shooter (when played with others). With the option of stealthy slow solo play as well. Some repetitive maps and scenarios but still with enough variation to not feel "grindy" (until you're trying to get something specific to drop). Can be played entirely free but a little cash injection certainly can boost the fun.

review: Throughout my years of gaming I've stumbled across few games that provide such diversity and freedom, we all crave the opportunity to play a game that has almost no limits. Well Warframe for one is absolutely stunning, it provides the player with the feeling of no limits even though it still has a few wich can almost not be noticed at all. Warframe is linear, fun and dynamic even for a game nearing it's last stages of beta, it's quite impressive. The mechanics in the game had blown me away at some point as it has some originallity to it, wich very few developers fail to master. The gameplay itself however makes the player feel truely apart of the whole experience as it has a mixture of realism, fun and fantasy with a twist of sci-fi, it provides the ultimate game experience. Most games have failed at the combination of these elements. The diversity of weapons is astonishing, as it provides almost every weapon type imaginable and more! Another part of the game I enjoyed was the modding system, I found it very easy to use and I also loved the diversity in mods available. There really is almost endless possibilities especially with the elemental combination of mods wich forms new elements. The customization also stood out for me, It gives the player some nice personalization options to feel even more "at one" with the game or perhaps makes them feel more comfortable with their gameplay, strangely enough. The graphics of the game is quite a pleasureable aspect even though it gives some killer eye sores, you know it's all worth it. In referral to the music I really enjoy the action movie feel it has to it and would love to see some more of it, it truely gets you in the "zone". If there is one thing I could add to warframe it'd be a bit of lore. Warframe is free-to-play and almost all in game content can be obtained by the player without having to pay a dime. Warframe is co-operative and provides a PVE gamestyle with a few PVP elements wich are seemingly still in development, and I am quite eager to see the outcome of the PVP system. Warframe also provides players the option to trade for platinum wich is basically only obtained from buying it with real time currency. In short warframe is not a pay-to-win but if you feel like supporting the developers for thier great work then buying some platinum is a good way to support them. But to sum it all up, I strongly reccomend Warframe if you are looking for something new and different and encourage some RPG fans to try it out aswell as those die-hard MMO fans. Keep up the good work I am excited to see what comes next with the further developement of this game! If I had to rate it on a scale of 1 to 10 I'd give it a 7.6/10.

You can use all weapon, all warframe (Class), all Companion (Sentinel and Kubrow) You don't need to pay for them, You need only time for craft them. (Pay for support the game) Events every month and New update every 1~2 weeks( new weapon/ new class/ new cosmetic ) Forgot about pay to WIN!, Even you have many platinum to buy stuff in market. you still need to play for mods, weapon parts, frame parts.(or just trade your platinum for them... You come to play right? Why pay for them when you play for fun and get stuff?) *** You can trade your stuff to other player for what you want.*** Forgot about hard time for newbie like the old time.(U7 maybe 2013)...

You don't need to solo.(You need Clan for stuff) I hope my review help you.

review: For a free game, it's pretty good with its gameplay and graphics. Kind of similar to the Destiny game. Beside it's heavy micro-transaction based nature, everything else is awesome. Most of the cash item can be forge with a little more hunting. Of course there are cash item that cannot be forge or purchase with in-game currency. Conclusion: Good game for people that like grinding. Bad game for people that have short attention span.

review: Before you read this reveiw, you must consider these questions three: Is the game worth my money? Is the game worth my time? Are the developers in touch with the community? Now that you've done this, I will read your mind and answer three questions you have about Warframe. "Is the game worth my money?" I will dismiss this question out of hand, as a simple glance at the price will answer this. "Is the game worth my time?" This is where it gets tricky to answer. Warframe isn't for everyone. There's no underaged kids telling you that you're a "Haxxer," there's not very much math involced, and worst of all, there's precious few instances of acronyms and/or bizzare phraseology with which to confuse new players. In all seriousness, however, there are problems with Warframe's delivery. The gameplay itself is fun, the perfect blend of fast and tactical, with enough customizability on Warframes and weapons to allow a broad variety of playstyles. The troubles come when not playing the game, however. A new player, after slowly acquiring the blueprints and materials nescessary to build a brand-new Warframe, will suddenly find themselves faced with an intimidating three-day wait until it's done, and Warframe makes it very clear that a little cash will make it go faster. When I first built a new Warframe, (It was Ember, if I remember correctly,) I rapidly went from excited to depressed to angry to saddened. To the new player, this wait is an annoying wall that stands between them and fun, a barrier placed by malicious and evil developers who hate all manner of fun and enjoyment. Fast forward to a few months later, when this once-new player has three Warframes they need to rank up, two waiting to be claimed, and another building. Although Warframe's enforced waiting period seems like a cheap money-grab at low levels, it becomes less and less meaningful to a patient and determined player as they progress. However, this is really the most important thing about Warframe. If you arn't patient, if, like Veruca Salt, you "Want it now!" then Warframe will probably irritate and annoy you. If you have the patience to stick with it, however, you'll find a fun and entertaining game with a good variety of gameplay and weapons. "Are the developers in touch with the community?" If you've made it to this part of the reveiw, you should get yourself a cookie. Once you've done that, I'll answer this question. Yes. The developers, Digital Extremes, is very in touch with the community, releasing fairly frequent updates and devstreams. They keep a good touch on what the players want, and do their best to deliver it, with only a few instances of failure. We're not likely to see the next Cube World/Stomping Land in Warframe. In summary, the only drawback of Warframe is the patience required to get started. With that said, however, it's free, so why not try it out and see how you like it? See you in the game, Tenno.

review: Review time: So this is a pretty good game, problem is it doesent really explain what to do, as a newb to this game 1.5 years ago I was lost. if you find that you are in this situation then I guarentee that you will hate this game, it has no direction and the mindless killing doesent really have much replay for the first Frame/Weapon and starter planets, but with time and persistance and a little bit of spending "creddits" for better gear then I guarentee that you will enjoy the massive ammount of weapons to choose from couppled with warframe abilities. Warframes are easy to aquire and weapons are really cheep for the most part, farming for monney is easy to do as long as you have someone in trade chat carry you to a high level mision for easy monney. Finally for a last opinion, I would despite all I have said get in a guild and play with people, this game is not meant for solo and playing with a squad of 4 is much more fun than sticking it out by yourself.
game-hours: 525.4
review: This is a game that takes a bit of getting used to, but once you're in you'll love it. Rushing around doing parkour and shooting bad guys feels good, and the abilities of each warframe can feel awesome when used right. Take the time to learn the game and you'll find yourself immersed in one of the best free to play experiences on the PC right now, and it's only getting better.
game-hours: 316.9
review: Warframe presents a fast-paced, immersive and cooperative gameplay experience. Warframe is an OTS shooter or OTS hack-n-slash game, depending on the player's preference. Players construct from a generous library of weapons and warframes, which are essentially ninja space-battle suits, each of which drastically alters the game's play style. In this way Warframe is a highly customizable experience and makes way for player specialization inamongst their squads and clans. Warframe is a cooperative game. Though players can run missions and accomplish most goals by themselves or with internet randoms, the game is much better suited for squads (maximum size of four) of friends who can work cooperatively and communicate verbally via external voice comms. Each mission balances itself according to the size of the squad playing it, but the best challenges and rewards are only realistically available to larger groups. Warframe places new players directly into a series of tutorial missions which comprehensively explain the mechanics of the game. Because of this, Warframe's moderate learning curve is very easily mastered. This game's soundtrack is appropriate and envigorating, but the true artistic strength of the game lies in its graphic design. The visual effects of battle and the tacit graphical base of the scenery and setpieces compliment each other and afford an immersive combat experience. Warframe is appropriate for novice and mature gamers. Though the game is free of any age-sensitive content, the violent nature of the game may not be appropriate for younger audiences. Previous experience with FPS and combat gameplay is recommended, but not strictly necessary. Warframe is free-to-play, driven by optional in-game purchases. All story and gameplay content can be unlocked via gameplay, but players can at any point obtain nearly any item in the game in exchange for money. This does not inhibit gameplay or diminish the enjoyment of others, as players do not compete and one's overall rank is only improved by game time. Warframe can be played casually or hardcore and is worth considerably more than the time it takes to give it a try.

It's a 4 player mission co-op game. You find blueprints, craft new weapons/frames and level-up to get stronger so that you can advance to new arias. Anyways, Like it a lot. Heck, it's a Free 2 Play game ! Give it a try ! --- Rating: 7 / 10 "Steves" + Gaming feel - Repetitive gameplay

If you answered yes or no to any of these questions, you should be playing Warframe. It is the epitome of a successful F2P game. The devs are dedicated, inventive, and care about the game in ways that show they're invested in it, and the game universe and lore itself. It's the pinnacle of cooperative PvE. It's probably the most enjoyable MMO I've played. There is no reason you should not be playing this too.

review: The Metacritic score is way off. Warframe is a great game. Nearly everything in the cash shop can be acquired by simply playing the game. It's a satisfying romp that feels like a mash up of Devil May Cry/Gears of War gameplay with Halo/Mass Effect themes in small parties like Borderlands/Left 4 Dead. Very enjoyable, though the first 10 hours or so may feel a bit slow. Crafting your second Warframe is when the game really opens up.

review: So, for those of you looking at this game, take heed. This is a free to play game, and while EVERYTHING (Except some vanity items) can be obtained without paying any real money, it still is a difficult game to get ground on as you have such limited space and the grind for anything in the game is long and hardly enjoyable after a few hours of the same mission over and over. If you are still interested, read onwards. You play as the equivalence of a space-ninja, with different suits with special abilities, guns that do awesome things, and of course, epic melee weapons. You have a pick of three suits at the start. Most suggest Excaliber, since he's the easiest to play (And trying to unlock him otherwise is so annoying), however I picked Loki at the start. This game really makes you think about what weapons and suits (Called Warframes) you use, but doesn't punish you for straying from the Tank/DPS/Support/Niche builds. As I said previously, I played Loki from the start, pouring 5$ into the game to get a melee weapon called the Obex (I wanted to punch guys in the face, okay?) which, both choosing Loki and Obex had me ridiculed, I didn't regret it. I teleported around the battlefield, used clones to keep myself alive, and again, punched guys in the face. I joined my friends clan and found the game was deeper than just punching guys, as there were giant wars between ingame factions, assassination attempts on yourself that made missions terrifying, and the epic grind for mighty gear. This lead me to have great times with my friends and their clan. Then...I ran into a few problems. A lot of missions use reformated versions of the same maps, enemies become generic, and the grind for gear is sluggish. It took me 17 tries to get all the blueprints for my second suit, Valkyr (Who's super attack makes her invincible and punch things) by fighting this one boss over and over....eventually after that the grind to get the materials for the blueprints themselves took longerl, then the grind for ingame money to pay to start the crafting.... Face it, with any MMO you are gonna grind a lot for good stuff, but here at least you're a space ninja, right? Wrong. You may be a badass space warrior, but stealth sections in the game are partially broken, as enemies will detect you irregardless if you are an invisible Loki, and stealth attacks aren't always insta-kill as they are advertised. Some enemies are so beefy stealth is the only options which is super hard unless you are playing a frame made specifically for stealth (Ashe and Loki), especially in missions where you fail if you are detected (I played during some Red-thingy event and got a free scarf). Even with all the typical problems most games in the genre has, this is a unique treasure and I would play it some more if I wasn't already into 5 games right now. I'd give this a 7.5/10. Oh, and by the way, they totally ripped their Infested from Halo. Just sayin'.

review: The game without the bells and whistles is just one hell of a grindfest. But dammit it's a good one. New tutorial, constant expansion of the game, and evolving storyline makes this a great game to add to your library. The game does start very slow however and takes some time to get moving. But when it does, it'll take a while before you stop. Did anyone forget to mention it was still in beta? Best free-to-play game i've ever played.

review: Good game. Keeps things interesting with events and different circumstances they constantly bring out.. And constant updates to weaponry and activites make this a very good game to play. Key features and the best parts are.. the variety of weaponry and modification, and the warframes themselves. Negative features are.. The maps themselves have clearly copied and pasted areas. Once you see 2-3 rooms in a map, you've seen it all of that template. All in all, fun game with friends, i've wasted so many hours myself on it; but what would make it perfect is new maps that aren't full of copy and pasted areas, and a new race other than the corpus or grineer and the infected. Mix it up! =) ------------------------ Well, 1,000+ hours later in the game, there are some things that need to be said. DE, the devs, have a bad habit of ignoring bugs and glitches and visually unfinished models that they implement into the game and make decisions based on how much plat they will make out of the game. If you find a farming method that is anywhere near effective, it will be nerfed. If you find a system that works, it will be changed. If you find anything that makes you feel good, they will usually take it away. I'm not speaking personally on this, but all the decisions DE has made, make it painfully clear that they are only interested in how much you pay up. I mean, fair enough, but sometimes they make one too many wrong decisions, and piss a lot of people off. They don't think about their fixes, they don't understand 'repurcussions' or the what their "fixes" do to the rest of the populace. Also they just released jarjar binks as a warframe. lmao enough said there.

review: Warframe is a game where you play as a space ninja. You get to kill stuff and hang out with friends. Basically it plays like Gears of War and Ninja Gaiden. Pros: -Controls are solid, gameplay is very addicting and entertaining -Not pay to win, but pay to advance. -LOOOOTS of customization options -Friendly and helpful community -Active dev team who listens to the community Cons: -Lots of grinding -Feels repetitive over time I strongly recommend you grab some of your IRL friends and play locally with them.

review: This is an amazing game if you just want to sit back and have a good time slaughtering everything in your path! Beginer players might have trouble at first figuring out the market and modding system, but there are in game tutorials and internet tutorials to help with that. Warframe is constintly puting out new content about every week, and usually on wednesdays so veteran players like me keep getting new content to keep us working at it. I currently have over 400 hours logged into the game and im still very much enjoying it! Overall once you figure out how to do most of the beginer stuff it is a very relaxing game. If you want you can sit back and do easy missions, but if you in the mood for more of a challenge you can face off against players around your skill level. Some of you might say that all free games are pay to win, however I havn't spent a dime on this game and i still get the items that people pay for. You see there is a big trading system that players trade items for the currency that cost real money. It works out very well. If you read this whole thing I sugest you start downloading this game right now and have days upon days of fun!

review: This game is free... so hell yea, play it. Tons of planets to explore, so many missions to do, and it's difficult to do solo, you'll definitely need help for many of the missions. A crap ton of upgrades so you can fully customize your build and loadout for any one of the warframes, which there are also a ton of. A handful of pets and sentinels to help you out, c'mon what more do you need? IT'S FREE! This game is lightyears ahead of a game like destiny in terms of customization, gameplay, and multiplayer. However, even the barely there story in destiny is better than this game, and the pvp in destiny beats the pants off Warframe. The only thing these guys could have done better is create pvp servers that didn't lag out completely and attempt a story line, but you can't win em all, and these guys certainly have nailed most of the categories. Graphics 10/10 Gameplay 10/10 Weapons 10/10 Customizability 10/10 Social aspect 8/10 Multiplayer 8/10 Story 4/10 PVP 2/10 Also, if you can afford it, kick some cash towards the devs and buy some platinum, this game is too awesome to not pay something for it. BUT, if you do buy platinum, wait til you get the 50% off coupon from your login rewards.

review: This game is space ninja themed TPS, it has parkour moves, guns and fun abilities. It has nice visuals even on a low end PC, and even the visual design is good. It is a little bit grindy and repetative, but if you like the theme you won't mind it. It's not pay to win, it's only pay to spare your time (but then you get left out of the fun). The only drawback for this game is the bugs. When old bugs get patched new ones appear, so if you haven't played a buggy game for a long time, this one is not for you. But most players can live with the game's bugs, bec they are usually not annoying.

review: Warframe presents a fast-paced, immersive and cooperative gameplay experience. Warframe is an OTS shooter or OTS hack-n-slash game, depending on the player's preference. Players construct from a generous library of weapons and warframes, which are essentially ninja space-battle suits, each of which drastically alters the game's play style. In this way Warframe is a highly customizable experience and makes way for player specialization inamongst their squads and clans. Warframe is a cooperative game. Though players can run missions and accomplish most goals by themselves or with internet randoms, the game is much better suited for squads (maximum size of four) of friends who can work cooperatively and communicate verbally via external voice comms. Each mission balances itself according to the size of the squad playing it, but the best challenges and rewards are only realistically available to larger groups. Warframe places new players directly into a series of tutorial missions which comprehensively explain the mechanics of the game. Because of this, Warframe's moderate learning curve is very easily mastered. This game's soundtrack is appropriate and envigorating, but the true artistic strength of the game lies in its graphic design. The visual effects of battle and the tacit graphical base of the scenery and setpieces compliment each other and afford an immersive combat experience. Warframe is appropriate for novice and mature gamers. Though the game is free of any age-sensitive content, the violent nature of the game may not be appropriate for younger audiences. Previous experience with FPS and combat gameplay is recommended, but not strictly necessary. Warframe is free-to-play, driven by optional in-game purchases. All story and gameplay content can be unlocked via gameplay, but players can at any point obtain nearly any item in the game in exchange for money. This does not inhibit gameplay or diminish the enjoyment of others, as players do not compete and one's overall rank is only improved by game time. Warframe can be played casually or hardcore and is worth considerably more than the time it takes to give it a try.

review: You know that weird girl in the corner of the class? Your friend told you that she likes you, but everytime you look at her she smiles and look away. Then when you got the chance, you approach her and start talking to her at the school out and you think: "wow she's really nice, didn't expected that!" After sometime you look at your watch and realise that 7 hours flew away with you spending time with her. And when it's time to goodbye, she says: "I really like you, if you want to spend another time with me, just call ;) " And then, without warning, she kisses your lips and walkaway. Day after day you ask yourself if it was real or just an hallucination, and you keep thinking of her all the time just trying to see another opportunity to see her again. Well... this game is this girl :D

review: What to say about this game...i've played this for a long time...a -really- long time, way back in the beginning of its alpha, and its really grown since then...there are consistant updates that keep everything fresh and new, and fast-paced third person shooting/ brawling that most people would be interested in...but as much as I love this game, thats sort of where the bright sides end... The game, in its nutshell...is a huge farmfest, thats it. You earn mastery rank (basically an account level) through levelling gear, which unlocks missions, weapons and gear for you until about rank 7, which, as is expected of the community, they will look at this and think how they could possible perfect this system, and they have...you farm the same mission, over and over again, usually either defense (you have an objective to defend from oncoming waves) or survival (you defend yourself from oncoming waves while keeping your oxygen supply up from drops from the enemies and capsules which drop). By the time you're about...say mastery rank 4+, you will be doing the same old thing, in the same place, the same way, and if you're not brainlessly farming xp for a warframe or weapon, your farming materials, to make another weapon/warframe to farm xp for them. On the other hand, the farming methods means you get diverse weaponry that you are forced to use, instead of clinging to a single weapon like a life-line and never leaving it...until you realise just how bad 80% of the weapons are...come on, this game has rocket hammers, glaives, chainsaw whips, lightning throwers, beam-rifles, quad barrelled shotguns and yet...almost non of these weapons can by used by the end, with the "end game" rifle being the SOMA Prime. Next up is warframes, and what a selection you get... warframes are the classes of the games, and there are over 20 to choose from, and their abilities differ from creating clones, going beserk, summoning water tentacles from the floor, balls that turn into black holes etc. etc... but again, too bad 70% of them are dwarfed in terms of useability, with most high-end groups refusing anyone who isn't on the "good warframe" list, and just to prove my point, should you get this game...just count, how many times you see a "Hydroid" warframe...800 hours and i've legitimately seen 3 hydroids. In a game with 22 different warframes (at this current time) why are only 6 or 7 are viable? The paying system is what you'd expect from any F2P app, the simple "pay to make things more convinient" take on it, with weapons taking 12 hours to craft, and warframes taking ATLEAST 3.5 days to make. They are nice to begin with, they give you some starting platinum, only about enough to pay for the cheapest warframe there is, or to increase your warframe/weapon slots a couple times. I can't complain with it, if you have the patience, then you won't have to pay a penny. Its difficult to say how I feel about the developers...yes, its good that they are coming up with updates on a regular basis, that they're trying to keep things fresh, but they have a horrible habit of releasing a new weapon, making it overpowered so everyone will buy it and items to upgrade it, then nerf it in a weeks time when everyone has got one, claiming they were fixing it. This wouldn't be a problem if this didn't happen consistantly over the time I played it. In conclusion, despite these things, the game...is oddly fun, even with its mind-numbing goals and sneaky tactics to part you with your money, and being free to play, it wouldn't hurt to try it out, and there is some joy in being an overly-powerful space ninja destroying waves of space clones/merchants or zombies. P.S. This is simply my opinion on the game, some of my knowledge on the game is slightly outdated but otherwise, this should be fairly accurate.

review: Dear fellow gamers, For years, I played this game. I joined in when it was at update 6, now we are waiting for the update 16. I watched how it was developed from a simple normal game to a masterpiece. The devs were adding lightshows, new content, new features, new playstyles and even greater optimizations. They were doing so much thing with this game, that its just nostalgic to remember back how was it back than. The game is hard when you play it first. It is hard, like you can die anywhere at anytime. Than you advance and level, the game becomes harder, but you become better and than it becomes easier and filled with more and more action. Than you make new weapons and frames. My first choice of frame was the Rhino, the Boltor, and the Dual-Ether blade. Slowly you become the best of the best and seek new challenge. Higher type of enemies, than even higher type of enemies for even better stuff. Than you go for the towers, the enemies become harder to kill. The scrub remains scrub, but they add these little -chops enemies which makes your life ten dozens time harder. As you advance you begin to see that the Ai is not just a stupid clone-brain anymore, it thinks and makes a tactic against you, which will still mostly fail. -> it is the rhino who steps in the room first, you will understand why Than you wish to go higher, do mmo type repu for these freedom fighters or just for those green guys. Than you realize you need a prime and you want to farm it, than level it, than polarize it. Than you reached your meta-status, one frame over-the-top, with high-end-tier of weapons, you are the mass destruction in galaxy. Well, you can have a sentinel, or a pet, or just do archwing missions. But most of all, you can try out other things. In other mmo-s, there is the meta and the rest of the useless stuff. Here, you are the meta. If you do well, victory is yours. If you do the very best, it will be an easy fight. If you are the meta, you can step into the greater challenge. Also, there are pvp too. As you advance, you gain things. The game is free to play, but there are things closed down. Like two-warframe slots. But as you advance you can get platinum, through daily alert, or just trade. But if you wish to have more and more, you can do that without. As your mastery level increases, the slots increase too with it. The more you try out, enjoy and play, the more you can do. It is great fun for me, though I know it wasn't for some of my friends. There are those who like the gameplay style and there are those who don't. But I tell you it is worthy of your time!

review: Warframe is by far one of my favorite free to play games. The art style and combat is very unique as well as the general gameplay mechanics.There are over 10 warframes "The space ninjas" you play as and has over 50 different types of unique wepons. Although they are already many wepons and frames new updates keep coming making the game endless fun. The community is quites funny and interesting as well as helpful. The makers of warframe (Digital Extremes) listen to the players feed back and keep adding new thigns as well as fixing bugs. However, with all these pros in place there are some things that take away from this gaming experience. The fact that the maps are repetitive and many of the mission require you to do are the same, some may leave this game for a while. But after while and you return it will be filled with new goods. I would give it a 8.0-8.5/10. And way not try is. Its FREE!

review: I liked the game while it was still fresh. But challenge, it ran out. All fights felt flat, no enemies posed any threat, the whole gameplay is turned into generic mass destruction with no need to use any brains. But what killed it for me is constant updates, which featured nothing but weapons and frames - new ways to kill old, helpless enemies. Uncool, bro, uncool. Still, I recommend this game to those who haven't tried it yet, just mind that if you're not into mindless repetitive grind - you won't be here for long.

They need Earths help,Earth has recources needed to help the Teno in exchange the government wants tech and is willing to help by donating the soldiers who are willing to become the first to be outfitted with Teno bio suites (this means designing new frames which will be added to the game after the premiere) So the ANcheints knowing they are in a position to save Humanity from destroying itself make the deal on the request that we decommision all nuclear power sources and weapons (we need to anyway) So with teno technology in a month the earth is free of everything nuclear and toxic to humans people are getting healed ect... And the Soldiers are getting trained . THere are get to know them scenes ect (first two hours) then a friking 2 hour battle you could split the humans up with the Tenos so many options. I DONT CARE IF IT IS ANIMATED THIS GAME NEEDS A MOVIE LOL

review: Warframe is a fun, yet somewhat laggy free to play co-op game. The quality is amazing and the visual design kicks , gameplay is fairly simple (sort of like Mass Effect's combat, but without the cover system and RPG elements) but fun and it's probably the first F2P game that doesnt feel like a rip-off It's good!

review: Its a pretty fun and cool game, for most of the game you're wildly stronger then any of the enemies and its nice and relaxing. The only downside is that you have to pay real money for almost anything- sure you can skirt by without dropping a penny into the game, but there is still a lot of money grabbing attempts.

It has the feeling of a fast pace shooter game, but with a unique feeling of individual player abilities and customization. Amazing graphics and decent community.

Game runs well on low end and still looks awesome, on high end it looks next gen, not a year younger, but 5 years ahead of other graphics. The game engine is amazing, never lag (exept when there is more than 60 enemies on screen, thats when you drop 10-20 fps.

review: Mixed opinion on this, the gameplay is great, with the wall running the brilliant animations and the series of characters you can play with that all have their own abilities. HOWEVER, the developers have used a tile system so after a while the maps get repetitive and they all look the same, that said the enemies are also reused and the only change is their lvl scaling, this game Is mostly for those who have nothing they'd rather be doing and just want to stab things with a sharp discus and shoot an arrow into something with a helmet 5 times bigger than the actual head(seriously knock off the grinners head & helmet and the head is actually a regular sized head.

review: this game is fun, for everyone who loves shooter or leveling up the character colors can be customized and theres like 20 characters to choose from, of course after farming the items needed, some need quests, some only items from bosses/etc theres multiple game modes, well... missions xD survival, defense, rescue and some others, so everyone would have something from it but its better to play it with friends! because you will feel weird otherwise xD maybe thats just me though haha theres soooo many weapons to choose from... including BOWS <3!!! and melee weapons from axes to huge swords and scythes and staves and a few more types i like everything on this game, and the boss fights are fun as long as you are not too high level haha, then it gets stupidly easy, but then again theres high level missions too cons: -there should be more bosses, theres 1 boss per planet, and theres about 10 planets i think there should be more than 1 per planet, or a boss-arena mode XD -most people who play this game just stick to what they heard on some forums about whats the best equip... they really dont have their own style, kinda stupid to me -i hate the new flight-mode, sure its all fast and stuff.... but i hate that type of games normally XD so i try to avoid all flight missions not sure what else to say, the game is just awesome, try it yourself, it doesnt hurt BTW!! everything in the game can be bought with in game money/items well okay, with real money you can skip the 12 hours waiting time for crafting other than that real money in this game?? more for stupid people hehehe you can even get more weapons with in game money than you can buy with real money, so if you prefer games where you can buy(cheat) your win, this is not the game for you thats it! thanks for reading -Sophie Phantomhive----

review: When I first downloaded this game, my first thought was: "This game you cannot solo, and act like rocky." however as I progressed on through the game, and got better frames, and weapons & just in general better experience with the game I soon realised with the right setup you can solo anything if you put your mind to it. I loved this game so much that I spent 95 on the Loki Prime Acess package, soon after that I bought 5 kubrows and probably spent around 550platinum on them. Soon after that I stopped playing and left all my beloved Kubrows in Stasis where they would be safe (This was before they added "Consign to lotus" ability) 3/4 months later I came back to this game to find that 5/6 of my Kubrows which I spent platinum on had been removed, so I had been left with 1 fully grown one and 4 other baby ones (none of which I payed plat for) - So I contacted the support about this issue, and they deleted the logs of me ever owning those kubrows, and ever spending platinum on them. They deleted the Kubrows and said there are no logs of me owning any kubrows. This made me stop playing the game which I loved and spent so much of my money on (P.S I am 16 going on 17 and do not have any income so nearly 100 is a lot for me). This game has a great community and this is why I keep coming back to it, and enjoy playing it. It improves a lot, and as the game improves it adds new challenges for you to conquer with your friends. If you are lucky you can join an already made clan (I wouldn't suggest starting your own clan as it costs a lot of items to make a decent Dojo) - But if you join a pre made clan, and they're active and kind, and they help you out with missions and stuff, then stick around until you improve and help some of their new members out. The clans on here are really fun to be apart of, as they are able to attack a sector on the solor system and it brings you to a fight with the current clan/alliance owning it.

review: The game itself is good, but it's got a few annoying aspects unless you pay, such as only having 2 slots for warframes, meaning you have to sell others to make room. I hear the in-game market is good for getting the platinum (paid currency), but you would need something people would want to buy to have any chance at getting the platinum. It costs 20 platinum to buy a warframe slot, and I would suggest you never buy the warframes straight out. Depending on the warframe, it can get quite pricey, even if you take into account the other things it comes with. Real money - paid currency rate $5 gets you 75 platinum, and only 1 warframe I believe is this cheap. Some warframes cost near $25 or more to buy straight out.

review: I started playing this game way back when it first hit steam and let me tell you, there wasn't much to be had there. It was a great concept and didn't seem like anything more than a coop thing. come into the last year or so and this game has made amazing progress and the fact that practically this game is 100% free given the fact you can trade items for Platinum (game credits) to which you can use to speed up timers, buy those aesthetic items or bluerints. You don't have to actually spend money for this game; but I can almost guarantee you will want to at some point. Warframe Login rewards will occasionally reward you with a 50% off coupon + free Plat on Platinum purchases to help regulate Plat flow in the markets, and give you a taste of what Platinum can do. Again Platinum is not needed for everything, as most things can be either farmed or bought with In-game money. But some things Will require Plat either excluseively or to help expedite things. The Core gameplay is somewhat grindy, as you'll be running missions for dailies, clearing planets to uncover new ones, gathering materials to craft new gear or items, or even gathering gear itself. Recently, updates have changed how Melee works and have also introduced Clans and PVP. Future updates are told to bring actual space play involving Jetpacks. TL;DR try the game. It's free. You could spend money if you wanted, but it's not needed. For a current gen game that has online play, free, goals and objectives, why not try it?

review: This game is really great mainly because EVERYTHING can be obtained without giving a penny to the developers. I'd also like to mention that this game etches the word "GRIND" into your brain like a fatboys crack addiction. I don't have a problem with the grind because I'm used to grinding away on games and I'm also sure that lots of other people won't mind either. Going onto the topic of the games virtual currency, Platinum, which can be bought and then either be used to buy stuff from the market or the player auction. DON'T expect to get very far in the player market unless you have platinum to spend or have some damn good mods for your gear. The only downside to the trading aspect is that weapons and a few other things aren't tradable (although I can kind of see why with mastery rank limitations, ect) Recently Digital Extremes made a new beginners walkthrough so don't miss out on that great tutorial which teaches you some good things to know. The developers keep up with the games development and if something isn't working, it usually gets fixed in about a few days. Overall this is a damn good game and would recommend anyone looking for a grind. EDIT: I'd also like to say that this game is WAY out of beta and should have been "released" in update 10. 11/10 ~Zeroeh

review: Warframe is a really fun Co-Op game. There are many weapons as well as several different warframes to fit your play-style (stealth, offensive, defensive, support, etc.) Weapons can be easily obtained if you really put your mind to it, people who say that the game is all about grinding are probably wrong. Yes, it takes time to build weapons. Yes, you need to obtain certain materials to craft something. But in the end, the game gets easier to obtain weapons and other items. I've gotten most of my stuff from just crafting them, there's really no need to waste money unless you're just not in the mood to craft or "grind". Overall, the game is great. The mechanics are really cool, gameplay is responsive and smooth, graphics are great, and the developers really put alot of effort into the game with many updates and events. The game keeps getting better and better. I'd recommend this game for people who like fast paced third-person shooters and don't mind taking their time crafting weapons, warframes, or making research projects for your clan.

review: I had a review before, but I felt like its time to completely redo it, now that I am more experienced. So, we have Warframe. What is warframe? You are a Tenno, basically a space ninja-samurai-thing, and you have to restore balance to the galaxy. By that, you go around killing different factions, gathering their resources, to build more weapons to kill them all again. It's a loop, and if you don't like the gameplay or grinding, than this game has nothing for you. There is a tiny amount of story, but the game revolves around gameplay heavily. So, what are the three factions? -Grineer, an empire of cloned soldiers, who are genetically decaying, and who you'll probably be fighting the most. They are heavily armored, and prefer brute force. -Corpus, a conglomerate of merchants, who do whatever they can for a profit. They have armored helmets, but are mostly lightly armored, and they prefer to use robots and other tricks. -Infested, space zombies. They are infected by a virus from an old war, and kill whatever gets in their way. They are lightly armored, and usually swarm you. There are also the Orokin, but they just take some units from all three factions, and combine them all, which you'll be facing in the Orokin Towers, where you'll be spending most of the endgame. There are also a multitude of weapons. Some of them are better than others. For example, the Soma and the Soma prime spew crits like crazy. The Boltor Prime does pure damage, and the Latron Prime is very accurate, and very ammo efficient. There are constant wars over which is better, but it usually boils down to personal preferance. Modding can be a bit tricky to get used too, but there are builds online, and it's not too hard to learn. There are also Warframes, which is basically your class. They al lhave different stats (Health, Shield, Armor, Movement speed, and others), and different powers, which reflect what their based of (Necromancer, assassin, paladin, etc.) They take a while to farm, and 3 days to craft, but some completely change your playstyle compared to others. So, what about the gameplay? As you are a space ninja thing, you have a large amount of abillities, which include: Wallrunning, rolling, lots of melle attacks, wallrunning and shooting, sliding, sliding and shooting, slide melee attacks, and some others. You use all your abillities, weapons, and powers, along with three other Tenno, to run around maps, and kill everyone in sight. You've probably also seen it was free to play, so you're wondering "Is this game Pay2Play?" Well, my answer is a complete NO. Th eonly things you can get with only the premium currency (platinum) are cosmetic items, and you can get platinum from trading, so anything is available with dedication. All the game changing items are available for free. The community is great. Aside from some heated arguments (Boltor Prime vs. Soma Prime), they answer questions, are generally polite, and if you need help with a quest, want to do a tower, etc., ask in recruting chat, and they will probably help. So, this game all boils down to personal preference. Do you prefer the combat? Play it. Do you prefer grinding? Play it. Do you prefer a great story? Not the best game for you. I personally love this game, and I recommend you give it a try. If you don't like it, no money lost. If you love it, you are going to be spending lots of time on it. I've almost spent 400 hours, and that pales in comparison to some of my friends.

review: Warframe is a refreshing blend of FPS, RPG-like progression, and mmo interactivity. My average Warframe session plays as follows: The game opens up to an overlay of the Solar system. The options from here are fairly analogous to that of diablo III. From here you have access to your equipment, inventory, crafting, market with both ingame and out of game currency items, clan, chat, and friends list. Unique to Warframe is the Solar Map. It features high interactivity, allowing you to drill down two levels of detail. Selecting a planet/planetoid allows you to see all available mission in that system. Upon hovering on a mission, the map shows the mission type, faction and level of difficulty presented in the mission. There are various ways to run missions, but the most commonly used is online. In this mode, you matchmake with other players wanting to run the same mission. Once matchmaking begins, you can either select "play now" to begin the mission after a short countdown or simply wait for at least one other person to join before the countdown begins automatically. If you are running though a mission and it's not yet full(4 players max) and the objective is still incomplete, players will be able to drop in mid-mission. The more players working together, the higher the experience and reward payout. Progression in Warfame is accomplished through a couple different systems. Your account has a rank, it begins at 1 and slowly builds up as you play through the game. Progressing to the next rank requires completing a trial, accessed by clicking on the xp bar on the main menu once it's full and flashing. Certain weapons require a certain account rank or "mastery rank". Your warframe, weapons, and carrier has a level, these cap at 30. As these are raised, your health, shields, stamina, engery, and damage increase. Each level provides the respective equipment an additional amount of capacity for mods. Each new weapon and new warframe that you level helps build your mastery, and is proven to be the quickest way to progress. Each mod drains capacity but gives an upgrade. These are both increased my fusing the mod to higher levels. This offers near limitless upgradeability to your frame and weapons of choice. As you progress though the game's content, you will collect more mods along the way allowing you to further customize your build to your needs. Chasing difficult to find mods and upgrading them to their full potential is a challenge in and of itself.

review: It's hard to find a middle ground when it comes to "Would you recommend" or "Would you not recommend". The game is good, I'll give it that. Played it for quite a bit (40 hours+) before relizing it was on STEAM and swapped to that for achievements/items. The game looks great, the gameplay is fun and the new content is always nice and I have to say I love the Dojo (Being allowed to build stuff your way in a game is always amazing!!!) but at the same time there are some key flaws. So let's do PROS and CONS. PROS Good Graphics A lot of different Warframes and Weapons to play around with. You are essentially Cyborg Ninja from Metal Gear Solid Fully Customizable and Decoratable Clan Dojo EITHER/OR It takes places in the same Universe as Dark Sector... which is weird. Never did like Dark Sector. CONS Rather then, list the cons by just, simplifying it, I'll explain a few. For starters, you have endgame. All games needs a good endgame but Warframe sadly does what Diablo 2 did. You can become powerful enough to kill the hardest boss in twenty seconds! Now grind/farm so you can kill him in fifteen seconds! Now grind/farm some more so you can kill him in ten seconds! Now grind/farm some more so you can 1-shot the final boss! You'll just be trying to make yourself godly powerful in which case any new content that is released as well as any current mission will lose all challenge and it will begin to feel like a chore doing missions to the point you just run through all enemies, spamming AOE skills just to get to the end. The missions as well are grind-like since on some event missions, you have to replay the same mission FIVE times just to get the reward. The grind does however feel a lot less when you work in a clan all working toward a single goal... like finishing a dojo decoarion! The Warframes, while varied, have some things to be desired. As expected, there are those "Select" Warframes everyone wants or is used for endgame content. The Rhino Warframe can be aquired on the second planet Venus, and you can pretty much go the whole game using that one Warframe without ever choosing another. That's what I did. Stomp + Iron Skin ftw. I ended up getting other Warframes (Nekros, Paladin, Berserker, Excalibur) but I never had the motivation to even play them. Sure I could play the level 4 Nekros there, oooorrr play the lvl 30 fully decked out Rhino and not feel like a third wheel in Invasion modes in comparison to the others. The last big flaw is STORY. To this day, I still have no clue what is going on. Like, I know I'm Tenno, I know the Corpus and Grineer are badguys but not always or something cause you will help them at times. And I know you work for a girl named Lotus who might be a Tenno but might not be who wants you to do stuff for, reasons. Nothing is really explained. Ever. EVER. I've tried looking it up. The Grineer are simply explained as... they live on a rotten Earth... they're clones... they use old tech... their mission... stop the Tenno from awakening. Because.... EEEHHHH???? You know people are fighting but "What are they fighting for?" is never really explained! The most I got was.. the Grineer are trying to conquer everything. Stop them from doing that. The Corpus are trying to do stuff too. Stop them from doing that. There's a guy named STALKER too who comes after you... he might be a Tenno. Stop him from, stopping you stop others? I'm still gonna recommend the game, it's fun to play for a while I would not suggest trying to play this for so long you become supah-awesome numbah one! This kind of game is a space filler, something to play between waiting for other games to come out. Like Titanfall, or Dark Souls 2, or Elder Scrolls Online. That sort of thing. In conclusion. Fun gameplay, good graphics and a heavilly customizable clan DOJO, but a grind with no real story backing it up, wouldn't recommend spending 100+ hours on it. And Stealth becomes quite pointless once you can stomp and kill every enemy in the current room and next couple adjascent rooms die instantly.

review: This is one of the better Free-to_play games out there. It takes a few hours for it to get fun, but once you get into it, it's tough to put down. It isn't as grind-intesive as most F2P games, either, if you don't want buy anything. Highly recommended, especially if you have friends to play with.

It takes up quite a bit of space as well, so i ended up uninstalling it because i dont play it as much....

review: Warframe is a parkour/ ninja type game (hence the "ninjas play free") where you play as a race called the Tenno. Tennos are equiped with special suits called Warframes that allow players to use "powers" to help conquere the battlefield. enough with the intro stuff. Warframe is a great game in my opinion. Although it may be a slight buggy at times... Basically its an awesome game with a space ninja twist. All in all, play it. All i gotta say. :D (though it took me alot of sentences to say it)

review: What can I say? This space-ninja based game caught my eye and life. Playing with friends hasn't been more fun, running through different instances such as spaceships, devastated debris fields, ancient ruins, all with one purpose: cutting off infested zombie-like creatures, robotic grineers or energy wielding humans. And blowing everything up with each different Warframe unique and epic ability. With a huge arsenal of weapon variety, different mods to customize your playstyle accordingly for each frame, makes the posibilities endless. Although it sometimes can get repetitive, like power leveling, farming, and non stop killing, there's this thing that keeps Warframe so good over the years: the constant and non-stop updates and events from the developers, DE. Fun with friends, get three teammates and have a great laugh killing everything on sight. If you like mayhem: you got it!

review: This game is posetively beautiful and I can attest from the beta stages when I initially joined it was great and still it.

game-hours: 447.7
review: This review is split into sections, using numerals to show each section. My rating: All in all I would rate it an 8/10. Would recommend if you can deal with a lot of grinding and some bugs. Also this game is still in BETA! I The game modes are: Exterminate (eliminate all enemies), Mobile Defense (taking a DataMass to a Control Panel, then defending it), Defense (defending something for 5 waves at a time), Survival (survive a mass onslaught of enemies for as long as possible, rewards every 10 minutes), Excavate (defend and keep a scanner and its excavators powered to extract resources, Interception (you Capture and Defend several points from being taken over by enemies), Sabotage (Destroy a Reactor), Assassinate (all boss missions, and to kill high valued targets), and Hijack (defend a mobile target and possibly destroy it). The game is 100% Co-Op, unless you go to the PVP (Player Versus Player) areas. Graphics are good. Gameplay is very grindy, sometimes buggy, and very well balanced. Bugs well crap II The game is very grind worthy, grinding through many missions to progress is slightly boring. But considering that each mission is never the same, in the sense that they will always look different from the last time you played it. All weapons can be OP if you mod then properly, and you obtain mods from trading other players, rewards from missions, or by defeating enemies. There are Warframes, which is basically your suit with magical powers that are very destructive against enemies. There are 300ish missions and more than 10 different planets/moons with 10 or more missions each, with their matching environmental art styles. Each Warframe has their own special four abilities unique to that Warframe. Warframes abilities range from being able to turn invisible, to being able to stomp the ground and suspend all the enemies in the air, to shooting spikes into every enemy within your sights. The weapons in game can range from a Jet Power Hammer, to a Pistol that shoots rockets, to a gun that shoots circular blades or bolts. The lore is very simple, and easy to remember. There are three main factions, the Grineer that are a bunch of brain washed clones, the Corpus that probably are like humans, and the infested that are infested creatures of doom. There is an enemy called the Stalker that rarely shows up if a boss curses you, and then there are the G3 and Zanuka that do the same thing. You have these syndicates that are 6 different groups, you sign up with one and then you trade this thing called standing for a mod that boosts your Warframes abilities, or a weapon, or something else. The basic 300 missions, are the normal missions, then there are Void missions and derelict missions. Void missions come in 4 Tiers, each increasing Tier number indicates increasing difficulty. There is a void boss called Corrupted Vor, he comes around just as rarely as the Stalker does, but only in the void. Derelict are basically the Tier 3 and 4 but only with infested enemies. Also customization of your Warframe/weapons is pretty good, you can change every color to whatever you want, and same for additional cosmetics. Credits are the basic currency in the game, Orokin Ducats are prime pieces (rewards from void missions) traded for special currency to be traded for Primed mods/cosmetics, and the premium currency platinum. Platinum can be earned by the login rewards, by trading rare mods/prime components, or by purchasing them. Archwing I have not done too much of this yet, as such I am unable to give 100% valid information. AFAIK (As Far As I Know), you have a jetpack and fly through space and continue your basic objectives, and you can go fast like Sanic. This is AFAIK of Archwing, but I will edit this later on after I have tried it. III Alerts One of the best ways of acquiring rare mods/items. There are daily alerts that often reward with only credits or a few resources, but sometimes they have a rare mod or weapon as an reward, Normally a weapon or some high cost item would be reward from a Tactical Alert. Tactical Alerts are long and tedious alerts that last a week or so, in which the player needs to complete a very hard challenge in order to obtain said item. My rating: All in all I would rate it an 8/10. Would recommend if you can deal with much grinding/some bugs/ absolute nonsense.

review: Mixed opinion on this, the gameplay is great, with the wall running the brilliant animations and the series of characters you can play with that all have their own abilities. HOWEVER, the developers have used a tile system so after a while the maps get repetitive and they all look the same, that said the enemies are also reused and the only change is their lvl scaling, this game Is mostly for those who have nothing they'd rather be doing and just want to stab things with a sharp discus and shoot an arrow into something with a helmet 5 times bigger than the actual head(seriously knock off the grinners head & helmet and the head is actually a regular sized head.

Words cannot describe the direction this masterpiece has taken from it's small roots to this vast entity that keeps on giving back. You get tired, take a little break, play it again, and wonder why you ever stopped. If there was ever a game deserving of a 10/10, it is Warframe.

The customization is awesome and (more importantly) the combat and gameplay are smooth, fast and keep you into the game. I haven't fully mastered the game navigation (as far as where to get what and mods, etc.) at this point but I'm sure it will become 2nd nature in a few more sessions. It's free to play so you have nothing to lose by trying!

review: I really didnt expect to enjoy this game as much as i did.The combat is fast paced and once you play into the game the difficulty definitly increases in a good way.The rpg elements have been implemented very well and the mod system seems very interesting. The only thing about the game i didnt enjoy is that for a new player i found it pretty difficult to figure out how to do certain things there are small tutorial hints in-game but i didnt find them as helpful as they could have been. Overall i think everybody interested in an action/rpg/shooter hybrid should give Warframe a try, and since its free to play that makes checking it out even easier. Rating 8/10

review: Let me start by saying that this is a free game that has in game purchases (weapons, warframes, storage slots etc.). Let me continue with: "This is one of the best games I have ever played in my life." I am an avid gamer for more than 18 years now, and have played hundreds of games of all genres. This FREE game is mindblowing in many ways: 1. It is FREE!!! 2. It is not that kind of a free game where someone who makes in game purchases will have an enourmous advantage over you. The advantage is only in the fact that he will have more warframes and wapons (because storage is limited and you can purchase more). You level at the same speed, the Prime warframes are only 10-15% better then the normal ones, same goes for prime weapons. 3. The game does not require you to pay to get 100% out of it. You can aquire all weapons and all warframes (including prime) by earning them through playing. 4. The graphics are brilliant. A beautifully designed game. 5. Playability is 150%, at least for me. Love the mechanics, love the skillsets, love the weapons. For a free game, you could not wish for more. 6. Robot ninjas with superpowers. Enough said. 7. Awsome mod skilltree (simillar to RPG style) but here you collect mods, upgrade them and fit them into your warframes, weapons and companions (little robots with laser beams, killer hounds and simmilar). The best thing is you need to pick different mods for different misions because they are very specialized (there is no best mod for all missions and against all types of enemies). There are a few drawbacks: 1. The lore (story) is somewhat shallow, altough it is so far very well thought of. 2. The missions tend to be somewhat repetitive, but using different warframes, weapons and playing with different co-op players makes it interesting, time and time again. 3. That is all I can currently think of. All in all, this is a must try game. I have personally invested over 300 hours in it, and i haven't had enough. Cheers.

review: Bring time, break with your girlfirend and play warframe dude. I totally recommend this game. And it really deserves to call itself F2p! Yes you can invest real money, but if you finally discover how to trade, you dont need to! (you will do it anyway!). If you like Coop-based games, stand your ground with your friends against endless waves of very well designed enemies. Every Warframe (those things you play here) and every weapon is unique. You dont believe me? Play it and you will see, im so fukin right! Its so much fun to level your frames and weapons, sentinels (flying machines equipped with weapons to automatically shoot enemies) and your kubrows (you can breed dog-like monsters, but they are much coller than boring, small dogs!!!). You want to hunt for rare stuff, prime parts, mods... The community is awesome and helpful all the time. Dont mind to ask something if youre new! A lot of F2P games like War Thunder or World Of Tanks are very frustrating sometims. Warframe NEVER frustrated me. Sometimes you have enough of playing Warframe, but suddenly, after 3 day of abstinence, you cant stop play anymore, because you fond another great warframe to build, a weapon to research.... im addicted

review: Easy to play, easy to get hooked. Repetitive gameplay. Not pay to win, but the reminder of what you could have for just a bit more $$ is constant.... you cant get away from it. If you ever saw the Simpsons episode where Mr. Burns is draging money on the street from behind his limo...thats a lot like warframe. Not everyone will (or needs) to put real money into the game. To some extent I hope most people pitch in a small part to support the devs as this is a good game, but be careful. I personally have put more real money into this game than what I would for preordering most AAA games and while it does pay off.... it doesnt come anywhere close to unlocking everything in the game. The upside of that is that the game keeps churning out new weapons to use, new gamemodes to play, new enimes to shoot or slice, new warframes to use in battle, and new gameplay expeirences overall. ...pretty sure they make new graphics improvements as well. Warframe is a great looking game that is constantly trying to evolve itself. The controls are solid and the gunplay can be satisfying so long as your at the right level for your frame and weaponry. Speaking of weaponry, there is quite a bit here. Everything from Sci-fi lasers to war hammers, bows, assult rifles, axes, whips, and much more. Each of these are leveled up and can be modded for increased effect. Same goes for the warframes themselves. IMO, this is there warframe hooks people. There are so many options of warframes and weapons to use it's astounding. This game keeps giving you little goodies like mods and credits for each mission and eventually you'll have enough to upgrade your equipment or purchase something new. ...which starts the process all over again. If you're looking for in depth story, you might want to look elseware. There is a backstory for sure, but it is barely noticeable compared to the addictive cycle of leveling up, fighting, obtianing new equipment, and leveling up again. What story is there, I do enjoy and I believe Digital Extremes keeps giving little tid bits of story to progress the game. The game play is fun, but after a while it gets old for most people. I do know some have kept at the cycle for a while and have came up with some very impressive builds, but I dont see myself doing that. Good thing is that there's still plenty of gameplay to be had for us more casual players. All in all I dont regret the money or time I spent on the game, but the cycle is something that needs to be pointed out.

review: A really good game if you like those Metal Gear-esqe "Gray Fox" Ninjas, except with a lot less sneaking and more slicing people into pieces. The game has microtransactions for some interesting cosmetic things and much of the unlockable content. However, most all of the equipment, from primary weapons to the warframe you play as, are unlockable via playing the game and getting the parts to build it. Its not "pay-to-win" its "pay-to-save-time". In defense of the grinding, it doesnt take long at all to get all the good stuff once you get used to the game and the mechanics.

review: I had a review before, but I felt like its time to completely redo it, now that I am more experienced. So, we have Warframe. What is warframe? You are a Tenno, basically a space ninja-samurai-thing, and you have to restore balance to the galaxy. By that, you go around killing different factions, gathering their resources, to build more weapons to kill them all again. It's a loop, and if you don't like the gameplay or grinding, than this game has nothing for you. There is a tiny amount of story, but the game revolves around gameplay heavily. So, what are the three factions? -Grineer, an empire of cloned soldiers, who are genetically decaying, and who you'll probably be fighting the most. They are heavily armored, and prefer brute force. -Corpus, a conglomerate of merchants, who do whatever they can for a profit. They have armored helmets, but are mostly lightly armored, and they prefer to use robots and other tricks. -Infested, space zombies. They are infected by a virus from an old war, and kill whatever gets in their way. They are lightly armored, and usually swarm you. There are also the Orokin, but they just take some units from all three factions, and combine them all, which you'll be facing in the Orokin Towers, where you'll be spending most of the endgame. There are also a multitude of weapons. Some of them are better than others. For example, the Soma and the Soma prime spew crits like crazy. The Boltor Prime does pure damage, and the Latron Prime is very accurate, and very ammo efficient. There are constant wars over which is better, but it usually boils down to personal preferance. Modding can be a bit tricky to get used too, but there are builds online, and it's not too hard to learn. There are also Warframes, which is basically your class. They al lhave different stats (Health, Shield, Armor, Movement speed, and others), and different powers, which reflect what their based of (Necromancer, assassin, paladin, etc.) They take a while to farm, and 3 days to craft, but some completely change your playstyle compared to others. So, what about the gameplay? As you are a space ninja thing, you have a large amount of abillities, which include: Wallrunning, rolling, lots of melle attacks, wallrunning and shooting, sliding, sliding and shooting, slide melee attacks, and some others. You use all your abillities, weapons, and powers, along with three other Tenno, to run around maps, and kill everyone in sight. You've probably also seen it was free to play, so you're wondering "Is this game Pay2Play?" Well, my answer is a complete NO. Th eonly things you can get with only the premium currency (platinum) are cosmetic items, and you can get platinum from trading, so anything is available with dedication. All the game changing items are available for free. The community is great. Aside from some heated arguments (Boltor Prime vs. Soma Prime), they answer questions, are generally polite, and if you need help with a quest, want to do a tower, etc., ask in recruting chat, and they will probably help. So, this game all boils down to personal preference. Do you prefer the combat? Play it. Do you prefer grinding? Play it. Do you prefer a great story? Not the best game for you. I personally love this game, and I recommend you give it a try. If you don't like it, no money lost. If you love it, you are going to be spending lots of time on it. I've almost spent 400 hours, and that pales in comparison to some of my friends.

review: As an organize-minded person, I will do a list of pros and cons this game has, and overall view/recommendation Pros: +Audio(gun sounds, ambient, level music etc) +Variety(amount of warframes, weapons, companions, enemy types etc) +Interesting storytelling(enemies/NPCs/playable characters' history, language, style, culture etc) +Up-to-date(widely approved in-game/game related modifications in Warframe forums added/removed in to Warframe relatively often) +Always something new(alerts, invasions, events) +Enviroment(multiple tilesets across the Solar System) +Looting system(very simple, wide variety of collectable items) +NOT pay-to-win(There is alot of things you can buy with real money via in-game alternative currency(Platinum), but you can sell in-game items for Platinum(special weapons, Prime parts. mods), gaining real money-worth in-game currency without having to use a single penny. Although this requires you to play decent amount of this game to have access to farm sellable items) Cons: -Netcode(Despite recent netcode updates, strict NAT problems still persists in some parts of the playerbase) -Tileset variety on a single level(this might bother once you've seen all tilesets many times) -Controls(takes time to learn[I got 600+ hours and still haven't completely mastered all controls]) -Resource-heavy(not recommended to run on low-end PCs, see system recommendation for more info) -Level size(for some missions, the levels forces you to do too much moving around to get to objective, and for some missions the level size is not overly small, but would definitely use a bigger combination of tilesets) -Overall bugs(random, massive, few seconds lasting framerate drops even on high-end PCs, players joining game might spawn over the map, and minor bugs that are just visual[holding your melee weapon like a rifle, or having the gun holstered and equipped at the same time, making the guns projectiles come from the holstered weaponmodels' barrel]) There probably are many other +/- in this game, but those are what came to my mind now. Anyways, I highly recommend this game to people who like MMO-styled Shooter games. Also if you only like one of those, still I recommend playing this game. And as I said before, no matter how much you feel like '' this games' soo p2w'', it definitely is not. This game just needs time and interest from a player to start ''making money''. Putting real money in to this game is completely voluntary.

review: A great game became better with a newly introduced story line and quests. It's a difficult grind to get the better gear if you don't spend cash for Platinum or purchase packs, but it's still possible to get all high-end gear in-game without spending money. A great time sink, the game gets better and better as you put more and more time into it.

review: After playing this game for over a year, I have come to the conclusion that it is highly addictive, and has the potential to be something great. The combat is really fun, from being a stealthy and fast Loki, to a Tank like the Rhino, there is a Warframe to suit everyone. Pros: The game itself can be played without spending a single cent. The combat is fun, and can range in difficulty to easy to impossibly frustrating. The middle game and endgame content keeps you playing, and once you figure out how to actually play the game and how the systems work, it become easy to play. However, higher level missions are best done in groups, the maximum level difficulty that is possible to solo without dying would probably be 20 until you get endgame level gear. Participating in a clan/alliance is almost necessary during the endgame, but it is easy to either form your own or join an existing one. New game content is almost added, providing new things to do in the game, so unless you are a veteran, you will always have something to do. Cons: The game is not easy to pick up. The farming is almost unbearable as time goes on. The Early game is almost unbearable, and the Late game is rather stagnant, even with the additions of PvP and clan/alliance conflicts. Once you get to the end, all that is left to do is grind the same content over and over again. Although the same content is entertaining, you will find yourself taking long breaks from the game in order to make it feel fresh again. I personally just started playing again after 7 months of not playing, and I am enjoying the latest update. On a final note, the Platinum prices are ridiculous, and the artificial difficulty created by the low drop rates is clearly designed to keep you playing and paying.

review: Although the bugs may be a turn off, i absolutely love this game. Constant updates large and small keep the game more varied and interesting. The game alone may not seem to interesting but playing with friends is really fun. The warframes vary well having different support, offensive, and defensive abilities. Also this is probably the best looking free to play around right now. Overall if you have the room to download, give it a chance and play with friends and you will end up putting some hours into it.

review: My favourite Sci-Fi Game so far. 10/10 for me. The graphics are beautiful, the choice of weapons, warframes(characters) and mods(to upgrade all these) are just huge. The game is mostly a co-op game, with a maximum of four players per mission. Your mission goals vary, the environment varies, everything is perfect. Only one thing I don't like: the updates. When a major update comes out(like new mission type, new event, etc.) there are so many bugs and glitches and sometimes a lots of game crashes, that it makes almost impossible to play peacefully for one or two days. They should focus on looking for these problems and repair them A.S.A.P. In brief this is a beautiful game, interesting, always gives you something new to reach. I have 350+ game hours and I'm still enjoying it.

If you don't enjoy mission style gameplay (someone repetitive at times), this probrably isn't the game for you, but I would still recommend you try it and definitely get on the forums on the game's site and take a look at it and contribute.

This game is awesome, whether you like a solid third person shooter with a whole variety of guns to choose from (having in mind the fact that you need to spend the time to forge them or lvl up to the needed rank), or if you just want to go melee nuts hack and slash style. Bad this is once you get you character/weapon slots full, either you keep selling the things you have to make space for new ones, or you get slots by refering a looooot of friends, otherwise you're gonna dump some cash on this free game. I've been with Warframe from the beginning and it had major improvements since it was on beta till now, was it a new HUD, new tilesets and enemies, the game keeps getting better :)

( -.03 for it sometimes being warfarm :3) Amazing gameplay, graphics, mechanics etc. The movements are very smooth and can chain into some incredibly creative (and awesome) combos, and combine that with your warframe's special moves, then you get a BEAST! The game is a fast-paced third person shooter (yet suprisingly the only one im good at :3) where you can be a slower, beefier tank, (Rhino, Frost etc.) a high-mobility glass cannon (Nova, Ember etc.) a manipulative ability user (Mag, Loki etc.) or an all-round one if you don't like those three extremes.

review: I stepped away from this game about a year ago as my interest faded. I originaly posted a review stating that this was a pay 2 play with a heavy grind aspect but I loved the theme and atmosphere. Stepping back in, I am genuinley surprised with the amount of content now included with this free beauty. Items and Warframes are more easily accessible as long as you put in some hard work. Clans and Clan Dojo's are outstanding with the ability to customize and upgrade. Melee 2.0 has added a new dynamic to duels and melee based characters. My own personal ship! The list goes on... (really) The point I am trying to put accross is that we need to put a small hold on the whining in regards to recent changes. Our voices are heard, and it appears the developers have their own goals and will make changes that they see fit best. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Originally posted by ikefier3: It's so sad when rewarding you with in-game items for completing elements of the game and not paying for it is considered "amazing". How ed up is that? Ikefier was refering to the addition of Sigils as cosmetic acheivments and I completely agree. It is ed up but koodos to the dev's for trying. In this generation of pre-orders and pay to play, I believe Warframe steps up to the plate in the best way possible. There will always be a cash cow market in free to plays, or some sort of ad revenue. For Warframe to be where it is now, it required support from the community and we see the pay to play element balancing out quite nicely as development continues. I will continue to support the developers, because from my perspective we have come a long way and I have fun playing. Goodbye life, it was nice knowing you! Thank you for the Founder Headband!

The game is free so you don't need to purchase any $ to get all the weapons or warframes in game (only some unlimited items if you wish to purchase - the rest you can farm meterials to craft). Overall: I love this game, I know it is not perfect and can get bored when you get all stuffs from the game but it is the good game you can play with your friends or solo and make friend in group of region.

review: I've been playing this game for about two weeks, and my impression so far is mixed, though mostly positive. If you like the concept of being a space ninja, and don't mind the grinding that goes with most MMOs, then this game is for you. So far, I'm still "relatively inexperienced", and avoid the trading channel like the plague. Honestly, while a community market is always a plus, the sheer wall of text of stuff you don't care about is hard to sift through in order to find people selling/buying the stuff you DO care about. Also, the game seems to suffer from a Diablo-style "You need this gear on this class, otherwise don't bother me" mentality when it comes to high-level missions. Perhaps it's a spoiled community, or perhaps it's the apathy that comes with farming. I can't say. Apart from these two glaring, community-based problems, I'd say the game is superb. There are occasional bugs (falling through the map, not being able to interact with the UI) but they can be worked around. As a F2P, it blasts its competitors out of the water, holding its own against similar AAA titles. The weapons are varied, and most are suited for specific occasions and playstyles. Like to snipe? There are sniper rifles and compound bows! Like mowing down enemies with a hail of bullets? Try the Soma! Wanna get up close and personal? I can't recommend the Valkyr frame highly enough, as her ultimate ability renders her invulnerable with the only drawback being a restriction to melee attacks... which regenerate her health. Want to customize your frame? There are several mods which alter your abilities, as well as paint and accessory customization options at your disposal. My recommendation for people looking to try this game -- download it. Give it a whirl. It's free to play, so it's not like you'll be missing out on anything by trying it. I recommend starting with the Excalibur warframe, as it turns out quite handy even in later missions. There are lots of weapons and mods that were only accessible for certain events, but a lot of them are often sold on the player market. Most of the gear you'll need can be won through in-game missions, though it may take a significant amount of time. For those of you who don't mind spending a bit of extra cash, platinum will be your best friend in quickly acquiring equipment which would normally take days of grinding to find. For those of you who'd rather keep your cash and play entirely free, you'll spend a lot of time trying to farm specific areas for parts to craft your new toys, but it'll be that much more satisfying once you have them. I can't recommend this game highly enough. It has its flaws, sure, but for what started as an indie free-to-play, it's come a long way. The game is still regularly updated, the devs are usually quick to fix major bugs, and you can finally live the dream of becoming Space Rambo. What's not to love?

If you want to buy something off of the store with plat, that you can only get by plat, all you gotta do is play the game, and sell the mods to other players for actual plat. The game just all around feels good, looks good, and plays good. There is a lot to do, a great community, and c'mon, lets be real here: graphics DO sometime make a difference. In Warframe, the graphics are stunning, and if you have PhysX then you will love it. I recommend this game to anyone. Shooter/RPG fan or not, you need to try it.

review: Review time: So this is a pretty good game, problem is it doesent really explain what to do, as a newb to this game 1.5 years ago I was lost. if you find that you are in this situation then I guarentee that you will hate this game, it has no direction and the mindless killing doesent really have much replay for the first Frame/Weapon and starter planets, but with time and persistance and a little bit of spending "creddits" for better gear then I guarentee that you will enjoy the massive ammount of weapons to choose from couppled with warframe abilities. Warframes are easy to aquire and weapons are really cheep for the most part, farming for monney is easy to do as long as you have someone in trade chat carry you to a high level mision for easy monney. Finally for a last opinion, I would despite all I have said get in a guild and play with people, this game is not meant for solo and playing with a squad of 4 is much more fun than sticking it out by yourself.

review: A decievingly fun cohesive multiplayer game with endless combinations of weapons and Warframes. From the bow and kunai stealth approach, to the hack-and-slash gib-lord sword and shotgun combo. With the heavy-hitting ranged weapons, I find myself struggling to use the melee weapons effectively. I try, I honestly do. The parkour system in this game is so unnatural that I find myself avioding it because it feels chunky and uncontrollable-- it almost feels uncomplete. The ability to infinitely mod your weapons and make them more deadly is astounding, however. And the game actually making you have to work to level up is great. The seemingly endless universe for you and your friends to explore is amazing, and I always find something new to explore. I love how the maps are randomly generated evvery time you play the game, even if it's a dozen times in a row. The enemies and loot changes every time. Also, IT'S FREE TO PLAY, AND IT'S NOT(completely) PAY-TO-WIN!! I've got to admit that I haven't played a game this fun in a long time, and I'm torn between it and Mountain!

review: First of all this game somehow doesn't feel like a grind you can get most of the weapons/frames pretty quick,the community are awesome mostly in the North American/EU servers, like help newbies etc. The stealth is just to simple and weak.Gunplay is fun with many ways to take out your enemies,from your oridnary guns to LAZORS BEAMS to enegry weapons etc. Each frame looks and funtions uniquely.There are so many ways to kill your enemies,Will you slash dash your way through your enemies? Will you zap them into oblivion? and many more.Also you can earn real life currency (platnium) though trading rare stuffs (prime parts)/mods/stuff :P. Arcwing is awesome as you fly around space and blast your way though victory, but there not much really to play arcwing as there are very little weapons/mods for it.There are syndicates you can fight for that gives you rewards of doing missions got them,though a little more lore can be added to why and how they were created so at least i could give a damn about why im helping the syndicates rather than focusing on the rewards.Overall this game is fun, but it is very repetitive though they have many game modes.They are feel the same at times

review: Space ninjas. Space baddies. Space farming. Best farming simulator 2016. 11/10 Would farm again. In all seriousness though. Warframe is a third person co-op shooter. You play as the Tenno, who seek the protect the balance. As I got into this game, it was confusing. Unless you check the wiki 24/7, which I did because I'm a nerd that way, you won't understand anything. However, once you get the hold of the mechanics, the game is really fun. However, the grinding and the cruel RNG does make this game feel repetitive time after time. When you do get burned out, just do something else. Come back in a few months and even weeks and I garuntee you that something new has been added/changed. Pros: -Beautiful Graphics -Fluid Motion -F2P completely. Everything is unlockable except for event items (which could have been done for free) and cosmetics -A Dev (Digital Extremes) that actively updates and cares about this game -Just fun Cons: -Repetitive at times -Confusing to the new player -And yes, DE is human, so they do make mistakes. These mistakes are usually temporary and will be fixed almost immediately. Overall, this game is fun and just pure awesome. Like any game, it does have it's cons but the pros heavily cover them up. I recommend you pick it up and give it a go. Remember, check the wiki. :3

review: Throughout my years of gaming I've stumbled across few games that provide such diversity and freedom, we all crave the opportunity to play a game that has almost no limits. Well Warframe for one is absolutely stunning, it provides the player with the feeling of no limits even though it still has a few wich can almost not be noticed at all. Warframe is linear, fun and dynamic even for a game nearing it's last stages of beta, it's quite impressive. The mechanics in the game had blown me away at some point as it has some originallity to it, wich very few developers fail to master. The gameplay itself however makes the player feel truely apart of the whole experience as it has a mixture of realism, fun and fantasy with a twist of sci-fi, it provides the ultimate game experience. Most games have failed at the combination of these elements. The diversity of weapons is astonishing, as it provides almost every weapon type imaginable and more! Another part of the game I enjoyed was the modding system, I found it very easy to use and I also loved the diversity in mods available. There really is almost endless possibilities especially with the elemental combination of mods wich forms new elements. The customization also stood out for me, It gives the player some nice personalization options to feel even more "at one" with the game or perhaps makes them feel more comfortable with their gameplay, strangely enough. The graphics of the game is quite a pleasureable aspect even though it gives some killer eye sores, you know it's all worth it. In referral to the music I really enjoy the action movie feel it has to it and would love to see some more of it, it truely gets you in the "zone". If there is one thing I could add to warframe it'd be a bit of lore. Warframe is free-to-play and almost all in game content can be obtained by the player without having to pay a dime. Warframe is co-operative and provides a PVE gamestyle with a few PVP elements wich are seemingly still in development, and I am quite eager to see the outcome of the PVP system. Warframe also provides players the option to trade for platinum wich is basically only obtained from buying it with real time currency. In short warframe is not a pay-to-win but if you feel like supporting the developers for thier great work then buying some platinum is a good way to support them. But to sum it all up, I strongly reccomend Warframe if you are looking for something new and different and encourage some RPG fans to try it out aswell as those die-hard MMO fans. Keep up the good work I am excited to see what comes next with the further developement of this game! If I had to rate it on a scale of 1 to 10 I'd give it a 7.6/10.

review: Now that over a thousand hours of my life have gone into this game as well as a good chunk of cash I can really give this a better review. In short, it's fun but doesn't feel like its going in the direction it should(or that I would like). I don't really know how to describe my feelings for it. After U.I. 2.0 it just wasn't as much fun. I was rank 16(highest you could be at the time) and had every weapon i could obtain except for 3 and then new ones came, and then more, and more. Sure this is how Warframe has been but for some reason it just wasnt as fun. Some of the new weapons now look fun but during that time I couldn't get back into it. I will say that if you come across this review and haven't played yet, get the game. its amazing when you fist start out as you have so many weapons and warframes to choose from. And of course its a grindfest so if you're into that then you will be fine. I hope you enjoy this game and maybe you'll see it finally get released.:Corpus::Grineer:

review: Ok so this game will be repetitive at the start just a bit.But when you start doing void missions and start getting prime parts the game will open up more. Also i suggest installing a warframe alert app on your smartphone just beacuse you can miss a lot of good stuf just by not knowing about it. I suggest to everybody to try this game and give it a shot

review: As a beta game or free-to-play, i would say its great overall. Bugs and glitches should be expected throught your gameplay experience and they are not hitting on players too hard though. Therefore, its not overall so bad for the bugs part. If you are like me, you will always find the bugs funny. For the gameplay experience, its a werid action game because it combines typical third person shooting games actions with magic power (especially after the upcoming update for the Parkour2.0 system). Although there is some tank type character, you still need to play the same mission over and over again aka farming, to gain rare mods or rare items to build your ultimate weapons. It is similar to how you keep pickaxing and shoveling in Minecraft just to build a dream house. And if you do not play minecraft, it will be just like how you get gold and diamond skins for your guns in COD. Of course you can pay a lot to purchase items from other players or the prime access. Another important thing is to join a clan or find some pal to play with. It is a co-op game. You may go solo but it would be too hard to level up because bonus experience points can be gained through playing with other players. Remember to pay attention to the abilities of every warframe because every character aka warframe has his/her special abilities, like Nekros's desecrate can increase drop rates. Some of the warframes may not need heavy protection too if you have built it right, like Limbo, playing intelligently will not casuse you any damage at all. Gaming experience is great but the problem is warframe should start working on creating some exclusive things for players who had hunted a lot of things. Many new players are just buying every stuff to make themselves fit in the high level or veteran(?) players community. This is kind of annoying though they are the people who are supporting the game in a financial way. And also there should be more competitive gameplay added to this game. Maybe a clan war? This can make the game more fun but I suppose this cannot be done by looking at the engine and server for now. This one will only for the new players. The missions and tutorial can be quite confusing. It is totally not a good time to start off playing this game right now as there are bunches of new things added to this game. Just remember, do not rely on your primary weapon too much. Check and try out all your abilities, every weapon you can obtain. Find your favorite set up and play. This is my opinion. It may not mean a lot but this is the comment I have on this game after playing for a year. Happy hunting tenno.

review: One of the only shooters I like, because the RPG elements are reasonably compelling. Some menu items are mouse only, but otherwise you can play with a gamepad. Just pray to the gods of RNG with Warframe. It can take a LOT of grinding to get what you want, since it's typically not a steady stream of predictable rewards, but rather a completely random chance of getting a reward based on the roll of the dice. Cash shop isn't too intrusive. You can play without paying easily, though if you don't want to look ugly or have barely any inventory space, you'll want to cough up 5 or 10 USD for some color palletes and inventory spaces.

review: Ninjas Play Free. Those are the three words I won't forget for a very long time... Having first began playing Warframe at the beginning of Open Beta. Back when there were a handful of tilesets, the UI was simplistic, and generally the game felt so much smaller. At some point, I grew disillusioned with the game and left it for atleast an entire year. Looking back, now, it's great to see how much it has grown. I returned only a week ago. But there is still much work to be done - the title of "beta" becomes readily apparent when you realise Digital Extremes has a multitude of undocumented changes and nerfs in their hotfixes, as well as glitches, and imbalances between many of the titular 'frames. But. It is, however, a third-person shooting, hacky-slashy, parkour ninja simulator and one of my favourite games of all time, for its intuitive, fast-paced and fluid combat, which flows brilliantly as one switches from oversized machinegun to pocket laser shotgun to jet-powered hammer. The most important question is, however; "Is it fun?" Well, it certainly has its flaws; for newer players, it'll be an uphill struggle; since you won't be all too familiar with it, you'll have to really farm for some of your gear, and sometimes RNGEsus will kick you in the balls. There are some annoying enemies too, like Grineer Manics who zip around and teleport constantly, or Nullifiers who remove your Warframe's buffs when you enter their shields. My answer? Yes. Play this bloody game. Give it a chance - after all, Digital Extremes had this baby from the get-go; this is what darkSector was supposed to be.

review: And here's my book: Warframe. One of the most popular online FPS RPGs on the market today, Warframe has already collected quite the crowd. Three million is the current, last-published number for the player base of this game. With online guide support, one is never lost in this game as it is constantly changing. Created by Digital Extremes (DE), this game is nothing short of constantly updated. If you ever find a bug or that something isn't correct, you can guarantee that it won't be the situation for long. If you're not too big on PC gaming anyway, just buy it for PS4 (releasing Nov 15, 2013 in the US). Oh wait, I didn't mention that the game is absolutely free. If it's not your cup of tea, no problem. You simply delete it off of your hard drive, and your out of nothing but your time. However, if you do enjoy this game like the many others who tried it, you'll be sucked into the universe (or solar system, more correctly) of the Tenno. Now, don't think this game has some magical, gripping storyline. The missions are extremely repetitive and somewhat lackluster. However, the amount of content available is simply astonishing. I have at this current time 196 hours of time played in Warframe. I still feel as if I haven't scratched the surface. if you're worried about spending money, you shouldn't worry at all. If you want to play this game in the sub-100 hours range, then you should be fine. If not, I would say $50-$75 should complete the entire purchase of the game. Considering the fact that Fallout 3 plus all its DLC was $120+ I'm not too concerned on that price range. If you're interested of hours of addictive gameplay filled with ninja robots and a whole lot of dead people, you've come to the right place. Fight on, Tenno.

review: This game is a great free to play, I really insist you get it. This game is very different. For a free to play game, it actaully doesn't look like a lower resolution game. This game offers stunning graphics and glorious lighting. And after you get over the lovely graphics, you can head straight to the high impact fighting. This game has a level system and you can set your character to however your play style is. If you enjoy staffs and swords. Use the mods and make a melee build, or if you prefer automatics. Use some mods and make a rifle build. Just incase you get annoyed with your character, you can always get a new class a 'Warframe" to be exact. This game has a high replay value and I enjoy playing it. One downside to this game is that it's pay to win, but that doesn't even matter to be honest. 10/10 - Best space game ever.

review: Warframe is the frequently updated, lovingly supported, free-to-play outing from Digital Extremes, the team that brought you 2008s mutagen-filled Dark Sector. In fact, Warframe is the not-so-direct sequel to Dark Sector in that it takes place a good handful of millennia after the conclusion of its predecessor. But dont worry about plot, because Warframes story is thinner than water. Youre a Tenno, a humanoid being descended from the protagonist of Dark Sector. Revived by the Lotus, a mysterious entity who seeks to bring balance to the Milky Way, youre sent out to do battle with space marines, space zombies, and space corporates (seriously) with your space ninja superpowers, provided (in part) by your Warframe, a bio-organic suit of armor created by a virus that has begun to infest the entire star system. Warframe is an oddball of a game to classify. Its part MMO, part Monster Hunter, part Mass Effect 3 co-op, part Vanquish, and then some. The game is so hard to describe, in fact, that Ive coined a new genre for it: space-ninja simulator (okay, its a third-person action shooter MMO, but shut up). When you first begin, youll be dropped into a tutorial that teaches you simple movement tricks like jogging and sprinting, firing your weapons, and hacking things apart with your sword. Immediately following this, youre dropped into the general UI and shown a big galaxy map (think Mass Effects galaxy map), an inventory screen, a foundry (where youll craft things), a store, and some other options. Here is where Warframes biggest folly lies: not once are you ever told how these work. Some of these elements are pretty easy to pick up on (click a planet on the map to bring up nodes; these represent missions, which unlock branching paths when you play them), but others are more complicated (How do I make weapons? How do I get more Warframes? Whats an Orokin Catalyst?), and will require alternative methods to learn about and utilize. Thankfully, Warframe has a big community, so its not hard to pull up a Google search and find a half-dozen listings for why Excalibur is the best starting frame and why all the gear youre given to start with isnt going to hold up. If youve ever played Vanquish for any length of time, then you already have a fairly good grasp on how Warframe works. While you wont be slowing time down, virtually anything you can pull off in Platinum Games underrated 2011 shooter can be done here. However, there isnt a single bit of hand-holding, which, as previously mentioned, is the biggest issue with the game. Tricks like sliding on your knees to move rapidly while unloading rounds on your foes, running up a wall to reach a better vantage point, and zipping through the air with your feet outstretched to kick enemies to the ground are all things you must find out through experimentation or word of mouth. While its a cool idea to keep these as things to find out on your own, the acrobatics of Warframe are a huge portion of what makes it unique. Theres nothing quite like running along a wall while laying down a hail of gunfire on unfortunately located foes below. Warframes unique blend of gunplay and melee is an unconventional approach to the shooting genre. While melee is almost always an option, its rarely given the same level of importance as the firearms you wield. Not so here  youre actively encouraged to take advantage of the many stunts your melee weapon of choice grants you. While straight up punching at the faces of your foes isnt the most viable option, leaping into the air and slamming a massive blade into the air to trip over your foes, giving some poor sod on the floor a flurry of punches to the face from a pair of gauntlets, or bisecting a mob of degenerating clones with an electric whip are just a few of the choices youre given when it comes to hacking enemies apart. Not all weapons are the same, however, so while the Obex fisticuffs look cool (they taze and they punch!), theyre not going to be nearly as practical as the Scindo battleaxe. Thankfully, theres a lot of gear to choose from, and the frequency of updates from Digital Extremes will see to it that you never run out of options. Warframe I saw this in Kill la Kill! There is no overworld in Warframe to speak of. The entire game consists of instances (organized by nodes on a web map), with missions that vary in faction, objective, potential loot, and tile set. Each faction is a completely different force to compete against, as the Grineer utilize overwhelming numbers and heavy armor, while the Corpus defend themselves with shields and robots that act as cannon fodder. Lastly, the Infested are a race that does what the name implies: over time, planets containing nodes that denote specific missions will become infested, and you will temporarily ally with that nodes faction to repel the infestation. Once the infestation meter for that planet is reduced to zero, the original faction will move back in, and the conflict resumes once again. An interesting feature of Warframe is the previously mentioned tile set. Tile sets are different, grid-based chunks of a level that are randomly selected before every mission begins to make a completely unique level to explore and do battle in (much like TimeSplitters, though youre not the one making the maps). The open-ended nature of tile sets means that you can end up in an expansive or linear map, making some missions lengthy and full of loot to find and use for crafting new gear, or others short and sweet to make boss runs that much shorter. While some may be irked by the idea of layouts not set in stone, the idea of never running into the exact same map twice is a refreshing take on the co-op shooter. Weapons can be modded for improved stats and the ability to generate elemental effects, like fire, ice, and even radiation. Weapons can be modded for improved stats and the ability to generate elements reactions, like ice and fire. One of Warframes biggest draws is the flashy, non-competitive gameplay you can enjoy with friends for the low price of free. However, the label of free is all too obvious, with all weapons, Warframes, and other gear being objects you can purchase right out of the box (albeit at inflated prices easily circumvented by farming for the parts needed to make these frames). While many items (such as the coveted, raid-exclusive Prime equipment) require that players achieve them instead of pulling out the wallet, the idea of being able to buy the newest gun the moment its released is quite odd. However, not one item that affects your ability to perform the game is behind a pay wall; all non-cosmetic items (and even then, some cosmetics) can be obtained with the simple concept of invested time. This is where the Monster Hunter comparisons come into play: if you want to get a new Latron rifle, youll have to purchase the blueprint with credits (earned through regular play) and construct it in the foundry using materials found during different missions. Once youve begun construction, timers come into play. This is another aspect of Wareframes free-to-play status. If youre patient, your new gun will be ready within the next 12-24 hours. If you want your fancy new rifle now, however, youll need to drop a small amount of money to rush the build to completion. While its not going to impede your ability to participate normally, it wouldnt be a surprise if this turned many away from the idea of playing the game. However, the nature of the game is the grind. You can always be better, and thus, youll almost always be looking for the next big thing to find, as there are no real goals set for you (outside of big events) besides the ones you want to achieve. Thus, you may love Warframe, or you may actively despise it. 8/10

(Feels like a different game) Neutral * Archwing is nice but needs more mixing with normal gameplay like in the first AW-mission. Cons - Only a few quests - Unbalanced weapons and powers - Still a huge grindfest - RNG item farming Warframe has lured me back with the new updates and I guess it's a nice timesink.

review: Cyborg Ninja Third Person Shooter That's as succinct a description as I can think of. You play as a variant (over 20 kinds) of Grey Fox from MGS1, or Raiden, whatever you prefer, in a far future Solar System filled with humanoids, robots and infested Flood (from Halo) like aliens that you shoot and slash and stab and stealthy stab and energy stab and jump stab and do other things I haven't unlocked yet. Its got crafting and a grind to match for the specific items you want, but I don't mind that since I find the core gameplay of shooting and running and jumping and somersaulting really really fun. So yeah, play this game. Its free and the vast majority of content is completely free. Only cosmetics are forced to buy with money dollars.

review: I will start by saying weather or not the game is fun is going to depend entirely on weather or not you find the endless grind of typical MMOs fun. Because once you get past a certain point the game devolves from an interesting third person space ninja shooter with crazy weapons, Into just another Grind fest. Doing the same missions over and over to farm enough resources to build that one gun you wanted to try out. Example: Spend an entire day farming all the parts for the Miter, and after all that hard work, spend another day waiting for it to build. (Or rush it if you feel like wasting your hard earned cash) Then use nothing but this weapon until it max ranks. then toss it asside and repeat. After a while no variety of weapon, no variation on "Point and shoot" in this game continues to be fun. The same enimies time and time again, the same tilesets time and time again, and the same Grind that never stops. And while it is entirely posible to play this game without spending a dime and actually get Plat (the stuff that cost real money) The amount of grinding involved is excevive even for a free to play game. As another example of how bad it can be. Back when Kubros were first introduced into the game, you could get one to have as a companion during missions. I spent nearly 200 runs of the same mission before i got the drop for the egg i needed to get one. (or spend real money on it, but i wasnt going to do that) Only to then have to wait 3 more days for it to hatch and mature to be able to use the thing. The same kind of grind goes for getting Prime frames. Run missions over and over until you get the Blue prints for the parts. Blue Prints. That take an entire day to build each. Then when you have all the parts. you build the Frame itself. that takes a total of 3 days time to build. All that hard work, to sit on your  and wait. Or spend 5 bucks to rush all the builds. In my final thoughts on it. I think warframe is a great game that falls flat on its face simply for being to much of a free to play. Trying to force people into buying things that can be grinded without money by making it take ungodly long periods of time. This game is the Farmville of Shooters. And i give it a 7/10 Good, but to greedy. A Free to wait game

review: After playing warframe for 1000 hours I'll say it definetely was a blast and still is. It never ceases to fail me that it always made me and my friends feel like were badasses. One shotting things and wiping rooms in mere seconds made me feel like a god almost. When ever it came to the hard stuff it was a bunch a teamwork and skill to output such great results whether it be survival or defense missions. Although this game is not perfect with its few glitches and grindfests (freaking rng >_<), I feel it has come along way and from its beta till now. This game is about the journey not the quest (sometimes :3).

review: Great Game. Worth putting the time and effort into. the game gives a different atmosphere of gameplay, something that you will want more and more of. theres alot of stuff to do ingame. you have Dojo's (clans) which u can customise fully however you like. you also have a handfull of great weapons to choose from and customize at will. theres a great community backing the game too. also the developers at warframe are very good, they are very helpful for whenever you need them e.g. technical issues and wateva else. They bring great content to the game every so month or season like xmas, easter and so on. while on a certain mission, its great just to take your time and look around the map, the way they design the map and have all different secret areas for you to xplore and discover is just awsome. Only down side i have had with the game would be just the lagg, some games i join might have cr*ppy internet, so it pretty much makes the mission impossible to do cause, sometimes you will not see the enemies around you or doors will not open for you but for others it will. but those are just minor things. everything else... is just awesome! plus.. you become a space ninja what more could you ask for!? :D

review: One of the best Free to play MMORPG's I've ever played. The game is not pay to win, all warframes and weapons can be crafted except excalibur prime as this is for founders only. Even if you don't play for a while you can still go back to the game and play with friends who may be a different level. The game requires alot of time and effort (Grind). Regardless this doesn't really matter as it is very fun with friends and solo, solo just providing more of a challenge!

review: Why is this game free? Someone, tell me. Its better then alot of games that cost 60$. Is it mabey because of the little amount of in-game purchases? (Which can be avoided) AC Unity had tons of those, and it was a 60$ game. Someone tell me, why is it free? EDIT: Its because these developers care about making a good game, not about making money. Thankyou, may your company live long, and prosper. (Dangit Spock)

review: Great Free 2 Play game , totally addictive
game-hours: 94.1
review: I'm not one who easily gets hooked into your typical shooter. To a certain degree, Warframe is quite unique as a Third Person Shooter game. Each individual Warframe (character you play as creatively named after the title) has their own unique sort of play style which can help your team either very little, or you could be a Banshee where you point out weak spots, or Loki who disarms every enemy within range to make the fight easier for you. For those who aren't after a shooter that's similar to the Call of Duty scene (Which is getting increasingly bland with every new release), I'd give this game a try. Sure the missions get repetitive at times, but this game should have enough content to more or less keep you coming back for more.

review: I'm a fan of the muliplayer FPS, MMO and RPG scenes. I love the idea of an FPS in a Diablo suit, but I was worried it would be too repetitive. Would the replayability be there? The answer: A circumstantial Yes. I would highly reccomend that you play this game with friends. If you are solo the game can quickly become tedious. However, with friends time flies by! Something else that is not readily apparent - There is a somewhat steep learning curve to this game. Understanding how mods interact with polarity slots, how damage is calculated, various weaknesses and strengths, and learning all the warframes (really what style of play suits you) can be a daunting task. New players will find the first system of missions easy enough, but will soon find enemies that prove a real challenge. The correct application of mods on your warframe and weapons will be essential. All in all Digital Extremes is putting in a great deal of work into making this game an amazing experience. Updates are constant. It's free to play with an ingame store for both normal currency and paid currency. Everything that can be bought with real money can also be obtained without real money (except extra inventory space and a few cosmetics) and without too much difficulty. Try it out - what have you got to lose?

review: For a free game, it's pretty good with its gameplay and graphics. Kind of similar to the Destiny game. Beside it's heavy micro-transaction based nature, everything else is awesome. Most of the cash item can be forge with a little more hunting. Of course there are cash item that cannot be forge or purchase with in-game currency. Conclusion: Good game for people that like grinding. Bad game for people that have short attention span.

review: Before you read this reveiw, you must consider these questions three: Is the game worth my money? Is the game worth my time? Are the developers in touch with the community? Now that you've done this, I will read your mind and answer three questions you have about Warframe. "Is the game worth my money?" I will dismiss this question out of hand, as a simple glance at the price will answer this. "Is the game worth my time?" This is where it gets tricky to answer. Warframe isn't for everyone. There's no underaged kids telling you that you're a "Haxxer," there's not very much math involced, and worst of all, there's precious few instances of acronyms and/or bizzare phraseology with which to confuse new players. In all seriousness, however, there are problems with Warframe's delivery. The gameplay itself is fun, the perfect blend of fast and tactical, with enough customizability on Warframes and weapons to allow a broad variety of playstyles. The troubles come when not playing the game, however. A new player, after slowly acquiring the blueprints and materials nescessary to build a brand-new Warframe, will suddenly find themselves faced with an intimidating three-day wait until it's done, and Warframe makes it very clear that a little cash will make it go faster. When I first built a new Warframe, (It was Ember, if I remember correctly,) I rapidly went from excited to depressed to angry to saddened. To the new player, this wait is an annoying wall that stands between them and fun, a barrier placed by malicious and evil developers who hate all manner of fun and enjoyment. Fast forward to a few months later, when this once-new player has three Warframes they need to rank up, two waiting to be claimed, and another building. Although Warframe's enforced waiting period seems like a cheap money-grab at low levels, it becomes less and less meaningful to a patient and determined player as they progress. However, this is really the most important thing about Warframe. If you arn't patient, if, like Veruca Salt, you "Want it now!" then Warframe will probably irritate and annoy you. If you have the patience to stick with it, however, you'll find a fun and entertaining game with a good variety of gameplay and weapons. "Are the developers in touch with the community?" If you've made it to this part of the reveiw, you should get yourself a cookie. Once you've done that, I'll answer this question. Yes. The developers, Digital Extremes, is very in touch with the community, releasing fairly frequent updates and devstreams. They keep a good touch on what the players want, and do their best to deliver it, with only a few instances of failure. We're not likely to see the next Cube World/Stomping Land in Warframe. In summary, the only drawback of Warframe is the patience required to get started. With that said, however, it's free, so why not try it out and see how you like it? See you in the game, Tenno.

review: I Would Recomend this game for people who enjoy playing grindier games It's quite the time sinker if you like it to be, always thinking about what is the next step, what weapons you should be leveling up and modding As you get more into it, you will expand and build you own kind of gameplay with you own set of favourit warframe , and there are quite a lot to choose from , I would recomend also to be a few people playing it as a team as it enhance the experience and makes it easier to achive goal's that contributes to you own agenda

review: The game is centred around a group of "space ninjas" or tenno who aim to maintain some form of balance in the galaxy. They are lead by a mysterious being known only as the Lotus in their task. Each tenno is able to equip a warframe or battle suit to use in their fight, they each have their own abilities, strengths and weaknesses. The game has a slow start but does get better with the aquisition of new weapons and warframes,most of the game is based around improving your gear and weapons and there is pvp if you want to compare with friends. The story is still unfolding in the game so it may seem very subtle but the actions you perform do have an impact, even if it is just a minor one. + Good gameplay + Varied Weapons and Warframes(Abilities) + Varied Maps and enviroments - Slow to start - Can feel "grind" heavy for free to play players 8/10 Would play for hours.

It's a difficult grind to get the better gear if you don't spend cash for Platinum or purchase packs, but it's still possible to get all high-end gear in-game without spending money.

review: After playing this game for over a year, I have come to the conclusion that it is highly addictive, and has the potential to be something great. The combat is really fun, from being a stealthy and fast Loki, to a Tank like the Rhino, there is a Warframe to suit everyone. Pros: The game itself can be played without spending a single cent. The combat is fun, and can range in difficulty to easy to impossibly frustrating. The middle game and endgame content keeps you playing, and once you figure out how to actually play the game and how the systems work, it become easy to play. However, higher level missions are best done in groups, the maximum level difficulty that is possible to solo without dying would probably be 20 until you get endgame level gear. Participating in a clan/alliance is almost necessary during the endgame, but it is easy to either form your own or join an existing one. New game content is almost added, providing new things to do in the game, so unless you are a veteran, you will always have something to do. Cons: The game is not easy to pick up. The farming is almost unbearable as time goes on. The Early game is almost unbearable, and the Late game is rather stagnant, even with the additions of PvP and clan/alliance conflicts. Once you get to the end, all that is left to do is grind the same content over and over again. Although the same content is entertaining, you will find yourself taking long breaks from the game in order to make it feel fresh again. I personally just started playing again after 7 months of not playing, and I am enjoying the latest update. On a final note, the Platinum prices are ridiculous, and the artificial difficulty created by the low drop rates is clearly designed to keep you playing and paying.

review: Although the bugs may be a turn off, i absolutely love this game. Constant updates large and small keep the game more varied and interesting. The game alone may not seem to interesting but playing with friends is really fun. The warframes vary well having different support, offensive, and defensive abilities. Also this is probably the best looking free to play around right now. Overall if you have the room to download, give it a chance and play with friends and you will end up putting some hours into it.

review: My favourite Sci-Fi Game so far. 10/10 for me. The graphics are beautiful, the choice of weapons, warframes(characters) and mods(to upgrade all these) are just huge. The game is mostly a co-op game, with a maximum of four players per mission. Your mission goals vary, the environment varies, everything is perfect. Only one thing I don't like: the updates. When a major update comes out(like new mission type, new event, etc.) there are so many bugs and glitches and sometimes a lots of game crashes, that it makes almost impossible to play peacefully for one or two days. They should focus on looking for these problems and repair them A.S.A.P. In brief this is a beautiful game, interesting, always gives you something new to reach. I have 350+ game hours and I'm still enjoying it.

There are some slight problems with it, the level design is lacking, there needs to be more creative mission types, and going solo in this game is never the best way to play.

review: One of my all-time favorite games. No its not everyon's cup of tea. The game is focused entirely on 4 player coop with an AMAZING art and design style, the fast-paced and largely enjoyable gun-play/sword-play combo all in one package. yes it can get grindy, but a large part of the fun is going out and crafting all the various weapons from a multitude of components and resources you find, while fighting varying enemies (currently, 4 main enemy factions: corpus (robots/shied focused), grineer (cloned human/armor focused), infected (bio-technocyte virus/ general zerg-ish focused), and corrupted ( a mix of the previous 3 with a few twists ). each faction has its major weaknesses and strengths, so you will never be facing hordes of the same enemy over and over... there are a HUGE number of varying enemies to fight and places to go in the solar system. the overarching storyline is slowly being fleshed out by the devs, and it's quite interesting, certainly not the run-of-the-mill, and the suppsoed protaganists (you) the tenno, are not always acting in the best interests of humanity as a whole, so the player can choose (all RP for now anyway) your role in the powder keg that is the solar system in the timeframe the game is set (thousands of years from now). TL;DR - many different space ninjas with badass guns and swords. that is all.

review: Ive changed this review from negative to positive, as I do enjoy the game. Just hard to get into. This is a really fun game. Its just extremly grindy. Which is why its hard to recommend. Its very difficult to get into unless you have a lot of patience, and really dont mind grindfest games. If you do however, then by all means play it! It took me over 400hrs of playing to reach the point that I wanted to be at in this game, which is max rank (17 right now), every Warframe in my inventory, and over 50 weapons along with every mod that has been released. (Excluding some event specific gear. Ive had my account since closed beta, but didnt get to play till about update 11, (4 majort updates ago at the time of this writing) It has one of the best F2P models around. You start the game with a free 50 platinum (roughly 3 bucks worth of premium currency) and this can be used to unlock extra slots for weapons or frames. You start with 2 frame slots and about 8 weapon slots. Each weapon or frame that you build takes up on of these slots, no slots and you cannot claim your built items. (12 platinum for 2 weapon slots or 20 for one frame slot) This premium currency can be earned by trading rare items or mods in the public trade chat channel. No weapon or frame rentals in this game,(which is a good thing!) you build everything you use or you can buy with platinum outright. (Usually overpriced in the market.) Everything gameplay and weapon wise can be built with materials found in missions, however the build process is excruciating sometimes as builds for weapons take a minimum of 12 HOURS, where frames take at least 72 HOURS! Every weapon and frame can be obtained from playing the game, or by buying it from the game's market. Every piece of gear is permanent until you sell it. The only thing that you cannot earn by playing is cosmetics.(Unless a special event is active and is a part of the rewards) Those are all platinum exclusive purchases. This game is still in beta, and has been for a year and a half or so. Full release is STILL quite a ways off.

review: The overall gameplay and features are wonderful in this game, a really well developed masterpiece. Some of the things that really catch my attention and hopefully yours, I've listed below. Please try the game to see if you like it, everyone is different. + Free to Play - Paying wont give you an advantage over other players, it will only reduce waiting times to build items, unlock skins and colors pallets and other cosmetics. Everything that is not cosmetic, you can obtain from playing the game. + Free content - The game is constaly updated with new content - Weapons, Warframes, maps and game modes. + Events - There a multiple events in this game from which you can experience alternating goals + Weapon Modifications - Modify the damage, fire rate, add elemental type damage, reload speed, recoil control, appearance/color etc... + Warframe modifications - Run speed, health, shield, maximum energy, ability damage, ability radius/reach, appearance/color + Up to 4 Player online Mulitplayer - cooperative or deathmatch arena. + Bosses - Tiny to huge, deadly and tactical. These bosses know how to get under your skin. When you beat them, you'll find good rewards. + Voice chat (Optional) - Don't stop to type in deadly situations that require coordination, just talk using a microphone. Alternatively you can use the voice chat to chill, have some beers and talk about nonesense. + Large player base - Never feel alone in your region, there's always some people online that want to do what you want to do. Most of the players are also nice and they don't undermine anyone because of the shared common goals. - Repetition - Sometimes it will get too repetitive, so have another game you alternate between. - New HUD - Feels weird to some, may take time to get used to.

Really the only moment you'll buy something is probably for a cosmetic or to rush your currently crafting items. In Warframe you play as a Tenno warrior, with the suit called a Warframe which has epic powers depending on which frame you have. There's a lot of variety between the frames, and many different primary, secondary and melee weapons to choose from. These primary, seconday and melee weapons you can find and craft from the market so long as you have the required recources. Warframes you can also buy from the market but you will need both recources and parts for the warframe, now onto other weapons and warframes. Clan weapons and warframes, they can only be found in a Clan Dojo and you must craft it in clan first then craft it at your foundry and a forma is needed for this. These weapons are significantly more powerful than the weapons found in the market. Community: helpful, nice Tenno friends, who will likely help you in a mission. You can also join players already in the middle of a mission and complete it along with them, the only con with this is that some players may kill faster than you. Mastery Rank: From what I've noticed, ranking up your mastery rank will always have positive sides, access to stronger weapons on the market, othe rplayers lower level than you may feel better that you're there along side them to help. Ranking up is easy, all you need to do is rank up your new weapons/frames to rank 30 and repeat with new weapons. (But keep your high level weps for those high level missions) Potatoes: There are 3 different potatoes, Orokin Cells, Catalyst and Reactor, Cells allow you to build weapons and warframes that require cells, catalyst adds an extra 30 rank on your weapon of choice (make sure your wep is already level 30 for it to be bumped up to 60) and reactor adds another 30 to your warframe (again, amke sure your frame is already at rank 30.) Mods: No, not the mods you new players are thinking! Mods are for your weapons/warframe/sentinel/kubrow. Mods are used to make your weapons, warframe or companions stronger, you can find mods in any mission you do, just be sure you know what you're doing with what mods you have. and finally, companions!: Sentinels, little flying robots with guns, or robots that can help you pick up recources or mods. Kubrows, dog-like space things, although weaker than sentinels, they're cute as hell and make a good Liset pet! You can mod these lil guys and the sentinels, there are many different kind of kubrows, stealth kubrows, attack kubrows, recource kubrows etc. For better info visit the Warframe wiki!

review: My computer has cancer. it cannot run this game because there is a rule about the game that says those who have cancer cannot play warframe. It was not my fault. I downloaded free RAM to increase my computer's sexual performance and it stopped working. I eventually deleted system 31 and it began to work.

review: This story requires a bit of setup. Last year, a friend of mine whom I'd known from gaming for a long time contacted me and told me about this great new game that was in beta that he was backing as a founder (called a "Grandmaster" in-game) called Warframe. A third person cooperative shooter with elements of Phantasy Star Online/Diablo loot runs, procedurally generated levels, and more content being added all the time. The game was difficult to start, as there are many keys for various secret parkour maneuvers. Running along walls! Sliding down ziplines! Soon, I was completely hooked; my friend and I were playing late into the night, trying to grind out just one more piece necessary to build a new component or weapon, or trying to beat our best time on the Survival missions -- where you fend off an ever growing wave of foes as life support ticks down. Over the year, there were many great victories, hair raising last second escapes, and new friends joining our little group. Many hours were spent joking around with each other on Skype, cracking jokes, blasting weird songs at each other, and coming up with our own stupid little catchphrases. Flash forward a year; Warframe now has space combat, new Warframes, new weapons, and new combat controls. The game still has its original style, but it's so much improved. Last week, our four player regular team developed some incredible strategies that let us get further than we ever had on wave defense missions. The only thing that made us stop was getting tired. On Tuesday, my friend who invited me to the game a year ago didn't show up that night. I found out on Wednesday that he had passed away suddenly from an undiagnosed health condition. The shock of it is still hitting us hard. The friendships that we had formed through the game, gone in an instant. It hardly feels real. I keep expecting him to log in and be there, ready to do another defense mission, and it's difficult to accept that we'll be going it alone now. We contacted Digital Extremes, the company that makes the game, and asked if there was anything we could do. They dedicated their 11/20/2014 episode of their webcast to the memory of our friend and read our memorials to him on the air. Their reactions were heartfelt and touching. They really do listen to and react to the community. I not only recommend the game for how much fun it is (I recommend you play it with a group of friends on voice chat -- up to four per session; your gameplay experience may vary alone, and form a clan or join one just because many items are clan-only), I recommend it for how responsive the game developers are to the community. They constantly improve it and add new content, items, and weapons. There is a storyline that is unfolding. The voice acting is delightful. You could easily play this game without spending a single dollar of real world currency on it (real world currency is used for cosmetics and increasing the number of Warframes and weapons you can own, or buying things that you can't wait for). Thanks, Digital Extremes. And rest in peace, Woxit.

review: How to ruin your life: 1) Download Warframe 2) Learn how to press buttons on your keyboard to play Warframe 3) Grind for hundreds and thousands of hours for that one thing that looks really cool. 4) Congratulations, you now have no life. This method is tried-and-true, I have even tested it on myself; that's how sure I was that it would work. Edit: A few people are adding me for help on WF. Feel free to add me if you wish, and I'll try my best to accept and answer any questions you may have, but just know I may not have time to play more than a few rounds with you :c Sorry.

review: | Update (24/4/14): It has been a fairly significant chunk of time since I wrote this review of Warframe, and some elements of the game have been expanded upon in ways that alleviate some of the issues I originally had. The premium currency, platinum, can now be traded between players. This provides an option for players who do not wish to put money into the game but want to participate in using the storefront. Users in the comments have pointed out that there are many powerful items which are not available in the store - if you want them, you'll need to grind. Multiple new game modes exist, including "Invasion", a mode which allows players to team up together with the Corpus or the Grineer to work against the opposing faction. This mode gives the player some agency in the kinds of rewards he receives for completing the mission. The latest update introduced Melee 2.0, which delivered improvements to the game's melee combat. The most interesting update comes in the form of Dark Sectors. Clans and alliances can own parts of the Solar System, and can fight for that contested ownership. Clans and Alliances can also set tax and resource requirements on anyone who accesses their conquered territories, leading to territorial battles for supremacy. In conclusion, a decent amount of content has been added to the game. While the core argument of my review holds true, Warframe is finally approaching the level of depth required to elevate itself above a mere grinding game. The new "EVE Online"-esque sector mechanics are particularly promising in that regard. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | Original Review (25/11/13) A great-looking, initially interesting game that feels like one compelling part of what should be a greater whole. Warframe is an interesting entry in the free to play space. It has the looks and the gameplay, but after a while it begins to feel lacking in the way of substance. Gameplay largely involves clearing your way through various missions types as you progress in rank, leveling up your weapons and your Warframe (the game's metaphor for various Classes, each having their own unique abilities, advantages, disadvantages and so on) as you shoot a myriad of alien Grineer, infested hordes, and Corpus robots. Missions range from rescue scenarios where a hostage must be located and escorted to safety, to mobile defense missions where waves of increasingly difficult enemies must be held off as you protect a moving objective. These can all be completed solo, but are made more interesting by grouping up with other players. Higher level missions are tricky by yourself, making teaming up the more attractive proposition. Weapons and Warframes can be augmented with various modifcations that apply the standard Action RPG fare - elemental damage bonuses, increased critical hit damage, faster reload speeds, you name it. This allows for some diversity in gameplay between players, where you may opt to build out your Warframe in a more supportive role, or stock up on mods which provide a more tanky character. So far the game has been well supported with semi-regular content updates and special events, usually in the form of new warframes and weapons, and a "community effort" in which everyone can participate. The only "issue" is that the game is a bit of a grind. In fact, it's a complete grinding game. The main reason for going on missions is in the hopes of accumulating various materials with which to craft the new warframes or weapons. You can use the games "premium" currency to expedite the process of manufacturing said items (which take hours, days of real time to craft) or simply buy them outright from a storefront. Why do you want these new weapons and warframes? To grind more efficiently for materials. This might strike you as a monotonous loop, and to an extent it is, but the joy of the gameplay itself goes a way to allievating the game from being a total bore. Inevitably though you may become tired of the treadmill. The game sometimes feels like it is skirting the boundaries of being gross about its "free to play" nature - you can certainly get almost everything in the game without spending if you're willing to commit to the grind, but it can sometimes feel like game systems are designed to encourage you to give up and bring out your wallet - namely the sheer amount of materials required to craft better equipment, and the time spent waiting for these items to actually be built. It's always questionable when a F2P game includes a long timer alongside a button to make it go away for just a few pounds. Ultimately, if you're just looking for a good looking, nice playing third person shooter with online components and a decent aesthetic, you can do far worse than Warframe. After spending some time with it, however, you might wind up wishing there was a little more to the experience beyond what is currently available.

review: Before you read into this review, let me ask you one question. Do you think fun is the most important thing in any game? If you answered yes, stick around and keep reading. If you answered no, you probably wouldn't like Warframe. Warframe gets a lot of flak for being repetative, but I personally feel that the reviewers who complain about the gameplay being repetative are failing to see the bigger picture. Warframe is not about a deep, gripping narrartive or memorable characters, it's about action, fun, and pretty crazy weapon variety. And to top it all off, everything that impacts gameplay can be obtained for free. Warframe is a very specialized game, focused on action, flare, and fun. And boy oh boy does Warframe nail action and fun. With over a dozen unique Warframes(Powersuits used by the player, each with their own unique abilities and stats) to choose from you're sure to find one that you really enjoy playing as. And then there's the weapons. Oh boy, the weapons. This game has almost every kind of Sci-Fi weapon I can think of. We have small scale particle cannons, Beefy sniper rifles, plasma casters, living weapons that shoot everything from Electricity to streams of deadly viruses, an insanely powerful rocket launcher, a Grenade launcher with remote detonation, powerful bows, a gun that shoots spinning saw blades, and of course the obligatory pew-pew assualt rifles to ease new players into the experience. Oh, but that's just the Primaries. In every mission, you will have the option to carry a Primary, a Secondary, and a Melee but you can choose to carry only 1 or 2 if you please. The Secondaries include but are not limited to: Living weapons that shoot Corrosive darts and poison gas, a goo gun that shoots sticky globs of acid that eat right through armor, 2 deadly hand cannons, one of which shoots many metal balls in a shotgun spread while the other shoots a spread of radiation blasts, Miniature plasma casters, rapid fire dual pistols, a spread-rocket launcher that they somehow compressed into the size of a pistol, a pistol that shoots bolts that can pin enemies to walls, deadly and accurate burst fire pistols, pocket snipers, Revolvers, a Lever action beast, Throwing knives, Throwing stars, and a Standard semi-auto pistol to ease new players in. And then there's my favorite weapon class, the Melee. We've got Greatswords that can hit numerous enemies in a wide arc, more conservative longswords that swing fast and allow better mobility while attacking, Dual daggers which generate an incredibly fast flurry of slashes and stabs, whips for when you want the range of a greatsword but the mobility of a longsword, there's also the polearms, Heavy axes, Heavy hammers, ROCKET HAMMER, and even the Thrown melee weapons, useful for killing at a distance while conserving ammo and for stealth kills. More recently Digital Extremes added in 2 Katanas and a set of claws that pop out of your arms like Wolverine. Melee has become much more prominent lately now that DE has completely revamped it. No longer do you simply mash or hold E, now you can perform different combos that require different inputs. These combos are assigned to stance mods that you can apply to your weapon. Each melee weapon class I mentioned above has at least 1 stance mod, and each mod comes with it's own unique combos that are useful for different purposes and situations. My favorites are the Katanas with Decisive Judgement as the stance. I use it to make my tenno look and fight like Vergil from Devil May Cry 3. So yes, Warframe can seem repetative to some people, but not to me. I greatly enjoy the vast arsenal that is placed before me, and I truly believe that these tools of destruction make up for the lack of deep narrative. That said, I thoroughly recommend Warframe to anyone who likes Shooters or character action games, or anyone who likes having fun.

review: Great Game. Worth putting the time and effort into. the game gives a different atmosphere of gameplay, something that you will want more and more of. theres alot of stuff to do ingame. you have Dojo's (clans) which u can customise fully however you like. you also have a handfull of great weapons to choose from and customize at will. theres a great community backing the game too. also the developers at warframe are very good, they are very helpful for whenever you need them e.g. technical issues and wateva else. They bring great content to the game every so month or season like xmas, easter and so on. while on a certain mission, its great just to take your time and look around the map, the way they design the map and have all different secret areas for you to xplore and discover is just awsome. Only down side i have had with the game would be just the lagg, some games i join might have cr*ppy internet, so it pretty much makes the mission impossible to do cause, sometimes you will not see the enemies around you or doors will not open for you but for others it will. but those are just minor things. everything else... is just awesome! plus.. you become a space ninja what more could you ask for!? :D

review: One of the best Free to play MMORPG's I've ever played. The game is not pay to win, all warframes and weapons can be crafted except excalibur prime as this is for founders only. Even if you don't play for a while you can still go back to the game and play with friends who may be a different level. The game requires alot of time and effort (Grind). Regardless this doesn't really matter as it is very fun with friends and solo, solo just providing more of a challenge!

review: Warframe is not without its shortcomings with regards to skill-gap, balance and friendliness to novice players, but it's also hugely entertaining. DE have absolutely nailed that 'just one more mission' loop. When you find a group of players who work as a team, or just a friendly player to partner up with for story missions, it can be absolutely thrilling. Survival missions where each team-member works to help others while fending off wave after wave of enemies is a total rush. When you pull off some impossible feat of sword/gun-based acrobatics, it is gratifying like few other games. On the other hand, there is a considerable skill-gap. Get beyond the initial public missions, and you will often find people playing the game at a level of skill and speed that renders novice players little more than a burden. There are also a baffling amount of systems and upgrade trees to navigate. Upgrades have upgrades. There's definitely a part of me that likes the fact that in a lot of ways it's very unabashedly hardcore, but I would certainly caution new players that it requires a level of dedication they might not be willing to give. But, if you like the sound of space-ninjas pulling off improbable feats of death acrobatics against hordes of enemies that look like they were the product of Tsutomu Nihei's fever dreams, and you're prepared to put in the hours to learn how to master the game's myriad systems, then I totally recommend you pick this up and spend a few bucks in the store. Addendum for those worried about the F2P aspect: Spending a bit of money will save you a lot of pain and grind, but you can absolutely play this game and have a thoroughly good time without spending a penny. It is NOT a pay-to-win scenario.

review: As a beta game or free-to-play, i would say its great overall. Bugs and glitches should be expected throught your gameplay experience and they are not hitting on players too hard though. Therefore, its not overall so bad for the bugs part. If you are like me, you will always find the bugs funny. For the gameplay experience, its a werid action game because it combines typical third person shooting games actions with magic power (especially after the upcoming update for the Parkour2.0 system). Although there is some tank type character, you still need to play the same mission over and over again aka farming, to gain rare mods or rare items to build your ultimate weapons. It is similar to how you keep pickaxing and shoveling in Minecraft just to build a dream house. And if you do not play minecraft, it will be just like how you get gold and diamond skins for your guns in COD. Of course you can pay a lot to purchase items from other players or the prime access. Another important thing is to join a clan or find some pal to play with. It is a co-op game. You may go solo but it would be too hard to level up because bonus experience points can be gained through playing with other players. Remember to pay attention to the abilities of every warframe because every character aka warframe has his/her special abilities, like Nekros's desecrate can increase drop rates. Some of the warframes may not need heavy protection too if you have built it right, like Limbo, playing intelligently will not casuse you any damage at all. Gaming experience is great but the problem is warframe should start working on creating some exclusive things for players who had hunted a lot of things. Many new players are just buying every stuff to make themselves fit in the high level or veteran(?) players community. This is kind of annoying though they are the people who are supporting the game in a financial way. And also there should be more competitive gameplay added to this game. Maybe a clan war? This can make the game more fun but I suppose this cannot be done by looking at the engine and server for now. This one will only for the new players. The missions and tutorial can be quite confusing. It is totally not a good time to start off playing this game right now as there are bunches of new things added to this game. Just remember, do not rely on your primary weapon too much. Check and try out all your abilities, every weapon you can obtain. Find your favorite set up and play. This is my opinion. It may not mean a lot but this is the comment I have on this game after playing for a year. Happy hunting tenno.

review: One of the only shooters I like, because the RPG elements are reasonably compelling. Some menu items are mouse only, but otherwise you can play with a gamepad. Just pray to the gods of RNG with Warframe. It can take a LOT of grinding to get what you want, since it's typically not a steady stream of predictable rewards, but rather a completely random chance of getting a reward based on the roll of the dice. Cash shop isn't too intrusive. You can play without paying easily, though if you don't want to look ugly or have barely any inventory space, you'll want to cough up 5 or 10 USD for some color palletes and inventory spaces.

review: Note: My Review Has Been Edited: Warframe is a co-op kind of game that is more fun to play with friends than playing alone. The game can drag out if you are trying to get materials to build that next Warframe or weapon or expand your dojo if you are gathering materials, completing missions, or just down right killing things if you do it solo. Don't get me wrong, this game can be played solo and some people like myself don't mind soloing- but the experience is improved tenfold when you are playing with friends or even other strangers online. Warframe takes place in the future within our own solar system and beyond. You are a Tenno, an ancient warrior who uses the suit of the Warframes to restore peace and balance to our solar system- which has errupted in chaos. The Tenno are a master of all weapons including boomerangs, blades, long swords, daggers, scythes, heavy weapons, bows, and all sorts of guns. To add onto the fast-paste action Warframe will provide, the Tenno are defined as "space-ninjas" since they have the agility of one. Tenno can wall climb, run on walls, and posses unique skills to help you navigate the levels of the game along with feeling a sense of accomplishment as you slice through hordes of enemies. As I stated earlier, you can play alone, with friends, or with strangers. The game is defaulted to have you play with other strangers- which will equal a squad of four with each mission you go through. Your squad will be tasked with a series of missions such as Survival, Extermination, Capturing, Hostages, and so on. You can adjust the settings to where you can play either with friends only or play on your own however. The first few planets such as Earth and Mercury can be easy to navigate solo- but the higher up levels such as The Void, Phobos, and so forth are highly recommended you go in with a squad of three other players who are also experienced within the game. No matter which mission you pick and what level you choose or who you play with, Warframe will provide a fast experience and you will have to adapt quickly in order to survive a mission. An example would include this: I was aboard a Corpus cruise shuttle in space and I accidentally missed my shot at one of the enemies and hit a window- in turn it shattered and the air in that room was being sucked out and I was losing health rather quickly. I had to quickly dispatch the majority of enemies in the room and then I had to hack the nearest computer I could find. As soon as I was done hacking the computer, the safety locks for the windows kicked in and air was restored to the room- keeping me alive. This game is free to play and I would personally recommend that you give it a try. The worst that can happen is you don't like the game, and you can uninstall it- it doesn't cost you anything. But with that said, you will get a sense of a Pay To Win environment in this game. You see, you can start out with three Warframes to pick from: Loki, Mag, or Excalibur. You then get a small selection of weapons to choose from. But if you ever want to get any other Warframes or weapons than what you had to pick from, there are two ways to go about it: 1) Buying the blueprints with in-game cash called Credits and then having to gather the materials needed to build that weapon or Warframe. (NOTE: Weapons can be super easy to find the materials for depending on what weapons you want to build, but Warframes are ridiculously unfair as it can take a very long time to find the rare components to craft them with.) 2) You guessed it, paying real money to get "Platinum" which is the fastest solution to earning practically everything in this game. You can buy booster packs, coloring options for your Warframes/weapons/ship, weapons and Warframes sooner, skins, and so forth using Platinum... some things are exclusive to Platinum only such as the Booster Packs and Coloring Palletes- meaning there is no way to earn these items without spending any real-world cash on. I understand that that can be rather frustrating as gamers, but as a Free To Play game- the developers need to earn money somehow. They do offer "Login Rewards" which you can obtain by logging in once a day. One of the many rewards you can earn from the login reward is a 25%, 50%, or even 75% discount on Platinum for 24-48 hours. While Warframe can feel like a Pay To Win environment at times, at least they are willing to discount their real-world currency for those who want Platinum- but don't want to spend an obsurd amount on it. Plus the majority of things such as the Warframes and Weapons can be obtained for free- they just take much longer. I have spent many hours in Warframe and it does have it's bugs that are still being worked out, but my experience in the game has been a great one all around. I would recommend that you play with a friend- but the experience is still amazing if you are playing alone or with strangers. They offer many social features such as a Clan for you to join- and you can have a clan dojo to go along with it. The playerbase is very much alive and there is always players online no matter what time of day you are on. But when in missions, the game provides fast-past action and at times you really need to think fast in order to survive the outcome. The game still has major updates and they keep adding something new every few months. One of my personal newer favorite updates they have added is the Archwing. When you become a Level 2 initiate, you can quest to build your very own Archwing. What the Archwing is is an device that allows you to explore the vastness of space- flying around in freedom. Once you obtain your first Archwing and go out into space for the first time, you will notice that the flight controls are fantastic. I don't think I have ever played a game with such well-built flight controls as what Warframe provides for the Archwing levels. Space combat has never been funner! Because of major updates such as the Archwing, I look forward to future updates knowing that there will be more coming in the near future. Warframe will be one of those games that will stay alive for years to come- it has the playerbase and it has the developers to stay going. Despite the times of feeling Pay To Win- I would recommend that you give the game a try and see if you like it. There are different ways for you to play whether you want to go into missions full on stealth or go in with guns blazing. It is a free download- why not give it a try and see how you like it?

review: Do you like ideas that sound good when they're announced but when they're released it's half-baked and forgotten in a week? Do you like grinding through grindwalls for more grind? Do you like having your weapons nerfed just to have that same weapon power creeped in the cash shop by something new a week later? Do you like having diluted drop tables? Do you like knowing the devs were bought by Perfect World so this is only going to get worse over time? Warbros #1

review: I have played longer and I'm in master lvl 10 but my steam profile says that i have only played like 81 hours. I recommend Warframe but it has two problems, 1. Breaking the noob barier, meaning that the first 4 mastery lvls are the hardest and kinda the most boring ones, however once you're through that and have some good stuff it'll be a blast. 2. Paying users and non-paying users: If you pay nothing your warframe and stuff will never look that good and it'll ruin the expirence for you, meanwhile your teammates (paying users) will have special armour and well coustumized colours and skins. With the armours, colours and skins and stuff you'll enjoy playing the game much more. But overall it's a good game and you can get stuff at events and more and you can also sell stuff on trading and meaby buy some stuff for the money you make there. :) I'm very sorry if i made any spelling mistakes.

review: I am incredilbly impressed with this and amazed that it's free. Not only is it super fun but it looks wonderful graphics wise, even at minimum settings. The style and game play remind me of something like Mass Effect smacking into Metal Gear, sword slashing and high tech pistols in space. My only concern is the controls; I'm not sure if it explains further in later tutorials, but it's pretty slow in evaluating in all of the controls and buttons. However it's a non-existant problem and doesn't affect the game play.

review: I am over 700 hours into this game and I have been playing for over a year and a half at the time of this review, and I have been a clan leader, there are things that DE does well in this game and things they do horribly. Cons -FARMING This game is a massive grind, with grind goals. So if you don't like grinding that is a huge wall you need to get over. -LEARNING CURVE Lots of new things to learn on top of over a hundred weapon names, planets and specific missions, as well as the factions, movement tricks, and different game features.The amount is overwhelming for a new player. -RNG is a living nightmare and hard to deal with sometimes. DE is slowly but surely coming up with new ways to fix RNG, like giving automatic frame blueprints at mission complete, something that could have taken hundreds of hours before. They also started creating quests to make rng easier to handle. -DIFFICULTY AND CHANGES, since the game has gotten bigger I have noticed bosses getting easier. I've also seen some bugs that make some low level missions harder then high level missions, and the opposite happens as well. -EVERY MAJOR UPDATE BREAKS THE GAME in some way, DE is usually good fixing these things up, so long as you are active in the forums with bug reporting -POORLY IMPLEMENTED ENDGAME, DE has been working on different endgame game modes but they feel rushed and not polished as of right now. -GAME DRAIN you need to either take breaks from this game from time to time or casual through content, there is lots of content, but the joy of playing goes away if you play too much IMO. -RUSHED CONTENT you notice it more when you play newer features such as the kubrow, Frames on release if they are on time contraint, at some point weekly weapons were all boring or useless. -SPACE IS LONELY this isn't really a con or a pro but the game is much more fun with friends or clanmates. ***PROS******* -FUN!!!! once you get your hands on a unique weapon and get a hang of controlling your frames the game ramps up the fun -ARCHWINGS one of my personal favourite recent addition to the game though the game mode needs LOTS of love before it reaches its full potential it is one of my personal favourite things about it. -NINJA EXOSUITS AKA WARFRAMES they are for the most part well done, powers and balancing can use rebalancing sometimes, but each frame feels unique. You can summon tentacles, become ethreal, molt your skin, become invisible, create mirror clones of yourself, create singularties, mind control,and fly off the tileset into nothingness. -GRAPHICS Great looking world if you do take some time out to smell the roses you will notice how much detail was actually put into each scenario.Tilesets come out around every major update and they always add a new level of detail to the world -STORYLINE I'd say the storyline is not amazing but it does give a good guideline of what is availible to you in the world -ARESENAL over a hundred gorgeous weapons to choose from ranging from historic(katanas, greatswords, bows, kunai) standard(smgs,rifles,handguns,knives) to Sci-fi(lazers,lazer swords, plasma) and some of the weapons feel unique to the game(flak canon shotgun, blade boomering thing, tentacle lazer gun). -GET INGAME CURRENCY FOR FREE Platinum which is the ingame real money currency can be traded for. Overall I give this game a 9.4/10 it's still in "beta" so hopefully there is more detail once it's released.

review: This game is a whole lot of fun, but it can get a bit repetative at times, so I recommend playing this with friends. This game is team based, and it does a great job at rewarding team based play. I've played a long time in this game, and I absolutely love it. What's better is that with every major update, it get's more and more content, to farm for! :P Great job, Digital Extremes. You guys really outdid yourselves.

review: It's a grinding game in essence with a somewhat bland storyline. Much like a lot of mmorpgs or online free-to-play games.

New patches are released almost weekly with and major updates are monthly or bimonthly.

review: BEWARE that once you start playing you'll get hooked. Every Warframe has it's own unique abilities and powers. New content is always being added and which is why this game never gets boring, keep in mind that crafting weapons could take a long time if you don't want to spend money on purchasing platnium. For tougher missions its always best to have other friends help you out but overall its a great game.

review: its ok
game-hours: 727.4
review: The game is a co-op third person shooter, but please do not let that turn you away. There is a very good reason for this. You would probably puke your guts out otherwise. The game at times is very fast paced and involves flying through the air, climbing up walls, running on walls, jumping (sometimes to great heights), sliding, spinning around and doing flips. Had you done this in first person, not only would this not look as cool, but you would probably not get too far before losing your lunch. The best way I can describe it is you are a highly mobile space ninja/spellcaster/mercenary that can master a plethora of weapons and abilities to complete any mission given to you. Whether you are eliminating enemies from an area, hacking computers, defending a point, carrying out an assassination, capturing a VIP, or some other mission. Although the game is a shooter, the game lets you be adventurous. The maps for each mission are large and have several randomly chosen tile sets. As I said before you can climb up walls and often times find alternate routes that may allow you to find hidden goodies or a stealthier route around a group of enemies. You can sneak around and be stealthy, or rush in guns blazing. You also can choose to play solo, with friends, or with randoms. Warframe also allows for an unbelievable amount of customization to your spaceship, warframes, weapons, and companions. There are many cosmetic items you can use to add to your warframe or switch out parts such as the helmets to get the look you want. You can also change the coloring of your gear. You start with a small variety of colors, but you can buy more color pallets if you wish. Then there are mods. Mods give your equipment different perks. For example, some mods may decrease reload time, others may increase damage or your shields. There are separate mods for your warframe, weapons, and companions. The mod system gives you more control over how you play and fine tune your gear to make it more powerful. There are literally hundreds of mods in this game to choose from. There are also plenty of primary, secondary, and melee weapons to choose from. Each weapon has its own damage spread for different types of physical and elemental damage they do. Some types of damages are better against different types of enemies. The Good 1.Sounds  Although its space and sound should not be as well pronounced as it is in the game, the sounds in my opinion are great. 2.Customization  As I said, there is plenty of it. 3.New Content  New content for this game comes out every month so there is always something worth looking at. 4.Events  There are many events that pop up in the game as well as in the forums. You can enter a contest to win platinum (cash shop currency) or do the in game alerts for rare items and special challenges such as Tactical Alerts. 5.Not Pay To Win  This game is absolutely NOT pay to win. It is pay to get cosmetics or to skip grinding or waiting for some things. Many players trade in game items for plat so you can get cash shop items without spending a dime if youre a wheeler and dealer. You can also gift items too! 6.Clan Doujo - Clan doujos (your clans private base) give you access to items you cannot get in the normal market and give you a place to trade items and parkour courses you can run through. Also, the doujos just look flipin sweet! You can also get an observatory which looks beautiful as well. 7.Exp Rate  I honestly thing the exp gain rate is not bad. Yes, if you are formaing a weapon for end game it takes a while depending on what you do, but it is not really all that bad. You do not need to dedicate months to this game to get somewhere. 8.Solo/Multiplayer  You can play by yourself, with friends, or with random players if you want. You can control this in your options. 9.Content - There is a lot of different types of missions and modes you can play. 10.Playerbase  There is always a lot of players online. Even in off hours. 11.PVP Mode  There is a PVP mode that they recently revamped 12.Story and Lore  There is a lot of lore involving this game that helps explain why the solar system is the way that it is. There are also side story quests you can do after completing the main story quest line. 13.Syndicates  Syndicates are factions in the game. There are perks for joining them such as access to items you cannot get anywhere else. It also adds another mechanic in that enemy factions will send squads to attack you randomly, which adds to the tension and the danger of the world. 14.Archwings  It can be fun flying around in space. Do a barrel roll! The Bad 1.Glitches  Easily the number one issue with this game. This game has more glitches than any game I have ever played in my life, and that is saying a lot. 2.Constant Patching  An hour or two (if even) after new content is released a hotpatch is released to fix what they broke. Then there are consecutive hotpatches to fix what was fixed. Each hotfix requires you exit the game and relaunch. This kind of sucks if youre about to do something and getting your party organized. 3.Trading  You cannot trade until you reach mastery rank 4 and then you are limited in how many times you can trade daily. You also need a doujo to trade. 4.Obtaining Cosmetics and Colors  Most color pallets are obtained by spending platinum. The same goes for most of the cosmetics. 5.Kubrows  If it dies it likes you less and then you have to pet it to make it not hate you. As it hates you more it does less damage. Oh, you can only pet it three times a day to make it happy. It also degrades over time. This means you need to buy these expensive DNA stabilizers to keep it alive. Every day your Kubrow will lose 10% of its condition gauge which also decreases its total health, which causes it to die more, which causes it to hate you and do less damage. Yes, it comes full circle, ladies and gentlemen. 6.Lack of Archwing Content  There just is not a lot. 7.Lack of Warframe and Weapon Slots  If you want more than two warframes you need to play platinum for additional slots. The same goes for weapon slots. Fortunately, they start you off with some platinum, which you can use to buy slots if you want. Rating If I were to rate it now, I would give it an 8/10. I would probably want to give it a 9/10, but with all the glitches and patching I cant honestly give it a higher rating. I understand DE is not necessarily a huge group and they are good about patching things up, but gameplay is still gameplay, and that is what I am rating. It is also hard to rate Warframe due to the fact the game is not complete. New content is added monthly and it is still in beta. For now I feel 8/10 is quite fair. I also would like to note, I am not big into buying game currency in games. I am on a budget and I do not normally feel games deserve my hard earned cash. However, I did not mind giving them some of my money because I love the game, I want it to keep going, and I feel like that later on down the road there will be something to show for it. Recommendation Which leave one last question. Would I recommend this game? Yes, I would. This game has elements that would attract FPS and TPS players as well as people who like MMOs/RPG players and possibly anyone else. Even if you do not normally like shooters you may love this game. For example, I have a buddy that hates shooters, but loves the Elder Scrolls games and Guild Wars 2. I got him playing this and now he is on it every day. Even if you do not like guns, you can still hack and slash your foes apart. You also do not have to be hardcore about the game to get anywhere. If you have questions feel free to ask me in here or add me on Steam or in game (AgentIce). It was longer but character limitations. Thank you for reading!

review: There is a saying "It saves time and money". Well, this game doesn't save your money or your time! Warframe might be a free game with a stunning graphics and huge potentials, but the problem is the game wants you to either pay for everything from Warframe to speed up process and that causes an arm and a leg (through in-app-purchases) or you could simply wait from an average waiting time (1 day) and the slot idea that sacrifices most of the things you've gathered if you don't pay for the extra slot you loss the loot. The game crashes most of the time if not all the time. The community are annoying and the game sometime force you to play with other players you don't want to play with them. On the other hand, the game is very enjoyable from stealth missions to tower defense. The mods are a great idea! Where you gather and combine your loots. It's a very sophisticated intelligent game, but with greedy publishers. They have the right to put the price for their products and we have the right to buy the product or not. From my opinion, I dont recommend this game, due to the latter reasons.

review: The general gameplay and experience was fun... while it lasted. The whole game gets tedious and players can easily buy their way to success, but that takes most of the challenge away. I've lost interest in this game, and so have many of the people that I personally know who played this game. My clan is dead and many more have gone quiet. Generally, Warframe now has a lackluster feel for me. I got used to the grinding, but DE just added more, and then buffed the grinding with little annoying paywalls  that honestly generate more challenge. Unfortunately, they nerfed across the board, so it became more difficult for non-paying players to effectively play. I can't imagine this game having any longevity. Im serious. I used to love the  out of this game, but now its just complete crap. As little money as I did spend on it (after 300+ hours of play) I feel cheated. Longtime players, founders, and vets alike have been leaving and/or disapproving of the game's recent turn of events. Discontent is all over the forums. DE has become heedlessly distant from their fan base and gamming community. I implore you to seriously consider NOT downloading this game.

review: I generally don't like shooters and oftentimes this type of game gives me motion sickness. However, I'm having a lot of fun with this game and it doesn't make me feel ill. Also, it's third person, rather than first person, so that helps. There are quite a few classes to choose from, though you do have to hunt down your parts to make them. But that's half the fun! Pretty much, anything in the cash shop, you could just as well hunt for it. Cash shop is more of a convenience and not really necessary except to unlock slots if you want more warframes.

review: Warframe is a free to play, fast-paced, third person shooter that can be best described as space ninjas. Developed by Digital Extremes, Warframe follows the adventures of the Tenno during a war with the Grineer, a race of militarized humanoid clones. Tenno soldiers bear a Warframe  effectively, a futuristic and alien combat suit  into battle, as well as a primary weapon, a sidearm, and a melee weapon. The game is, essentially, a sequel to Dark Sector, taking place about a thousand years after its events. Its a game built on two very solid features: exciting gameplay and awesome gear. At its heart, Warframe is all about the action. Combat is intense, and blazingly fast. The Tenno can sprint, slide, and dodge out of hairy situations, as well as being able to run along walls and displaying quite a fair collection of parkour motions. Players can sneak around a map and melee an enemy from behind for elevated damage, but its nowhere near as fun or as easy as running into a crowded room, guns a blazing. Theres a much heavier focus on staying agile in a gunfight rather than being sneaky. Each warframe has its own set of unique abilities and stats, giving each one a diverse feel from the other. A wide array of weapon types keeps the combat fresh and gives the player a multitude of ways to play. Guns feel impactful, but melee weapons tend to feel a bit floaty. With an astounding amount of different enemy types and bosses, levels can produce a variety of challenges. Theres even a one-on-one PvP feature in which players can duke it out. These are called conclaves and are limited by a point scale to keep players of relatively equal skill fighting against each other. While it is nice to see a human player react with unpredictability, a lot of the AI in the game is very predictable in its actions. Theyre still difficult, but it takes away from any sort of surprise if youve already squared off against that enemy before. Also, it is highly recommended that you play this game with friends and a common goal in mind. It can get stale quickly without those two things. Despite that, theres still an immense amount of fun to be had in Warframes fast-paced shooter action. Warframe is visually stunning. And I dont mean just for a free to play game; this game is gorgeous for any type of game. Theres a great attention to detail. Lighting effects are cinematic. Environments are vibrant with color. However, youll see many of the same settings over and over again. While they are pretty to look at, seeing what seems to be the same map several missions in a row gets very tiring. The slight blur that is created from constant movement will distract from any minor visual flaws  flaws that youll have a hard time finding to begin with. This is actually one of the few games in which Ive fired my weapon solely for the purpose of hearing how it sounds. The guns sound incredibly real and impactful. And even though each gun has its own distinct sound, most of them manage to sound pretty good. It certainly outdoes the gun sounds that are apparent in more successful shooters like Call of Duty. Warframe is just full to the brim with varying types of gear. Warframes, essentially character types, are plentiful and number well into the double digits. Each player has three weapons: a primary, a sidearm, and a melee weapon. There are a multitude of primary weapons, such as rifles, shotguns, bows, and snipers. Sidearms include full auto and semi-auto pistols. Available melee weapons are swords, staves, axes, and more. These weapons can be bought with platinum  the equivalent of real world money  but are also easily obtainable through the in-game currency known as credits. Weapons must be built by first purchasing their blueprints and then having the items required to build it. Items are scattered as drops throughout the planets, and while theyre entirely useless on their own, they can be used in unison to create some really interesting weapons. However, items have build times. Weapons generally take twelve or twenty-four hours, while warframes take a lengthy seventy-two. This can be a bit bothersome to those without patience, but items can be rushed to completion by spending a certain amount of platinum. This gear can also be modded with a plethora of upgrades depending on how the player see fits, resulting in a huge amount of customization. A single weapon can be made to play several different ways depending on the mods the player has installed on it. This creates an experience that truly is different for every player and item. While most free to play games suffer in terms of story and narrative, Warframe actually does a very successful job at this. Well partially. Its narrative is weak and lacks integration into the gameplay. The average player will just plow through the missions without even realizing theres a plot going on. Most of the plot will be found in the Codex, a menu in which players can read up on the lore. It takes a while to uncover, and quite honestly Ive only scratched the surface, but its chock-full of science-fiction goodness. There are questions of morality and the Tennos purpose in the universe. There are references to Dark Sector, proving that the two games exist within the same universe. Its certainly very interesting and easily dominates in a market where story tends to be an afterthought. Another strong point, one where it stands above its competitors in the free to play market, is the incredibly fair balancing of real world and in-game currencies. Almost anything that can be obtained through the cash shop can be found as loot or created via a blueprint. Most of the items that cant be obtained without spending some cash are purely cosmetic, such as color palettes and weapon skins. However, in a game that is so gear-centric, its a shame to see so few free inventory slots given to the players. Even still, prices are pretty reasonable. Shelling out cash doesnt put players too much ahead of others, and the small gaps that do exist can easily be closed by player ability. Its nice to see a free to play game that doesnt put a huge chasm between its paying and non-paying players, and that certainly is a huge advantage for Warframe in its market. One of the biggest drawbacks of Warframe is its perpetual state of open beta. Things can change from patch to patch, whether they be minor updates or huge ones that drastically overhaul something like the UI. This results in a large amount of bugs. Theyre not common and prevalent in every mission, but youre bound to run into them. Fortunately, they tend to stray far from game-breaking and are usually just minor annoyances. Overall, Warframe is a great addition to any collection as it is able to balance fantastic gameplay, gorgeous visuals, impactful sounds, an interesting story, stellar optimization, and a fair currency system. And its free. Did I mention its free? I would like to see more integration of its impressive lore into the gameplay as well as more free inventory slots, but apart from those setbacks it is a great game that should be given a try by anyone who enjoys some fast-paced action. And the reload wheel (as of Update 12) is pretty awesome.

review: You gotta get this if you remember your childhood well. This has everything a sci-fi fan could want. Parkour, high-tech weapons, mastery, and most importantly, if the game is pay 2 win or not. The only flaw this game has is that it's striking towards pay for convenience. Which is, you can get all the warframes in game and what not, but you can also advance ingame faster by paying money. But don't sweat, probably none of the money that you shell out will not give you an advantage on player vs. player modes whatsoever. This game is striking towards the right direction, highly recommend spending some time with it and see what you like.

You can just spend hours and hours on it, the only downside is many items in game you have to buy with real money which isn't that bad since it is a free game. Over all I would recommend this game and if you have some extra cash lying around I would recommend you put it into Warframe.

review: Warframe is, simply put, a great game. It's continuously updating with new content and that combined with its relaxed yet exciting gameplay will keep you playing for a long time. I personally love every aspect of Warframe, but there are two things that put me off, and I felt I should make people aware of it. For one, the game can get a bit repetitive, more specifically the grinding part. Although it does not do so to the point that it makes the game ridiculous and/or not fun, it still remains a bit of an issue. Second is the presence of the in-game trading, more specifically the ability to trade things for the ingame currency Platinum (which you usually buy with real life money). This function, and how extensively it is being used, might as well change the name of Warframe to WarTrade. However, other than those two things I find this an awesome game, and I definitely reccommend it to other people. It's graphics are definitely appealing, the customer service has been really good, and its gameplay is very addictive, at least to me. Not to mention Warframe is essentially completely free-to-play! You can unlock and play all content by just playing the game. Using money in this game only unlocks purely cosmetic stuff and allows you to get gear and weapons slightly faster. You get 50 free Platinum when creating an account to boot, which I heavily suggest you spend for Warframe/Weapon slots.

review: Ah, Warframe. A game I spent so many countless hours on. This game features 20 factions, 4 of which, you can fight. The first faction that you get to fight are the Grineer. They are steroid pumped soldiers that like to speak like Nolan Batman, with testicular cancer. Next up are the Corpus. They like to stick their phallus into shards of the ancient times (2014). But then, there are the Infested. Zombified creatures of both the Corpus, and the Grineer factions. They rely on eating each other's dried up ejaculation. And the final faction are. You guessed it. Those golden thugs that rob you of your virginity, yep, those Corrupted people. They are a mix of those three factions just mentioned. Except, they take more steroids than a black man playing football. They also murder more animals than those celebrities on crack. The only friendly faction are the Tenno. Once thought to be extinct, they've returned from the dead, laying waste to their foes once again, strking fear into their crotch. Silent and deadly they are. You should avoid them at all cost, like Shrek's Swamp. You never want to go there. It's filled with anorexic chicks who can't stop producing children. "Strike your enemies down. Leave no survivors. Rip off their pubes. Sell it on the black market for crack money, profit, Tenno." - Leona LionhartmansmithifiedlotusangryKFCbucketmaria The 3rd STORY - In the future, where vibrators are a thing in the past. There is a war. Chaos has erupted between the civil and understanding Grinner, and the heartless technophiles that are Corpus. In amidst all this chaos, is you Tenno. You hunt down the people who murdered the black market dealers, preventing you from selling anymore pubes. This story is basically an Assassin's Creed story on steroids, plus cocaine, and some other otherworldly drug. You fight the factions, yet at the same time, you can still manage to wank it (   ). I think the story is good. There are plenty of factions to fight, and the factions actually make sense. For example, the Corpus, actually stick their phalluses into hard drives, and that's how THEIR babies came from. The Grineer also do that. But they don't produce and  OR babies. They only do it for pleasure. You have your typical zombie-like faction which are called the Infested, but there is a catch. They aren't really zombies. They are evolved apes that can think, and feel. The corrupted, are the followers of the Ord Staff, a Satanic ritual device used to summon the ancients. Overall, the story is really good. But there could be room for more improvements. GAMEPLAY - It isn't your typical third-person beat-em up. It is a FIRST-PERSON beat-em up. That's right. I said it. FIRST-PERSON! Crazy right!? The solid hack and slash combat is really fluid and smooth, like a lubed up fatman's arsecheeks. You will unlock different weapons as you progress, like: Grand Theft Auto V, ArmA 4, Garry's Mod, which are all really neat games. You also can unlock different artwork for this game, everytime you cut off someone's pubes. Overall, pretty good gameplay mechanics. MULTIPLAYER - You and 10 teams of players consisting up to 50 people per team, can team up to defeat Lord Nagero, and his Italian Warlords that possess the ability to change your gender, making the mission hard, yet fun at the same, while retaining some of the sexiness. This mode also has certain options you can toggle. BODACIOUS BABES AND SEXY MEN - Decreases mission winning chance to 0%, yet also increases the chance of getting your gender switched by 99%. (RECOMMENDED FOR HARDCORE PLAYERS) SWEET HARMONY - Adds sexual music, instead of badarse fighting music. BACKSTABBER - You're able to kill allies. (RECOMMENDED FOR MLG PLAYERS) MONTAGE TIME! - Adds a weapon for quickscoping. (RECOMMENDED FOR 3 YEAR OLDS) YOU SEE THIS FIST? - You're able to fist friendlies in their deepest darkest hole. *DLC* OVERPOWERED - Kills everyone in the game, except for you. STIFF AS A ROCK BABY - Invulnerable to all incoming damage. TESTOSTERONE FILLED RAGE - Finish the game automatically, only you can gain rewards. The other players are chumps compared to your skill. CONCLUSION - I'd suck that penny up my hole. IS IT WORTH BUYING? - BUY 10/10 PROS - Good Gameplay Really Good Story CONS - Stupid AI Hate Voice Actors Really Bad Story Bland Characters Free To Play (For 50$) Really Bad Gameplay Terrible Dialogue Kermit's FIRST Badarse Suck of Approval (For 10/10s ONLY) (AUTHOR'S NOTE) - I know that I said there were 20 factions, and I only listed 5. Sorry about that, the other 15 factions were banned for being too unbalanced and unworthy of our phallus.

review: I have around 700 legtimate hours played on this game with no regrets or remorse because DE knew how to make a F2P game /good/. However, this game will not even be worth a second worth of anyone's time when Perfect World Enter-taint-ment will sink its talons into this game. I'm not going to write a review about mechanics or gameplay since PWE will probably find a way to make it bland, unoriginal, and a cash grab, making any current statements moot.

review: Warframe...Where to start... First of all, this is the only game I've spent more than 700 hours on in all of my 20 or so steam games. There are many reasons for this, and I shall describe all the pros and cons of this game in this text. PROS: -This is the only TRUE free to play i've seen in my life. EVERYTHING in the game (weapons, characters, cosmetics, etc) is avaiable to f2p players, but requires some grind to compensate. -Cosmetics (colors, shoulder pads, chest pieces, "capes" etc) can only be aquired with platinums (the currency you have to buy with real money), but guess what, you can get platinums for free by trading stuff with other players! You dont have to pay A SINGLE CENT to play this game and get everything, if you have a bit of time to invest in it. -The coop experience is present and intense, a great game to play with friends. -the graphics are good and will run smoothly on any decent computer, and if you don't have a such computer well you can lower the graphics and you probably wont even see the difference exept for the FPS boost! -The game is updated VERY frequently, and gets a huge update every 3 months or so! Digital Extreme is very commited in making Warframe the best F2P shooter out there. -Very developped movement system. You can run on walls and do some epic tricks, you can roll while airborne, you can slide on the ground and so much more...You are a space ninja! -Many Warframes to choose from. All warframes are different, and each one has some cool and unique superpowers and roles/playstyles. One is a slow tank with crowd control. Another can place shields that block bullets. And my favorite one, Zephyr, can even fly! -RANDOM ENCOUNTERS: sometimes you will get messaged by special mini bosses that will try to assasinate you in a near future when you are in a mission. Rumors say they drop epic loot on death, and are particularly deadly... CONS: -As you progress further in the game, lower level missions tend to get way too easy (but they are still enjoyable). The opposite is also true, a low level player trying to take on a level 30+ mission will get wrecked. -At current times, the late game content is somewhat poor, as the only thing left for vets to do is progress through mastery ranks and max out all their gear. But again, the frequent updates keeps the veterans playing as more and more content is added. I also heard rumors about some "lenses of power" that will add some serious late game content for all the accomplished players upon their release. -Enemies are a bit stupid, their AI needs more polishing. But that is far from making this game boring. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- In conclusion, this game is a model for all the F2P out there. It stands on the top of shooter games list, and it's definitely the best F2P steam can offer you! -By Retro050

review: Possibly one of the greatest games I have ever played. This is also the only game on steam which I have over 200 hours of game time. Warframe plays great and feels rewarding. This game is a legend and deserves the respect and support that it has. If you like being the ultamite space death machine, play this game.

review: Addictive, stress-relieving, and only occasionally frustrating. Updates occur regularly, and the developers seem to listen to the community. New content and bug-fixes are released frequently, and ninjas play free. Some content can only be purchased with platinum, but platinum can now be obtained via trading with other players, so the possiblities are limitless! It is based on Dark Sector, and the warrame-weilders are the spiritual descendants of Hayden Tenno (the protagonist of Dark Sector). If the idea of being a futuristic semi-robotic space ninja led by a mysterious (Canadian) female of possible artificially intelligent origins is appealing to you, get ready, Tenno!

review: I've played this game when it was in early beta. At that time, Warframe wasn't really something that's as awesome as it is now. Limited tilesets, limited enemies, repetitive missions and unpolished mechanics here and there. Even I myself have stopped once in a while, usually spanning 4-5 months, only to return because a friend was playing. And almost each time I return, new things are added in. And this currently is my 3rd replay of the game, and I have to say that although Warframe isn't a totally perfect game (there are flaws, bugs, glitches and connection issues running around wild), but the Digital Extremes team has evolved the game to a point where it has become a much more complicated game than what it was a year ago. Yet they are still polishing things, making new overhauls to certain aspects of the game and coming out with new stuffs to greet players old and new. What I love about Warframe is pretty much that almost everything that can be bought using money, can be obtained normally through farming as well. All that the free players loses are cosmetic items that does not affect gameplay (other than the owner's satisfaction and pride). One of the new updates since I've stopped also included into it a new Trading System which allows players to trade certain items for the platinums and other stuffs, which even boasts the game's value. For me, Warframe is simply the no.1 F2P game that I have ever played, and I find myself amazed over and over every time I go back to it. Kudos to Digital Extremes! This is a must play for any gamers interested in some sci-fi shooter action.

review: Shooting stuff, slicing stuff, being ninja n' stuff. If you like to do things like these, this is a game for you. Become an awesome individual who uses special abilities, customized weapons to achieve victory in a variety of game modes; gather resources and frame / weapon components to unlock further more gaming potential. WARNING: Grind fest. If you don't really like working *quite* hard towards what you want, there's always the pay option BUT everything except the cosmetics CAN be aquired through f2p gameplay. So take a look, you might put it down and look around instead, but you'll never know what will hook you in!

review: This is one of my favorite games! The graphics are spectacular, the game quality is superb, and the x factors of all the weapons and AI are awesome and very detailed and thorough. The game its self is outstanding and the campaign and multi player are awesome. Some of it is confusing but really easy to catch on and learn. Once you have a grasp of it, its one of the best games ever. I would suggest this to everyone and when you play it, the game has so much content that you wqant to spend money on the game to get it fast, but if you dont want to you can get everything for free, but it takes longer and its very difficult to find the items you need. 10/10, two thumbs up, 5 stars, whatever other rating system there is all the way up. I like it a lot and it is one of my favorite games, but that being said thats my opinion you should get it and find out for your self, trust me you'll wont regret it.

review: space ninjas boiiiiiii I have started Warframe the day after it was released. The game was in it's first update (Update 7) after Closed Beta. The game looked so awful. After a year and some magic, this game looks great! Sure, some mechanics are funky, there is a vast amount of bugs/exploits/glitches, but just give the game some hope. It's 50 grinding and 50 gameplay. After a few months or so, the game may get boring, but DE, (Digital Extremes) is working on, and adding more content every once and a while. It's quite frequently now-a-days. The community is a great one. You might encounter some pretty rude people, but overall the players are kind and are willing to help everyone. Just visit the official Warframe forums website and look around or so.

review: I'm going to redo my review for this game seeing as its the number one game I play. First and foremost, those who are attempting to start this game for the first time, please DO NOT TRY TO GO SOLO in this game. It is not easy to start off at all going solo. this is why the game is a MMO, make use of having extra players in the party. Another confusion many seem to have is that they think this is just another typical run-of-the-mill shooter. This is not CoD, This is an online game, that virtually is not PVP. You face computer controlled enemies, and in later factions and forms, you can face head to head against people though I do not recommend it. In anycase, getting the basics out of the way. I do not wish to make the game sound significantly hard, however, starting off it maybe. The gameplay feels a little like borderlands 2, with RPG like elements in the game as well, and as many disagree with me, I also say it feels a like like Pokmon, IF YOU ARE A competitive battler. You mod your stats, frames, mods, etc everything in a way, and in reference to Pokmon you IV breed, level, EV train and battle with select moves. But enough on this. Anyway, My overall opinion on this game is biased. Mainly due to the fact that even though this game is a little over a year old, it is STILL a beta, so it really means that anything you do in the game may change with any given patch(particularly, any patch seems to break anything good thats out to make wave for the newer stuff apparently.) I do love playing this game, both alone and with others, It seems to never really get tireding, unless youre trying to become a collector like me and grab everything in the game as well as modding yourself out to perfection because you want to be the best. In all honesty unless you are planning to take things solo you dont have to worry about ranking up to max..anything. The game is very taxing with time, credits and modding. You need mods for every weapon, sentinel, frame etc and there are different mods and some exclusive mods that work with certain frames only. The one interesting and maybe the best thing about this game is you cannot just, BUY your way into this game. Its impossible. You need credits for everything, even if you shove 100$ of your hard earned real money into this game, you cant really get too far with building anything, though, I guess you can buy your way into getting more weaponry, warframes and other goods, though, it wouldnt be nearly as fun to play. Really when it comes down to it, research the weaponry you want, and frame you want, use that as your main tools, because that is all you shall really need in this game, aside from mods too. So whats Zys Rating? 8.6/10 Heres why. The game is stupidly modcrazy, I mean seriously, you cannot write a review on this game because every update makes the game either better, or worse, depending on how you played. Further more the game seems to be really really good for an indie and in the long run it has matured into something massively great. On the downsides, the graphics for the game can be a bane sometimes. Even though they are nice to look at. The mods are expensive and are something you really cant just buy your way into obtaining. Plat is a requirement for this game. Well mainly if you want more weapons and frames. Extremely difficult to start if solo and without friends helping you This game requires you to spend a lot of time developing not only your skills but your mods, frames, weaponry and anything else in the game, and I seriously dont want to get started on dojos >______>

review: My favorite free to play! Controls are awesome, graphics are great, gameplay is fantastic. It's like a combination between Gears of War and Ninja Gaiden, games that form a big part of my gaming childhood (I know, playing GoW at 9 years old isn't the way to go.) There's many levels to play! And they all progressively require a higher level out of you, so you might have to replay many missions again. However, the game has a small twist, every area of a mission generates differently, it's still the same objective, but the area or asset itself, is never the same. One time you'll play this way, the next this other way. This gives it a big bonus, so you'll feel like you're playing a whole new mission, as opposed to playing the same repetetive gameplay. Which leads me to my next point, the gameplay might get repetitive at times, but I have lots of fun with this game. Hacking and slashing with a sword and gunning someone to pieces gives me a very good feeling (only in games, of course). I really have fun in this game, there's no doubt it's my favorite free to play. As you progress through a level, you might get some mods. These can be for your Warframe or your weapons. You can combine mods to make a bigger tier of that one, or leave it like that. Using mods is a great way to level up and enhance your Warframe's skills to your liking. Maybe you're more of a shotgun fan? There's a mod for that! A very very very well made F2P, if this ever becomes a paid game, there's no doubt it will be heard about around town. I highly recommend it, and it's free, so you don't lose anything :D

review: I entered the world of Warframe with a lot of confusion. The menu was full of options and customizations for me to choose from and I honestly had some trouble figuing out where to start. Eventually I got a few missions under my belt and found the color customization screen and from that moment on I was hooked. This game is repetitive and grindy but if you let yourself get sucked in you will find yourself playing countless hours on it. The one gripe I had is that it seems to lack an overall objevive. However, it really hit home for me after my fourth mission that this really is all about the spectacle and enjoying it. You beat missions to acquire better weapons and power ups only to use them to repeat the process. But when you eventually find yourself flying sideways down a hallway scoring headshots with a weapon you have built and colored yourself while impaling other enemies on an equally personalize sword you have no choice but to stop for a second and say: "Yes. This is why I enjoy playing this game".

review: Ninjas. Shooting aliens and robots. With tech and . 11/10 Proper review, pardon my english : This game is fully free to play with slow and steady pace towards full geared. With many different ninjas that you could get for free by grinding bosses. Mostly content for premium users is costumes and , but wait, you could half of those by some random event in-game and premium users items is just for a quick Good Game. Therefore i conclude this game is fully free to play by an exception, you couldn't get all of those cool looking ninjas and weapons in your inventory because you could only add slots with microtransaction. The community is great i think, dev is supportive too, i got a quick responses for wanting to change my e-mail id. So i have been enjoyed for about 300+ hours of fun smacking the enemies with so many interesting abilities. The missions could be repetitive and boring but random generated map negates it a bit. Therefore anyone who enjoyed tps-games should give this a try, nothing to lose.

review: A fun co-op shooter that doesnt feel like its solely out to gouge its players wallets. Solid third person shooter mechanics and some fun swashbuckling. Co-op works well with four invested players, and an interesting upgrade system. Play with your friends to enjoy the game to the max cuz there's no fun playing this game on your own. I would give it 9/10 because it's really enjoyable when you play with friends.

review: I really enjoy this game. Graphicly, it's way above your average F2P. Also, paying real money for things doesn't mean much since you don't typically fight each other; this is a co-op based game. There is an option that you can duel with others but it has to be an accept action, no one will just jump out of nowhere an kill you mid-mission. There is a little bit of a learning curve getting used to the controls, and an even greater one for a controller, in my opinion. When bad guys drop stuff, everyone shares the loot. You only see the stuff on your screen but everyone gets the same thing. This game has kind of an MMO feel with some of the grinding involved but it's done in an entertaining way. As far as using your real money equivilant platinum you start with, I recommend buying an extra slot for a suit and slots for weapons. They are contantly updating this game which makes it continually enjoyable. The improvements that are done for updates can sometimes change the whole dynamics of how you play your character. Fortunately enough, I haven't seen an update yet that has frustrated me into not playing anymore but instead curious about how to utilize the new system.

review: This game is very underrated, it deserves a higher meta score than it has, a lot of the negative reviews were back when the game was much older and offered less, they don't represent the game now. Excellent co-op, mostly bug-free, smooth controls, outstanding graphics, tons of weapons, upgrades and customization, get pretty much anything you can buy with the store credit in game also (except warframe and weapon slots I think). Oh and replayablity. I have been playing this game for a long time. They are always adding new modes that refresh the expereince. I can't recommend it enough. 8.5/10

review: Super Sweet 3rd-Person Shooter! Controls and Systems take time to get used to. The Damage System has got a big learning curve, but once you do get it you're basically a god. Almost everything in-game you can build, but there are some things that are exclusively Pay to get. Plus they give you some in-game premium cash when you start up- so all good (it's dirt cheap if you want to buy some more). Online Interactions are pretty O.K. You get a squad most of the time, but you never truly stick with them cause of connection issues. Without a good internet connections, your ethier lagging from your connection or someonelse's. NOTE: You actually need to join a clan to do crap in this game 0.0. Probably cause some weapons are exclusive to clans. The Gameplay gets repetitve after a while, due to the tidous farming and the same mission types over and over again. Though there are a few random events that keep it fresh. The shooting mechanics are....well...... generic shooting mechanincs, nothing really special. Unless of course, you count the warframe abilites. Overall Score: With its fun and social gameplay, and a few minor bugs and problems I give Warframe a 9/10.

review: Very fun Online Co-Op, very difficult for singleplayer. Its alot more fun when you're playing with friends as opposed to strangers though. Concept-wise/story-wise, its pretty unique and fascinating, as alot of the backstory is left for the player to interpret. Gameplay wise, its a very cool third person shooter and thirdperson melee experience, with special abilities for each individual warframe. Although it uses microtransactions, these are non-essential, and more or less just allow easier/faster access to items you could get through gameplay otherwise. I've been playing since closed beta, and I've watched the game grow and change but have yet to see a change I cannot stand. They seem to update frequently and patch as needed, and have yet to come up with a solid reason to be disappointed by the game or anything in it.

review: Hundreds of action packed four player co-op missions without having to spend a penny. Generated stages with 10 different mission types, all of which play very differently from one another. Character upgrading and weapon crafting is done through drops during levels, which is nowhere near as grindy as people make it out to be. There is a big character and weapon roster allowing play styles of every kind as long as they include a good bit of mindless shooting. Updates are plenty, well optimised while still looking good and the Warframes just look too cool to turn down.

review: Warframe is a pretty interesting game. If you're reading this, you probably already know that it is a "Co-op Shooter" from somewhere, and that it is in Open Beta. The first thing I want to let you know is that these two categories are not seperate at all. The core of this game is as much a Shooter as it is a "game in development", a game that experiments and teaches both the community and the developers, and of course a game with many unfinished features. There are upsides and downsides to Digital Extreme's decision of developing their game like this, but I am without a doubt that the impact of saying: "Let's release it publicly in Beta and develop it as we go with our players" on the end product of this game, will be even greater than when they said: "Let's make a Space Ninja Co-op Shooter F2P Game" I could write about the stunning visuals that easily outmatch any F2P game to date, I could write about the constantly evolving storyline and setting that seem as basic and simple as it is limitless, or I could even write about the gameplay that easily combines a dozen different styles of games into one fast-paced, progression-filled insanity... But I won't. These aren't what keep me in this game. What keeps me in this game is the development itself, the slowly building community and the potential this game has. The developers themselves clearly learn a lot with every hotfix and update they release, and it makes progressing through this game all the more interesting - seeing as the game is progressing alongside you. A normal company would learn quietly through data and attempting different things internally, but Warframe has by far the most community-involved development team I have ever had the pleasure of interacting with. This game is an experiment, and so far it looks like it's a successful one. It's still pretty far away from completion, though. You can choose whether you want to participate now, or maybe you'd prefer it as a more refined product. You could choose any amount of time, focus, and interest that you would like to invest in this game and its' development, and it will adjust itself accordingly. So, yeah... I recommend you try out Warframe.

review: I love this game sooo much, but it's a little too fast paced, it's a co-op based game definetely, but everybody can solo it without really any consequences besides being over powered which doesn't happen in tis game too much. The game has amazing features such as mods, i was once playing with a new bow and thought: You know? They really need to buff this thing, and then i thought: I really need to buff this thing, because you can do that! You can apply damage bonuses and different reload times and all these awesome things to you're sentinels weapons and warframe that makes them really unique! You dont have to pay to get cool weapons and warframe, sure it takes 12-32 hours, but in the end you dont pay real money for 2 weapons you may or may not like. This game is so amazing, it's free 2 play so if you're trying to decide whether or not to get it, GET IT! It's F2P and friggin' awesome! Good work Digital Extremes, you did good, -Waffle

review: Love this game. It looks gorgeous if you have a decent pc (otherwise you can play it on a PS4). It has its flaws with the amount of grinding you will have to do and is missing a proper endgame however the way the parkour is done, the way the weapons handle... The gameplay melts away the tediousness of the grind. I would say that overall, this game is a great game.

review: I've been following this game for a while, since it was in early stages of closed beta. And I can tell you this: *It is constantly being updated with awesome new content and fun events. *The community is one of the better ones I have seen in any online game. *The crafting system is done well. *The only thing you can't get without spending some cash is cosmetics (additional color pallets and scarfs etc) Of course there are bad sides to the game too: -First the game seams bugged alot, but the developers are working hard on fixing those issues and the changes in the past few updates have improved the overall performance of the game -The game doesn't focus on PVP, so it's almost non-present (which isn't necessarily a bad thing, just don't log in expecting some grand PVP action...It is a co-op focused game)... - The missions can get a bit repetative... Well, those are the barebone "traits" of the game. I loved it, it has a huge community so why don't you come and join us ;)

review: I absolutely love this game. The movement's nice, the grinding isn't as awful as other free to play games I've played, and the customizing on the weapons/characters is fun. There's also hidden areas in some of the levels and I love things like that. I personally recommend playing it with friends if you can.

review: one of the most addicting and beautiful free-to-play games out there i highly recomend it. it's kind of like a tps-mmo because of the powers you get on each warframe. the wepons are ok some of them are terrible,but on the bright side you can get great a huge longsword (galatine) and bladed boomarang (glave) sadly you can only get a glave by using platinum (real life money) and login rewards.so all in all i totaly recomended it

review: Cooperative Cyborg Space Ninja Third Person Action RPG. Do I have your attention yet? Having witnessed the evolution of this game from its infancy I can say that it has grown into a unique peice of gaming that will certainly garner its place in the hearts and minds of people. Coming from just a handful of "Warframes", this games version of character with pre-made stats, to an abundence such that there is almost always one to suit any playstyle within the third person market. In terms of graphics it has come a long way. The lighting and animations have come to a crisp smoothness that a lot of other free-to-play titles simply haven't gotten to. The bio-metal, or whatever the suits are made up of look organic but have the deflecting power of metal which makes for an interesting change when you're sliding across a metal surface and hear the suit grinding against the ground. Combat is almost always fast and fluid with hoards of enemies attempting to do everything in their power from keeping you from your objective with varying enemy types. Going head long into a wave of enemies can be fun, but the unprepared should be ready for a quick death. Finding your niche is easier since there are plenty of people in the community who are willing to pull you along to get the Warframe of your choice by getting you the parts to build it. Crafting is simple to learn and essencial to maximizing your arsenal as well. Getting the right gun could just be a matter of getting the materials to build it. If it turns out to not be that great, sell it off and craft again until you find that one you're willing to put money down to get a Orokin Catalyst and enhance it further for a fraction of the cost it would have been to purchase the weapon outright. Who knows, you might even find an event and get the Catalyst completely free. The final and most important element of the game is the mods. These can completely alter the way some of the warframes play out, even some of the weapons get an extra kick. Current personal favorite is the Kunai throwing knives with a 170% chance of an additional shot at the same time. That's right, I get the possibility to throw a third with each toss of a blade and deal massive damage. Finding this kind of combo for your weapon is just a download away. Enjoy.

review: This game has some amazing graphics for a free-to-play. Game mechanics are nice, too. Although it's an open beta, there is very little content in the game though, and it's definitely not worth spending any IRL money on, and after a while there isn't much to this game that brings you back to it: the missions, despite the levels being somewhat randomly generated every time you play a mission, get extremely repetitive after a while. 7/10

review: Clearly I recommend this game to anyone who wants team-based PvE Action, with loads of characters(WARFRAMES) and weaponry to chose from that are unique in everyway and that varies differently from each other with their own advantages/disadvantages to even the playing field. Fast intuitive action team based or stealthy solo missions, its L4D ninja's in space at its finest.

review: Warframe is, simply put, a great game. It's continuously updating with new content and that combined with its relaxed yet exciting gameplay will keep you playing for a long time. I personally love every aspect of Warframe, but there are two things that put me off, and I felt I should make people aware of it. For one, the game can get a bit repetitive, more specifically the grinding part. Although it does not do so to the point that it makes the game ridiculous and/or not fun, it still remains a bit of an issue. Second is the presence of the in-game trading, more specifically the ability to trade things for the ingame currency Platinum (which you usually buy with real life money). This function, and how extensively it is being used, might as well change the name of Warframe to WarTrade. However, other than those two things I find this an awesome game, and I definitely reccommend it to other people. It's graphics are definitely appealing, the customer service has been really good, and its gameplay is very addictive, at least to me. Not to mention Warframe is essentially completely free-to-play! You can unlock and play all content by just playing the game. Using money in this game only unlocks purely cosmetic stuff and allows you to get gear and weapons slightly faster. You get 50 free Platinum when creating an account to boot, which I heavily suggest you spend for Warframe/Weapon slots.

review: Warframe isn't one of those, run-of-the-mill free-2-play games you often see nowadays. Yes, there are microtransactions and yes, there is bought currency. However, that's where the line is dropped. Warframe is a game revolving around 1 versus 3 fight with you, the Tenno against the Grineer, the Corupus and the Infested. You, and three other players in your squad must eliminate these enemies by completing missions and events that are present throughout the game. You are given a vast amount of customizability with not only your loadout, but your cosmetic appearance. Weapons are either bought using Platnium (microtransactions), credits (achieved through missions) and building them using blueprints. Warframes also occur the same way, but may require more work. There are around about two hundred different missions ranging from about 10-11 planets of our solar system, in which each mission has a certain faction, tile/map set and objective that is to be accomplished as you challenge this mission. However, missions with the same objective may seem almost identical, which I'll explain later. Frames, otherwise known as your "character" holds completely unique abilities that will aid either you or your allies. Each frame also has a seperate set of statistics and can be used to suit the needs of the mission. You can also enhance not only your weapons, but your frames with mods or artifacts. These artifacts are obtained through missions and building frames. Effects of these mods can range from addition armour, to enhanced firing speed, to poison or elemental damage. Frame mods can boost attributes such as speed or ability power. Warframe is completely different from most F2P games, as they don't necessarily require you to spend money to get further in game. Most things can be aquired through playing and gaining levels. Somethings however, that may affect you would be the fact that you can't get more than 2-3 frames at once unless you buy a Frame slot, or you can't surpass a certain amount of weapons before you need to buy weapon slots. This is not necessarily worrisome in the beginning weeks, but it will get to you once you get some more powerful weapons and you'd rather not have to sell them in order to get a new weapon. Same with the frames, which is probably the only problem with the microtransations present on this game but they still maintain a fairly reputable system which isn't hogged with this. Now, this may not be early, but the game is largely grindy. In order to amass a decent chunk of money in order to build or buy, you'll need to do quite a bit of missions. This is another bad downside to the game, which can cause boredom once you get past a certain point, where fighting and completing missions has become basically worthless. Also, missions of the same gametype may seem extremely identical. However, the fact that the game is Co-Op makes the game much more enjoyable along with the fact that teamwork is actually needed at times in order to successfully complete a misiion without error. The graphics in the game are really well made, possibly the best graphics I've seen for a F2P game. Not only this, but the graphics are fairly scalable, allowing lower-end computers to run it at the cost of lower graphic fidelity. A couple mistakes that don't make much of a different is that the bloom can be massively impairing if you view it at a certain angle, the physics engine is a bit derpy as well, but it doesn't make any significant difference. Finally, the community of this game is probably one of the better ones I've encountered. Most people are helpful, relatively kind and because it's not a competitive game in most aspects, insults and such aren't flung very often. There are some who refuse to work and can be a massive nuisance. With this, I finally end this crappy review of a decent game personally. I suggest you not take my word on this to heart, and try the game for yourself. Now, Go Tenno!

review: Fun, action-packed game. Really nice graphics. If you like ninjas in space and shooters, this is the game for you. Fast paced game play, dungeon crawler co-op game with many weapons to choose from. It could do with more strategy as most games with a full team of 4 wind up being a huge zerg and the final kill count seems to be related to the person who run the fastest. Game can get grindy and repetitive, and the store items can be a little pricy, but if you want to just have a blast and shoot anything in sight for a while, this will get you hooked.

review: Great game, I've logged loads and loads of hours on it, for quite awhile you can solo it too but on most bosses and defence missions you'll need a helping hand. It's a good blend of melee and shooter, filling the enemy full of lead (or tiny metal darts) then hacking them to bit with your melee weapon of choice, collecting and building new items can be a grind at a start but after a while it soon eases. Plus it's free, give it a try

review: Since I last played this game in closed beta and left it due to it lagging on my computer along with choppy movement, the amount of updates that the developers have put forth is AMAZING! Warframe's premise for the game is unique and is continuously being built upon. There's a learning curve to the game, but once you learn it, it is a lot more enjoyable. Also, playing with friends and making new ones is always good! :D

review: One of the best Free2Play's i have ever tried out. You can practically get everything or every weapon, warframe in the game just by playing the game. Graphics wise, its a gorgeous game. Music is a heat pumping rhythm, that will make you just want to kill everything at sight. Sometimes the lobbies tend to mess up, like joining someone's game tells me the objective is done... but its not. It kinda feels like Mass Effect 3's multiplayer mode. Having these alert missions is good and rewarding. Plus an active community, gonna love an active community. There were a lot of big changes from Closed beta to open beta, but overall this is an amazing game. Oh i forgot about the story, it has a story and bosses to beat :D Amazing game, Play now Tenno!

review: Warframe is a fun and exciting third-person shooter. Leveling your "Warframe" and playing through its missions is super fun when you first start out. Although end game can be a bit grindy, there is always something to do and work towards. There is online mode as well as private, so you can play by yourself or with other people. But it's definatelly more fun with friends. If you're looking for an interesting action oriented game with some challange, pick up Warframe and give it a try.

review: Space ninjas in space with space guns. That's basically what I say the game is to people that have no clue about it. And I love this game. Sure it has it's fault, suich as "F2P" meaning nothing, you still need to spend at least $20 on it eventually. But other than that, the devs are nice, the community is good. And it's all in a ll fun to play. The gamer itself is really neat, even though it's a beta, it's still a very decent game. A lot of fun killing times, granted it's not very heavy on the lore, but it's still a good game. It's sort of like minecraft, you dont understand it, but you still get addicted to it at some point or another. The weapons are cool, and the fact that you put on a different "suit" and it gives you these awesome abilities, makes it fun. You can customize the play style to however you want it to be. Stealthy, bum rush, magic. It's all there. So check it out. It won't cost you anything to start, but if you get into it, a little investment to help out these awesome devs is totally worth it.

review: Warframe is a game which puts you in the shoes of a Tenno aka, "A Mother ing Space Ninja", where your job is to kill a bunch of people who look kind of like the emporer from star wars or people with shoe boxes for heads. The gameplay is pretty standard for a third person shooter but adds a few unique mechanics that makes the game flow together quite nicely and makes killing waves apon waves of crude clone nerd guys incredibly satisfying. The game consists of you doing a bunch of missions that are kind of made obselete as the game is focused - very heavily - around obtaining parts for weapons and warframes. This is a good thing and a bad thing because obtaining a new gun or a warframe can completely change the way the game is played, but I wont go into that, the reason why this is bad is that it makes the game very "grindey" and passively forces the player into committing to grinding for something to spice up the gameplay as the starter gear is piss-poor and uninteresting - alternatively they can invest their hard-earned coin into the game and just get most of the fun stuff through the micro transaction store. This sort of "forced commitment" has lead to a lot of people I know disliking the game as they came in and joined to play with other people who were higher as they felt that the gear they started with was more under-whelming and it put them off the game a little. Although this isn't much of a review as more of just throwing some thoughts onto Steam without using Spellcheck, I wanted to say something about the game as I have poured a lot of my time and money into it because the game is so satisfying and fresh when you invest your time into to it in the way I have. I'd like to say to anyone that picks this up as a try for a free to play game that it's a game where you may love it from the start but you may also have to invest you time or money in to get the same amount of enjoyment as others.

review: This is my favorite game! One of the best FTP games I have ever played. When you start off you get the choice between three starter characters (warframes) depending on your play style, and from there you can get more frames and weapons to further expand your arsenal. Everything in this game can be obtained without putting real money into it (just saying). It's definitely worth your time. Trust me it will be well worth the journey to get your desired equipment. Good Luck, Fellow Tenno :D P.S. If you need help, feel free to add me: lonesurvivor05

I will say it again though, it is a beta so there are bugs but the flip side to that is a continual stream of updates. I am taking place in the first big operation and it is a lot of fun. Basically it has everything I could want in an Action shooter; big levels, different types of missions, many environments, lots of guns, lots of leveling of gear etc...

review: It's ok. Not great but ok. I've really tried to like this game but I just haven't been able to get there, yet, and I find myself going back to Mass Effect 3 (it's a shame Bioware has pretty much blown off it's multiplayer support). I really dislike the fact that you can't earn platinum by just playing the game. Instead you're either required to shell out money or need to grind for ridiculous lengths of time to unlock new stuff. Regardless, for what it's worth, it's pretty good, especially considering it's free-to-play. If they were to change the purchasing systems and leveling system in the future, I'd most likely donate cash toward it's development. Addendum (2013/12/13): It's actually a lot of fun. I've been playing the crap out of it the past couple of weeks and, now that I've picked up on the resource farming and have a better idea on the forging, I think it's pretty entertaining. I still like the overall feel of Mass Effect better but ME has become pretty stagnant compared to the continuous evolution of Warframe. I will continue to dislike the purchasing system and the inability to get new equipment in an acceptable amount of time without paying for it. I also find it appalling that DE put in the option to pay platinum for credits. All-in-all, fun

review: I can't stop... playing this game... Help me. For a more substatnive review, a lot has already been covered in other reviews that I can echo; the gameplay is fun, it's got some grinding aspects but you never feel a lack of what to do, the co-op aspects are spectacular, and abilities start to synergize with each other as you start to work together... The reason I got so wholy sucked into it, though, is that it feels like an amalgamation of a lot of my favorite aspects of gaming; a compelling leveling system, great customization options for gameplay style, reasonable grinding for new equipment and warframes so that each acquisition feels like an exciting accomplishment... The sum of the parts makes the whole incredible. It's clear that the game is still beta, that's certain, but if it's already at this point in its beta stage and still getting updates, it has a LOT of potential. HIGHLY reccommended.

review: "Measure twice, cut once." This is not a credo the Warframe developers live by. Warframe's core problem is what some would consider a strength. The updates come quickly, and the developers just as quickly change their minds about what they want to do with the game. Sometimes there's obvious flaws in updates that wouldn't have been there if more time had been spent planning before implementing. Once the game is out of beta and considered final, maybe this will change. Right now, Warframe is an unstable game - player abilities change constantly, the defenses and attacks of the opponents likewise. There's a lot of user interface problems and frequent crashing. Overall, the development process seems very guided by passion, and it is not restrained by procedure or common sense. The result is a game that changes drastically in a rapid manner - and it is only a slight exaggeration to say I wouldn't be surprised if it turned into a turn-based RPG overnight. The gameplay itself is fairly solid - though, it's basically all shooting and looting. It is a third person shooter combined with an action RPG. Once you have shooted and looted your way to the best gear, however, there's woefully little to do. For now anyway, seeing the rapid pace of development. The parkour isn't fun, due to the problematic controls and abundance of surfaces where it merely fails. The shooting is fun, and the abilities spice it up nicely, though in late game the game goes from effortless to unfair very quickly. The looting is sometimes extremely grindy, but still fun enough. It is also a game to be played in a team. There's puzzles, there's bosses that need to be figured out. They're not complicated, but they do punish players rushing ahead without stopping to think. A group of players not working as a team will find some of the later bosses and level elements almost impossible. Given the language barrier you sometimes encounter, this can be a significant headache. As far as the free-to-play elements go, there's the good and there's the bad. It's possible to play the game for free, and it's fairly easy to pay a little money to skip a lot of grinding. There are however some items bought with real money that are completely useless and will quickly scare away a player after they buy them and they realize they spent the game's premium currency on worthless garbage. Until you figure out what you want and know your way around, buy nothing but Orokin Catalysts, Orokin Reactors, Warframe slots and weapon slots. The grind can be significant, however, especially if you're trying to spend as little money as possible. In short, it's a fun team-based shooter that can get extremely grindy, and once you're done grinding there's little to do. And the very fast and mostly untested patches mean that keeping up with the changes can be difficult, and bugs frequently pop up. Right now the game is decent. Maybe it will be excellent in the future.

review: Warframe is a 1-to-4-player co-op, third-person action title that combines gunplay, melee combat, and freerunning environment traversal in equal measures, and does all three very well. The firearms are numerous, and widely varied, and they deliver satisfying feedback. The melee combat is visceral, brutal, and lightning fast. The freerunning (though it takes a bit to learn the ins and outs of the game's physics) is mostly smooth, and makes you feel like a badass space ninja. The Warframes (characters) each have unique--and highly gratifying--power sets, and therefore unique strengths and weaknesses. But the deep and complex modding system allows you to enhance weapons and Warframes to suit your favorite playstyle, or to exploit the specific weaknesses of the game's various enemies/factions. The developers are always on top of it, often delivering hotfixes within hours of a bug's discovery. Major updates come fairly often, further increasing the game's already expansive array of goodies. Major events/instances can yield exclusive equipment to participants. The game is free-to-play, but is very careful to avoid being construed as a "pay-to-win" title. Aside from purely cosmetic items/features, you can obtain everything through normal gameplay. Every character, gun, sword, sentinel, blueprint, component resource, and material can be acquired through completing events and missions, farming, or boss rushing. Using Platinum (the game's real-money currency) simply saves you time. The community is very friendly and cooperative, offering up information, tips, and aid to new players when requested. Becoming a member of a clan has tangible benefits, as there are certain perks, items, and weapons that can only be obtained through clan-initiated research. There are always clan Warlords looking for new recruits. If you're a fan of shooters, ninjas, co-op, or sci-fi, this game is definitely worth a look. It's free, so you've got nothing to lose. :)

review: Warframe is practically the computer version of Clash of Clans, figuratively. It will addict you with hours of gameplay that keep you coming back with the "just one more level" feeling. The graphics are amazing. I play on low graphics settings, for quality's sake, and the game looks comparable to Halo 4 on the Xbox 360 in terms of detail. Your eyeballs are in for a treat. The levels are all the same structure, you move from room to room murdering everything in your path with guns to bow and arrows to shurikens, etc. There are different level types, Exterminate, Spy, Assassinate, Defense, Survival, Sabotage, and Mobile Defense. Each of these levels has a different objective that I am not going in depth of(mainly because the title says it all), but they last 10-15 minutes usually. The length of the mission really depends on how far you are willing to push yourself. Are you going to murder an entire army, or just the standing garisson? The choice is yours. This game has full clan support, trading, friends, text chat, and even a PvP multiplayer duel mode where up to 4 people can duke it out to see whose ninja skills are superior. All in all, it's a great game for being free, and even though repetitiveness sinks in quickly, the tutorial doesn't give a lot of info, and the storyline is non-existent, it's fun. And that's all games are supposed to be. For the few gigabytes it's worth, I give Warframe a 8/10.

review: At first I downloaded this game because KATANAS IN SPESS, and I thought I would just bust some money on it. So I go to the free2play store, to buy the katana (named Nikana in game). But, to my great sadness, the Nikana is XP locked. That's a nice free to play. Doesn't just allow you to buy all the good stuff. I ended up saving the majority money and got some Samurai Shoulder pads, and the Ash ninja frame. LAZOR SHURIKENS. Great free2play, great gameplay, great co-op, great balancing. I heart it.

While there can be a good amount of downtime between updates every once in a while, the amount of weapons, warframes(guys you play as), things to collect, dojo to build or clans to join, and friendly community, there's no reason not to play. I've only once put about twenty bucks into this game for some early warframe slots and weapon slots. Since then, I've made all I ever needed by selling items in-game. Great market, just gotta keep up with prices.

You're also a space ninja, Is there anything else needed to be said. Also play as raiden and other Metal Gear characters 10/10 would roleplay again

review: A fantastic shooter in the hack and slash genra. Graphics: the graphics are of high quality, the shaders work well and great visuals overall, the only issue i have is on grenier ships there is massive bloom in some areas, other then that i give it a 9/10 Story: there is practicolly 0 story in this game, you start off reviving on pluto and just... start killing stuff cus Lotus says do this for the tenno. there is some lore background on some things, but most story based content that has happened is on forums, and stuff you and the player base as a whole vote on on what happens (story tends to advance major update to major update. which is a unique twist on things) story i give 3/10 Gameplay: the game play is fluid. the controls are tight, you can do cool ninja things like running on walls, flipping off walls, rolling, just things that make you feel like a badass when done right. your warframe has unique powers and stats and the abilities are really neat, some of them are stupidly strong but thats the fun in hack and slash games. you have a primary weapon, a secondary weapon, and a melee weapon and between missions you can level them up and attach Mods you find to custumise how your weapon handles. weapons and warframes level up to 30, and if attached with catylests you can have 60 Mod points to equip. the only downside to the gameplay element is there is alot of grinding, the first 4-6 levels happen quickly, and on the last stretch from levels 23-30 take a LONG time, and if you decide to use a forma when hitting 30 for polarity slots, your back down to level 0 for that weapon or warframe. overal i give it 8/10 Free 2 PLay: game is completly free, and has hotfix updates nearly every 3-4 days, minar patches every week or 2, and a major update they advertise every few months. the udpates adress bug fixes, balence changes, system implimentations, weapons, and warframes. content in every direction really. the micro transaction model i find is fair, buying weapons from the market with Plat. gives you the weapon already built and gives you a slot for the weapon in your inventory (altho expensive but you are buying a slot as well for it and an equiped catalyst so you dont have to wait for an event for one) in the market you can also buy blueprint for most weapons in the game to craft on your own at anytime. all weapons you buy or craft starts at level 0, so you do have to play in order to make full use of them. how i feel they did in this F2P model is 10/10 overal i recommend the game, it is fun for people who like shooters and for people who like the hack / slash model of random dungens and lots of dudes to kill. hope this review helps :3

review: The game is alright for people who like PVE. You can play in a squad of no more than 4 people. There is a fair variety of missions Large ammount of guns and customization options Everything than can be purchased on the market with real money can be found and crafted in the game with hardwork and luck. There is even some things money cant buy. PVP lacks something fierce. There is literally no point to it. The PVP in this game lacks the feeling of just completely obliterating your oponent. There is no real strategy and it just feels like a cheap CoD arena. If youre looking for a PVP game. turn around this is not it.

review: Pretty much one of the best games I've ever played, but that is LARGELY due to personal preference. This game is extremely grindy, you will spend loads of time grinding for rare parts and resources. Keep that in mind. For actual gameplay, it is very smooth and the graphics are beautiful, All the races are well designed with plenty of variants (some really annoying, like nullifiers). There is a tactical advantage to stealth, depending on what frame you play as. Some frames are weak in terms of tankiness but can kill pretty much anything in the way if they don't get hit. Others *cough Trinity cough* can take literally any amount of damage and not die if you play it right. This is advanced modding though. See below. The upgrade system is really well done, using these special drops called mods. They essentially upgrade the stats and powers of your frame and weapons. You have 8 mod slots, and a polarity system so you can make your slots more efficient if they match up with the mod. When you first craft a weapon or frame, it will have no mod capacity, which you need to install mods. As you rank it up by using it in matches, it will gain mod capacity, allowing it to become exponentially stronger. The current strongest weapon in the game per shot is the Paris Prime, which through the polarity system, very rare mods, and lots of time, you can basically one-shot any enemy. I recommend finding the parts for one as soon as you become comfortable with the thought of using a bow against massive amounts of enemies that can, late-game, oneshot almost all players. The advantage to it is that you can do the same to them. The trading system is good, but needs some changes I think. The in-game currency that players can buy or trade for from other players is Platinum, which is used to either trade players for items you want, or to buy things from the official market. The problem with this is that players can essentially get any Prime gear they want if they pay, when really it is meant to be as a last resort if that one item you simply must have isn't dropping for you. There are loads more things in the game, because DE does actually add a lot of content every couple months. Companions, Archwing, Tactical Alerts, Boss fights, and even more. Expect large updates every 1-2 months with bug fixes and lots of new content to satisfy you. If you have no patience and no time, don't play this game. You will either rage quit from not getting the things you want quickly, or become addicted and then lose control of your life. I put 100 hours into this game over the course of 4 months, and took a break from gaming. When I came back.. I put another 400 in 6 months. I do recommend this to those who enjoy playing with friends though. Teamwork is one of the most major aspects of Warframe, and without a good team it is guaranteed that you won't make it far.

review: Absolutely amazing! Very wide choice of weapons and warframes, each with its own individual abilities. Customization is too big to handle, that is why it is very hard to get bored of this game. With its up to notch gameplay and excellent game mechanics I still got tired of Warframe for a bit, and here is a kicker... I had few months of break from this game, I came back and there was so much new content that I felt like I'm playing a brand new game that I never touched before. New weapons, warframes, environments, new missions, enemies, everything new! The big part of Warframe is evolution and progress of its universe and gameplay, it keeps the game fresh and exciting, that is why "evolving sci-fi world" is a big thing about this game and it keeps on evolving! Recommended to anyone and everyone who enjoys TPS, action games, sci-fi and ofccourse parkour elements :D Mirrors Edge can feel ashamed by Warframe :D

review: I highly recommend this game... If your looking for a stratergy game with teamwork or a 3rd person shooter with a difference. This is it! In my opinion this is the best F2P mmorpg out there. With beautiful graphics (even on lowest settings) and little to no lag you will be able to wall jump over fire and headshot Grineer in the face while idk its raining and theres a huge background with an endless horizen... If your looking for weapon customization then theres plenty. from cosmetics to upgrades you can change the dps the accuracy and other weapony stats with mods you pick up from the environment. While you can buy weapons with in game special currency you can build your weapons with blueprints which require materials. This game is not P2W as it requires stratergy, guile and teamwork (unless your lone wolfing it) to complete any level, not just the biggest gun. For some though they may find stealth dull, so you can enter a room guns blazing! with a multitude of different playstyles accompanied by Warframes wich is you as a character. there are a few (20ish) and each one different in size background and abilities! I recommend this game and would give it 21/20, 11/10, 70/69 topmarks!

review: Warframe is game that makes other FPS look inferior, it's supposedly set in the future, where Tenno Soldiers fight Grineer Marines, for absolutely no unkown reason ; possibly the soverignity of the solar system. The game is also supported by microtransactions via steam. DLC from the game is ridiculous, the more you pay, the more stronger and better you are, but unless you actually put in time and effort to get the same results as the p2winners. Overall, Warframe can be naturally seen as a fps and p2w game, this game actually seemed more new, unlike the other modern-day fps like black ops. Although the game can be seen as a p2w, rarely any time and effort needs to be put in to acquire better eqiupment since materials for blueprints are fairly easy to get. I rate this 7/10 or 70%

review: Warframe is a free to play, fast-paced, third person shooter that can be best described as space ninjas. Developed by Digital Extremes, Warframe follows the adventures of the Tenno during a war with the Grineer, a race of militarized humanoid clones. Tenno soldiers bear a Warframe  effectively, a futuristic and alien combat suit  into battle, as well as a primary weapon, a sidearm, and a melee weapon. The game is, essentially, a sequel to Dark Sector, taking place about a thousand years after its events. Its a game built on two very solid features: exciting gameplay and awesome gear. At its heart, Warframe is all about the action. Combat is intense, and blazingly fast. The Tenno can sprint, slide, and dodge out of hairy situations, as well as being able to run along walls and displaying quite a fair collection of parkour motions. Players can sneak around a map and melee an enemy from behind for elevated damage, but its nowhere near as fun or as easy as running into a crowded room, guns a blazing. Theres a much heavier focus on staying agile in a gunfight rather than being sneaky. Each warframe has its own set of unique abilities and stats, giving each one a diverse feel from the other. A wide array of weapon types keeps the combat fresh and gives the player a multitude of ways to play. Guns feel impactful, but melee weapons tend to feel a bit floaty. With an astounding amount of different enemy types and bosses, levels can produce a variety of challenges. Theres even a one-on-one PvP feature in which players can duke it out. These are called conclaves and are limited by a point scale to keep players of relatively equal skill fighting against each other. While it is nice to see a human player react with unpredictability, a lot of the AI in the game is very predictable in its actions. Theyre still difficult, but it takes away from any sort of surprise if youve already squared off against that enemy before. Also, it is highly recommended that you play this game with friends and a common goal in mind. It can get stale quickly without those two things. Despite that, theres still an immense amount of fun to be had in Warframes fast-paced shooter action. Warframe is visually stunning. And I dont mean just for a free to play game; this game is gorgeous for any type of game. Theres a great attention to detail. Lighting effects are cinematic. Environments are vibrant with color. However, youll see many of the same settings over and over again. While they are pretty to look at, seeing what seems to be the same map several missions in a row gets very tiring. The slight blur that is created from constant movement will distract from any minor visual flaws  flaws that youll have a hard time finding to begin with. This is actually one of the few games in which Ive fired my weapon solely for the purpose of hearing how it sounds. The guns sound incredibly real and impactful. And even though each gun has its own distinct sound, most of them manage to sound pretty good. It certainly outdoes the gun sounds that are apparent in more successful shooters like Call of Duty. Warframe is just full to the brim with varying types of gear. Warframes, essentially character types, are plentiful and number well into the double digits. Each player has three weapons: a primary, a sidearm, and a melee weapon. There are a multitude of primary weapons, such as rifles, shotguns, bows, and snipers. Sidearms include full auto and semi-auto pistols. Available melee weapons are swords, staves, axes, and more. These weapons can be bought with platinum  the equivalent of real world money  but are also easily obtainable through the in-game currency known as credits. Weapons must be built by first purchasing their blueprints and then having the items required to build it. Items are scattered as drops throughout the planets, and while theyre entirely useless on their own, they can be used in unison to create some really interesting weapons. However, items have build times. Weapons generally take twelve or twenty-four hours, while warframes take a lengthy seventy-two. This can be a bit bothersome to those without patience, but items can be rushed to completion by spending a certain amount of platinum. This gear can also be modded with a plethora of upgrades depending on how the player see fits, resulting in a huge amount of customization. A single weapon can be made to play several different ways depending on the mods the player has installed on it. This creates an experience that truly is different for every player and item. While most free to play games suffer in terms of story and narrative, Warframe actually does a very successful job at this. Well partially. Its narrative is weak and lacks integration into the gameplay. The average player will just plow through the missions without even realizing theres a plot going on. Most of the plot will be found in the Codex, a menu in which players can read up on the lore. It takes a while to uncover, and quite honestly Ive only scratched the surface, but its chock-full of science-fiction goodness. There are questions of morality and the Tennos purpose in the universe. There are references to Dark Sector, proving that the two games exist within the same universe. Its certainly very interesting and easily dominates in a market where story tends to be an afterthought. Another strong point, one where it stands above its competitors in the free to play market, is the incredibly fair balancing of real world and in-game currencies. Almost anything that can be obtained through the cash shop can be found as loot or created via a blueprint. Most of the items that cant be obtained without spending some cash are purely cosmetic, such as color palettes and weapon skins. However, in a game that is so gear-centric, its a shame to see so few free inventory slots given to the players. Even still, prices are pretty reasonable. Shelling out cash doesnt put players too much ahead of others, and the small gaps that do exist can easily be closed by player ability. Its nice to see a free to play game that doesnt put a huge chasm between its paying and non-paying players, and that certainly is a huge advantage for Warframe in its market. One of the biggest drawbacks of Warframe is its perpetual state of open beta. Things can change from patch to patch, whether they be minor updates or huge ones that drastically overhaul something like the UI. This results in a large amount of bugs. Theyre not common and prevalent in every mission, but youre bound to run into them. Fortunately, they tend to stray far from game-breaking and are usually just minor annoyances. Overall, Warframe is a great addition to any collection as it is able to balance fantastic gameplay, gorgeous visuals, impactful sounds, an interesting story, stellar optimization, and a fair currency system. And its free. Did I mention its free? I would like to see more integration of its impressive lore into the gameplay as well as more free inventory slots, but apart from those setbacks it is a great game that should be given a try by anyone who enjoys some fast-paced action. And the reload wheel (as of Update 12) is pretty awesome.

review: Super Sweet 3rd-Person Shooter! Controls and Systems take time to get used to. The Damage System has got a big learning curve, but once you do get it you're basically a god. Almost everything in-game you can build, but there are some things that are exclusively Pay to get. Plus they give you some in-game premium cash when you start up- so all good (it's dirt cheap if you want to buy some more). Online Interactions are pretty O.K. You get a squad most of the time, but you never truly stick with them cause of connection issues. Without a good internet connections, your ethier lagging from your connection or someonelse's. NOTE: You actually need to join a clan to do crap in this game 0.0. Probably cause some weapons are exclusive to clans. The Gameplay gets repetitve after a while, due to the tidous farming and the same mission types over and over again. Though there are a few random events that keep it fresh. The shooting mechanics are....well...... generic shooting mechanincs, nothing really special. Unless of course, you count the warframe abilites. Overall Score: With its fun and social gameplay, and a few minor bugs and problems I give Warframe a 9/10.

review: Very fun Online Co-Op, very difficult for singleplayer. Its alot more fun when you're playing with friends as opposed to strangers though. Concept-wise/story-wise, its pretty unique and fascinating, as alot of the backstory is left for the player to interpret. Gameplay wise, its a very cool third person shooter and thirdperson melee experience, with special abilities for each individual warframe. Although it uses microtransactions, these are non-essential, and more or less just allow easier/faster access to items you could get through gameplay otherwise. I've been playing since closed beta, and I've watched the game grow and change but have yet to see a change I cannot stand. They seem to update frequently and patch as needed, and have yet to come up with a solid reason to be disappointed by the game or anything in it.

review: Warframe changed the way i thought of [free to play Games] (Well Sort of), Having friends who play together using team speak is really Fun & Funny! have to buy blueprint to build your items might take up to days but its worth it! (Unless you wanted to use real money on getting the items fast while supporting the dev to update the game and keep it going) Well, give it a try and play to free up some stress from the real world, Add me up if you need a friend on steam :sfhappy:

review: Warframe is a F2P third person action shooter that succesffuly destoryed myself and the friends around me lifestyle slowly and it was worth it, instead of studying and doing homework at our school's cafe we decided it would be more fun to play warframe on our crappy college internet connection. I'm thankful that somehow i passed all my college courses barely....... Steps to ruin your school life and life in general 1) Download Warframe 2) Play warframe 3) Don't Study or do Homework 4) Become a "NEET" 5) Dont leave the house unless its for food This method of ruining your social life and your life and general works it happened to me and my friends.

review: This game has very satisfying improvements and events. When playing it drives you to think different. Createful battleground and you can specialize almost anything. n this atmosphere you might be remember starwars but no one knows whats coming on to you, soo you have to prepare yourself for harder battles with researching and improving process like ; Here some info to starters Vor? Lotus? hmm Im tenno lotus right, Vor enemy. What Im gonna do now? weapons, warframes, discovering worlds. to get a weapon gotta go to is drop spots. How Im gonna get there? I cant, Im low mastery, should use market to access some medium weapons I get blueprint, now what? ts still there in foundry, I need components to make it, where can I find these? Hmm in starmap or so called navigation console there is component list on every planet I can use the list to find my component farm spot. But its so far that planet I need to go No problemo, Just write to chat recruit tab LF (looking for) Taxi to ..... (planet name) Then someone takes you to somewhere in the planet u wanted to go. After farming components, make ur weapon and level it up in some defence mission. Now Before u building ur warframe, look far all warframes in codex, youtube, warframe wiki Pick 2-3 warframe differently for different missions. Make them in foundry like making weapons When u need a credit Play void missions or dark sector missions(in low tax spots)

review: I've had Warframe for a long time, but didn't really get into it till September 2014. There are so many things you have to learn and understand at the beginning which makes it a little hard. But once you understand everything, this game is worth your while. Good graphics, good gameplay, a whole ton of missions and planets to explore, I recommend Warframe anyday 8.4/10

They update the game pretty ofter, and when they update you can do same   over and over again expecting you'll get that new rare mod. 10/10 Would do over and over again.

review: Warframe is game that makes other FPS look inferior, it's supposedly set in the future, where Tenno Soldiers fight Grineer Marines, for absolutely no unkown reason ; possibly the soverignity of the solar system. The game is also supported by microtransactions via steam. DLC from the game is ridiculous, the more you pay, the more stronger and better you are, but unless you actually put in time and effort to get the same results as the p2winners. Overall, Warframe can be naturally seen as a fps and p2w game, this game actually seemed more new, unlike the other modern-day fps like black ops. Although the game can be seen as a p2w, rarely any time and effort needs to be put in to acquire better eqiupment since materials for blueprints are fairly easy to get. I rate this 7/10 or 70%

review: Great game and it is free so give it a shot! You play as one of the Tenno and you use a Warframe (there are quite a few, but you get to choose one out of a few for free from the start). You take on various kinds of enemy factions (Grineer, Corpus, Infected) in different kinds of missions given to you by Lotus, more or less the leader of the Tenno, across many planets. You can unlock more planets as you accomplish certain goals. On top of that there is a place called the Void that is quite difficult and requires a key to enter (4 tiers of difficulty). In the void you have the potential to unlock special items only obtainable there that both look better and function better than their normal counterparts. These are "Prime" items. The combat is quite good and fast paced, and it's all in third-person. Though fairly straight forward, it isn't necessarily easy. You'll want to move around a lot which can take some getting use to (as a Tenno you can be very acrobatic). You have a health bar and a shield bar, as well as energy which is used up when you use your Warframe's skills. As you play you gather materials which allow you to build new weapons of which there are many types (primary, secondary, melee, and subtypes of those), as well as companions (sentinels which are floating little weaponized creatures, and kubrow which are a lot like dogs), and new warframes (basically your battlesuit) for you to use, which each have their own unique appearance and skills. There is also something called an archwing that allows you to do an entirely new kind of mission where instead of running around in a ship or on a planet, you can fly though space killing your enemies. Spaaaaaaaaaace. In addition to building things, you can get a lot of drops called Mods. There is a massive amount of different mods out there. Mods can be used to improve your Warframe, all of your weapons, and your companions. As you level your gear up you can equip more mods. You can also sell mods, fuse many mods into one to increase it's effect (best of the three options), or fuse many mods together to gain one random better mod. In addition to all of that you can buy quite a few cosmetic things as well. For your Warframe, your weapons, your companions, and even your ship Liset. Your ship Liset is quite important. It's your hub for access to the market, codex, syndicates, foundry, arsenal, and more. The game allows you to join or create a clan which gives you access to a clan dojo, where you can gain access to many useful things over time (there's even a sentinel, the Djinn, that can only be gained by owning a clan dojo and building a bio-lab). You build various rooms with materials, and anyone in the clan can contribute. There also are factions you can join that are either broken off from the Grineer, Corpus and Tenno, or are something entirely unrelated to them. These factions are the Steel Meridian, Arbiters of Hexis, Cephalon Suda, The Perrin Sequence, Red Veil, and New Loka. They all have different standings with each other (Allied, Opposed, and Enemy) and you can join as many as you want. By helping them, you can gain special rewards only obtainable through them. However be aware that be helping some, your reputation can go down with others. And by joining syndicates, there is a chance that very difficult enemies can spawn in and attack you. There is also another powerful enemy that has a chance to spawn in and attack you called the Stalker. This enemy is attracted by killing bosses. The more bosses you kill, the more of a chance it has to spawn in future missions. Great game. Download for free and get your friends in on it. There's much more I could discuss but I've already written a massive amount, so find out for yourself!

review: Warframe: The game about rocket launcher wielding space ninjas. So much potential for awesome. Unfortunately this game just constantly shows the problems in random number generators. Hunting for specific mods, weapons and Warframes for months on end that you may never get does get irritating after a while. Currently all there is to do in this game is grind. Then grind some more after that. There isn't really any end game, nothing to do once you've sunk 500+ hours into the game and have your preferred loadout. I really like this game but until it has that something to keep you going once you have everything you want, it's hard to keep playing it. Grinding the same missions on the same tilesets over and over or attempting to aim for leaderboards that refresh every week on Defense or Survival gets old quite fast. Also try to find people to play with, grouping up with randoms will lead to frustration quite fast. That being said, it is space ninjas with rocket launchers. RNG is a thing in nearly all games, though some have ways to guarantee you'll get what you need, and hopefully adding some meaningful end-game isn't too far off. Might as well give it a try.

review: If I had to sum-up Warframe in one word: Tech-ninja. It does not get better than that. Guns, swords, and endless carnage. A few glitches here and there, but the gameplay is nonetheless fantastic. Third-person, over-the-shoulder shooter where you take control of a suit capable of providing endless entertainment filled with bullets, gore, and flying limbs. And on top of all that, wall-running, wall-climbing, wall-jumping. And what makes this game even more fantastic is that no matter what playstyle you prefer, be it stealth, tanking, or getting in their faces guns and swords flashing, there is a warframe with your name on it. There are also weapons that complement any playstyle. All-in-all, great game with lots of potential.

review: It's just a grindfest with repetitive missions. They have literally the worst experience for new players, you literally have no idea of what to do, but yes, they explain controls because that's what the people never gets  . Also the devs are no longer doing the things right, every update gets people to rage and stop playing the game. Don't be fooled by the reputation the game got in the past, it's pay2play since you need loads of slots to properly play the game. If you try to grid your way up you'll need at least 60 h of gameplay to already start playing the things that are worth farming. The game it's repetitive with only like 6 types of missions, and it gets worse later on (void). The frames can be fun sometimes but there are only 5 types: useless trash, fast ones (volt), mages (ember, nova), tanks (trinity-godmode, rhino) and nekros (also called the loot bot because you live to spam 3). So yeah, repetitive gameplay. Conclussion: play this if you can't afford to buy a game AND you are REALLY bored. Otherwise skip.

review: So Warframe. A game where you're a space ninja fighting off stupid robot things while grinding like  to get upgrades and better weapons. Although the game can be fun at times it can get really repetitive really fast. A lot of the missions are rehashes of other missions with minor changes to the layout or enemy placement. And speaking of enemies the AI is not good in this game. Stealthing is very easy as the range of vision isn't far and they don't detect sound making it almost too easy. Also they don't seem to dodge too much and will only move side to side when getting shot at making them a little easy to hit. The grinding is just hell. You will spend hours upon hours just to unlock a new weapon or certain upgrades. Although this may seem fine at first glance it will get tedious as time goes on. If you're into that then good for you but I, for one, am not. The controls are a small complaint for me as they feel awkward and sometimes unresponsive at times. Some controls feel awkwardly placed and some take a lot of time to get used to. Some will argue that it's a free game and that a lot of this stuff doesn't matter. Sure you think that but for me it just isn't a game that I took enjoyment in playing. Recent updates have added interesting things but not enough to keep me playing. It's an average game that has a lot of wasted potential and falls short with heavy grindfests, at times awkward controls and heavy repetitiveness. This game gets a 6/10 from me. You may disagree and think this game's really good and that's great you enjoy but I found no such enjoyment.

review: Fun game, but the downside is that you have to put in a lot of hours, and the repetitiveness of the levels would eventually dull one's senses. Yes, there is a PvP game mode, but rarely are people logged in there, plus, you don't get to use all your abilities and items obtained from grinding in there. You play with a skeleton warframe. Defeats the purpose of getting abilities and items in the first place. There should be more of a storyline too. One of the perks is that the community is friendly and players are always willing to help one another progress through the game.

review: Warframe addresses the issue of the racism back in 1960s in America. Warframe does a wonderful job compelling the player to explore new adventures with nothing but African descendants in his mind. Saryn is a great addition to the game, showing that reptiles can also have fun with nothing more than a whim on a stick and 13 platinum. I would rate warframe 16.3/20. Great game that is totally worth the 60 bucks.

Well done Warframe.

review: Great game with co-op story mission modes which is kind of hard to find in FPS nowadays. The PVP has serious balancing issues but overall the gameplay is fun and reminds me of Uncharted 2 combat. Would be nice if they eventually explain the lore a bit more.

review: Toooo many hours spent and as much as i want to leave the game i can't help but come back for "one last fight" but it seems no matter what i do there is never a last fight. sure it can be repetitive - it can be annoying - it can suck all of your time up but hey its free, and pretty decent so go pick up yor sword, ninja up and go kill somethin.

You love her so much, but she asks for money, and you have none. So you get a face full of glitter. It gets old after a while, but gets fun again with each phase. 11/10, would play.

review: Oh god do I love this game. It's intuitive, it's creative, it's easy to get into but rewarding and hard to master, and so, so unbelievably fun. This game is free2play, but it's not pay2win. Yes, it's grindy, grindy, grindy, and a lot of reliance on RNG, but there is basically nothing in-game that is off limits without paying, with the exception of various cosmetics. And yes, of course, if you're lazy you can buy all your favourite things with real world money, but where's the fun in that? TL;DR: This is one of the best games of all time.

review: Extremly addictive, fun and original. The gameplay and combat system are very fluid. The variety of weapons, waframes and mods lets you chose the play style you like ; straight up in your face, stealthy, support or tactical are some examples. Getting the components to craft items takes a while. It really is a grind to get better weapons or warframes. Wich personally i really like. In my opinion this game has the best pay to win system of any F2P game. Instead of having to pay cash to get extremly good gear that you coudn't get without paying (like most F2P games), Paying just lets you get the item immediatly instead of grinding to get the components to craft it. Or you could buy colours or different heads and such to customize your character. An extremly great F2P game, that I would gladly pay 60$ for.

review: Warframe has great graphics, good controls for doing lots of parkour, heaps of levels and tons of  to find. These things make it one of the best free to play games I've ever played. Although.... It trys to prromote teamwork,but finding a group is can be a nightmare sometimes and then once you do there is hardly any co-ordination, communication or teamwork involved. It seems that you just go with other players to finish harder levels because their really hard solo. There is also an extreme variety of warframes each with its own play style and powers and lots of weapons with different stats. However almot all of these require premium credits which can almost never be found in the actual game, which makes it all seem pay2win and then buying the blueprints requires you to spend hours searching planets for all the parts and then extra time to actually craft the item.

review: There's some [known] issue with the launcher, where it can not or will not connect to the content servers to inniate a download of updated content, which renders the game completely unplayable. I've downloaded the game twice and have been unable to even get past the broken launch frame. Unfortunate. At least I didn't pay for this game.

review: After the general fun of the combat wore off, I started dedicating a lot of time to "min/maxing" my warframe and sentinel with mods - however, the developers repeatedly changed the game mechanics (stamina change, frames and sentinels sharing mods change) in ways that screwed me over or left me far behind in progress from where I was right before the game update. Now that the game is a stable release, this may not be a problem anymore, but it left a strong sour taste in my mouth. Even with this fact aside, it takes an extraordinary amount of time and luck to get better gear/items. In many games, you get small stat increases at relatively frequent intervals, or relatively frequent gear drops. Although I think the weapons are supposed to be sidegrades, the expensive and high-rank weapons are much better, albeit somewhat more situational, than the defaults. It takes a lot of materials to build weapons, and a lot of luck to get certain blueprint parts to drop from missions. These add up to a very grindy game with very slow progression.

review: Ok, so let me start off by saying, No this is not apay to play game you can get almost all the items in the game for free in the sense of federal funds. Ill decide to start with the bad news oabout this game. Bad Things~ 1.Map systems are TERRIBLE -half the time you wont even know where the exit is on an infestation level . 2.Wait time for the RIDICULOUS amount of timeit takes to make practically anything. -Basicly explains itself but its cheap way how they get money [get ready to empty your wallet to speed up things] 3.Its a GLITCHFEST -you will run into at least 10 glitches in one week of playing I would let this pass since its f2p and th illt constantly update it to fix them but they are countless and its going a while till they perfect everything. Good things~ 1.Beautiful Graphics (given you've got a good enough pc) -The graphics and colour variations are great epeacially with colour correction on. 2.Gameplay -this is definatly a given since you probably know by now a game with space ninjas and guns each with various powers and customizable looks to boost morale and overall expirience is very good. 3.Constant Updates -This game recives tons of updates so many that you should never really grow bored with the game (given you arent still starter and dont know what to do like i was i reccomend looking at Mogamu and some of the guides very helpful)

review: This game is awesome, the developers are very user-friendly (even if you play as F2P you can get everything except skins (it does not include Prime Warframes which are elite version of character, the real-money platinum is very cheap and there are sometimes events where you can get it w/o much effort)). However this game is little recursive, you can feel bored sometimes, but if you like the concept of galaxy wars this game should never make you bored. Grinding in this game is like other dimension of grind-based games; Still - you are looking for resources to build you weapon, but you will know how much time it will take, you will find awesome graphic effects (check Frost). I remember when I was playing Volt warframe, defense mission as my team were dying as hell and I had only time for using my speed skill to be EVERYWHERE EVERYTIME to revive them (Volt is not support, but with his abilities it can really save the ). Team composition changes everything in this game

review: IMO IMO IMO IMO IMO IMO IMO IMO IMO IMO IMO IMO IMO IMO IMO Warframe is a third-person hack&slash game developed by Digital Extremes. It features combat which, easily master throws a twist of interesting game play. Warframe is great when handling lore, people that lore such as myself will love Warframes background story. Game play is broken into parts. First the casual, at-times boring missions, these tedious missions are to grind for Credits (In-game currency) and other Materials to build weapons and warframes. Warframe's true prime is shown in High level defence or survival; this is the bread and butter of Warframe. Challenging in either the sheer output of the enemies or the tactical play of your oxygen supplies or defence positioning. Warframes absolute best attribute, its strong community scene and a strong relation with the Developers such as Steve, Scott and Rebecca to name a few, consistent bug, content and other updates/patches with weekly live streams with four-five lead developers talking about Warframe and the upcoming updates and ideas, taking question, all live on twitch. Warframes payment system runs by something called Platinum or Plat for short. Weapons range in prices but very few weapons are locked be hide a pay wall. Warframes are also in the same handled similar. So are Sentinels. Warframe has a trading system. Many player trade Platinum that they traded for or bought for in-games items not available on the market such as specific mods. These can then be traded with the use a Trading post which you must be in a clan which has built one otherwise you will have to be invited to their dojo to trade. However a lack of a dedicated websites to host trading and deals such as Team Fortress 2s Outpost leaves Warframe player to scream into chat, most are forgotten as the trade moves at an alarming rate. Ah whole systems such as Team Fortress 2s Outpost should be implemented into the Warframe site or a 3rd party developer should invest time into making one. Warframe is a game which caters to new and veteran players alike; bring a fun but extremely casual game play experience to the table. The lack of interesting game play innovations is Warframe glaring downfall; this severely limits the replay-ability for extensive play sessions. Un-doubtable an amazing concept to a devolvement team that have proven themselves more than just avid programmers. Thank you very much to Digital Extremes for making Warframe. Thank you very much for reading my full review of Warframe.

review: This game is a third-person, pvp, pve, shooter type game where you develop your character, max that character, get a new character, max that character, find the most op character, max it out, max your weapon, find the most up weapons, max those out, then make a doge (kubrow). I can easily say doing all that takes time and effort, Or you can pay for it like a little . I would give this game an 7.5/10 due to the content it provides. -You can farm for items, which gets really repitive, but they put different maps in for the same mission so you can never really get to tired of it. -You can trade which makes somethings easier to get than others. -Characters are easily customizable as well as the assortment of weapons you can get. -The variety of missions always keeps things interesting. -The variety of character can satisfy everyone, there is a tank, a medic, a stealth character, and many more that fit the type of gameplay you want to have. -It is fun and exciting an think everyone should try it out. :D *Some of the bad things about the game are that you can pay to win, but you can get those items through time so I won't complain about that.

Robot?) that has landed on a shuttle and have to complete the mission assigned. Missions have a chance of changing part way through, based on performance and / or if other characters join in game / you merge into THEIR games. This game is more based on the fact that it IS multiplayer and has NO campaign attatched. Does this game suit your needs?: If your looking for something that has a COD esc feel for gameplay (online; averagely repetitive maps) and are looking at killing loads of AI with friends, strangers or alone then this is probably a really good game for you! Future Development: -More Guns -More Suits -More Planets -Actual Space Exploration / Battles -More Game Modes -More Users -Steam Workshop (IE: Guns / Levels / Bosses / Suits) -Campaign OR Some kind of lore.. even if it's hidden like in "Dark Souls" -Bullet Physics -Space Physics -More Mind Puzzles via Hacking or Other -Destruction of Computer sytems that AI use too alert hoards (IF/When you fail @ stealth) -More Boss Battles -Steam Inventory (Trading cards after X level | Suits | Guns | Items) -Space Shuttle Flight -Mech's -Bosses that require specific areas (IE: If it's mechanical, rather than just shooting it a million times, shoot the joints rendering it useless (IE: Quad-Walker, shooting out a leg making it struggle with 3) -Different Crossairs (Dynamic / Static / Colourized Schemes) All in all though, amazing for a "Free To Play" game. 8.3/10

review: Warframe offers a fast-paced* third-person shooter experience with a large variety of weapons to choose from and decent controller adaptation. Movements are absolutely fluid; you can slide, climb, wall-run, and all sorts of fantastic things, all while shooting your gun. Alternatively, using your melee weapon will also have different moves based on if you are in the air, sliding, etc, and you can even charge up for a massive swing. On top of that, each 'warframe' (class, if you will) features 4 unique(ish) powers that help you to manipulate enemies and survive combat. These aspcets combined make the simple act of killing enemies highly satisfying. Oh and did I mention you'll be levelling and upgrading your weapons and armor? Missions are between 10 and 20mins usually with randomized levels using a decent number of chunks, and a number of different mission types, and you will progress across stations on each planet which will eventually branch out and give you a lot of paths to work with. Now on to the critiques; You will only find 3 different types of enemies in Warframe, and one will only appear from time to time. However, each of the enemy factions feature a decent variety of units to engage which keeps combat lively, with the variety increasing as you progress across planets. Still, you may get tired of fighting the same units over and over, and the gameplay you experience from day one will essentially never change, but simply become more difficult. This is a problem for some, but not all. Some missions feature essentially endless gameplay with ever increasing difficulty, so depending on what you are after it may appeal. Also you can build everything you need in the game without setting foot in high-level missions, which is both good and bad for obvious reasons. Next are weapons. Yes there are many, no they are not all viable. Some are infinitely better than others, but have a 'mastery' requirement so you will have to level other weapons and frames to obtain the best weapons. There are many ways to modify your weapons however, and testing weapons becomes a critical part of the gameplay. Next is community; some players like to run through the whole level without killing things (when possible). You may find yourself doing this as well at times, but as a new player it can be extremely difficult to learn to keep up without dying, and solo play to set your own pace can be frustrating for the new player (running out of ammo, mobs from behind, etc.). Those who can adapt and play through to challenging difficulties however will not have an issue with this as they will quickly assimilate to the game's culture. Some levels are flagged (informally) as farming zones in which players will use their warframe powers to decimate massive amounts of enemies, which may be disheartening to some players but you will still get experience for these kills (if in range). Still, many players are belligerent and will refuse to cooperate with others in the team environment, making the most aggressive player the one to set the pace. Note that these players do not tend to appear too often, but they will from time to time. That brings us to powers; great at low-medium levels, supplements at high levels. Because there is little motivation to play high levels, many players choose more fragile warframes with AoE powers to decimate mobs quicker and ones to quickly traverse the levels and attempt to get every kill (there are kill leaderboards). This can cause problems for players who are levelling as experience has a very short range on it, as well as consistent enemy spawning since spawn points move throughout the level as the players do. Here are some nice redeeming qualities however about the game; you (technically) never have to spend a dime on this game to play it and do everything the game has to offer. You can build every weapon and warframe, and even construct your own 'clan dojo' (guild hall) and unlock the 'guild only' weapons in this manner individually, without purchasing the for-money currency, and many players will buy fully upgraded mods for said currency. My opinion overall is; it's free, so try it! You may not get into it at first, but it is worth playing. The skill base is limitless, and while it may take a little extra time to get the hang of some aspects properly it is an excessively fun game, especially with friends. Also, this game is still actively being updated and added to which helps boost my rating. 78% approval; lacking in variety of gameplay, but still high in excitement

Shotguns, rifles, lasers, grenade launchers, pistols, akimbo pistols, needle guns, flamethrowers, and more. Oh, and did i mention you can melee too? Everything from katanas and broadswords to dual axes and polearms, and a freaking glaive. A melee weapon that you can charge and throw that returns to your hand. How awesome is that? Add to all this a super fluid parkour/acrobatics system, a deep engaging crafting system, and ongoing updates and events. A+ all the way. Also, one more thing... it's free.

review: Space Ninjas play for free. Free to Play defines this game extremely well. The fact that most FTP games are pay to win, this game is the exact opposite. This game is Play to Win. Sure you can spend money and buy things, but you can literally unlock everything (except for colors, slots, and aesthetic features) in game. There are items in game that you have to play to unlock, you can't buy everything. The play style of Warframe is amazing, it's PvE with groups of four. Sure you can run solo, but it's a lot more fun to play with groups. The beginning is somewhat slow, but once you hit around the third planet and you figure everything out, this game is simply amazing. The graphics are breath-taking, I could go very in-depth about this game, but I'll let you decide if you enjoy it or not. Just think about this one phrase, "Space-Ninjas".

review: Warframe Review This game can be very fun, I personally give it an 8/10, and I believe it's pretty damn good ADVANTAGES - Has great graphics, better than alot of games out there - Has interesting factions and interesting weapons, and Grineerish is just pure awesome - Most of the game can be accessed for free, by crafting or as login rewards - The whole Solar System is free and can be done with any warframe - Every warframe and weapon have advanteges and disadvantages, this makes them fairly well ballanced - The game is Free to Play DISADVANTAGES - Some items cannot be aquired for free, they must be bought for "platinum" - The game has microtransactions which is never a good sign, but they don't give any overpowered items - Colors are not free, palletes cost 75 platinum each, along with most cosmetic items - Platinum is very hard to get without paying money - Ridiculous crafting times starting at 12 hours to 72 hours Overall I think this game is worth a shot, I have been playing for almost a year now (since the early beta) If you are willing to pay real world money for platinum, I recommend waiting until you get a discount as a login reward, I also highly recommend doing research on the wiki before craftin/buying items Happy hunting Tenno! - Crazy

It is not pay2win unless you have money to buy things instantly but you can still have the full experience without paying. You must try this game out if you dont have it or never tried it. I would rate this game 9/10, because the only thing I dont like about the game, is that its all about grinding and sometimes feels repetitve. If you play with friends, its more enjoyable. You dont even need a gaming computer for this, my laptop with intell 4000 graphic card can handle this game on low settings. Dont look at the Metascore, it does'nt deserve below 70/100.

review: Warframe is a co-operative, free-to-play, sci-fi shooter game developed by Digital Extremes (DE) for the PC and PlayStation 4. It is set in a distant future where the solar system is torn between a hyper-militarist clone empire, profit-driven technological merchants, and infested mutants/zombies. The player takes the role of a "Tenno", a member of a fourth faction with a blurry past and roots in ninja themes, and is guided by an entity called "the Lotus" through missions including timed survival, prisoner rescue, sabotage, and many more. The players is always pitted against enemies in superior numbers. To this end, players have at their disposal a varied arsenal of weapons both archaic and fantastic, and, most notably, a special suit of armor called the Warframe, each of which has a particular set of abilities. Despite being primarily a shooter game, the gameplay has a definite focus on the agility of the Warframes, featuring some parkour elements, and the way each Warframes abilities allow for creativity in combat. To sum it up this is a very good game.

review: Warframe, the ultimate 'free to play' game. This game has brought me and my friends much fun from just defeating a unlimited amount of hordes that consist aliens known as either the Corpus or Grineer. While playing this game, I wondered why this game is for free? it has desired gameplay, good graphics, and incrediable looking weapons. As well while knowing that you can spend cash on items; it's best not to, since you can already unlock after completeing certain objectives if your patient. For the designing company who made this, thank you, for my laptop is just lucky enough to play this Apple of Eden. An the only negatives I can see this game are that the game can get boring if your not fond of having to repeat the same goals - though I've come to understand that most games' are, therefore I enjoy this game. 8.7/10

review: The story is terrible, the graphics are good but not anything special, the gameplay is repetetive and requires a lot of 'grinding' to get anywhere. However for some reason its my favourite game and i find it completely addictive, it might be the space ninja robots, it might the super fun movement system or vast array of weapons and characters, i'm not sure but i love it. 9/10!

review: This game is really good, and not good good, but so good, it will explode your brain *Don't take it too literally tho* Its about you, a Tenno, which will stand up, and kill everyone.. Well, not everyone, but most of the enemies, including the Grineer, so this game, is just a freerun run&gun magic game, interesting boss-fights, and new-player friendly, which is always good. It gives you the freedom of crafting your own gun, hence you got the blueprint and the required materials, which are sometimes hard to find, but sometimes as simple of killing everyone and farming the crap out of it :D The gameplay is hard to master in my opinion, as in the beginning, even if its new-player friendly, the running and shooting mechanics can be hard to master, but if you just put some time in it (Sadly, i don't really have that much time for it because of real life stuff) it will get easier. Its beautiful, with great graphich, and even a low-end pc can run it on low settings. Overall, a great game, still some room for improvement on some parts of it, but, for the most of it, its an amazing game, worth the shot to play :)

review: The gameplay is quick, fun, and solid. There isn't many inbalances in the combat. Going to a higher level area means you will die, pretty straight forward. While the parkour feels a bit forced sometimes with how your character will snap into a sequence of moves which launches you off a cliff, it works well when it's done intentionally. I usually loathe Co-Op games, I prefer single player. And this game does allow solo play (which ramps down the enemies in number and skill, I love that.) There are missions that require co-op play, and turning the game to a public match is one button, lovely. It feels a lot more refined a co-op experience than most. As an F2P game I have to talk about P2W. There is none. A lot of games claim to have P2W and don't. P2W by some is that this game allows quick advancement. That's not Pay2Win, you can access everything except cosmetics in game, for free. It may take longer to get, but you can get it free. Stuff is reasonably priced, and sometimes you can get 25-50-75% discounts on premium currency (platinum) as a daily reward (among lots of other things.) Which it's then recommended you wait until you get a discount to buy any dosh. There are things like how many weapons you can have at once, and how many warframes you can have at once. This is all increased with platinum. Did I mention a new account grants you 50 platinum? Which you can use on cosmetics, or slots, or daily revives? Yeah that's there. My only complaint is the raw time you have to invest. You can only rank up once a day. Which is frustrating. But I guess it keeps people from advancing faster than others. Understandable, but when if you fail a rank up test you have to wait 24 hours is rediculous. I'd understand 4-12 hours, but not a whole day. Crafting is out of the picture for the most part for the first few days of existance. You will not be able to aquire the parts to craft even lower end gear until you get further into the game. Which you can't do because your gear is bad, so you're relying on the luck of the drop to get enough mods to make your low end gear not suck. Again, I understand they don't want accellerated advancements. New gear though, doesn't mean BETTER (with the exception of Prime variants), your weapon starts at lvl 0, and goes up to 30, which allows you to mod it further along that track. It doesn't really take long to get something to lvl 30, a weapon if used a lot can get to lvl 30 in a days worth of (hardcore) playing. Recommended. Yes. gg.

The game is ment for people who just want to kill Stuff and complete the objective while Upgradeing their character. I found it Extremely annoying to get matirials for Warframes,Guns and Melee weapons Other then that,This game Deserves alot of credit and sometimes it feels pay to play becuase of the customaztions options Like the Sydanas which are cool looking scarfs but cost Platinum(Real money) Or a skin. If you dont care about time Consuming Or the looks of your character and just want to have fun This game is ment for you :D

OK you go and be back packed another round see how you feel after that. as i said it could have been a nice game with a nice reward system but instead, playing this game makes me like im being deliberately incovenienced into paying and paying and paying. to that i say Thanks but no thanks

review: Incredibly fun, like a mix space, and ninjas. dare I say, space ninjas. You are the Tenno, a race of organisms that have been in cryosleep for a long time. When the Factions of the Grinneer, the Corpus, and the Infested start to overtake the solar system and its outlying planets the Tenno have been awakened by the Lotus, the mainframe for Tenno communication and status, to stop them in their tracks. For a free to play game, unlike many that have tons of microtransactions, this game has 0% of pay to win. All items in this game can be acquired through effort and playtime, and yes, some grinding. It has a fun playstyle and its playerbase is incredibly helpful and supportive of new players. its environment gets slightly boring in a short time, but you get a small respite in certain planets, like earth. Along with void missions, derelict missions, nightmare mode, and invasions/alerts. This game definitely has replayability. If you are a player who loves getting achievements and 100% a game then this game will not be for you unless you have the apt amount of time to give it. It does take a long time to get certain things, and some of the items you get are completely random to the point where you will need other player help, but based on the solo difficulty the game was obviously never meant to be played 100% solo.

Want a weapon that punctures through enemies and sticks em to a wall when you kill em? You can get that. Want to cut enemies in half and listen to thier dying screams as you tear apart thier ship in an effort to complete your goal? You can do that. Want to be a pirate/space ninja that can wall run? You can do that to. All in all, I really enjoy this game and if you can find a friend or two, or more and set up a clan/guild you're garunteed to have a blast.

review: This story requires a bit of setup. Last year, a friend of mine whom I'd known from gaming for a long time contacted me and told me about this great new game that was in beta that he was backing as a founder (called a "Grandmaster" in-game) called Warframe. A third person cooperative shooter with elements of Phantasy Star Online/Diablo loot runs, procedurally generated levels, and more content being added all the time. The game was difficult to start, as there are many keys for various secret parkour maneuvers. Running along walls! Sliding down ziplines! Soon, I was completely hooked; my friend and I were playing late into the night, trying to grind out just one more piece necessary to build a new component or weapon, or trying to beat our best time on the Survival missions -- where you fend off an ever growing wave of foes as life support ticks down. Over the year, there were many great victories, hair raising last second escapes, and new friends joining our little group. Many hours were spent joking around with each other on Skype, cracking jokes, blasting weird songs at each other, and coming up with our own stupid little catchphrases. Flash forward a year; Warframe now has space combat, new Warframes, new weapons, and new combat controls. The game still has its original style, but it's so much improved. Last week, our four player regular team developed some incredible strategies that let us get further than we ever had on wave defense missions. The only thing that made us stop was getting tired. On Tuesday, my friend who invited me to the game a year ago didn't show up that night. I found out on Wednesday that he had passed away suddenly from an undiagnosed health condition. The shock of it is still hitting us hard. The friendships that we had formed through the game, gone in an instant. It hardly feels real. I keep expecting him to log in and be there, ready to do another defense mission, and it's difficult to accept that we'll be going it alone now. We contacted Digital Extremes, the company that makes the game, and asked if there was anything we could do. They dedicated their 11/20/2014 episode of their webcast to the memory of our friend and read our memorials to him on the air. Their reactions were heartfelt and touching. They really do listen to and react to the community. I not only recommend the game for how much fun it is (I recommend you play it with a group of friends on voice chat -- up to four per session; your gameplay experience may vary alone, and form a clan or join one just because many items are clan-only), I recommend it for how responsive the game developers are to the community. They constantly improve it and add new content, items, and weapons. There is a storyline that is unfolding. The voice acting is delightful. You could easily play this game without spending a single dollar of real world currency on it (real world currency is used for cosmetics and increasing the number of Warframes and weapons you can own, or buying things that you can't wait for). Thanks, Digital Extremes. And rest in peace, Woxit.

review: | Update (24/4/14): It has been a fairly significant chunk of time since I wrote this review of Warframe, and some elements of the game have been expanded upon in ways that alleviate some of the issues I originally had. The premium currency, platinum, can now be traded between players. This provides an option for players who do not wish to put money into the game but want to participate in using the storefront. Users in the comments have pointed out that there are many powerful items which are not available in the store - if you want them, you'll need to grind. Multiple new game modes exist, including "Invasion", a mode which allows players to team up together with the Corpus or the Grineer to work against the opposing faction. This mode gives the player some agency in the kinds of rewards he receives for completing the mission. The latest update introduced Melee 2.0, which delivered improvements to the game's melee combat. The most interesting update comes in the form of Dark Sectors. Clans and alliances can own parts of the Solar System, and can fight for that contested ownership. Clans and Alliances can also set tax and resource requirements on anyone who accesses their conquered territories, leading to territorial battles for supremacy. In conclusion, a decent amount of content has been added to the game. While the core argument of my review holds true, Warframe is finally approaching the level of depth required to elevate itself above a mere grinding game. The new "EVE Online"-esque sector mechanics are particularly promising in that regard. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | Original Review (25/11/13) A great-looking, initially interesting game that feels like one compelling part of what should be a greater whole. Warframe is an interesting entry in the free to play space. It has the looks and the gameplay, but after a while it begins to feel lacking in the way of substance. Gameplay largely involves clearing your way through various missions types as you progress in rank, leveling up your weapons and your Warframe (the game's metaphor for various Classes, each having their own unique abilities, advantages, disadvantages and so on) as you shoot a myriad of alien Grineer, infested hordes, and Corpus robots. Missions range from rescue scenarios where a hostage must be located and escorted to safety, to mobile defense missions where waves of increasingly difficult enemies must be held off as you protect a moving objective. These can all be completed solo, but are made more interesting by grouping up with other players. Higher level missions are tricky by yourself, making teaming up the more attractive proposition. Weapons and Warframes can be augmented with various modifcations that apply the standard Action RPG fare - elemental damage bonuses, increased critical hit damage, faster reload speeds, you name it. This allows for some diversity in gameplay between players, where you may opt to build out your Warframe in a more supportive role, or stock up on mods which provide a more tanky character. So far the game has been well supported with semi-regular content updates and special events, usually in the form of new warframes and weapons, and a "community effort" in which everyone can participate. The only "issue" is that the game is a bit of a grind. In fact, it's a complete grinding game. The main reason for going on missions is in the hopes of accumulating various materials with which to craft the new warframes or weapons. You can use the games "premium" currency to expedite the process of manufacturing said items (which take hours, days of real time to craft) or simply buy them outright from a storefront. Why do you want these new weapons and warframes? To grind more efficiently for materials. This might strike you as a monotonous loop, and to an extent it is, but the joy of the gameplay itself goes a way to allievating the game from being a total bore. Inevitably though you may become tired of the treadmill. The game sometimes feels like it is skirting the boundaries of being gross about its "free to play" nature - you can certainly get almost everything in the game without spending if you're willing to commit to the grind, but it can sometimes feel like game systems are designed to encourage you to give up and bring out your wallet - namely the sheer amount of materials required to craft better equipment, and the time spent waiting for these items to actually be built. It's always questionable when a F2P game includes a long timer alongside a button to make it go away for just a few pounds. Ultimately, if you're just looking for a good looking, nice playing third person shooter with online components and a decent aesthetic, you can do far worse than Warframe. After spending some time with it, however, you might wind up wishing there was a little more to the experience beyond what is currently available.

review: Before you read into this review, let me ask you one question. Do you think fun is the most important thing in any game? If you answered yes, stick around and keep reading. If you answered no, you probably wouldn't like Warframe. Warframe gets a lot of flak for being repetative, but I personally feel that the reviewers who complain about the gameplay being repetative are failing to see the bigger picture. Warframe is not about a deep, gripping narrartive or memorable characters, it's about action, fun, and pretty crazy weapon variety. And to top it all off, everything that impacts gameplay can be obtained for free. Warframe is a very specialized game, focused on action, flare, and fun. And boy oh boy does Warframe nail action and fun. With over a dozen unique Warframes(Powersuits used by the player, each with their own unique abilities and stats) to choose from you're sure to find one that you really enjoy playing as. And then there's the weapons. Oh boy, the weapons. This game has almost every kind of Sci-Fi weapon I can think of. We have small scale particle cannons, Beefy sniper rifles, plasma casters, living weapons that shoot everything from Electricity to streams of deadly viruses, an insanely powerful rocket launcher, a Grenade launcher with remote detonation, powerful bows, a gun that shoots spinning saw blades, and of course the obligatory pew-pew assualt rifles to ease new players into the experience. Oh, but that's just the Primaries. In every mission, you will have the option to carry a Primary, a Secondary, and a Melee but you can choose to carry only 1 or 2 if you please. The Secondaries include but are not limited to: Living weapons that shoot Corrosive darts and poison gas, a goo gun that shoots sticky globs of acid that eat right through armor, 2 deadly hand cannons, one of which shoots many metal balls in a shotgun spread while the other shoots a spread of radiation blasts, Miniature plasma casters, rapid fire dual pistols, a spread-rocket launcher that they somehow compressed into the size of a pistol, a pistol that shoots bolts that can pin enemies to walls, deadly and accurate burst fire pistols, pocket snipers, Revolvers, a Lever action beast, Throwing knives, Throwing stars, and a Standard semi-auto pistol to ease new players in. And then there's my favorite weapon class, the Melee. We've got Greatswords that can hit numerous enemies in a wide arc, more conservative longswords that swing fast and allow better mobility while attacking, Dual daggers which generate an incredibly fast flurry of slashes and stabs, whips for when you want the range of a greatsword but the mobility of a longsword, there's also the polearms, Heavy axes, Heavy hammers, ROCKET HAMMER, and even the Thrown melee weapons, useful for killing at a distance while conserving ammo and for stealth kills. More recently Digital Extremes added in 2 Katanas and a set of claws that pop out of your arms like Wolverine. Melee has become much more prominent lately now that DE has completely revamped it. No longer do you simply mash or hold E, now you can perform different combos that require different inputs. These combos are assigned to stance mods that you can apply to your weapon. Each melee weapon class I mentioned above has at least 1 stance mod, and each mod comes with it's own unique combos that are useful for different purposes and situations. My favorites are the Katanas with Decisive Judgement as the stance. I use it to make my tenno look and fight like Vergil from Devil May Cry 3. So yes, Warframe can seem repetative to some people, but not to me. I greatly enjoy the vast arsenal that is placed before me, and I truly believe that these tools of destruction make up for the lack of deep narrative. That said, I thoroughly recommend Warframe to anyone who likes Shooters or character action games, or anyone who likes having fun.

review: I've been playing this game since beta firstly came out as f2p, and game was good then but really boring, no trading, few warframes, a lot of bugs and i still got till 30th lvl before I've decided to stop. Few days ago few mates and me saw it on steam and install it again, I found my old acc and started playing again. GAME IS AWESOME NOW. The amount of bugs they cleared, stuff in stores, game mods, lvl's, optimtization's and basicly gave mostly what people asked for, they are active on forums, answering Q&A and very helpfull. Love their blogs in which they love to tease and give people news about stuff they are working on etc. Get it, great game, much fun, if you have few friends, start a clan and fight.

review: So here is the deal. Warframe is aweful. Honestly 0/10 would not play. Maybe... MAYBE 2/10 cuz swords. Other than that this game is lame. You force yourself to play a few hours, however, becuase it has gotten higher ratings than some of your favorite games. So you're in around ten hours, and you get to your first level 30 weapon. You have since then purchased and/or found other weapon parts and intended to build a superior weapon to the weapon you currently have. You give it a shot and holy dear lord is it good. And it felt pretty satisfying coming out of the 12 or 24 hour oven (foundry). So you play with that for a while and have a decent amount of fun. So okay, games not great, maybe a 5/10. At least it's free. But, becuase this new weapon is pretty good, you want to see what else is on the horizon. Rinse and repeat until about 40 hours when you realize that you've covered most of the starchart and have a few good weapons. Rinse and repeat until you can take down anything in the starchart VERY fast. Rinse and repeat until you can take out the stalkler in one hit with a meelee weapon. Rinse and repeat until you can last to 45 mins + on T4 survival. etc., etc., ,etc. 10/10 God Tier Game. Would Recommend (EVEN DROPPING CASH ON TEH GAME) TL;DR Graph of y = x where x is how much you play and y is your desire to play

review: Its a amazing and wonderful game, full of action, adventure, and that splash of violence that just makes it great. Though in the first few days or months (depending how much you play) it is difficult, mainly in money and resources, but that will soon end, and best of all, you don't have to worry that much about upgrading, since all warframes have unique abilities and traits to decide on! So I would definitly recomend this game, but for people who don't like 3rd-person view, space travel guns, lazers, swords, bows, robots, and NINJAS!!!, turn your head and find a different game.

review: - Story - "They were called Tenno. Warriors of blade and gun: masters of the Warframe armor. Those that survived the old war were left drifting among the ruins. Now they are needed once more. The Grineer, with their vast armies, are spreading throughout the solar system. A call echoes across the stars summoning the Tenno to an ancient place. They summon you. Allow the Lotus to guide you. She has rescued you from your cryostasis chamber and given you a chance to survive. The Grineer will find you; you must be prepared. The Lotus will teach you the ways of the Warframes and the secrets to unlocking their powers. Come Tenno, you must join the war." I think in my opinion is one of the best F2P games I ever played.It has: weapons, space ninjas, Archwing, character costumization, santinels, your very own pet (called Kubrow) and more. The best advice I can give you is: take your time and don't buy everything you see on market.Almost everything you see there can be created/optained through hard wark and patience. I definitely recommend this game to anyone that is looking for this kind of games...That's it, now excusie me, I need to get back and save the humanity.

I found that the mouse sensitivety is more sensetive than a menstrating teenage girl who was just dumped on prom night, even after i turned it down almost to zero. this gives the illision of extreme lag which can piss you off. everything is also shaped weird, as in enemies and such. like there armor is plated over bursting tummours which have serverly deformed them, but this keeps the game interestin and fresh. runs pretty smoothly.

review: Let us settle the most important questions first. I have been playing the game since the early closed beta, had seen the game change a lot over the course of that and the 11 updates. Now the important questions that always come up with Free to Play games. A. Is it Pay to Win: I would say no, some would assume right away that it is because you can use the real money currency (Platinum) to buy weapons and warframes. There are a few things that mitigates this: 1. Weapons/Warframes need to be leveled with experience. 2. Weapons/Warframes need mods (dropped by mobs) in order to become powerful. 3. Powerful weapons/warframes are gated with Mastery rank (sort of an account experience). Someone buying a warframe or weapon still needs to level it and get the mods for it to become powerful, which is a matter of available time. 90% of the weapons found in the store can be built with a blueprint and the available materials you collect trough the missions you do. There are powerful weapons in the game only available via random encounters, research or events. The only things that one could get from the shop: Catalyst and Reactor (used in weapons and warframes to double it's mod capacity) and Forma (this in a way helps on that too). These are only available via events and random events called Alerts (Forma however can be farmed). The only things you cannot get without platinum are: Cosmetics for pets, Weapon/Warframe/Sentinel slots, Capes, Clan badge, Warframe skins(different color patterns), colors and in game Account avatars, Affinity (exp) booster, Credit booster and Platinum to Credit exchange. B. Is it a grind: While it was in the closed beta this had gotten a lot better, drops have been increased and it is always a matter of know where to get the materials. Starting out this will be a bit rough, but after you get your second/third warframe it will not be much of a problem. So the main question is not exactly how much money you want to spend rather, do you have the time to invest in the game. If the answer is Yes, then read further, if the answer is no then you are still able to give it a try but you will get stuff at a slower pace. 1. What is Warframe? Warframe is a Co-op TPS (up to 4 people) with limited PvP (duels, 2v2 fights on selected maps), putting emphasis on fast action without having a cover system, a lot of people would say it is like Mass Effect 3 with a mission system. Especially now with the reworked damage system (with update 11). You play "Space Ninjas" and have to complete missions in a varied enviroment, you start off with one warframe of your choice from the three starter ones: Excalibur (balanced), Mag (more of a caster type) or Loki (mobility/utility frame, has no direct damaging ability). All Warframes come with 4 abilities. You fight against three factions over the course of the game, each having their own arsenal. Grineer: They are human/Cyborg people, clones who's genes are degrading with each cloning, making up for their degradation with cybernetics. They are mostly Heavily armored, with quite a few crowd control units. Possibly the most varied faction in the game. Corpus: High tech space "Merchant Guild", they operate mostly with shields and employ robotics also known as MOAs, they are fairly weak compared to the grineer but they do more damage. Infested: Space zombies and the likes, they have variations all around, have no shields at all, some have some form of armor, they compensate with health and numbers. Orokin: you will only encounter these later in the game, they consists of controlled Grineer, Corpus and Infested units. Only found in the Void missions. 2. Gameplay Warframe operates on a Solar map system, with a variety of missions available at each planet. These missions are locked in a chain and needs to be opened by playing the previous mission in the chain. When you select a mission, depending on the area it is in will Generate a map, these maps are put together from tiles, so you will notice that some rooms look the same, sometimes you can get big maps sometimes you get medium to small maps. Your objectives depend on the type of mission the map is and a few factors, sometimes there are random happenings on the mission: Change of objectives, this can happen on the fly. Faction change, you will notice this from Lotus mentioning it, this will change the enemies spawning, the original faction not only fighting you but the newly arrived faction as well, no original faction enemies spawn anymore, just the newly arrived one's. Another one of these random events is the arrival of the stalker, a powerful enemy warframe, this usually happens after boss kills and a certain factor working in the background. Mostly he arrives when you are not at full potential (like leveling a low level warframe/weapon). If you are alone he will be a tough fight, if you are with a group all you have to do is survive long enough for others to burn him down, if you triumph he will drop rewards (which can be blueprints for his weapons or mods). 3. Features Crafting, this is the thing that will take away. Get the blueprint for weapon/warframe, farm the required components and then start the craft, the time required is roughly like this: 12 hours for most weapons and weapon/warframe components (researched weapons mostly), 24 hours for Pets, Reactor/catalyst/forma and 72 hours to complete a warframe. You can rush these by using up platinum. Clans can create a sort of Clan hall, called Dojo. They can do the layout themselves and decorate it as they see fit (granted this requires materials), do weapon research, trade, duel in specific duel rooms. With update 11 people are able to trade Mods, Void Keys and Platinum, so if you have the time and there is a need for it you can trade away rare mods (upgraded mostly) for platinum from other players. Events: These happen quite frequently, sometimes this changes up the map, like a faction taking over a planet from the other. Alerts: These are generated missions appearing randomly on the map, it mentions the reward, type of the mission. Some things can only come from these alerts (Aura mods, Catalyst/Reactor, One warframe blueprint pieces, some weapons). They come up quite frequently and after every Warframe livestream. Scanning: New feature, you need to buy scanners and scan the enemies for info, including some drop table and stat information. The developers are always changing the game, tweaking here and there. This game had changed quite a lot from the start (mod system, now the damage system is overhauled). They are also working constantly on updates. Nightmare mode: Some missions will become nightmare missions, mobs are higher level and there are special modifiers for the mission (like no minimap, no shields, no energy, losing HP, etc) but if you complete it then your reward is a dual stat mod. 4. Is it worth it? I don't play too much but I like the game, if you have the time to kill and want to try a good free to play game then give it a try, you might get positively surprised.

review: I really, really enjoy Warframe. Combat wise, if you've ever played the multiplayer maps in Mass Effect 3 it is very similar. If you enjoy being able to customize your character's look and abilties, you'll very much enjoy this game. The developers are also constantly pushing out new updates that have a fair amount of content/improvements to the game. Now the game is still technically in Open Beta, and while most professional reviewers have pointed that out, their reviews are also from fairly early public builds of the game. A lot has changed in the past 5 updates or so, I really think the game needs to be revisited. The game can be challenging, or you can stride through battle slaughtering countless foes as easily as chewing gum. The choice is up to you, various game modes and varying difficulties can all be chosen by the player. While the game is free to play, and you can earn in game credits to buy and build new and more powerful gear, throwing the developers som cash can help speed the process a bit. Plus, I think the devs deserve just a bit for producing something that has given me so many hours of enjoyment, easily taking hours away from my beloved wife... ...sorry honey! So give this game a go, if you're looking for beautiful graphics, fun fast paced combat, and an ever evolving game, you won't be disappointed! Suit up Tenno, war is calling!

review: The decision to play this game is to give up on reality. Bugs, Glitches, Horrible pubbies and the nosiest lady in the world will be the order of the day. That does not automatically mean that this game is bad, because it absolutely isn't For a F2P game this is the one I had the most fun with. All the weapons and Warframes can be bought in the ingame store, but can also be found while playing The only things that can not be found ingame are vanity items. Every update is a new adventure, What will break next? Will the UI break again or will the loot table be topsy turvy again. WHO KNOWS? Try it out, Play untill you atleast get a different warframe other than the starter ones and you will be alright.

review: Haven't played in a while but, I can say this much; even before all the newer updates it was a wonderfully fast paced action game in which the missions were sensably logical and well thought out in design, now even though I haven't played in so long I would still most definitely recommend this game. I bet all the money in my wallet that more than half of the people that read this will enjoy Warframe especially since all the new updates. Thanks for taking the time to read this short little blurb and I'm serious, enjoy this game or I WILL find you and I WILL make you play it and I WILL make you enjoy it whether you like it or not. JK (for those of you that thought I was serious :P)

review: A lot of fun with friends. Good payment system. 160 hours, and I only spent $20 with plat to spare. It can be repetitive, but its fun. Its one of the few games where I've enjoyed "the grind." It kept me interested and I was happy to work towards new Warframes and Weapons. Once I got all the weapons and warframes I wanted though, I did stop playing. There wasn't anything "end game" to keep me going. But if you got friends to play with, its a good time.

Granted, the game has it's occaisional glitch and internet connectivity issues. but it's still a fun game to play.

review: Warframe is a great game. For some people. I am one of those people. This game is very innovative, because of the way it takes mmo, and mashs it with a single-player game. The controls are nice and accessible, and are also easy to learn. I myself, use a xbox controller for many games. The xbox controls for this game is also nice and feels good. The special effects is phenomenel. It looks amazing if you have a good computer. I love the wayu you can slide while shooting, use a sword to decapitate and how eye-popping it looks on my monitor. So yes, I would extremely recommend this game to another.

review: An interesting game so far.It's based on teamwork,which is crucial in this game.You can't simply go Rambo on enemies like Call of Duty,'cause you would get gangraped.You also need tactics,such as sneaking and covering behind objects.I reccomend it and wait more people to come play with me.

review: Warframe is a fun and busy game. Never a dull moment once you are in a mission. One of my favorite things about Warframe is the foundry. The Foundry is where you can make Warframes and gear with the materials you have found throughout the game. Makes you feel like you have accopmplished something and you get to show off what you made.

review: Overview: Ok, so Warframe is an over-the-shoulder shooter developed by Develeoper Extremes. It takes place many, many thousand years into the future, with diverse Warframes whose users are called 'Tenno' and a whole arsenal of weapons. Gameplay: Gun/Sword fighting is fast paced, enhanced by Warframe 'abilities'.Different tile sets with predetermined rooms organized differently make each play-through of a level unique. Players have a shield that will absorb damage, and while regenerate over time, as well as health that does NOT regenerate and causes the player to die when it hits 0. Enemies have 'levels', with higher level enemies having better stats, such as damage, armor, health, shield, etc. Warframes: This is your character. You can team up with three other players. This group is often known as a 'cell'. Each warframe has unique abilities, movement speeds, health, and shields. The starter warframes are :Excalibur, a warframe balanced in health, shields, and speed, with powerful blade abilities, a sword flashbang, and super jump, making him able to fill any position in a cell. Mag, a warframe that moves slightly faster than average, and with increased shield but reduced health, manipulates magnetism to restore allies' shields, as well as magnetise enemies so that bullets are pulled towards them, as well as pulling enemies to her, staggering them. She also is able to magnetise enemies' bones to break themselves. The third and final warframe is Loki, an advanced warframe that is the equivalent of a twig when compared to other warframes, but is able to easily avoid enemy fire with his amazing speed and abilities. His abilities allow him to create a decoy to draw fire, to swap positions with enemies or allies at range, make himself invisible, and even jam enemy electronics so that they are forced to resort to melee. These are only the starter warframes, and will serve you very well, even into late in the game. More warframes can be created by finding blueprints of warframe parts from each of their corresponding bosses. You must craft these parts of the warframe with resource, then buy a rather expensive warframe blueprint (the actual blueprint to the warframe), and use those parts to craft the warframe. Construction of a new warframe takes three days, but is very rewarding once you are in a completely new power suit! Weapons: Of course, you need a weapon in order to dispatch enemies. You will start off with a Braton Mark I, a FAMAS-looking rifle, a Lato handgun, and a Skana one-handed blade. As you progress through different planets, which all drop different resources, you will find enough resources to start making new weapons, whose blueprints may be bought from the store. Construction of a weapon will either require 12 or 24 hours. Weapons range from a plasma-firing minigun, to a saw-blade launcher! Sentinels: Sentinels are robotic pets that follow you and aid you in combat. Each sentinel has a specific ability, such as the Dethcube with a machine gun and 'vaporize' ability, that is the equivalent of a taser, and the Dethcube with a semi-automatic shotgun and 'vacuum' ability, which collects nearby items for you. Mods: Essential to the survival and combat of a warframe, mods randomly drop from fallen enemies. They are organized into 5 categories: Common, Uncommon, and Rare (Nightmare and Corrupted mods are called rare quality) .They can be applied to warframes, weapons, and sentinels, and will uniquely enhance the items they are applied, to making a single weapon unique with different mod builds on the weapon. Enemy Factions: The direct enemy in this game is the Grineer, a vast army of warriors who have been cloned repeated and seek to take over the world with sheer numbers. Men and women with completely destroyed bodily appearances and strengths caused by cloning degeneration, they rely on armor and shield-tearing weapons to defeat the warframes. They have a natural hatred of the warframes, being the only people able to stop them from their goal of world domination (But I just think they're jealous). Another enemy is the Corpus, a faction based off of economy and profit. They have high-tech laser and plasma weapons, able to shred warframe armor, and equip themselves with powerful shields, but lack bodily armor to protect themselves once their shield is down. They only want to kill warframes to dissect and salvage them, selling the pieces to the highest bidder. The third and final main faction are the Infested, a manifestation of the virus that infected the Tenno and gave them their powers. They charge and kill the Tenno on instinct, and can be considered the zombie infection of the future, with enemies being evidently infested versions of the previous two factions mentioned. Maps: The players starts at Mercury, and will eventually unlock other planets, going outward from the sun. Almost all planets have their own unique boss. New, unheard of planets have been added to diversify and increase the amount of gameplay. The player may find and build keys to access lost and forgotten parts of the Solar System... Bosses: Each boss is different, and will require teamwork and coordination to defeat. Early-game bosses require brute force to eliminate, but bosses from mid-game and on require tactical movement and attacks in order to be defeated. Assassians: As you have taken from the world, the world will take from you. Upset a faction, or a dark, angry tenno whose lore is unknown, and you may find yourself killed or maybe even captured by extremely dangerous assassians, as the lights blink as if Slenderman were there. Remember that your actions have consequences... Gamemodes: The game includes gamemods such as extermination, sabotage, capture, rescue, spy (intelligence gathering), and so much more. The games revolves around PvE, but a poor PvP system called 'Conclave' has been implemented. Clans: The implementation of clans in this game is unique. In the clan dojo, players may research into each of the enemy factions' technology, and create weapons and devices out of them to use for themselves in combat! Graphics: Excellent, but rather taxing on the computer, even on lower video settings. Now, onto your questions: Q:Will this game run on my low-end computer? A:I'm sorry, it probably won't. But it wouldn't hurt to find out yourself. Q:I HATE PAY TO WIN GAMES! A:...That wasn't even a question. However, this is one of the most fair games I have ever played. 97% of content in this game can be unlocked free of charge. The cash currency, known as 'platinum', is rather used as a trading currency used to trade with other players. Free to play players could easily earn themselves 20 platinum or so in the trade market if they tried, which is about $1.25. Very few players spend platinum in the game market. This is a complete list of platinum-exclusive items: Color Palettes (to customize the look of your warframe, weapons, and sentinel), and Extra Inventory Space, so that you can have more guns and warframes without having to sell old ones. Other than that, there's nothing that a paying player can have access to that a free player can't. Q:Will I have to grind for resources/parts of a warframe or weapon? A:Yes. But, warframes only have 3 parts whose bluepints drop from bosses, all with an equal chance of dropping, and 1 part will ALWAYS drop. This also applies to weapon parts from bosses. Resources are relatively easy to farm, and you will find yourself loaded with all but the rare resources by mid-game. Q:Are weapons balanced? A:I'm afraid not. Weapons are usually categorized into 3 tiers by players, and tier 3 weapons will absolutely crush tier 1 weapons. But almost no one plays the broken PvP in this game. Summary: When I speak highly of this game, I mean it. This is a beautifully made game, and I definitely suggest that you should give it a whirl. Stop reading this, and install the game!

Although it is a free to play game its not pay to win, the vast majority of items in game you can get without spending a cent or a penny in real life. It just takes a little time and determination. Exceptions are ofcourse items that make your warframe look better and colors (if you play it youll see). It is worth at least a try and if you get hooked on it dont blame me :D Its certainly not a game for all, but for those that like melee weapons, this game is for you.

review: Grind! Grind! Grind! That's what you might think. But honestly, it only takes a few hours of life leech to get another Warframe. Otherwise? Enjoy the randomly generated levels and repetitive gameplay. It's not very bad, but if you can't find a purpose within all the hours of gameplay, it might not be for you. Oh, and despite the graphics, it runs quite smoothly.

review: The Best Free2Play game today. 3rd person shooter with amazing graphics and gameplay. It is not pay2win unless you have money to buy things instantly but you can still have the full experience without paying. You must try this game out if you dont have it or never tried it. I would rate this game 9/10, because the only thing I dont like about the game, is that its all about grinding and sometimes feels repetitve. If you play with friends, its more enjoyable. You dont even need a gaming computer for this, my laptop with intell 4000 graphic card can handle this game on low settings. Dont look at the Metascore, it does'nt deserve below 70/100.

review: Great fun, slick and smooth. Really comes into its own after a few hours play as you can get into customising your Warframe(s) and weapons. (And by then you'll have some idea how to go about setting up your frame and weapon modifications.) Metacritic scores don't do this game justice - they were all given out by reviews made when the game was in early beta. It was pretty good then, it's better now. Top quality alien shooter action. The criticism I hear levelled at this game time and again is that it's not completely free to play. You do need to put a little bit of money into it for slots for new weapons and warframes and probably for items called orokin reactors which increase how many modifications you can load into your setup. In addition to this, while it is possible to get pretty much anything in the game through playing it, you have to repeat the same mission ad nauseum if you want to get all of the components for one warframe or item right away. I think a number of people who are giving it the highest praise are the people willing to drop some real dollar into the game to purchase items from time to time. In this way, and if you're a collector, you could easily spend a great deal of cash. Nevertheless, the core gameplay is slick, it'll cost you nothing to play it perfectly adequately for a few days and it has throat-singing in its soundtrack. Try it, It's free.

review: One of the two best games currently on the F2P circuit, both of which happen to be self-published. Digital Extremes is a group that cares deeply about its player base, involves and keeps them updated with all aspects of development, and responds promptly to critical emergencies. They're working very hard at making a PvE-exclusive TPS in the vast sea of PvP domination. No matter how you view the project at its various stages, you have to give them immense credit for going full throttle at this. Nothing but applause. Edit: Should note that at the time of this OP, the game did not have the Clan Dojo Dueling Room or the Conclaves. Nevertheless, focus on PvP modes has remained a secondary priority for Digital Extremes, and they are still standing fast behind their commitment to PvE.

(but what if you already like the warframe you have? what do i sink creds into then, CONSUMABLES??????

review: Let's see Warframe it's a sci-fi game with exosuits (space-ninjas) fighting the ugly bad guys. Well you can basiclly buy almost anything in the cash shop, including cosmetics. This game is immensly fun with friends, and trying out the AMAZING weapons, there are katanas, whips, laser guns, shotguns, freeze rays, and many more. Now the maps are the same, and can feel repetitve, because it is, although some of the levels look really cool... well compared to the other maps. Now the gameplay could range to really boring to really fun, that depends on what weapons you using and how you use them. Now the Warframes are the exosuits the players can wear, it gives them special powers, like jumping high, iron skin, healing, and mind control. Getting warframes can be very difficult, and that brings me to my next point, the learning curv is very steep so you need to watch youtube videos on how to play properly, thes game is also very difficult so if you like that then good. So in the end, do i recommend this game? Well if you like what you've seen here then go play this, if this turnes you off, then you can try it i guess. So I personally enjoyed this game immensly, but i didn't let that get in the way of the recommendation of this game. This Review is just my opinion.

review: (Review may be subject to changes as the game's still in beta) + No paywalls. A very important thing in a F2P game. + The game's fun. + Fluid combat and movement. + Good graphics. + Lots of weapons to choose from. - The entire game is a grindfest. The only goal in this game is to increase your Mastery Rank and get more weapons to grind with. Amazing. - No dedicated servers with high bandwidth and PC performance requirements for hosting. This turns most public games into unenjoyable lagfests. - Ridiculous cash shop prices on Warframes and weaponry. - Major balance issues with all equipment in the game, especially with new weapon releases. Which essentially is power creep. - No variety. - No real difficulty. Most of it is just artificial difficulty with stat increases. - Community lacks brain cells. - Terrible PvP. Yes, PvP is just a thing that was added because everyone asked for it and it's definitely not the focus of the game, but that doesn't mean I can't criticize it. - Nonexistent AI. - No endgame content. Warframe has had a lot of potential which it showed back in early Open Beta. However, the game has taken a turn for the worse with more and more grinding and power creep put into it. It's a fun game to play at first, but as you progress and increase your Mastery Rank, you will notice that the only thing you're doing is grinding your  off. 75/100

review: This game is amazing for a free to play and the only bug that i have found is that once in excavation the scanner stayed at 100% power and the drill wouldn't spawn, but apart from that and a few clan dojo glitches the game runs really well 10/10.

review: Warframe is an amazing game for emphasizing your playstyle, each weapon is suited to a specific playstyle, or adaptive to MAKE it fit your playstyle, this also can be said about the Warframes themselves. Mods further enhance playstyle to the very elements you want to fire out of your gun! While it is a grind, after that first loadout is bought and you have a new melee, primary, and secondary weapon, it becomes a game of using awesome mods and unique effects for each gun to mow down hundreds of enemies in different ways, using abilities let's you master the flow of combat. Another thing great about this game is the animations, while they are triggered by player use on some, which can be a bit sudden, all animations look so smooth, and each weapon even has unique combos, stealth kills, finishers, and so on. I would highly recommend this game to anyone, and it's FTP, but not necessarily PTW, the developers themselves said that everything in the game (besides color packs and Excalibur Prime, the donator frame) is obtainable for free. Grinding to get a new weapon can be fun with friends, and the combat is so satisfying most of the time.

review: The game is a lot of fun but repetitive so it can get boring fast. Its a lot more fun if you play with friends so that its less boring. At a certain point progressing does require you to pay for more weapon or frame slots. If you don't then you will have to trash , remake and lvl up what you already have to continue progressing your rank. Lucky the slots aren't expensive.

review: While fun, the game has three free "classes" to pick in the begining. The other "classes" are avalible with by use real world money to buy in game points to obtain the other "classes"; with the most expensive ones being about 20$. Wareframe plays exceptionaly well, and is just plain fun; especially with other players/your friends. However, because Wareframe is free the majority of the gameplay is essentially pay-to-win due to the better items and other "classes" being available through the use of real world money. That's not to say that Wareframe is a bad game, because it's not, but this one aspect is enough to be a huge turn-off for some people.

review: Would you happen to be a fan of ninja? Maybe a fan of space? Perhaps you are one of the refined few that have a developed taste for space ninja? Well, I have great news for you. Warframe is a space ninja game where you play as a space ninja and use your wide array of ninjitsushis like sudoku and guns to combat fierce enemies like space marines with genetic defects and Isaac Clarke's extended family, as well as a dense strain of the dreaded hepatitis B. You can play with your friends, and can perform a number of exciting tasks such as raiding spaceships to steal your enemy's money and trading cards, running and jumping on the walls like a hyperactive primate, and murder. 's good, play it.

review: How to start... Well, warframe is an action/fps/hack n' slash game so addictive at the beginning, you will be surprised of the amazing and funny gameplay and method to obtain the stuff, it's easy, it's attractive, it's "fast", it's cooperative, etc, you will be interested in being more powerfull with better mods/weapons/warframes, etc, later you will have a feel that it's a bit repetitive the gameplay, then the absence of a decent vs multiplayer mode (like; capture the flag, deathmatch, control points, king of the hill, etc) will make you feel a void in your soul, then you will feel a lil disappointed when you realize WF in some cases is too P2W, and etc etc... Afterall, seeing that WF is still on develop, you will say that is not that bad, when you have your mates there; it's an amazing game to play and always it will make you go deep on it and having you playing more and more, obtaining what you want to obtain because it's true, you can obtain the 90% of the stuff without pay (certainly, slots system is a bit abusive) and with all of this in mind you will say "Ok, lets try again to see if the boss finally drop the blueprint? :)" and you will repeat this again and again... 9/10

review: Damn good for a free to play, one of the best I've ever encountered. The start is a bit rough but once you get the flow of it, it becames super fun. The combat and weapon system is really unique, and the movement is unlike any other game I've played before. Downsides are it gets a bit grindy, but the way they implimented the game it works out well. You rank up by using more guns and increasing your skill with them. No weapons are off limits to people who don't want to dump real money into it, but your pool of weapons and frames will be limited. Even then there are events and promotions that give weapons you can just delete and keep the open slot. A really fun and interesting game, the best part is the developers are very active and quick about hearing the community's word, and take a great deal of care into making sure the feedback they get doesn't fall on deaf ears.

review: Warframe has improved so much from its humble beginnings but has shown so much improvement simply due to the receptive and ambitious nature of its developer. Its a great squad based PvE combat shooter that keeps things interesting with a pleatura of frames (characters) and weapons. The in game upgrade system utilizes in-game found mods that lets players pick and choose how to custimize said frames and playstyle. The environments and enemies can get old after a while and it can feel a bit grindy at times but implementation of trading, in game events and clan dojos have kept things fresh enough to keep me coming back for more.

This game is literally an amalgam of the best elements of the FPS and RPG genres, all in one tightly bound package. FFS WHO DOESN'T LOVE SPACE NINJAS!!!

review: Warframe is a good sci-fi co-op mission game which has promising potential to be a great game but right now contains many annoying bugs which need to be fixed for it to be great. There is still much more room for improvement such as the user interface and animation set. If the developers can fix some basic issues, they will potentially have one of the best game's of its genre. Right now, I give this game in September 2014 a 7/10.

review: This game is hard to review given its state. It's still being worked on, but I feel like it's gone far enough to the point I can properly give it an honest review. Actually, I am really glad that the developers are putting so much effort into it. You can always look forward to new things from a very hard working team. That's something you don't see a lot of. They have done a whole lot of good here. It makes me happy. So what is Warframe? It's a very grindy third person shooter centered around what I believe are suits of armor, although it's not really mentioned what you are, this is what I assume. The story is currently in development, but the core game play up until now has revolved around the grind. There are a plethora of weapons: Primary, Secondary, and Melee... along with your very own warframe. Your warframe is given four abilities in itself which also revolve around the theme of said frame. It's highly customizeable and you can craft anything you can buy with the exception of colors and armor pieces. Crafting can take up to 24 hours. If you're making a warframe it's possible it could take up to four days... but I consider that a plus, because no matter what you do, you feel productive in your doing it. The game is free to play which is pretty astounding considering the graphic intensity and how well it's put together. If you want to support them it wouldn't hurt to buy some stuff for at least customization. Although it's not necessary, it's good to point out that your warframe can be a reflection of you, if you so choose. I really liked that. Warframe is beautiful. In recent updates it's filled with newer tile sets, and in the most recent (as of this review) you're given a ship and a small companion through the quest system. The ship makes accessing your arsenal in an orderly manner fun, and the interface for your crafting system and mods is pretty amazing looking. The meat of the game revolves around modifications. You will find mods everywhere as you grind for materials to build new things. Trust me, there are just as many mods as there are weapons... and there are a TON. You can mod your weapons for elemental damage, combine elemental mods to make new elemental damage types. You can mod your frame for more health, shields, endurance, or just whatever feels good for you. It depends on your build and play style, and it can be a good time if you experiment enough. All weapons are viable given the right mods. The last thing I want to talk about in this review is the clan dojo. You basically build your dojo from scratch. The corridors, the room types, decorations, levels, all kinds of awesome stuff. It's complete with research on weapons and even a few warframes you can't get anywhere else. I recommend you grab some friends and make a clan dojo to get the most out of the game if you're the grindy type! No game is complete without its negatives. Honestly there are quite a few... but the game is still in development, and if you have developers that are competent enough than that's a great thing. It's a grind heavy game, and the mentality seems to be to blaze through the levels as fast as you can. This can really throw off new players trying to get in on the action. The combat is fast paced... but if you take the time to learn you will most likely be zipping ahead as well. Parkour is a bit difficult to grasp, but that also takes a little practice. The controls are fluid for the most part. Over all the mayhem is a good time. If you ever find yourself in the position to kill, or blow up baddies and some intense third person grinding as what is widely known as a "space ninja" than have fun in this ever growing sci-fi universe, because this is the game for you.

If you have friends to play with it will only increase the amount of amusement that you have. It's not pay-to-win which is with almost every free to play game and it will keep you entertained for hours upon hours. I have been playing this game for over a year now and I can't get enough of it with their constant updates that add new stuff every week! Keep it up DE!

review: The storyline isn't exactly in depth, and there are a few (minor) bugs. However, Warframe is a fantastic creation and a very pleasant game to share with friends. A friend of mine constantly told me to download it. When he finally bugged me enough, I downloaded it and played it for the rest of the night. Now we have a group of about 5+, made entirely of personal friends. The game can be challenging, even with a full squad (of 4), but the way the game is balanced to feature all playstyles works well with my group! For a free game, Warframe can be played without purchase quite easily! I'll admit, about $20 makes the run a little more fun, but you can function without the use of money very well! I can't wait to see this game in the future! Excellent game!

game-hours: 271.4
review: So here is the deal. Warframe is aweful. Honestly 0/10 would not play. Maybe... MAYBE 2/10 cuz swords. Other than that this game is lame. You force yourself to play a few hours, however, becuase it has gotten higher ratings than some of your favorite games. So you're in around ten hours, and you get to your first level 30 weapon. You have since then purchased and/or found other weapon parts and intended to build a superior weapon to the weapon you currently have. You give it a shot and holy dear lord is it good. And it felt pretty satisfying coming out of the 12 or 24 hour oven (foundry). So you play with that for a while and have a decent amount of fun. So okay, games not great, maybe a 5/10. At least it's free. But, becuase this new weapon is pretty good, you want to see what else is on the horizon. Rinse and repeat until about 40 hours when you realize that you've covered most of the starchart and have a few good weapons. Rinse and repeat until you can take down anything in the starchart VERY fast. Rinse and repeat until you can take out the stalkler in one hit with a meelee weapon. Rinse and repeat until you can last to 45 mins + on T4 survival. etc., etc., ,etc. 10/10 God Tier Game. Would Recommend (EVEN DROPPING CASH ON TEH GAME) TL;DR Graph of y = x where x is how much you play and y is your desire to play

review: Be a Space Ninja and planet hop a dystopian Solar System while grinding your face to the ground to climb the Mastery Ranks! Be warned as this is a game which IS BETTER WITH FRIENDS. You're gonna have a bad time running Solo, so get with some friends and play this game. If you dont have any friends that dont play it/dont want to play it, then you're ed. Overall, I very much approve.

review: Warframe may be a bit grind-heavy, and waiting for your items to build is a pain, Warframe is a really fun F2P third-person shooter MMO. Thankfully, unlike most F2P games, almost every item in the game can be obtained in some way, permanently, without use of any real cash if you are willing to invest the immense amount of time to do so. No real pay to win  here, just pay to speed things up. This is a pretty good model in comparison to  you see in Nexon games for example. Aside from rushing items or getting rare orokin catalysts/reactors and forma (3 very important items to leveling up) outside of events that give them out for free, the only things you necessarily need to pay for are costmetics such as color palettes and armor decoration. When you get your first bunch of platinum (the in-game real-money paid currency), hold onto it, and don't waste it on guns (get the blueprints instead, those can be retrieved with normal credits which are free by playing), or anything that isn't necessary. Use your plat for cosmetics, or Orokin Catalysts/Reactors (but only if you urgently need them then and there and there isn't an event available). As for the game itself, Warframe's gameplay is fast-paced and frantic. There's a huge emphasis on both ranged and melee combat, and the Melee system is really neat, kind of combining typical TPS melee combat with a God of War-style combo system. There is also some parkour in the game, allowing you to run along and up walls, vault over objects, and do slides, spin-dashes, etc. The guns in the game are for the most part satisfying to use, and feel beefy (such as the Latron), and leveling them up/modding them is surprisingly deep and complex. Mixing damage types depending on what faction you're fighting is very important and something you'll be doing regularly, same with applying mods that build on a weapon's strengths (such as fire rate, damage, mag size, etc). The Enemy Ai, while it definitely isn't the smartest, it is coordinated and different enemy units will try to flank you, take cover, and some brave units may try to hunt you down and find your position if you've run out of sight. However extremely rare, if a fight is going south for the enemy, they'll flee which is also interesting to see. You progress through the game by playing various missions of different types, some involve simply killing everyone(extermination), defending an object of interest from destruction (defense), defending multiple hackable terminals (mobile defense), and much more. There's a lot of variety, and almost every mode save for extermination requires some level of teamwork. With the Archwing update coming out soon, the game will be a lot more diverse, adding full space combat to the mix as well. This is one of the most anticipated updates to the game thus far, and with good reason... It's a big game-changer, literally. The biggest downsides to the game are that the Voice-chat sucks and has horrible quality, the game can be very buggy / freeze prone at times, the netplay can be bandwidth intensive, you can only have parties of 4 players on a mission, and there's a lot of older weapon mods and warframe abilities that are currently becoming less viable as new content rolls in and other elements of the game get new features/improvements. The new stuff ends up leaving older stuff in the dust, in short. Digital Extremes, the developer, plan on rectifying this soon thankfully. In short, it's a great game, it still has issues, but those are quickly evaporating. If you like fast-paced cooperative action with some RPG elements thrown in, plenty of loot, decent AI, satisfying guns, and lots of blood/gore, you'll like this game. As a slightly off-topic note - Digital Extremes (who made this) also made one of the best games of all time; Unreal Tournament 2004, alongside Epic Games back in the day, so give that a look too.

review: Pretty fun and exciting game, lots of weapons and characters. There are many things you can do in this game, for example you can run on walls do backflips or slide down ramps. You like to get upclose and personal? you can grab a shoty or hold f to equip melee and kamiakzee the enemies. Dont like to get close? keep the distance with rifles. Each warframe has different abilities/playstyles. you get 3 weapons, a primary, a side arm and a melee weapon. You can either go in guns blazing or stealth missions if you like(patience is required). The pve is what shines the brightest in this game, though the ai can be a bit questionable they are still competent and offer a challenge to the player. In pve you can play up to 4 players and 4 players in pvp or you can solo. Now here are some minor problems with the game. Sometimes games can get very lagy making everyone warp around. Stealth is very hard for the wrong reasons, enemies can sometimes spot you via sixth sense or can sometimes derp right infront of you, many maps are usualy close quarters meaning sniping and stealthing can be very difficult which i recommend only if you have reached end game or need a challenge. Im not a fan of pvp and i dont play it, but i did try it in its early stages. I don't know if they changed pvp but damage mods really ruin pvp as some one who doesnt have them is going to get stomped and turns the game into a call of duty with ninjas. Overall good game, but it can get a bit repetitive with all the grinding (exp/resources) which is reasonable because this is a free to play. the bleed mechanic can get quite annoying since it goes through shields and is based on rng. 3 factions each and have their own environments. Bosses are pretty meh except lephantis which was very satisfying to fight. Buying platinum sure helps lessen the grinding which is good, so if you dont like to grind recommend buying some platinum.

review: Combine Mass Effect with Diablo, add some ninjas, and Warframe is what comes out. Structured around 4-man instanced missions, Warframe has a large variety of map objectives with random secondaries being added during the mission. Overall, the randomization is pretty strong, piecing together gigantic levels that are easy to get lost in. Exploration is rewarded with rare mats, bonus cash, and EXP for all your equipment. The leveling system doesn't increase the stats of your gear but instead how many mods you can slot into your equip (and how strong); combined with a low level cap of 30 (for each gear piece), it's easy for new players to jump in while veterans are rewarded with stronger mods. Everything in the cash shop, apart from skins & colors, are purchasable in game or are craftable. My only major complaint right now is that the environment variety is a bit slim. Overall, Warframe is a well balanced third person shooter with tons of customization and replay value.

review: I'm going to sum up this game as simply as possible. It is a repetitive, grindy game. You should know this going in. Do not expect a massive variation in what you do. NOW THE FUN STUFF A PARKOUR SYSTEM - WALLRUNNING, SLIDING, FLIPS, VAULTING, ALL THAT COOL STUFF WHILE FIRING GUNS 4-PLAYER CO-OP (It's not an MMO.) A GOOD F2P MODEL (Only stuff that you HAVE to spend real money on are cosmetics - weapons can be crafted using resources gained from missions and blueprints bought from the market for credits.) GUN MODDING AND STUFF (Customise your gun to make it more effective against specific enemies, or just make it set people on fire. CLANS (Guilds, armies, whatever you want to call it. You share a dojo, a communal map that you all build which allows you to unlock exclusive clan-tech weapons. ADORABLE SENTINELS (They fly around above your shoulder and shoot stuff. They are adorable.) 9.6/10 - Not bad (IGN) GOTY

review: This game sucked up all of my time, and is pretty much the defining game of my college experience. Anytime I play a game, I play Warframe. Super addicting, but in a good way. Time is definitely money in this game, and often the majority of your time is spent in crafting sweet new weapons and Warframes. Updates are constant, with new content being released often. If you love fast-paced ninjas sprinting around with superpowers shooting and slashing everything in their path, this game's for you.
