With the time you spend on this game, you could do all sorts. Study on learning a new set of skills to further your career. You could raise money for charity. You could be an aid worker for a foreign country and help improve the lives of others. You could even just play other games, you know, those ones sitting in your backlog, pushed aside by DotA 2. But you won't. You will always return to this game. The maximum you will learn from playing this game is how to insult others in various languages (mostly these languages will consist of Russian and Peruvian.). This game will become as much a part of your life as eating or blinking. Half the time you will not even remember having played DotA 2 on a certain day. It just becomes natural to you. If you start playing this game, you will become addicted. You will also spend obscene amounts of money on cosmetics. A quick chest purchase here, a few random items on the market there, and boom. Like me you'll have spent far too much on a game which needs no money spent on it. If you start DotA 2, not only will you be subjecting yourself to a motivation-destroying hobby, but also subjecting yourself to a wallet emptying one too. tl;dr This game will take away your time, money and patience for others.

Don't get me wrong, I am not hating or anything. I was from HoN for like 2-3 years before Dota 2 was released and tried LoL and actually enjoyed it for a bit but then went back to HoN. Dota 2 is a great game, an awesome game. I really should have thought about spending money on a free game but to hell with it I say. Mechanics are well designed, what makes a hero OP is the player behind it and the team that surrounds it. This is a team game people, so team work is a must (unless you are solo queuing, then you have to carry your garbage of a team but it can be the other way around). Monster gamers are real. Dota 2 has taught me a lot of things, you can only be good at something if you focus on it, learn from mistakes, be aware of your surroundings, trust your instinct, use common sense, trusting on your team to always have your back, believing in your capabilities, always try to be better than you were yesterday, and that.. THE COMEBACKS ARE REAL!!! This game bought me and my friends together for lan parties and strengthen our bonds. A mere game that brings people together, not just friends but complete strangers too. Dota 2 is a game that will never be forgotten. All in all, I recommend this game to everyone who wants to experience pain, suffering, and torment because at the end, you will come to a sudden realization that things are always bound to get better.

Instead of being sarcastic and writing a funny review that jabs at russians, I'm going to tell you how Dota 2 really is at it's core. In a nutshell Dota 2 is a great game, but a terrible experience at the same time. You want to keep going back to it, but you also hate to go back. Why? One word: community. Dota 2's community is for the most part rude and hateful (and undeniably filled with russians who refuse to speak any other language than that of their own), sapping the joy out of this otherwise polished and addicting MOBA. It's unfriendly to beginners and the basic mindset is to belittle anyone who makes a mistake. Make one wrong move and you are called a noob right away... at the best of times. Often it's much worse and I would prefer not to go into the details. Sometimes you get a crapstorm of hate and blame even if you haven't actually done anything wrong. Occasionally, though, you come across friendly players, and when that happens, the game is a pure joy to play. However, since the game is 5v5, coming across four nice players at the same time (if you're solo queueing) is a rarity. Why then have I played the game for over 2000 hours? The sensation of winning. Your determination to keep playing, despite of the discouraging community, is fueled by the fantastic sensation of a glorious victory. That sweet moment when you see the enemy Ancient blow up and look back on the match, remembering all the plays and teamwork that lead you to victory is ever so gratifying. But even a victory can come with a grain of salt. Many times you have rude teammates that rage in the chat even when your team is winning. There is a mute option, but that doesn't stop the bad manners that extend outside the chat. People can intentionally feed the enemy team, ignore their own team, teamkill with some abilities and just generally be a bad player. It's really frustrating and the worst part is it happens all the time. Going ranked doesn't really solve the problem either, at least not completely. Ranked matchmaking is a more serious type of mode in Dota 2 that ranks you based on how well you do and finds opponents of equal skill. It feels much more professional and \"tryhardish.\" Although you meet nice players more often, nothing stops the rude players from jumping over the fence and playing ranked aswell. Having played some matches in ranked, I can say the mode isn't \"hate free.\" I had some of the worst matches in regards to teammates in that mode. Another problem with ranked is that, like I said, it's more \"tryhard.\" Many just want to play the game casually and not have to worry about ranks and the \"this is ranked, you better be a damn good player\" mentality. But don't get me wrong, Dota 2 is a great game in itself and that's why I keep going back to it. The core mechanics are spot on and gameplay flows well. No technical issues to speak of (not counting the occasional missing texture bug or so, of which I have had none myself). Graphics are great and have a subtle water painting type feel to them. All the various spells and abilites look great. The game is very deep and complex with tons of items, skill and item builds and strategies to learn. It can be a bit terrifying to beginners, but once you get the hang of things, it's engaging. All the playable heroes are well balanced (although there is always some debate on a couple specific heroes being \"OP\") and free to play from the start. That's another thing the game does right. All the heroes are free and playable from the start, unlike Dota 2's undeniably very successful competitor, League of Legends. Dota 2's microtransactions focus on purely cosmetic stuff, which means there are zero \"pay to win\" elements in the game. It really falls unto you to decide whether if you want to suffer the rude community for the sake of playing this brilliant game. If you're one of those people who can just calmly ignore everything rude being said at you, you have a better chance of not finding Dota 2 so terrible. To put it roughly in perspective: Playing Dota 2 is like playing Skyrim, but having someone stand next to you the whole time yelling at you for every mistake you make, calling you a \"fooping idiot\" every time you miss an arrow or fail a quest objective. Failed to kill Alduin? \"Uninstall Skyrim, noob.\" Don't know how to make dragonbone armor? \"Learn to play, tard.\" It would just completely sap the fun out of your epic adventures, would it not? Sadly that's how Dota 2's community is. Having played the game as long as I have, I would say that you are better off not playing Dota 2. The game is fun when you're winning (because people tend to rage less when your team is doing fine), which is 50% of the time (and sometimes not even when you're winning). It isn't the losses that make the game unpleasant, it's the unfriendly people. Often your day will just be worse after playing Dota 2, instead of it cheering you up as games do. People will tell you that Dota 2 is great, but that greatness comes with a price. Do take in notice that this is all coming from a solo player point of view. This review is meant mainly to those who are likely to play the game alone most of the time and want to know what it's really like, not just the great things. If you have four friends who you can play with on a regular basis, then you're good to go. The game is at it's best when you play with friends and don't have to worry about getting \"a stick in the mud\" player on your team.

A mod that has been worked on by many, and therefore it was hard to determind where the rights belong. A lot of legal hocus pocus were going on between Blizzard and Valve last year, and it ended to valve's favor. The Dota name and franchise is now legally a part of Valve, probably thanks to the sneaky acquisition of IceFrog the year before. Dota 2 is a real-time strategy game in the sub-genre called MOBA (multiplayer online battle arena). A genre that has grown rapidly the past few years, with different type of alterations in favor of success. Dota 2 is a close second to being the most popular MOBA, right behind the giant League of Legends. Just like LoL, Dota 2 is gaining success throughout it's competetive e-sport scene, and it's clear that valve is highly pushing it towards the first position. The latest and biggest tournament was The International 2013, which included a total prize pool of over 2.8 million US dollars, which was the biggest prize pool in e-sport history. Gameplay is easy to understand but very hard to master. The map consists of 3 lanes that are constantly being pushed by NPC creeps. You are controlling a hero amongst 4 other in your team, and are fighting against 5 in the opposing team. The goal is to push your heroes and NPC creeps to the enemy base, where you have to destroy the ancient. It sounds pretty easy, but it requires hours upon hours to get a hold of the base mechanics, the more advanced mechanics and the professional mechanics. Plus the over 100 heroes you get to play and face. After 300 hours I have only touched what I call the more advanced mechanics, and I am not even close to professional level. The most experienced players have around 5000 hours of playtime and have spend the majority of their past 3 years to Dota 2. Since the game is Extremely competetive there will be a lot of curse words flying around while you play. These type of games are known for very hostile encounters with other players. There is an optional tutorial that you can take before going out there, beware though - the tutorial does not cover any Russian. Dota 2 might be competetive, extremely enraging and the learning curve is steep as crap, but it is still the game that I have spend the most time playing on Steam (mostly because my collegues and bosses were playing it). Somehow I keep returning to it, so I suppose I am enjoying it. You better have people to play with though, and you better not be good friends - because this game will take your beloved friendship and wipe it's  with it until you hate each other. Only play this if you plan on getting some mental disorder. Time will fly, and you will realize you still suck and people hate you no matter what. It's free so why do you need a review anyway?

Dota 2 is an addictive experience; however, this game also draws a player base from the bottom of society. If that statement is an insufficient description of the game, continue reading. This game is not for the casual gamer, this game is for those who have the capability to log in hundreds of hours into a game. If you play this game, I can attest that there will be times you love it and times you just want to break your monitor with your keyboard. I have a few hundred hours into the game and no matter how long you play, no matter what you do, you will encounter someone who will complain about something you're doing poorly or not doing correctly and it may ruin the gameplay for you. I can only recommend this game if you have thick skin or you have friends to play with. So here are what I consider the pros and cons of the game: Pros -This is a very intricate strategy based game that relies heavily on teamwork and timing. -Free to play with optional cosmetic costs. -Gameplay always varies due to each individual hero selection. This, in effect, increases replayability tremendously. -Wonderful voice actors with interesting dialogue choices by the developer. -Winning matches in this game often triggers the release of dopamine in the reward center in your brain creating the desire to play more. This in effect causes players to really want to win and may be the trigger of many cons of the game. Cons -This game has a steep learning curve, believe me, there is way more to this game than you might think at first glance. Unlike hero customization in League of legends, not all heroes are created equal and not all ward placements are either. It can be a little intimidating to think that your team is already at a disadvantage from the hero selection, but thus is DOTA. -Secondary to the steep learning curve, games tend to be won or lost by the actions of an individual on either team. This can be ameliorated by steam implementing some sort of \"fundamentals of gameplay\" video instead of the current lackadaisical tutorial they have. Suffice to say, many new players do not understand that every time their hero is killed by the opposing team, the player loses gold and the other team gains gold. This doubles the impact that each individual has for gameplay. -Unlike other video game developers, Steam does not region lock. This brings about an unforeseen consequence where individuals from any country can join any server despite having a language preference. You can imagine how difficult it is to create a coordinated cohesive team push when there's a Russian only speaker, Spanish only speaker and a Portuguese only speaker on the US WEST server. -Blame is a word that is thrown around in this game like the word inequality is thrown around in America. Unfortunately, this is by far the worst aspect of the game. The game community has very little to no interaction prior to gameplay or thereafter and there is no review conversation on what an individual can do to improve in the future. More often than not, an individual will oversimplify the ongoing team loss to 1 action by 1 individual because of time constraints and heated emotions. -There is no team forfeit vote option in game and often you are sitting there for 10-20 minutes as the other team wastes your time despite securing a victory much earlier. This review is from personal experience and your gameplay may vary. Of course, if you do meet someone ingame who is a decent person, be sure to commend them at the end of the match for their ingame courtesy.

First of all, this review is not a humorous one. I'm writing it seriously to give information about this game. Because it is so popular and too many people want to learn something about it including who has never played it and starters. I think this review will be informative for these people, gamers who has spent couple of hours like me, knows everything i am going to try to tell. After this short introduction, we can start: -Russians' problem is not about being Russian. Due to the game's popularity among Russian players, there are too many bad (always swears, doesnt play as its a team game, doesnt speak english in eu servers etc.) Russian players. But there are also too many nice Russian players. Briefly, the problem is not about being Russian, if there are 10 gamers in dota, 4 of them will be bad players, if there are 1000, 400 of them. Thats the point. -If you want to play this game to get relaxed, dont do it. After few matches you will find yourself more depressed, angry or sick instead of relaxed or enjoyed. The bad players are the reason for it. As an illustriation; you started a game to get enjoyed, looked the picks, someone rushed carry heroes without saying anything and suddenly said \"me mid\" or \"me solo\" etc., ok thats right you are still relax, you picked a support for your team, they somehow fed the enemies, ok still you are relaxed, they started to argue with each other, they started to swear and fed the enemy team on purpose just because of their arguement, ok you are still trying to convince them to stop it but you feel angry, and then you will lose the game. This type of games are not so rare in dota. 3 over 10 games are being played according to this nutshell. Therefore, it is highly possible that you will find yourself in a very bad mood instead of enjoyed after playing dota. -Then, why people still playing it too much? Why there is not just bad players in the community now? Because it is addictive. You can not get rid of it. If someone trolls your game, you want to play again and wish to play with better players, if you win the game, you want to win again and increase your mmr, if you lose the game you want to play again to get your mmr back. Shortly, you will want to play again after every game. However, if you are sure that you can stop playing whenever you want, this reason is pointless for you. -Meaningless mmr system. When i first heard about mmr system i was quite excited. Because it ideally provides an environment that includes less trolls and bad players. However, the system is completely meaningless. Player profile and skills are same at 1k,2k and 3k mmr. Once you get your mmr, it is very hard to increase it too much since every win increase it 25, every lose decrease it 25 and as i said before, player profile is same at 1k 2k and 3k, when you have a bad player in your team it is nearly impossible to win that game etc. It is completely up to your team. So, how people get too high mmr's? They have this mmr at the begining. And how they did it? There is no clear information about it. Valve does not announce how it is being calculated. For example, i played 10 first ranked games with 8 wins, i played support and carries, buy wards and couriers when i was support, i carried the game almost on my own when i was carry, but my mmr was 2200 when some people get 4k starting mmr. This system also a fact about this game's addiction but doesn't help kind players about creating a better environment. -All in all, i dont recommend this game just because of its community. The game is a master piece, master of MOBAs, it is a great thing that only you can spend your money on cosmetic items in the game, it has great graphics etc. However, it has a really bad community and you will find yourself as one of those bad players when you play more and more and it becomes impossible to get rid of it. On the other hand, if you have a great mental power and patience, play it, i completely recommend it. This review was written for normal patience leveled people. I dont say \"Dont waste your time, go and do some social activities\", if u want to play video games, dont play it go and play more enjoying games. -Lastly, i have an advice for valve, it would be better if there will be an administrator system in dota. People who works professionally and for money for this administrator job would examine players' matches who get reports too much and if they see that they are bad players (as defined at the beginning) they should be banned from game for few days or their mmrs should be decreased. Now, it is done completely automatic and so after some low priority matches bad players can continue trolling. I hope it would be helpful for people who hasnt spent too much time on dota and it would be read by people except from my friends :D ************************Some Suggestions************************ I wrote this review when this game made me feel so bad and desperate. I lost my will to play dota. However then, thanks to some sensitive comments, I started to play dota only with my friends. Now I have some suggestions for people who have similar feelings about dota as I mentioned in my review months ago. -As some people say in comments of this review, play this game with your friends. After writing this review I have rarely played solo games and it feels better. -Participate in some tournaments. After lots of bad pub match experiences, that tournament atmosphere offers a great dota experience. You can participate in ESL's or other platforms' open tournaments for free. -Finally,never give up! You can encounter very kind players as well. After a bad pub game performance, your teammates maybe say \"uninstall dota\" etc. but after then you can participate in tournaments with your friends. Just do not give any importance what they say. You can see similar things in this review's comments section. There are very kind, sensitive and suggestive comments which try to help me and lots of depressing, offensive comments. Same is true for the player profile in dota, just dont give any importance what the haters say! ***Final Note*** For the guys who say \"why don't u recommend the game while playing it too much\", please read the review again, this review is a complete answer to your question. GOOD LUCK & HAVE FUN :D UNFORTUNATELY, IO LOST THE ARCANA SHOWDOWN :( Edited: Game hours are updated and some grammar mistakes are corrected. \"Some Suggestions\" section added. Thank you all for suggestions, comments and rate ups. Final Note section added.", "num_reviews": 3, "num_screenshots": 4}

The blend of well-balanced multiplayer, infinite replayability, gorgeous aesthetics, and the time and care Valve has put in to support the community is a recipe for perfection. I simply cannot reccomend Dota 2 enough. The game boasts a roster of over a hundred heroes, and each one feels unique and well-designed. In any given match, you take control of a singular hero, and victory or defeat hinges not only on how well you play that hero, but how also on how well you synergize with your five person team. Unfortunately, the barrier of entry is high. Quite a lot of research, preparation, and knowledge is required to be sucessful, and it can be frustrating losing repeatedly. However, tutorials are available to guide new players, and the time spent learning only adds to the satisfaction of landing a five-man Black Hole or pulling off that perfect Blink-Poof combo. Spectacularly enough, the battlefield is not the only area where the game shines. Dota TV is an in-game spectator mode that allows the option to watch professional teams play in tournaments, including the multi-million dollar International that Valve hosts on a yearly basis. And all of this for free. There are cosmetic items that can be used to customize your favorite hero, however nothing availble changes gameplay in any way. They are mostly designed by members of the community and can be purchased or recieved randomly while playing. Content patches and new heroes are being added all the time. Dota 2 will continue to grow for years, hopefully continuing to find new players interested in a fast-paced online multiplayer experience that is equal parts exhilirating and engaging.", "num_reviews": 7, "num_screenshots": 105}

LoL has childish names like Blue Team, Red Team, Minions, Turrets and Inhibitors. Not to mention all the champion names are like that too. Its targeted at 4-9 year olds that recently quit runescape and want a DirectX9 game because their computer is too wooden. These days, easy games attracts NOOBS. Many LoL players used to play Dota but they got wrecked too hard, so they just play LoL, therefore the all the worlds worst gamers are addicted to this no brainer game. Same reason goes why Dota TI players OWN in ranked LoL, but LoL Worlds players cannot even survive in unranked Dota. The gap for the skill requirements for these 2 games is simply uncomparable. Simply amazing how Riot earns millions of $$$$$$$ yet still can't keep their servers functioning. The time it takes to download and install Dota2 is about the same as the time to update LoL. Its true that its a selfish company created for REVENUE ONLY. WTF is $10 for a NAME CHANGE? WTF is $20 for a server transfer? I ALMOST FEEL SORRY FOR LOL PLAYERS GETTING THEIR HARD EARNED MONEY STOLEN BY A TRASH COMPANY THAT EMPLOYS STAFF THAT USES THEIR SERVERS TO TOAST MARSHMELLOWS", "num_reviews": 1, "num_screenshots": 5}

In Dota 2 is a pure free-to-play game, which means that you don't have to unlock heroes, maps or other stuff. The only way to be good at Dota 2 is to know the game. You need to know every single item and hero to become a really good player. And that's the reason i like this game so much. However, this can be a problem for new players. You don't know anything about the game when you spawn in your base with 4 teammates. So, what is this game all about? Well, you play as one of the 105 available heroes and you have to destroy the enemy base. Sounds easy right? Well, to do that you have to fight your way through towers, creeps and of course the other team. At the start of the game you just stay in your 'lane' and farm and harass enemies by attacking or even ganking them. After this 'laning stage' is completed, your team and the enemy team will face eachother in so called 'teamfights'. After a while, one team will have a large gold and experience advantage, and they will push to the other teams base. And then of course destroy it. Verdict --------- I really enjoyed and still enjoy this game. Dota 2 isn't a pay-to-win game, which makes this game much more enjoyable. Dota 2 also has the best eSports support, you can easily watch a match and select one of the several Broadcasters to make watching eSport matches more enjoyable. The only downside of Dota 2 is the fact that you'll need a lot of knowledge to be good at this game. If you manage to survive all the mean teammates and learn everything about the game, you'll easily spend 200 hours on Dota 2. If not, you'll quit within 20 hours.

Your home is abuzz with laughter, and the smell of fresh baked goods drifts up from downstairs. You race to the tree, and begin to open a beautiful present, adorned with festive colors and a wrapping scheme that is both dauntingly complex yet also simple in its execution. You turn to your mother, father, and two siblings and smile; for you know that your adventure into opening your gift is about to begin. You go to open your unwrapped box, and BWONG.. A horn bellows, deafening you. Out of the box pops a small, dwarf-like figure, wielding a multicultural bat festooned with Ecuadorian and Peruvian patterns, and of Russian construction. \"THANKS FOR STANDING STILL, GANKER,\" he shrieks, as he wallops young brother Timmy in the teeth. Your mother tuts and scolds him, for being out of position. The dwarf darts under the tree, looking for a hole in the wall to continue his pursuit of rat-DOTA. \"Gank him,  blyat!\" your father roars, as he sits on the couch lazily and watches. You crawl, desperate for your gift of victory over the rat, under the tree, and he continues to elude you. Suddenly, with a flourish, he produces a lighter, and proceeds to methodically burn down your house while muttering \"GG 2 EZ\", and your family sits in the living room muttering \"garbage team\" and \"reported\". Your family home burns down around them, and only you escape the engulfing flames, accompanied by the chortles of the dwarf. Downtrodden but not easily bested, you begin your walk down the street to your friend's house, in the hopes that by having Christmas at their house, you might be able to somehow catch the multicultural dwarf on the second try. 10/10 Best fun and Peruvian simulator.", "num_reviews": 0, "num_screenshots": 0}

While many other titles label themselves with this distinction, there are often convenience purchases or some form of power available for real money transactions. While Dota 2 has an extensive cash shop, all offerings are completely cosmetic. HUD options, voice packs and character costumes form the basis of a store lacking even an iota of power or convenience for purchase. All gameplay elements are absolutely free and do not require collection or usage of any kind of in-game currency. Once a player has determined that theyre ready to commit to a steep learning curve and potential negative interactions with teammates (Again, learn with friends to reduce this aspect), Dota 2 is incredibly enjoyable and possibly one of the best multiplayer games ever made. Every match is different, and watching perfect team fight execution is gaming art. Players have access to a huge range of hero styles and the interactions between teammates and foes are incredibly diverse. Its twenty to forty-five minutes of gladiatorial bliss, the end result carefully orchestrated from the first enemy tap to the final crushing blow. Dota 2 can be experienced and enjoyed at multiple levels of engagement, and its a title that rewards users for a deep dive. Heavy investment, heavy reward. The barrier to entry isnt quite as bad as it was years ago, but it would be disingenuous to say that the game doesnt have a colossal learning curve. As a free-to-play title readily available on Steam, it offers players a frictionless doorway  but the challenge may be keeping new players interested and willing to commit to the epic journey that is learning, playing, and enjoying Dota 2. The game is in a strong place right now. Its rewarding and sociable like few other games, and despite its vast popularity it still feels like a secret waiting to be discovered. The next few months will be crucial: its currently the best expression of Valves progressive attitude towards players, and if it can continue on that track it describes a future for online gaming that is far more hopeful than the one were used to. Just remember to spend your starting cash, and make sure someone buys the courier. Oh, and when Riki starts showing up in your games, just get some Sentry Wards down and don't run away. Also, you always want a Bottle when in mid-lane, and runes spawn at 0:00 and again every two minutes. Practice last-hitting before you go online. And if you're jungling, memorise where the low-level Creeps are. Actually, you know what? Forget all that. Just have fun. 4 out of 5", "num_reviews": 38, "num_screenshots": 862}

I've been playing Dota 2 for around 10 years since it was DotA, the Warcraft III custom map and I'll tell you right now there's still a lot of room for personal improvement. This game boils down to far more than individual skill, tactics, and teamwork/cooperation. The author of \"Three Lane Highway\" (see pcgamer.com) has called Dota an \"isometric wizard-em up\" game, and I think it's fitting. There are so many aspects to this game, so many factors that control the outcome that if you try and sit down and list them all it'll take you a couple hours. And you'll still miss some. I have played pretty much every single \"Multi-player Online Battle Arena\" on the market, and no matter how interesting they are or what different elements they try to bring to the gameplay, I always end up coming back to Dota. If you want to seriously challenge yourself, and you have the will and motivation to work towards a lofty goal that many are unable to reach, this is the game for you.", "num_reviews": 1, "num_screenshots": 2}

Alright, guys, listen. My name is [IG] D[andi] SingSing aka WildDigger1998UA and i will throw some of my wild gameplay suggestions in a game that is totally not corrupted by trends, pro leagues where people play like lobsters on acid (denying your own aegis because you click like a frenzied ape when nothing around is happening) and totally not toxic community where every Ivan, George and PingPongClingClong is a distinguished pro gamer with 200 years of training at Icefrog's monastery of enlightement somewhere inbetween Tibet's asscheeks. Okay, let's go: This riding on cat Mirana chick with face that looks like she just seen a dolphin putting on a condom. Her ultimate allows teammates to get invisibility for given time. Which can, for instance, save your carry+ support who is getting dived by frenzied Bristleback and enemy mid hero with 2 runes up his butt. So just press r - and since they didnt have any dusts - your carry is safe. Haha, no! We can't have any of that! I need more damage on my arrow that i will miss anyway. Plus if my allies are dying, i can just blame them instead of doing anything. If they are russians - just double your blame output. Okay, so we have that hero, Spector, but it doesnt look like this gay guy from Bioware game. So she has ability to move through obstacles and units, has free tons of pure damage (can't be reduced by armor) on every illusion, and map presense with her ultimate that allows her to fight at any given time without leaving her farming spots until necessary, and with high enough agility her illusions can just inflict enough damage so your team can fight freely while you patiently taking your farm. SO WHAT DO WE DO? OF COURSE WE AINT GONNA DO ANY OF THAT: we will get her phase boots because spectral dagger is clearly not enough, we will never ever get free damage on carry, and we get a bloody skill that blocks and returns damage instead (when enemy team has like. ugh, same damage output as yours?and you have no hp yet anyway?). Get vanguard that just doesn't work because of dota 2's RNG programming and then will farm radiance till 50' timemark because expensive aura with item's green damage that doesnt work on illusions (even though aura does work and can do a lot of good things, like blocking enemy's blink dagger that will be blocked by your ult in a second anyway) is clearly better than stat-gain or mana-burn. Okay, so we have that orange bird guy, that can hold solo lane against 2 or 3 people with minimum deaths (except some specific combos that just screw up his escape) and set of abilities that allows to eviscerate enemy team if your allies have at least ANYTHING to hold them in place. What are we gonna do with this hero, you may ask. Of course we will put him on a support role and make him buy mekansm, so he would never have any mana for his high damage dots that also have ridicilous slow debuff and ult that is easily countered only like by ten heroes out of 150. We have Mirana without ultimate to go get all this exp, remember? Alright, these situations are obviously too situative, so we will talk about global scale meta: Let's get to most obvious question: what hero should we pick? The answer is - PUDGE. You need mid - you pick PUDGE. You need support - you pick PUDGE. You need offlane, jungler, roamer, carry, social worker, girlfriend, president of the united states of 'Murrica? - Just pick Pudge. Why? Because someone did that on twitch.tv, you silly noob cheekyscrublord. You, of course, have same skill as pro players so you can just mimic them and game will be magically won! You don't need to think about anything, just buy recommended items and blame your teammates if something is wrong. You got a motherflipping DRAGONCLAW HOOK afterall. If you bought an item that is worth of 3 years of your school lunchboxes - nobody will have enough guts to argue with your divine skill in pressing q button at cursor location to lasthit a creep (mute everyone at the start of the game just in case tho). Next important issue is map presense, lane control, creep control, ability to analyze situation, counter-warding and all that important elements of this pseudo-strategical map game. For all of that just remember these two lines: \"BUY WARDS\" \"WHERE THE GANG\" (it is important that you will never type \"gank\" properly). This is basically all you need to know about this game. Remember: its not important to win! It's the whole competetive spirit and sportsmanship that matters! Everyone has around 50% winrate anyway because of matchmaking, and ELO system in rankeds is based on wizard-science and tarot-fortunetelling (it's supposed to work only in chess anyway). Yeah, developers may tell you their rating system is not based on elo, but can Volvo really pull off their own mathematic rating model for the game that after all these years still lags when someone is picking a hero, armor rating still doesnt work properly, and hero with 320 movespeed can chase down and kill hero with 350 because of model animation? Oooh i think not. Anyway i give this game 100 dirty apes out of 100 and encourage you to start playing as fast as possible, to join in most viral addiction the world ever saw since taking heroin rectally, poping polyethylene packages or throwing water filled condoms out of the window became a thing.", "num_reviews": 31, "num_screenshots": 7050}

I'll keep it brief. Dota 2 is probably the most frustrating game ever created. Your team will let you down constantly, the enemy team will consistently pick the heroes you hate playing against the most, you will never get the hat drops you want, and your own mind and body will frequently betray you and make you contend with the fact that you are not nearly as good as you think you are (or, more likely, force you to live in a fantasy dream world where you are as good as you think you are and just blame your teammates some more). It'll turn you into a monster and destroy your life. It'll murder your loved ones and feed them to you. But you'll play it anyway. You'll ragequit and uninstall and stare at your library of games as the creeping realization sweeps over you that you not playing Dota 2 will not effect the universe in even the smallest way, will have no conceivable effect on anything. You will be filled with a sudden dread that nothing you do matters and life has no meaning. Basically the same feeling you get when you play Dota 2. And Dota 2 will be your only distraction from this dessicated husk of a life. So the next day you'll find yourself drawn back into it like a moth to a flame, staving off the moment when you'll have to face your demons for as long as you can. You will probably die alone some day and nobody will remember how high your MMR was or your sunstrike accuracy. So what are you waiting for, you worthless peons?! Get out there and dance!

Dota 2 is definitely one of the best games of this generation, and I'm certain it will remain as popular and as influnencal for many years to come. Graphics: 8.5/10 Very pretty, the art direction in DotA 2 is one of the best. The source engine ensures you can run it on anything more powerful than a toaster, and have it look great too. Cosmetics look great, and fit perfectly, with some exceptions,(I'm looking at you Alpine Ursa) but many stay true to the heros artstyle. Sound: 9.5/10 All heros have a multitude of voice lines,and some even respond to one another (e.g Tidehunters hatred for Kunnka). If you find the default anouncer not too flash, theres a huge variety of optional packs, from the smoth talking Narrator from bastion, to the harsh condescending tone of Pyrion Flax. Gameplay: 10/10 The big one. Theres a reason DotA Allstars got so popular, not just from the incredible passsion from the community, or the dedication of IceFrog and co., but from the incredible gameplay that spawned one of gamings most popular genres. From perfectly co-ordinating a fountain hook, to getting stuck on top of a cliff accidentally as Storm Spirit, no other genre rivals DotA 2 outstanding strategic gameplay and near-vertical learning curve. At the time of writing, I have 7,469 hours played and I've only just scratched the surface in the combos, stratagy and 107 availble heros to use, it takes year of hard work, dedication and passion to become truly great at the strategical masterpeice that is Dota 2. - beardATTACK @ fren", "num_reviews": 0, "num_screenshots": 0}

Dota 2 is basically a game based around teamwork, except the community only does three things. 1. Call each other f*gs and berate one another for slightly foolish decisions. 2. Do solo farm and try to win the match by themselves (which never works, ESPECIALLY if they are playing against a team of 5 players in a party, also known as a five stack.) 3. Make fun of, and ruin everything for, new players. If you want to learn how to play Dota 2, you either need a really good guide, or a good friend who has more than 500 hours into the game. The tutorial just teaches you the basics. No, you can't learn by yourself by playing matchmaking with random people. All you'll learn from the other players is that you suck because you're new and don't understand any of the tactics, and that the best course of action would be to uninstall. There's also the fact that some people create new Steam accounts so they can be matched up against newbies and annihilate everyone. Also, this game stole all my friends. We used to play other games, now they play nothing other than Dota 2 and one of them has spent $40 in the game... ON SKINS! COSMETIC ITEMS THAT ADD NOTHING TO THE GAMEPLAY! YOU CAN BUY SOME OF THE BEST GAMES ON STEAM FOR LESS, I REPEAT, LESS THAN $40! AND THEN HE TOLD ME HE ONLY PLAYS DOTA BECAUSE HE CAN'T AFFORD ANY GAMES ON STEAM!!! So there. Terrible community, steals your friends, incredibly addictive for some people. Don't touch this game. I spent way too much time hating myself while playing this. Never again. EDIT: 172 people read this review. Wow. Also, I have to say, I think the in-game tutorials are better than the actual game, because the actual game has only one map, unlike the tutorials. I know this is pretty standard for MOBA games, but for me this contributes greatly to actually ruining variety and fun in the gameplay. It's just all the same tactics over and over on the same map. This doesn't only mean less variety, but it also means that veterans will know the game just that much better. On another note, this game is like the opposite of everything I like about TF2. Unbalanced classes (According to Google, every Dota hero/champion/class/whatever the hell is overpowered), only A SINGLE MAP, relies too much on teamwork when it's hard to find online (whereas TF2 benefits from teamwork, but still, it's not the key to winning a game, and it's much easier to achieve teamwork, because TF2 doesn't rely NEARLY as hard on your early-game. The early-game in Dota literally either makes or breaks the whole game for you, setting the outcome of the match in stone almost literally during the first ten minutes of the game.), and also, a horrible community. Not saying TF2's community is good, but hell, it's miles above Dota. Don't really know why I am comparing this game to TF2, maybe because Valve made both games, but still, just wanted to throw out there some actual criticisms about the game itself and not the community. Now, some people have been telling me \"Pfft, just block the trash talkers\". That doesn't change anything. They're still horrible at teamwork, which, like I said, is the entire point of the game. And if you block them, you can't coordinate with them. Basically, it's not only a bad game for new players because you suck, it's also a bad game for new players because everyone else sucks. Except for Koreans, whenever you see one in a game, bam, you already know his team has won. Overall, I think Dota, nay, the whole MOBA genre, has great potential, but it's just too bad I've yet to see any game in the genre actually achieve to fulfill it. EDIT 2: I just came back to this game and tried it out again the hopes that maybe it has gotten better. No. There's still absolutely no communication between the players except for casual pings here and there. Seriously. There are tonnes of balancing issues in the game, and the one character that stands out the most is Sniper. He has good abilities and does real good damage at a real fast rate if you play the game right. He can easily annihilate two to three heroes by himself later on in the game. Frankly, he is cheap, and it is incredibly easy to kill steal with him. Valve is a company structured in a way that, if you're employed there, you don't really NEED to do these things. You don't NEED to patch bugs from a game. You don't NEED to fix balancing issues. At Valve, the employees' primary concern is getting recognition. If you add something that looks cool, you're gonna get recognition. If you're going to fix something, you're not, because you're not showing off your creativity or imagination. You're doing an important job to ensure that the product works as intended. No-one cares for that, give me more cosmetics. There's also the kill stealing. Now, you get much more experience and gold, as well as the kill credit, if you actually deliver the killing blow. Yep, just the last hit, no questions asked. It doesn't matter if you've reduced someone from full to 1% health and someone from your team pops out of nowhere to take the kill credit and leave you with a measly amount of gold and little experience. A lot of players hate these kill thieves, but you know what? That's exactly what this game encourages. To screw other players over. Couldn't, say, the gold and experience be divided equally between the two players based on the damage they did? Nope. Instead the players are forced to hate each other and if you are an actually fair player who doesn't want to rely on these cheap tactics, you'll be behind in the game. What is this, Defense of the Capitalists? I mentioned that one friend spent $40 on items in DOTA 2. I actually played this game with him again, and he has spent about, well... $300 on the game. That's enough to buy 4 copies of GTA V here in Australia. He was also recently hacked and had $200 worth of items stolen from him. That's what you get when you blatantly overprice some items and drive the game's economy into the ground. Refer to the previous joke on capitalism. Now, the worst part of this game, in my opinion, is the long matches. Matches usually take anywhere between 30 to 50 minutes. The longest I've seen is 70 minutes. You're not going to have time to go to the toilet (people with indigestion beware, I bet Valve is in on a conspiracy to make profit from increased adult diaper sales), you're not going to have time to eat, you're not going to have time to speak to people while playing the game or do little chores around the house that you're parents need you to do because you're impatient), and if you're gonna get addicted to the game, like a lot of people are, you're not gonna have time to have a life. See: my Russian cousin. It also really sucks that when your early game sucks, you're going to be stuck in a losing match where you know you've lost and all your team is doing is delaying the inevitable. It's not enjoying to lose, and if you quit at that point,THE CONSEQUENCES WILL NEVER BE THE SAME!!! LITERALLY!!! The more you abandon games (doesn't matter if the game crashes on you or if you have a slow internet connection and the entire thing stopped working or if you have a really slow connection and it messes up and boots you out of the game or if you have a slow computer, like my $300 friend, and your entire computer crashes and you can't get back in the game), the more you will be punished. So, on your first few abandons, you will get low priority matchmaking games (low priority games are pretty much like the normal priority games ON STEROIDS!

You are going to die alot and probably yell at your team mates but that's just the nature of this game. Dota 2 takes place in an arena where you will fight to destory the enemies Anicent if you destory it; you win. The Ancient is protected by 11 stuctures called towers that protect it. Each of these towers are found in each of the three lanes bottom, middle and top. You take control of a unit that is a hero, many of them are diverse and have a lot of pros and cons such as Crystal Maiden who is really good at locking down heros early game with her stun but she is also the slowest hero in the game. You are accompanied by 4 other players including yourself to fight against another 5 players. You need to push lanes to be able to destory the enemy towers in each lane but the catch is the enemy team is doing the same thing, so you need to not only push to your victory but to stop the enemy team from pushing aswell. There is 107 heros in Dota 2 out of the 112 heroes that are in the Warcraft III. They are categorised into 3 groups. Strenght, which are usually the tanky guys. Agility, most carries are found in this category and Intelligence which most of the supports are usually found. All these heroes have different skill levels, such as Invoker who is an intelligence hero with 14 spells. He is able to create spells with 4 of his spells, creating the other 10. He is able to create tornados which disable enemies, meteors which looks epic and burns enemies that stand in front of it. Just an all round crazy hero. Viper is arguably the easiest hero which as 2 passive spells (Passive spells are spells that work all the time, you don't need to activate them) and 2 other spells which are targetable. You can customise your Dota experience with annoucer packs which change the voice of the annoucer which include Glados and the narrator from the Stanley Parable. You can change your HUD to different themes. The game allows you to buy tickets where you can support tournments, some of these tournments allowing you to directly contribute to the prize pool. Most of the time it is 25%. In 2014, The International is a annual tournment created by Valve for Dota 2. In 2014, the prize pool for this tournment became 10.9M dollars. First place got 5M dollars! If you are into ESports then this game will be up your ally. Dota 2 is a hard game, but if you look in the right places you are able to learn a lot, if you aren't sure you want to play this game, you can PM me and I can teach you how to play. I honestly don't mind.", "num_reviews": 3, "num_screenshots": 87}

It feels gratifying when you win. It feels frustrating when you lose. In DotA 2, you will lose alot whether you want it or not. What matters in this game isn't your hero or this pointless 'counter picking'. Your performance is solely dependant on skill, experience and reaction time. However, no matter how good you are, defeat is inevitable with a bad team. At the beginning when you're matched with new players such as yourself, this can be quite infuriating and almost made me stop playing after approximately 10 hours. That's why I strongly advise you to play with friends, so you actually have a coordinated team. About the game itself: It's a solid MOBA [en.wikipedia.org] with a big diversity of unique heroes. The majority of the community is quite unpleasant at times and isn't very beginner-friendly which can be really off-putting. If you ignore these people (a.k.a. muting) and just keep doing your thing, you will find yourself genuinely having fun after ~50 hours. 50 hours sounds kinda extreme but it really isn't. This is the kind of game you can spend thousands of hours on and you still won't be able to fully master it. If you're ready to go through all this hardship and frustration, go for it, I highly recommend DotA 2.

Meanwhile the enemy team is getting fed because your teamates never backed you up when you blitzkrieged in 1v5, and they even have the nerve to question your methods! Then you notice that your dumbass anti-mage is in the jungle farming because \"he couldn't farm in lane.\" You know, however, that he is just a noob. Eventually the enemy is pushing your tier 3s, and the game is obviously over. This is the time when you give up and sit in base. Ignore the fact that your team has won the last two teamfights and you are starting to catch up, it's better if you just quit now. While you're waiting in base, make sure that the enemy team knows that you are not at fault in your loss. Make sure you type in all-chat \"team noob\" followed up by \"report anti-mage.\" If they ask why you want them to report him, ignore them, if your team has the bodacity to try and defend themseves, repeatedly say phrases such as \"lol ur so bad\" and \"ur just mad cuz you cant play.\" You could also take the alternative route and say things like \"  \" and \"   .\" Yea, the game and communtiy can be a  sometimes, but it's also a super fun game that requires fast paced decision making as well as strategical analysis.

I sometimes end up frustrated, tired and in a bad mood when i can't win a single game in 6 hours of straight gameplay just because of bad players who get in your games to ruin them. Theyre're not just noobs, they just love trolling and ****ing up others people fun. If you're noob and wish to play Dota, make sure you have patience and time. Becoming good in this game is really hard, takes years to master and you'll never get to call yourself a pro. If you decided to start Dota, DO NOT play online. Practice with bots first, read guides, read items and abilities descriptions first, you got to study before playing in a real game with humans. It can be very frustrating for old players to deal with people that simple come to ''try out'' a new game into their matches and ruin them. Please. Someday you will realize what i mean with this. I play DotA since 2007 (Dota 1) and I have hit my keyboard, laughed, yell'd to my father for no reason and confesing my frustration to people because of a bad streak in DotA, let my bad mood affect my scores in school and made me lose friends. Lost many good stuff I could have done out-game because i said ''One more match...'' which became 10 more matches... and ended up totally frustrated without winning one of them, unable to sleep at all those nights. Due to this, to the careless community and the fact that your entire life can be affected by DotA and how it makes you feel, i can't recommend this game. Dota is not a simple game. You have to be very careful at the moment you decide to play this.", "num_reviews": 0, "num_screenshots": 0}

This game is like a shower fight between you and another naked man. You're both in a small shower tub trying desperately to shove each other over while at the same time trying not to accidentally touch peens and catch the gay. When you slip over and land painfully on your  the other guy, completely by accident, gets his soap-stained foot into your mouth just as you both realize somebody downstairs is hogging all the hot water. Then one of the guys from downstairs who should be helping you get back up on your feet instead comes into the room and yells at you for stealing all the hot water even though it's the other way around. You're the noob who can't get better at naked shower fights no matter how hard you try, the other guy in the tub is the  from the enemy team who mains bounty hunter, anti-mage, puck, ursa, or some other broken class, and the people downstairs who made you run out of hot water are your teammates getting last hits on what would be your kills and turning them into assists on your end. The guy who comes in from downstairs to yell at you is the teammate who, even though you're farming plenty of creeps and earning plenty of gold and experience from them, insists you're killing them \"the wrong way\" and are therefore an idiot noob. The naked shower fight is also a one-way road: once you jump in, there is virtually no returning. You become enslaved and before long all you'll ever want to do for the rest of your life is play dota. You won't even want to talk to or interact with anyone from the outside world unless they are similarly enslaved, by dota (or LoL). The video game world then slowly proceeds to divide and coalesce into two and only two distinct spheres of existence and reality: people who play mobas, and people who don't. Neither side ever so much as glimpses at the other for the remainder of each of its constituents' entire lives because its masochistic addiction level is insane enough to leave Starcraft and WoW in the dust. If you complain about how slippery the surface of the showertub is, people will just yell at you because you're terrible at the game and don't consult the online guidebook and metagame like they do for every minute, individual step taken throughout the game. If you want to get \"good\", you are unequivocally required to follow the instruction book down to the exact letter even if it hardly makes a difference in-game, if at all. If you do otherwise, you will get yelled at. Every single time without exception. To not get yelled at, you have to assimilate into the formless mass. This is all a part of the self-enslavement process: you won't come back, ever. And within a month you'll find yourself just parrotting the same  people were yelling at you for earlier, because you'll be one of them by that point. And you literally will not return. You'll be doing this for the entire rest of your life and will be speaking it like a language.", "num_reviews": 22, "num_screenshots": 1583}

Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal. 5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust. 6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes.

In fact, thinking of dota as a game at all is a mistake; games are designed to be enjoyable and fun . Enjoying yourself and having fun is the the lowest priority for those who play dota, (especially for those in low priority.) they prefer instead to stubbornly not enjoy themselves while simultaneously making sure nobody else is having any fun either. Every facet of the game has been finely tuned to reflect the players personality to the point that each decision they make in game is synonymous with how russian they are they conduct themselves in their day to day lives, what kind of attributes they hold in high esteem and strive to emulate in pursuit of bettering themselves becoming the transcendent doto master they know they're destined to be. Although it seems at first to be a team game of 5v5, this is a very shallow perspective which will correct itself after around fifteen minutes of your first game. Same goes for the goal of destroying the other teams towers, barracks and ancient. These objectives are simply filler while you forcibly and decisively assert your rightful dominance over your team via your mic or hastily written yet crushingly witty remarks in the chat. (don't worry about the other team, they're fighting amongst themselves and don't matter anyway  remember: you're better than your team-mates and it's inconceivable that there's any possibility you did or will ever do anything wrong, regardless of what may be transpiring before your very eyes.) The interface and mini-map should be largely ignored in favour of committing your attention wholly to the chat box, here you can see the current state of the game clearer than anywhere else, it may take a while to understand some of the games many colloquialisms such as ' ' and 'no courier gg my team are  ff', but don't worry if you can't understand, it's not so much about comprehension as asserting your right to say things that don't need to be said and are generally trivial and unhelpful. If you find yourself doing poorly and being shouted at by your team for feeding, don't fret. They are likely jealous of your superior skills and can't understand that they are actually the ones letting you down. Just remind yourself of that one game you had that went freakishly well and make fun of someones build. 10/10 worst game ever.", "num_reviews": 8, "num_screenshots": 10}

After the release of the original Dota map in 2003, the WarCraft 3 community began producing a long line of Dota spin-offs, sequels and mods (just as Eul, Dota's creator, had used AoS as inspiration for Dota itself), which culminated in the release of DotA: Allstars by Steve \"Guinsoo\" Feak. Allstars would become the most dominant and consistently updated version of all the Dota maps and mods. In 2005, Guinsoo passed the torch to the enigmatic IceFrog, who has been supporting, updating, and shaping Dota ever since. His changes have been the most significant, the most popular (the mod grew more during his time than ever before), and arguably have benefited and enriched Dota as a whole. By 2010, DotA: Allstars became simply DotA, and IceFrog was showing no signs of stopping. Later that year, Dota 2 was formally announced (with its development spear-headed by both IceFrog and Eul, both of its most important \"authors\"; its past and present, alike), entered a semi-closed beta in late 2011, and was finally officially released in mid-2013... and the rest is history. History lessons aside, Dota 2 is a game of uncompromising depth and complexity. Though its gameplay intricacies can appear opaque, arbitrary and incomprehensible at first sight, the way these expansive game mechanics interact with one another when exposed to the element of player imperfection is truly remarkable: over a hundred heroes, each with at least four spell-based abilities and all capable of using up to six magical items, from a massive arsenal of over a hundred. Games can last anywhere from 25 to 55 minutes, and possibly far more! Dota's metagame is constantly shifting, and as of writing the game and mod are at total parity through version 6.80, released earlier this year. On top of that, it is completely free to play, with no features locked out to any players whatsoever. Not even cosmetic items, which form the backbone of the game's vast micro-transaction-based economy: these items are freely distributed by Valve to all players through level-based gift drops and random-chance item drops. Free game updates alter the game balance significantly, while introducing new seasonal game modes, and far more. And that's not even scratching the surface of the game's competitive scene, with its many tournaments, its constantly evolving teams and its own storylines, all leading up to the annual Valve-organized grand championship: The International.

Your teammates will cater the enemy team, not back you up, and refuse to call missings or place wards. The enemy team will always pick combos or  heroes that will make you want to immediately leave the game while your teammates pick 4 carrys after you randomed Phantom Assassin and tell you to buy the wards. Every other game you will get a Russian Pudge picker that feeds 3 kills mid in 5 minutes and immediately ruins all the work you've done last hitting every creep and harassing the enemy out of lane. You'll rage and call \"GG\" early and trash talk your teammates but you'll still keep playing in hope that the game will turn around. As things start to finally look good, you get bashed 5 times in a row by a faceless void or the Ogre Magi will get a 4x multi-cast on you 2 times in a row while the Nature's prophet is pushing your top barracks. But after all the rage inducing pain, you keep playing. You suffer through it for the chance of that amazing, satisfying comeback even though you're 20,000 gold behind the enemy team. Only to have your dreams crushed when the enemy team finally kills your ancient. But you still keep playing due to the feeling you get when you get that rampage that allows you to push to victory. Even so, after the game you'll still rage because of the common chest you get as a reward for your 60 minutes of pain and suffering. When you finally get that mythical you've always wanted, valve will come out with an event that lowers the price and makes it almost worthless. It's a drug that once hooked to, is almost impossible to break. You almost don't even realize you're raging and forget that you're telling your best friend how much of a feeding  he is and how this lost game is because of him when you're the one who has 1 kill and 13 deaths. You keep playing in hope that you'll get good enough where you'll be able to play with Dendi or the other pros and you know that'll most likely never happen but you keep playing in hope of it happening one day. I would not wish this addiction on my worst enemy. But I can't stop you, nor can I stop playing myself.", "num_reviews": 1, "num_screenshots": 62}

And with this horribly broken matchmaking I see no sane reason to play this game anytime soon. And because Icefrog and the his devs ignorance about the EU servers turning to s'hit because of russians, who select english on purpose because their own servers on East is unbrearable with the horrible people who mostly feed and rage in their games, talking smack all the time. Now don't misunderstand, this is a great game with huge potential. But the truth of it is it's rotten from the bad matchmaking and somewhat horrid and lack of brain community. Main reasons not to play this game goes undisputed as follows: 1# Russians ruining games, talking russian when they clearly selected english as the preferred language. In case anyone hasn't noticed dota is a team game. 2# Solo queue has been removed(this means that you can be matched against an enemy 5 stack when you are playing alone) 3# No real community Q&A support from developers, and complete ignorance on the game dev forum, mods deleting posts that's not deemed \"worthy\" even though there is issues surrounding the topics. 4# Ranked is viritually a joke in comparison to normal MM, the only difference is a number for self gratification purposes, It viritually means nothing when most MMR's you are still playing with complete '. 5# Broken Solo-Queue. At times, matches you whether you are alone or 2 players playing together, you will often or not(depending on your luck) you will be matched with an enemy full 5 man team communicating in game, while your team is just 2+2+1 or just all solo players. This creates a huge disadvantage at the start of the match. Now Valve, has it ever occured to you in the small strains left of what corporate moral fiber you have that you should fix Dota 2's blatant community issues? Is this really how you get out of your responsibilities by ignoring and deleting users expressing concern in a non-inflammatory way? It's shameful considering how much of a profit you're making on it. At least you'd have the dignity to give us something back no? I've personally almost quit this game two times because I can't handle the community and players I am matched with constantly, they don't speak my language, share my mindset or my skill level the least, except an actual good match on some occations. Which leaves me with a horrible experience most of the time.", "num_reviews": 17, "num_screenshots": 760}

In the early 2000s, when I had a lot of free time, Quake 3, Elite Force, Jedi Knight 2, et cetra all took up a ton of my time; but as my age progressed, I had less time to dedicate to gaming. Mass Effect 1 and 2 both took about 100 hours away from me; but that was probably the most I'd invested in many years. I currently have around 500 hours of Dota 2, and don't plan on stopping anytime soon. The gameplay is spectacular, the community is great (I have made more Steam friends on this game than any other), the meta is interesting, the professional scene is a blast to watch, and the game is extremely well supported - especially with the recent Wraith Night/Legion Commander content update. The thing is that I'm not great at Dota 2. I've put almost 500 hours in, and there's still more for me to learn - there are still some heroes I have yet to play! It is a lot of investment, but once you 'get' it, you will have an absolute blast. EDIT: Just updating this now that I've put around 1600 hours in. I still completely stand by everything that I said previously. The game is super fun, and I'm really enjoying playing with all of the friends I've made in it. I've also experienced some of the negative parts of the community, and they're unfortunate; but I must say that they are far and few between. The community is largely welcoming, and I've made some fantastic friends through it - ones I hang out with in real life now. Definitely play the game, the learning curve is steep but entirely worth it.", "num_reviews": 8, "num_screenshots": 60}

If you are a newbie to this kind of genre or this game in particular, think carefully about getting into it. Not just because it's very hard to get the basic right, but also it will slowly consume your life. Look at the average player spending their time in this game. Look at my record. GG. No refund on your life spent. Legal addiction. Despite all this, you should enjoy the game once everything's in place. This game, hands down, gives the best feeling of victory ever. As well as the worst feeling ever if you get to play with stupid people in your team. This game requires skill and teamwork. The more you play the better you are. It would be ideal to play with your friends. So it's easier to work together as a team. Solo is a bit of a gamble. The community is toxic. If you can't deal with something like this, you should avoid it. This is quite normal in competitive games. Victory matters, you know? There is a mute option too. On the racist part, some people are branded as noobs depending on the region. Russian on EU. Pinoy on SEA. You will encounter different kinds of bad words, again, depending on the region. Some examples are , tangina, pota, bobo, gago, lanjiao, sohai etc. I know all of them including the meaning. See? Play dota 2 for free language course. Being russian or pinoy doesn't mean you are a noob. You should see this more as a joke. There are pro russian and pinoy players. Some rank really high. No need for it to be high bracket, some can play well. So it doesn't mean that it's untrue. It's just true to some extent. The game is free-to-play.

The two is not to refer to the game being a sequel, which it is, but rather to specify the number of ancients in a game. The objective is to turn it into Dota 1. In Dota, you need to defend an ancient, which is either a tree or a rock depending on your religious affiliation. Since I'm one and two-thirds Bhuddist, I usually end up defending one of them at random, much like all the other players. Dota is a very unique game, in that includes both offense and defense. There are lots of characters, and all of them are mostly good at different things. In my opinion, the best part of Dota is playing it. This is because Dota is an extremely unique combining many difficult strategies, such as attacking the enemy team's Ancient or defending your own Ancient. The goal of Dota, much like other games, is to win. If you become proficient at this skill, you will win very often, leading to more victories. Scientists show that six out of every three Dota players that win matches tend to be on the winning team when the game is over. This is because winning substantially increases your chances of not losing. Dota takes a while to learn though, and that is because it is an extremely offensive, yet defensive, game with many complicated nuances, like being a farmer or trying to help your teammates do good. One interesting feature of Dota is that dying is really bad, in the sense that you lose money and time because respawns are really long, like when Halo 3 would just beep at you instead of spawning you and you'd get really angry, except this is an intentional feature intended to spice up the classic innovation of offfense vs. defense vs. offense. Why did I write a third position in that last sentence? Excellent question. There are neutral enemies in the game, and they usually don't do a whole lot except sit there and be neutral. If you don't respect their space, however, you may find that they beging to fight back, much like an offensive form of self-defense. Early in a match of Dota, you find yourself buying useful items like tp scrolls, also called Town Portal Scrolls, or Town Portal Scrolls for short. Why did I mention Town Portal Scrolls multiple times? Good question! That is because there are multiple teams. Once you've bought items, you go kill enemy creeps, and they aren't people so it's ethically sound and completely morally fine to do. :) Once you've spilt some blood, or watched as they comically struggle to kill each other for your favor, you may realize that you have more money and have leveled up. That is because creeps are made of gold stitched together by experience and points, and that usually transfers to you after they die. Think of it like inheritance or maybe a n involuntary tribute system. Once you've levelled up and gotten rich, you can buy better items that make you stronger, and then get new abilities like skills, active abilities, passive abilities, or passive-aggressive abilities. These abilities let you hurt creeps and other palyers more effectively, which may or may not be socially acceptable in your region of birth. Please refer to local ethic codes and statutes to determine whether victory is a viable gameplay style for you in your chosen country of choice. Once you've become the best all-around person you can be, or at least made some incremental progress down that road that usually takes about an hour on average, (resets between games, so you never get bored) it's time to go tear down the other team's towers (those, like many buildings in the united states, canada, or certain US territories, will fight back and damage you) and then eventually go and destroy their Ancient, which is what the A stands for in Dota. That makes your team the winner, and implies that you are better people in a metaphorical sense than your enemy team counterparts.", "num_reviews": 12, "num_screenshots": 22}

As you can see, I've only played 50 odd hours of this game at the time this review was made, but if I had to add at least ONE positive note to this review, its this. I've mananged to learn russian in only a few hours, grasping the most important phrase, \" blyat\". This phrase runs through my mind, every day of every minute. I sometimes even say it to myself in my head IRL when I see someone doing something moronic. This game is a russian weapon developed by Putin himself to enslave the world, along with the help of whatever leader Brazil has right now. While most of the friends I play with play LoL, I quit that in order to seek refuge from the spanish epidemic there is over there, but instead, have been sucked into this South America/Russian racism simulator wasting most of the extra money I have on steam to buy cosmetic items for heroes I've just played. I never liked history when in school, I hated it, with a passion, just like the Americans with their hatred for the Russians. This game has taught me everything I need to know on why to hate russia, how to hate russia and question the very existance of that country based on the ape like intelligence that I've seen coming from the country. In short, if you've always been a saint in your life, never swore, never hated another culture, never thought of abusing everyone you know that doesn't speak english that well, then I'd suggest not playing MOBA's entirely, all jokes aside. If cancer had to be a game, this would be it. Without a thought. What valve has done, is develop a way of making World War 3 possible. Along with the help of Putin, and his various ape test subjects that I've encountered in the game. 11/10 would keep playing.", "num_reviews": 7, "num_screenshots": 359}

Here is the reasons. 1)Broken stupid  meta , icefrog's nerfs and buffs. First of all the guy who makes all the balancing things doesn't even play the game itself. IF a hero gets picked too much in the pro scene , icefrog will nerf the  out of that hero and make it unplayable (Exp:Ember Spirit). Or he just buffs a hero like Riki since the day he came in Dota 2 (Riki is generally easy to counter in high skill pubs but he wrecks the  out of new players) and nerf a hero like Crystal Maiden both nerfing her damage movespeed etc. 2)THE ING COMMUNITY+MATCHMAKING (+Russians on English Lang.) AND RANKED Aaand here we are at the best part of Dota , the community... It is filled with immature kids who will rage at you and say stupid  like ''omfg u so noob'' ''learn2play feggit'' ''y u use midas on big creep'' , it's literally cancer for someone sensitive aganist stupidity . Believe me after spending hours and hours inside those people you will slowly become one of them or atleast it will cause depression + anger issues. Ranked system of Dota is just simply broken. There is no difference between a 3.5k player and a 1k player , it is all the same. The points are just there so some  can brag about his non existent 6k mmr lie.(Hell i typed a comment under a vid related to Dota some guy just came in and said he had 6k and you are a ing noob you should kill myself omfg) And the public matchmaking, slightly better than ranked a little bit because 1 out of a KAJILLION BILLION CHANCE you can actually meet with people who are funny and nice to play with (i made a lot of friends like this) but believe me most of the time you pick EU server with ENG language you will get Russians who farm Dagon on CM in hardlane and never communicate with you. You will slightly learn Russian because these guys never speak English even if they know it and since they love to scream in mic (like idi nahuy pidor suka blyat padaroshnik pizdec bla bla bla...) you will instantly learn MOTTHEEERR RRRRUSSIA ACCENT.+Either you will get (Not being racist here , but Dota really does make you racist) Esta muerto mexican fellas , Spanish people on American server (or Russians with 9000 ping). Btw don't ever write guides like I did. I innocently wanted to help the other new players with a few guides about the heroes I know really well. Some Armenian kid called me a  with his poor English. (For telling people to use Midas on the big creep in jungle camps to get a level advantage) 3)Lastly (Because i dont need to say anything more why this game is so piece of ) the ing effects on you... Why do you even want to play this game , it is like eating an apple with 4000 worms inside. Anyways arguing with a Dota player made me realise that this game completely destroys your social life and your ability to think, go try it yourself try to say something opposite to these s... (There is a big ''real life'' world for you to discover out here. Get a hobby instead of playing this.) So im done please never ever ever start playing this game.", "num_reviews": 15, "num_screenshots": 25}

(too many , griefers) --> You make 1000 good moves in a game, and you won't be recognized. Go feed once and get reported. --> You will start putting aside other priorities.

I only recommend you this game if you love MOBAs, but I didn't like MOBAs and now I have 1200 hours in it. I was a COD player, an MW2 player. Of course you will not be ''pro'' in your first matches. To be good you need a lot of training. If you played LoL and you have 30 lvl its sure you know the \"basics\". In this game the most important thing is the \"Last Hitting\" at the start, because if you have more gold and XP than your enemy, you own the game. The game may be boring, but if you have friends it won't be. I think the boring part is the first 13 lvl because you can't play some gamemodes before that. If you are new here you need to complete the training! If you are totally new here completing the training will get you a Sniper set. No the setts doesn't give you any bonus, just the enemy can see how rich you are. These decorative items have degree: Common, Uncommon, Rare, Mythical, Immortal, Old and Arcane. This items can be Normal, Auspicious, Heroic, Cursed and Unusual. So these were the decorative items lets talk about the in-game items! You start with 625 gold each hero have their own item build. I recommend you the Healing Slave, Tango and clarity items, this items will fill your HP or your mana. If you are new or never played that hero before i recommend you the guides (Up left the book icon). I recommend you the GreyShark(RU/UA) builds or Purge(ENG) builds.

The program lets me assume the role of another creature, helping me experience our oneness with the universe.

The other disciples (woefully) always curse at me. I usually have to mute them. I do so to concentrate on being one with the virtual nature. (I cant afford to go to national parks, so this is the best thing). Sometimes I see lots of colorful exclamations points and these PING PING PING PING PING sounds occur around my character. They are beautiful. One time someone said, THE ?! LEVEL 1 DISRUPTOR, BUY COURIER YOU ING ! And the truth is there are many players like him. They arent at peace with themselves. Perhaps if he came into the forest and hummed koans with me, and he had done so as the giant, walking tree, then he would see his greater consciousness. All the negative energy would leave his body, and wed share a moment of experiencing our Buddha nature. In my experience, sessions last about 10-20 minutes. And initially it did not take long to find a server; apparently Ive been moved to low-priority matchmaking. But thats okay. I just assume the lotus position in my chair and wait patiently.

First I would like to introduce myself :) . OK my name is etro, who has a hobby of playing a lot of games like skyrim, minecraft,pokemon, and etc. OK here's the point when I played dota 1, the first try of the game was hard and I really can't understand it very much. The moment I played dota 2 , that's how I realize and understands the game so the thing that I'am saying dota2 or valve can explain better than dota 1 (no offense , ice frog) so I would gladly recommend playing dota2 than dota 1 for the first try of the game :). Others say that dota 2 is not a good game or a bad game (well we all have our opinions :) ). For me it's the best game of all the time :D. I respect the Lol (league of legends) players. Even though they are saying that dota 2 sucks. Here in my country (philippines) many Filipinos say that they like Lol better. But I really don't get their point I mean (no offense to the Lol makers and producers) but Lol kinda copied dota 1 ( I don't even know if Lol have their permissions or paid icefrog for copying the main idea of dota) but valve paid icefrog for dota 2 so it means valve have their license while Lol doesn't have. I don't really know guys if Lol really have their permissions or paid icefrog. But I think they didn't ask for permissions or paid ( if im mistaken please correct me or you can just tell me to remove this review. And im sorry if im mistaken that Lol really have their permissions or paid icefrog.but i really think they didnt. Well the real point in this paragraph is I will play or follow the one who have permmisions or paid and that is dota 2 or (valve). If your noob or getting annoyed it's OK cause we all started like noobs :) and just ignore the people who are saying that you're noob,stupid,idiot, they will just annoy you and they have no hearts (they are monsters).

My play time reflects how much time I have spent appreciating the team work and competitive spirit of the game. Supports who actually support the team, carries who can carry the team to victory, and players who can execute a base push as timely as the New York Sunway. By the way, I love subway sandwiches. I eat a BLT without the T almost every week. Bacon is the most delicious meat. Lettuce is like the cup to the tea party. You can't have tea without water, and you can't hold water without cups. Unless of course you use your hands. Or your mouth. But lettuce cups are pretty delicious. So imagine the bacon and the lettuce together but without the disgusting creatures known as tomatoes. Which while they rhyme with potato, don't taste anything similar. If potatoes tasted like french fries, tomatoes would taste like awful fried wet vegetables. Speaking of wet tables, If you put water on tables, it gets wet. Not stuff like multiplication tables that are way too complicated. What is 6X6? Its like 64 or something. Which is like 10 if you add them all together. What does that mean? I am not sure. Math is hard. Unlike DOTA2. Which is a great game. Especially as a carry. Actually I never played carry before. It seems like a pretty easy job though.Just kill things until you win the game. That is a pretty simple job description. Unlike support or mid or offlane or jungle. I mean jungle is a location, how is it a job? It is more like a forest than a jungle. I mean jungles have lions and stuff right? Forests have angry bears. I am not sure where man-birds and horse-men are from though. Horses aren't jungle creatures I think. They sound more like mountain creatures to be honest. I haven't seen a troll before or a gnoll, but I bet they are forest creatures as well too. So jungle should really be called forest. Mid is a pretty self explanatory position. Its the middle of the map lane. Like if you had 3 lanes, he would take the second one. Or she. There are female heroes as well. Are they called heroines? Well I wouldn't want to call anyone a dangerously addicting drug. That would be sexist. I mean playing Lina is pretty addicting though. Fire fire fire fire fire fire fire fire fire fire . Its like if you had a charmander and combined it with a jynx. Thats what lina is. Which reminds me that pokemon recently came out. X and Y are pretty popular with my friends, so I wamt a 3DS. Those things cost money though, but I head I can trade my items for cash. That sounds pretty amazing. Earning money while palying games, its like the American dream for people who don't want actual jobs. Not that I have a job yet. All I do is stay home and read manga. Which is pronounced mane gah, Like mango but with an a. I sometimes forget myself and add a false accent though and pronounce it mahn gaaaa. So offlane is the lane opposite of the safe lane. So the dangerous lane as they would call it. It isn't very safe cause you cross the mystical safety river to fight bad guys. Its like chinese vampires and running water. I don't think they can cross running water. Many they would have a hard time with modern day plumbing. One flush of the toilet and the go poof. Or do they? I actually know nothing about chinese vampires. I only know vampires from the books my friends lent me. It was the Twilight saga. I really preferred the Jacob to the other guy though. I was pretty upset when Bella made the wrong choice. I mean who wouldnt want a guy you could play fetch whenever you wanted. Plus the other guy was like 439434 years old. Yuck! So Support is the last job you can play. Not only do you provide moral support because most teams don't ever have asupport, but you also help buy buying items no one else in their right minds would buy. Like a slave donkey to carry your items for you. He can even be given magical wings for more than his actual buying price. Why wouldn't I want another donkey instead of one flying one? I am pretty sure two donkeys are cooler than one flying one. I mean how would you even catch a flying donkey? It could poop from like 60 feet and it would be awful. Like a divebombing terrible smelling equine terror. But donkeys are pretty cute. So keep them on the ground. If donkeys were meant to fly, god would have evolved them wings instead of using magic. So that is Dota. Its a pretty good game. But it has some problems too. After all, even BLT's have T's. Here are the digusting parts of the BLT. Games take a while to finish. So if you tend to have sudden gas attacks like me, you might have an accident while you are playing a particular game. A game of Dota can last from as long as 30 seconds to 50 hours. Like I am not even joking how troublesome it is to stay on the toiler for over an house to finish my game of Dota. I mean look at my avatar. That is my face for like the first 5 minutes of Dota before my legs fall asleep and I start getting cramps. It also has too many different heroes. I think the game could cut its hero count down to about 7. It would also encourage faster hero picking if the last 3 players couldn't choose any hero. It is a definitely annoying to choose the tree hero and the enemy hero picks an all fire team and the lumberjack hero. You are literally counterpicked because you chose too early. It would be better to give some kind of gold option or a repick option. Some game modes take forever. Like captains draft can be much shorter if they removed all the bans. Sometimes I want to make team electric, but then a ban comes up and I accidentally ban Mr. Thunder or the masked electric emo. Then Team thunder is ruined. I can understand why bans could be good though. Cause everyone chooses fat butcher guy. He uses his hook to hug you then you smell him to death. Sometimes he tickles you for extra damage. What is worse is that he eats you, he gets fatter and stronger. The biggest tomato of the problem is the fact that the game has too much action, but not enough story. Its like worse than Dynasty Warriors when it comes to story. I could use a few cutscenes telling me why I am teaming up with a giant spider, a porcupine, a baby rock, and a angel man. At least there was a reason in Dynasty Warriors 7 about why I am fighting Guan Yu with my hated enemies the filthy Wu. Were those filthy Wu actually even men? The way they fought with their cowardly fire arrows and powerful navy instead of facing the numerically and superiorly led enemy army head on just screams uncultured barbarians. So I think I will give the game a 1/10/14. Its a pretty good game, but the lack of story gives it only a 1 in that category. I understand that every hero has its own lore, but the bigger connection is quite lost when I team up with my biggest rival against my best friend. A 10 grade for the excellent team spirit of the game. People play like men instead of filthy Wu women. But Ali, why the 14 and not a 17? Because the game has that huge tomato. And I hate Tomatoes. I love BLT's without the T. BL is the greatest invention of man, till someone introduced the uncessary T. I would have BL everyday if I could afford it, but I have no job and spend all my time reading manga.", "num_reviews": 1, "num_screenshots": 0}

As far as most MOBAs are concerned, this one has a good blend of strategy and relfexes that rewards those who can use both to their advantage. The gameplay is, as a result, solid, and every sessions provides new opportunities for fun and strategy. The UI is a little underpopulated, however, and doesn't explain much. learning how to do some of the functional things, like leaving a game that's safe to leave, or muting people, or reporting people, are not super intuitive: you have to dig. Furthermore, the options available, though very powerful and plentiful, are not explained super well. As a result, it's important to toy around with your settings a bit, which can be a hassle. As far as the F2P model goes, it's pretty fair: you can play the whole game without needing any of the micro transactions. The only thing they do is customize your aethetics, and happily not to an extreme extent. Because of this, the game has a really unified look despite all the different items your characters can wear. This might dissuade people from buying them, because some of the items are barely even visible. Overall, I would recommend this game to anyone with a hankering for a challenge. The game is NOT easy, but it is worthwhile and a lot of fun once you get a hang of things. Veterans of the genre will find a lot to like.", "num_reviews": 4, "num_screenshots": 51}

Overall i give this  game a 4/10, the game itself is worth at least a 9, but when you put Russians and  of the entire world together without putting them in their own servers or restricting them by their gameplay, this is what you get, people that cannot communicate and play together to win. I promise you, this games community will make you loose all hope in Humanity and in everything that is good, if youre unlucky, you will end up as one of them. I, for this matter, am abandoning this ship, after 1,3k hours played i finally figured, this game is being ed by its own community because it fails to set up people who can communicate, i might come back and play it once valve makes people stay in their respective regions by creating dedicated servers ( Like LoL ) but untill then, i will no longer participate in this . Thank you and good luck trying to make something out of this game, you will need it.

Your team on the other hand will fight over the mid position, pick 5 cores, purchase no wards ,fail to rotate on ganks and you wont have a courier till the 35 minute mark. 3) If you play with your friends they will slowly break all ties from you.

This list can go on for another 2000 words. The game only has one map so the game probably sounds repititive but its not, there is many ways to play the game, such as carry, support, tank, jungler, etc. When you check out this game it probably is going to look boring but definitly check this game out, one of my favorite games.", "num_reviews": 16, "num_screenshots": 5257}

As someone who's been playing Dota since its beginnings, the first thing you may recognize and notice is that many of the games features such as map layout, heroes, and gameplay is almost, exactly the same but with a better and more refined look with updated graphics, making the entire map feel more lively and a refresh of old. Of course, that's all good but at the heart of Dota as many may know is its gameplay and replayability. The amount of hours I've pumped back in the first Dota was unforgettable, clocking more than +2500 hours of time played. Just like Dota 1, Dota 2 shares the exact same formula, pick a hero, last hit creeps/farm up gold, and win team fights to gain victory. Simple and straight forward, right? Wrong. If you played back in Dota 1, you'd come to realize the more you played it, the game had a fairly, high skill requirement in order to do well, especially if you're pushing to be top in a region or tournament. The amount of time and practice makes perfect as you will want to eventually learn every hero, how they synergize and working together with your teammates. It gets rough but extremely fun and satisfying, especially if you're on high level play. Unfortunately though, most people tend to ignore these kinds of games since difficulty is fairly high or they just can't stand to put the effort to actually play the game well and properly, otherwise various issues can occur, such as getting hate from other players and getting reported for not being able to play well. It's an immediate turn off and can easily have people packing their bags and finding another game. Unfortunately, again, this is thanks to the toxic communities that have spawned across all MOBA genre games. You will always have to deal with these kinds of people who will give you  and you have to bare with it as those kinds of players won't be going away anytime soon. I strongly believe competitive games have the highest chance to have ragers compared to other types of games out there and it's tough to avoid the negativity that comes with it. Now with some additions, they've added a store where you can purchase from hero skins, UI skins, to different voices for the default announcer, different couriers and selling/buying through the steam market. The thing that seperates skins here compared to others is that skins come in seperate, armor pieces you can equip on a hero, meaning you can say, keep a helmet and sell the other parts, like gloves to someone else on the steam market. It goes to show how much control the players have and what they have in their hands. The best part of all this, is that all heroes are free right off the bat to everyone, so no need to spend money and unlock the heroes you want to play. It allows us, as the players to explore and see what heroes we enjoy playing the most and if you're into cosmetics, you also have the option to buy a skin. The business model for me personally, is fair and likeable as I've had no issues with it whatsoever, it's equal for both the customer and developer. Now, while the gameplay is still the same and fun at its core, what else has been added by Valve? Well, we now have various events that take from time to time, usually worldwide holidays such as Christmas or Halloween are some examples. These events bring in replay value to want and play the game more such as getting limited skins for heroes, UI skins, couriers or just straight up rare items that can be sold across the entire steam market so you can get some funds put into your wallet for perhaps other items/skins on the market or even just saving up to buy another game entirely from either the steam store or in-game store. They've also made several changes to the UI compared to back in Warcraft 3. The UI is bigger and straight forward, and buying items through the shop are easily seen as everything is now categorized properly, and accessing them with a simple click. It's easily noticeable but just in case, you may have noticed, some heroes have not been put into the game yet and are missing. It's mainly due to copyright issues with Blizzard, seeing as how Brewmaster was a Pandaren from Warcraft and now Valve has changed him to a Koala beast of some sort? In fact, every champion for the most part, have been changed in their appearance because Dota started off by using Blizzard races and even some famous lore characters such as Thrall (Disruptor) or Rexxar (Beastmaster). It's certainly slowed down some heroes from being brought back, the recent being Legion Commander (male to female) and Terrorblade (no longer the demon hunter/Illidan). Valve still has a few more heroes to change and get out, such as Techies, so if you're a big Techies fan and/or mainer, you're going to have to wait a while longer until Valve finally pushes him out. Alright, and now my few personal grips about this game other than having a toxic community as I mentioned earlier throughout these types of games. I just do not appreciate or enjoy the art style that Valve has brought into this game. NOT in terms of quality but art style. The quality is fine for some but most heroes I feel, lost their identity and instead of something different, or unique, Valve just made most of the heroes look ugly and feel uninspired in my honest opinion. I mean now Earthshaker now looks like a mutated version of Beast from X-Men with a mix of a Koala (similar to the new Brewmaster). Hell, I still appreciate Blizzards art style so much more in Warcraft 3 than this new look, look at Pudge and Slardar, they had the look, voice and feel back in Warcraft 3 but now it's just not as strong anymore here. Even the almighty and fearful Zeus doesn't look like an intimidating god anymore, but a scientist. Another thing that I do not find a lot of fun a whole lot anymore is the gameplay itself, yes, the core gameplay. It's literally been the same thing over and over, nothing new or innovative, just a rinse and repeat of picking a hero, farming up gold for items, and winning team fights. Maybe it's just me after playing thousands of hours in this genre or perhaps if you take a look past the gameplay and look at what it really offers, there's really nothing going for it. Last hitting isn't fun anymore, as that's all you're doing most of the time early on, with team fights mid to late game (unless you personally find it fun). The worst part, is you will fall behind if you say die a few times to an opponent carry, it pigeon holds you because now your team has little to no retaliation or chance of hoping to win since that carry will just roll face your entire team and there's a decent chance someone on your team will call you out, meaning more anger and frustration can occur. I can safely say as a long time Dota 1 player/fan, Dota is still fun but it's not fun if you want to play decently at the average level because the amount of mechanics people know in that level will put you in a disadvantage if you just learn a few because most just don't have time to do it. So what can I say, I mean in the end, this is basically Dota 2.0 with better graphics, same gameplay like the original, a few added features like events, and the in-game store associated with the steam market. Everything looks great except the art style for most heroes (personal opinion) and of course, the ease of access to newcomers while it may seem straight forward, it gets more complicated in-depth, meaning there's a harder learning curve and barrier to pass through to fully enjoy the game at its fullest, meaning you'll need to spend some time and practice.", "num_reviews": 8, "num_screenshots": 0}

This is the first Valve game where I haven't had fun at playing it and made me question their work. After a year of gameplay I can easily say that if you don't play it with friends you can end up with a brain tumor or end up in a nuthouse. You need to play it with friends because it's the only way to enjoy the suffering. The artstyle and voices are great, but the gameplay can be a little tricky and it can go unbalanced very easily. The only time where I found the gameplay balanced was in the Greeviling because everyone was in the same level. But the gameplay it's not the biggest issue with this game. The community it's REALLY toxic and Valve itself suffered this recently. They are equal or worse than the CoD community. The only good thing about this game is the business model. The big difference between Dota 2 with TF2 and CS:GO it's that those games gives you fun and money. This game only gives you money. No matter if you win or you lose a match, you will always end up with the same bitter taste. I only recommend this game for those who lost their minds or just want to make a couple of bucks to buy another game. If you are sane, please make a restriction order to anyone who invite you to play it.", "num_reviews": 16, "num_screenshots": 560}

I quit, that's the long story short. Wan't a long story long? Well... read ahead then my dear no-lifer (says the one that spends time writing game reviews in Steam)! So... where should I start? Of course... from the start! A friend of mine invited me to play this \"Super badass game\" with him and after days and weeks of pleads I finally bent to his will. Entered the game, all felt fine. He was a pro player and guided me through it. I am also a sharp person that never does anything if he's unprepared so I read a few tons of guides from DotA legends and watched plenty of tournament videos before my first game. I started high above all the newbies and my lerning curve was quite fluent. This means I rarely got to deal with raging idiots, though rarely is not the same as never. Even I that played at a higher level than my matches got raged at from time to time. Imagine how a normal player felt... brainless, super confident brats keep yelling at everyone they don't like (even if he is playing well) that he is terrible and should uninstall the game. Heck, the best guide ever writen for the game starts with a description on how to mute players and how to shield your psych... So yeah, nail number one in DotAs coffin: The terrible playerbase. Yeah, there are some nice guys that survived but their numbers are rapidly dwindling and honestly... even the kids at LoL are nicer these days! Well... DotA could have still sprung out of it's coffin if that was all... but it isn't. Things like the terribly broken matchamking system count as well. Even if you rock you can hardly progress through the ranks and as gamers say \"Leave the trench\". Since all depends on your partners and you mostly get raging kids and game-abandonig russians (no racism, simply plain facts and statistics, hell I'm a fan of Putin!), you will never be able to roll up enough wins to play with skilled people. Yeah... Valve says it's fair and it doesn't rank your wins/losses but your overall performance in the game... but... yeah, you guessed it, that's pure ! The heroes... See, the game has this goat fella named Riky that is wrecking public games because of his easy-to playiness and he is overpowered as hell to any unexperienced player (yeah, good ones can counter the  out of him with plenty of heroes). So... instead of getting this guy nerfed (reduce his stats) he is getting boosted with every update. Same goes for plenty of heroes which ruins the game. The balancing of heroes and skills is being lost gradually over time and lately, if you see a certain hero in a team on a pub game you know he will win (and yeah, only jerks pick such... but that's almost all the players you'll meet!). Other heroes that are so fragile and weak like the poor crystal maiden which gets killed 50 times per game are getting nerfed instead... And another nail goes in. I can keep this up for quite a bit but I realise readers are dropping off from the review like mosquitoes near \"Raid\" with every line I add so lets cut it here and shoot the word: The game is duying and unless it gets a restart it will keep degrading. Don't bother... you lose a lot of time playing it, matches take ages at times, no one pauses for you if your mom gets a blackout next to you... well either help her or lose the game... you see? It's not a good game to play, you won't learn russian (apart from swears)... you wont get smarter (quite the opposite)... you wont make cash unless you sacrifice your whole life to play professionally. You pour so much nerves, time and effort in this game and you get nothing apart from a few and far between games where you actually match with good guys who pick normal heroes and don't spam the mic with swears. Well the game isn't a  as someone who is on a rage spree might claim... it's a decent one but it's not worth it: I would mark it as a 4.65/10 (yeah, indeed: 4.65... what a nice number) and advice you against playing it. That's all really, excuse my lenghtiness and if you actually read that... well, go reward yourself with a treat from the fridge!", "num_reviews": 4, "num_screenshots": 18}

The spectator interface for viewing live games is impressive and though it seems the matchmaking algorithm is not really active at the moment for a beta the parts that work do so rather well. The attack and spell animations are all reworked and changed in this version so even for old dota 1 vets there is much to learn that only comes with the experience of engaging in the matches themselves. If you can get an invite and you like the MOBA genre you will find far more to like than not.

Not being anything like the actual game, and learning little to nothing through it. The game is a great F2P title, there are no microtransactions that will change the game, besides your character's appearance. Though the Dota servers are rough in some regions around the world, forcing players from those regions to play on other servers. Based for other regions, causing many problems. Such as language barriers, lag, and overall less team cooperation. If Valve improved some of the servers, instead of focusing mainly on N/A servers, this would most likely improve game quality for everyine around the world.

At first, all I can think is that I am happy to have woken from the nightmare. Later, in a moment of creeping fear, I will realise that the real nightmare is how bad I am at Dota... and yet I cannot stop myself from playing it. Dota 2 is an endless nightmare from which I cannot wake. To install it is to introduce into your life a hellish netherworld, one in which close friends are so disappointed in one another that they cannot even express it. One in which improvement means only that you will be matched against better opposition... All of this horror floats on the constant threat of the \"low priority queue,\" a stygian hellscape that this review could never hope to describe.

Lose 15 gold and counterpick the five broken heroes they choose. 3. Ban them from US Servers. #3 is inarguably the best solution. Join my group to fight for the cause.

Why can't a game just be about boobs like the old day- I mean what ever happened to good old Christian family values like Monopoly and Scrabble. Now we've gotta fill our games with fanservice and sell out to an audience that is somehow greater than ours? I don't think so. And there's even a character that's a flamboyant homosexual. I had to bring my children to therapy after they heard the words \"puddin pop\" from one such \"Storm Spirit\".

I recommend this game to any and all casual gamers, especially fans of light, friendly games and their community, like Club Penguin and 4 ch. an. Also, characters in this game are very easy to learn and their abilities are easy to utilize, allowing easy collaboration with teammates and friends, for example: Meepo the Geomancer is a great character for those new to the game, and I recommend all new players choose him. There's minor drawbacks in useful content though, like certain things are outright useless (like Couriers and Support characters) and they should be removed from the game to make it perfect and this is coming from a long term investor of this game who has dedicated many hours (1337, to be exact) to this extremely fun indie game.

Audio and video are incomparable. There were cube, cross in the older version, but in everything's smooth in new version. I mind the looks of some heros (sorting by race), but I used to it. Though what I miss from the older version is graphical visualization of objects, which was glowing out of them (aura, colors). But sound messages are just wonderful! Control, choice of using spells, items ... it's up to player, also like graphics and sounds. Great benefit is that you don't have to download and search maps, there is automatic update and synchronization. I give a big plus for buying, gaining of trading items. It's just huge jump and movement in this game. Who was devotee of the older version, he will also fall in love with this one. I recommend for 100%. Rating: 10/10 Slovak Review Bol som fanikom a hrom DOTA ''1'' a som i novej verzie DOTA 2. Audio a video s nezrovnaten. V starej verzii boli ''kocka, krik'' v novej ve pekne vyhladen. Trochu mu vad na poniektorch herov vzor (rozdelenie poda rasy), ale to som si u zvykol. o mi avak chba z prvej verzei je grafick vizulizcia predmetov, ktor z nich vyarovala (aury, sfarbenia, ...). o sa tka hlok: ,,S uasn!'' Ovldatenos, vber pouvania spellov, itemov, ... je na hrovi, taktie ako grafika i zvuky. Obrovksou vhodou je nesahovania a nehadanie mp, ale automatick aktualizcia a synchronizcia. Vek plus dvam i kpu, zskavania i trejdovania itemov. Proste obrovsk skok a posun v tejto hre. Kto bol zarytcom do starej verzie, tak isto si zamiluje i tto nov. Odporam na 100%.

Let this be a warning note for all gamers that have been a prisoner of their own style but then again trying to give Dota 2 a shot for a change of scene. if you are new to MOBA or just downright have had suck at it for whatever reasons, this game wont be any different by any means. So let us begin reviewing the game where comeback comes back and hits you in your face more than the Taken Franchise (i know they should have stopped after the first film..) -+- The game itself is pretty darn vast with approximately 112 heroes in the roster and just a bunch of different purchasable items to buy from the Gold you receive every second and by kills with. Its your job to figure out the strength and weaknesses of each of the character you are about to take down/ lead with and set your perks accordingly. -+- Objective aren't any different for other MOBAS, you take down enemy structures to make the 'Ancient' aka the final tower vulnerable and then take it out. -+- The community is definitely one of the most rage induced people piled together in a game where communication and tactical planning are crucial. Every team i was assigned to there seemed some guy Screaming his throat out at me or some other bad player in out team. Just like an ex-boyfriend with emotional issues. I don't really blame them, it is one of the most competitively played games out there. -+- The graphics are better than most and seem well thought out. the animations of characters on the lower box really adds to it. Its well thought out and isn't much flashy, should help most people unlike my ADHD sufferer cousin. And the system requirements aren't as much so you should do fine with most potatoes. -+- Sounds are quite varying for all items and also visually the effects are quite different that is definitely a mention for the creative team responsible for it. -+- They have drops! yep just like CS:GO you have a chance to get an item drop that can be tradable/marketable. some drops do cost a lot and can buy you a game on steam sale (cumulative drops) if you are dedicated to it. -+- I'd also like to mention playing with bots will only get you so far in a game against people. The tactics people use are nothing like they programmed those binary butts with. There is still a lot to conclude in what seems to be a game based on a chessboard turned side ways, but i wont ruin it all by discussing it here. So spend some money on a better internet and try it for yourself, Gaben knows you'll need it. This game did have its moments for me but it just sadly wasn't a meant to be. Well the opponent team will surely mourn for me for all those victories i snagged them. sadly i cant say the same for my friends.

Basically in tems of speed DotA 2, along with Strife (which is basically DotA 2 in graphics style of LoL with a pet+item system which you can level up by playing) is average, so if you think a MOBA should be slower you should try League of Legends and if you think it should be faster you should try Heroes of Newerth. If you are looking for an alternative that is less knowledge based you should probably try Heroes of the Storm, since you dont have to learn as many item effects. DotA 2 in a \"nutshell\" after ~2400h of playtime: -New players (if interested in cosmetic items) will have to visit the shop now because game drops have become so incredibly rare that it has become hilarious. -IF you buy item chests in the shop and dont get the set you bought it for, you can't sell the items since volvo put a trade+market cooldown (2 months I think) on every new item that gets released (yay!) so if you dont want to spend money until you have each possible drop from that single chest (RNG is strong in this one) you're better off waiting until the desired item is marketable and then buy it off the market. -Volvo greed simulator: The old loot system, in which you could acutally gain items after a game ,for DotA 2 profile levels, and a leveling chest you had in your inventory (which could be opened every few profile levels and contained a new chest to open later) was successfully reworked into greed-mode. The chances to get ANY items after a game are as low as getting a legendary (or higher) before. Sure they drop ENTIRE sets now, but most of them are common to rare, which overall is still less rewards than before if you add up singe items and put them up against the set drop chance now in both, item quantity AND value. Maybe you should try some \"never change a running system\" in this particular function. -Mostly developer/support abandoned game. the new content this game releases is mostly made by the community since the hero sets are workshop based and hero releases/patches are just really really rare. Special events are mostly the same every year and the report system is most likely 100% count-based/not reviewed by support employes (for example if you express your annoyance towards...lets say russians...for not being able to communicate in english on EU servers, you will most likely end up muted because out of the 10 players in a EU game 3 (probably more) are most likely russian and will report you for speaking english) -These days russian-infested to the max...8/10 games you play will result in eyecancer due to russian chatspam, even though they have their own servers(!) because its way cooler to go to international servers and spam your native language, thanks volvo for letting that happen! maybe one day the EU servers will be renamed into russia 2 and russia 3 and the actual EU will have to play on american servers after all :D *EDIT*-In addition to the listed issues, the game servers are now absolute ! 1/4-1/5 of the games crash and are not counted due to connection issues with the servers, great job of making it even worse when ppl thought that wasn't possible... Conclusion: If you want to play a game in which you get rewarded for playing (in terms of cosmetic effects and/or profile progression) this probably is not the right choice anymore, because as stated you don't get level rewards or similar stuff anymore, just REALLY rare item drops (probably in the 0,2% range). If you want to blow off some steam with trolling other players, spamming your native language while being sure nobody will be able to understand you this might probably be YOUR gamechoice #1. The community these days is mostly toxic and troll based so this is NOT your game for some serious gametime (at least not in solo matchmaking). I didnt check the other games these days but the community in HoN was much more friendly and less russian. In my personal opinion DotA 2 isn't playable solo anymore because there is too few games where you can actually play properly, without being annoyed by trolls or russians...

Great graphics, amazing sound and voice design, and rich backstories in every corner are just some of the features that make Dota 2 great. But it's major strong point is the depth in its mechanics. While Dota 2's gameplay might seem daunting at first, it's one of the best and more engaging ever seen in a game, and learning it is just one of the reasons why this game is addicting. Other games such as League of Legends end up falling short because their devs decided to cut much from the original formula, but Dota 2 kept it intact, and makes sure you learn something new everyday. Not only the core game is strong, but also the eSport scene surrounding it is amazing and growing, with several tournaments going on, including Valve's own The International. At the time of release, the game looks like a train with no brakes, about to crash against its competitors and run them over, raising the bar on the genre with a myriad of awesome features that perfectly compliment an awesome game.", "num_reviews": 1, "num_screenshots": 19}

Attempt Duo Queue and end up with 3 Russians, which kind of diminishes the full blown Russian experience; thus I do not recommend you try this or you can play with bots, which are surprisingly better teammates than the Russians. Just for good measure I'll throw in an extra ''Russians'' to get the point across. Enjoy yourself, comrad.

You have a selection out of 108 unique heroes, each with a unique skillset. Every hero is also available from the minute you start. No playing X amount of games before this hero becomes available. The object of Dota 2 is to destroy the other teams Ancient. To do this, you can work your way down any of the 3 lanes (Top, Mid or Bottom) by destroying the outer towers. Youll start most matches pairing up or going into a lane solo trying to get some experience and gold by last hitting creeps. As the game progresses, youll start teaming up more with your other team members to take on the other team or to quickly kill of a solo member of their team. Because of the importance of coordinating your attacks with other team members, communication is a very important aspect of the game. I therefor also recommend playing this game with some friends because random people that youll be teamed up with wont always show the same willingness to communicate. If youre just starting out playing Dota 2, I also recommend playing with a friend who already has some experience in the game because the learning curve is very steep, especially when you have to figure everything out by yourself. The skill ceiling is also extremely high. So every time you play, you might learn something new. Due to the high number of available heroes, skills and items, you can be sure that every game is unique. Something to be wary of is the community. There are people out there that take this game way more seriously than you might. Most players have an opinion of what you should have done in a certain situation and will be happy to blame a lost teamfight on you not taking that action. Flaming is something that could happen often. But if youre playing with a team entirely made up of your friends, this shouldnt prove to be an issue. If this is not the case, dont worry. You can always mute the players that are causing you grief and continue enjoying this wonderful, team oriented game.", "num_reviews": 2, "num_screenshots": 192}

But I will say the following generic things: Dota2 is not a simple team game. There are a huge amount of advanced techniques that you will have to be told or lookup online. You come into Dota to have fun with \"tools\", every character is a different tool. They move different, they turn different, they attack differently. If you enjoy playing the same game over and over and perfecting little, small tricks to give yourself a slight advatange, then this is for you. If you come from any fighting game for example, you can get into this. Like really into this. What makes Dota2 different from other MOBAs? Depth. Dota offers much more variety, much more freedom to experiment. Other MOBAs shy away from the huge complexity that is giving more tools to the tools. You have items that give you more movement options, that take away movement options from the opponent, even random modifiers that spawn on the map periodically. In other games you will find these \"options\" baked into a character, they try to guide you into learning how a character \"should\" be played. Dota2 gives you the sandbox to experiment, As a reminder, it's never anyone's fault when you fail to build your tool properly. This is a game. Have fun. Most people just look up to a player and copy his playstyle, and Valve facilitates this. But you don't have to. Everything depends in Dota2. Should you try Dota2? Yes. But remember to have fun. You will be playing a game that can last 1 hour per match. Enjoy. Smile. A lot of people forget this. If you're not enjoying Dota2. Uninstall.", "num_reviews": 8, "num_screenshots": 2}

A message to my fellow classical economists: we're all Keynesians now. With the release of How to Train your Dragon 2 (which might've been more suitably named \"How to be a Dictator 2\"), Communist influence has been seeded into the minds of the children, destroying the potential for a perfect laissez faire economy for future generations. How to Train your Dragon 2 is a story of a young Shaggy Rogers discovering the wonders of \"Sandwiches\" for the first time with the Rottweiler he owned before Scooby. Our protagonist, a rebellious socialist who never came to grasp the true meaning of Republican Motherhood, is a frequenter of the parks, motivating the homeless by promising them peace and beating them until they promise to get a job or preaching to the innocent picnickers about the evils of animal cruelty. A subtheme of gun control is dished out discreetly as the script writers encourage us to do better than what game theorists think we are capable of with flawed moral consciences. In the same way viewers are assured that we have learned from the days of the arms race by subtly bringing up the Marilyn Monroe-JFK scandal. Obnoxious and unorginal, the production draws content heavily from the movies E.T. and Avatar, indicating that it could have been funded by a collective effort between PETA, James Cameron, the public health institute, Heidi Fleiss, and Joseph Stalin. In the end, the main character's tyrannical liberal-minded father boards a boat to Russia under heavy artillery fire by social darwinists, portrayed as defiant and unruly teenagers that want nothing but an end to civilization. I can say with certainty that any child who watches this film WILL become a democrat at some point in their lives, and, like the movie suggests, the only way to prevent the disease from spreading is to contain it.

It seems really stupid, but you suck it up and play through the tutorial. Then you stupidly decide to play your first game of real dota. Put short you fed, badly. After going 0/30 your first game you kinda hate dota. But you stupidly decide to play another, and chances are you lost again. And this keeps happening until you discover your first newb hero. Drow seems so op doesnt she. Afterwards you decide to play this hero again and again, and doesn't it feel good to win. 50 games deep you'll hate noobstomp heroes like riki, sniper, drow, and bloodseeker. Obvisously these heroes are really op. 100 games deep and you'll find yourself trying out some new heroes, tidehunters ravange is pretty epic you have to agree. 200 games deep and you'll have played every hero, with the exception to earth spirt. How the hell do you play that guy, I dont get it. 300 games deep and those newb stomp heroes dont seem so bad anymore. Manfight riki, stand right next to drow, get blademail for sniper, and buy a tp for bloodseeker. And dont forget to buy dust. 400 games in you will know how to ward, rune control, stack and pull and play a support. You will understand the basics of having one person farm while another supports and harrasses. Holy  you've made it to 500 games. Remeber your first match if only you could see yourself now. By this point you understand the basics of dota! Remeber to dodge the sunstrike! 600 games in and you'll realize that for the past months dota is the only game you have played. Like the only game, because once you start playing dota you never come back. Unless your power dies.... By 700 games you'll start playing against trilanes. Now as an offlaner you have to do your best to not die, and get some farm. Hide in the trees and sap xp where you can. By 800 your tempted to buy that arcana. Not saying you will but it sure does look tempting. By 900 you know what to buy, and you get what every hero can do. You know where to be and when and you get the feeling when there smoke ganking and roshing. Gamesense op! By 1000 games you hit a milestone. The game doesnt seem like colored creatures punching eachother. Welcome to dota 2. Noob Advice: read guides when your trying out new heroes. Practice in bots, and dont stick to one hero, play them all. And stick in there, your first 10 games will suck. Purge has some great guides that you really should watch before you even step into your first game. And also play with friends, otherwise you might have to put up with peruvians who keep screaming noob in chat when you make one mistake. People who have to rage at everything (thats why theres reports), and russians who will play uber aggresive all the time, which to be fair on there part works half of the time. Welcome to dota 2.

Late Last March, I was naive enough to dip a toe in its beguiling waters and today, 450 hours of gameplay later, I return as a semi-functional human to regale you with tales from its realm. Dota 2 is unlike any other game Ive ever played, both in its nature and history. It started off as a StarCraft mod popular enough to be ported to Warcraft 3, which then exploded into a kaleidoscope of player-made variants and eventually coalesced again into a single entity titled Defense of the Ancients Allstars. There is no single author of Dota, though all the anonymous contributors whove made it what it is have come from the community that first started playing the mods. As such, Dota is the very definition of grassroots game development. The idea of a game made by the people for the people, as a certain American president might put it, fills me with a particularly warm and fuzzy sensation. Of course, I knew none of this when I first picked up Dota. A friend recommended it because its free and Im cheap. I understood that the game had a team-based format where killing the other guys was a good thing, like with first-person shooters, but your character also leveled up through the course of a match, as in role-playing games. That seemed like a recipe for unbalanced gameplay, but as it turns out, its precisely Dotas balance that makes it so unbelievably addictive. You start off as a member of a ragtag group of five heroes intent on destroying the enemys base, which is embodied by the titular Ancient structure. Through a series of skirmishes against the other team, their defensive towers, and waves of autonomous creeps, you gain experience and gold, the latter of which can be spent on items that make you stronger, swifter, and deadlier. The more you kill, the more you make, the more you buy, the more you kill. Rinse, repeat, and make sure to say \"gg\" at the end. LEARNING A LANGUAGE MIGHT BE QUICKER THAN MASTERING THE FULL BREADTH OF DOTA Excuse me if Im making this sound simple, because it really isnt. Dota 2 has a roster of over 100 heroes to choose from, and the combinations of items they can obtain is an order of magnitude greater still. Each hero has four or more unique abilities, and to have any hope of defeating a skilled opponent, you have to know what those are, what items he or she is carrying, and how they affect your chances of survival. Ignoring all of that nuance, I jumped straight into the game with the Juggernaut and was promptly beaten into a pulp of samurai sushi. A dozen humbling  whoopings later, I was online and reading the Dota Fire hero guides. DOTA 2 CHOICES The key reassurance I can offer is that all of these intricacies are, in fact, worth learning. As daunting as Dotas complexity may be, without it the game just wouldnt be as rewarding. My way of rising to the high bar of basic skill required was to pick the last enemy hero to destroy me. Thus I went from playing Juggernaut to Bounty Hunter to Bloodseeker to Ursa to Spirit Breaker. Each time I was sure I had the \"right\" hero, a better player would come along, expose my weaknesses, and teach me something new. Im the worst loser I know and yet I played Dota 2 for nearly 100 hours before I could get my winning percentage above 50. Maybe if I could actually see that I was being dominated by 14-year-old kids listening to Darudes Sandstorm on repeat, I might have felt sufficiently embarrassed to retreat in shame. I stuck through it, though, because, in the immortal words of Agent Smith, \"as a species, human beings define their reality through suffering and misery,\" and Dota delivers both with just enough victory to keep me titillated. And once I had a couple of hundred hours of experience under my belt, I too started passing on the sacred knowledge of Dota through the time-honored tradition of owning noobs. IM THE WORST LOSER I KNOW AND IM ADDICTED TO A GAME THAT KEEPS KICKING MY  This is not a game for the impatient. Success in Dota 2 requires the strategic forethought of chess, the unselfish teamwork of basketball, and the steely nerves of poker. None of those skills are acquired with ease and theres no magic number of matches or hours played to achieve Dota competence. Its a lot like learning a language: I never felt discrete upgrades in my knowledge and skill, but eventually I got to the point where I could tell you every typo in the games hero descriptions and every corner of its single asymmetric map. Just know that the commitment required is on a whole different scale to other games. You could complete the epic Mass Effect trilogy (plus all of its expansion packs) in less time than it takes the average Dota player to familiarize himself with everything from Abbadons Aphotic Shield to Zeuss Lightning Bolt. But thats really the point. Mastering this game in 50 hours wouldnt feel anywhere near as satisfying as taking a good 500.", "num_reviews": 0, "num_screenshots": 0}

Instead of being sarcastic and writing a funny review that jabs at russians, I'm going to tell you how Dota 2 really is at it's core. In a nutshell Dota 2 is a great game, but a terrible experience at the same time. You want to keep going back to it, but you also hate to go back. Why? One word: community. Dota 2's community is for the most part rude and hateful (and undeniably filled with russians who refuse to speak any other language than that of their own), sapping the joy out of this otherwise polished and addicting MOBA. It's unfriendly to beginners and the basic mindset is to belittle anyone who makes a mistake. Make one wrong move and you are called a noob right away... at the best of times. Often it's much worse and I would prefer not to go into the details. Sometimes you get a crapstorm of hate and blame even if you haven't actually done anything wrong. Occasionally though you come across friendly players, and when that happens, the game is a pure joy to play. However, since the game is 5v5, coming across four nice players at the same time (if you're solo queueing) is a rarity. Why then have I played the game for over 2000 hours? The sensation of winning. Your determination to keep playing, despite of the discouraging community, is fueled by the fantastic sensation of winning. That sweet moment when you see the enemy Ancient blow up and look back on the match, remembering all the plays and teamwork that lead you to victory is ever so gratifying. But even a victory can come with a grain of salt. Many times you have rude teammates that rage in the chat even when your team is winning. There is a mute option, but that doesn't stop the bad manners that extend outside the chat. People can intentionally feed the enemy team, ignore their own team, teamkill with some abilities and just generally be a bad player. It's really frustrating and the worst part is it happens all the time. Going ranked doesn't really solve the problem either, at least not completely. Ranked matchmaking is a more serious type of mode in Dota 2 that ranks you based on how well you do and finds opponents of equal skill. It feels much more professional and \"tryhardish\". Although you meet nice players more often, nothing stops the rude players from jumping over the fence and playing ranked aswell. Having played some matches in ranked, I can say the mode isn't \"hate free\". I had some of the worst matches in regards to teammates in that mode. Another problem with ranked is that, like I said, it's more \"tryhard\". Many just want to play the game casually and not have to worry about ranks and such. But don't get me wrong, Dota 2 is a great game in itself. The core mechanics are spot on and gameplay flows well. No technical issues to speak of (not counting the occasional missing texture bug or so, of which I have had none myself). Graphics are great and have a very subtle water painting type feel to them. All the various spells and abilites look great. The game is very deep and complex with tons of items, skill and item builds and strategies to learn. It can be a bit terrifying to beginners, but once you get the hang of things it's engaging. All the playable heroes are well balanced (although there is always some debate on a couple specific heroes being \"OP\") and free to play from the start. That's another thing the game does right. All the heroes are free and playable from the start, unlike Dota 2's undeniably very successful competitor, League of Legends. Dota 2's microtransactions focus on purely cosmetic stuff, which means there are zero \"pay to win\" elements in the game. It really falls unto you to decide whether if you want to suffer the rude community for the sake of playing this great game. To put it roughly in perspective, it's like playing Skyrim, but having someone stand next to you the whole time yelling at you for every mistake you make, calling you a \"fooping idiot\" every time you miss an arrow or fail a quest objective. Failed to kill Alduin? \"Uninstall Skyrim, noob.\" Don't know how to make dragonbone armor? \"Learn to play, tard.\" It's like that. Having played the game as long as I have, I would say that you are better off not playing Dota 2. The game is fun when you're winning (because people tend to rage less when your team is doing fine)... which is 50% of the time. Sometimes not even when you're winning. It isn't the losses that make the game unpleasant, it's the unfriendly people. If you're one of those people who can just calmly ignore everything rude being said at you, you have a better chance of not finding Dota 2 so terrible. But realistically, why should you even have to? Videogames are supposed to be a form of entertainment and when you can't have fun half of the time, the game isn't worth it. People will tell you that Dota 2 is great, but that greatness comes with a price. Do take in notice that this is all coming from a solo player point of view. This review is meant mainly to those who are likely to play the game alone most of the time and want to know what it's really like, not just the great things. If you have four friends who you can play with on a regular basis, then you're golden. The game is at it's best when you play with friends and don't have to worry about getting \"a stick in the mud\" player on your team. Great game with a bad community.", "num_reviews": 16, "num_screenshots": 36}

The game works like this ,that there are two teams, first team is called \"Radiant\" , second team is called \"Dire\" and each team will have a base, that base is called \"Ancient\" , then to win this game you have to destroy there base. So basically the first one to destroy the enemy's ancient wins, but before that you must go through the enemy's towers, there's three tower on each lane, so you can't destroy their ancient if you don't destroy the three towers and you cant advance to the second tower or third tower, you must destroy the first, second and third then finally their ancient. Last thing is , each team will have five players so you and your teammate must cooperate if not you guys will lose instantly the game, then each player will have a to pick a their role. There are 10 roles. After you guys pick a roles. There will be three lanes there's \"Mid\" , \"Top\" , and \"Bottom\" . So it can be like this 1 in the mid, 2 at the top and 2 at the bottom. 10 Roles Carry - will bring victory if he levels up faster and makes gold faster. Support - will provide wards and courier, also will upgrade the courier. Lane Support - useful even without farm and can go to other lanes to help others Initiator - will start the teamfight. Jungle - can get gold in the jungle so the other teammate can solo top/bottom. Pusher - can push faster through first, second and third tower. Escape - can bait the enemy or bring the enemy to your trap. Disabler - will stun the enemy or cancel the enemy's spell cast. Durable - will tank(shield) the teamfight so he's teammates wont die fast. Nuker - will bring massive damage too the enemy. This the common role in game, if you have this team you have 50/50 chance of winning Player 1 Carry this role will kill all the enemys and finish the game Player 2 Support this role will help the carry to farm because the other team will try to kill your carry Player 3 Durable this role will help in the teamfight, he will take all the damage of the enemy so the carry will live Player 4 Initiator this role will start the teamfight so you guys will have an advantage of the enemy Player 5 Disabler this role will stun the enemy so the enemy can't cast spell or attack I hope you like it and I really recommend this game, so good luck and had fun :) Pls like my review Originally posted by author : Steven Baes A.K.A.

We had a down time during Christmas time... and lately it seems that the player(s) were more frustating than before (closed beta, invite-only period). Also the leavers and the disconnected players are more rampant now. Which make this game more and more unenjoyable now. Noob-calling, negative not-team-players and the blame games involved, yes those kind that you have to expect when playing with total strangers. You'll be wasting 30-45 or even 60+ minutes of your life, thanks to them, losing easily. So this time around, you have to prepare yourself mentally to face those kinds. :D Good thing is that they have implemented the local lobby feature, so that you can actually play locally within your LAN. Should be a very good game worthy of having a LAN party again. I like the balance changes they put into the game, the item changes and things that make the early games more \"fun\", but... I'm putting this as a \"No\" for those who play only with a friend or two. You better play this with a full five-person-team to fully enjoy this game and the time not wasted. Or perhaps due to its current state, players similar to me might not have the reason(s) on how to fully enjoy this game.

As a true christian, I was raised to to believe the true saviour, gaben.

So, like any other true christian would I decided to play and not stray away from the reightous path, but when I loaded up the game the loading screens were riddled with satanic images and meanings. I was outraged by this atrocity more than when my son told me he had \"sinned\" by doing some dispicable acts. As Matthew McConau said in chapter 16:9, \"Thou hou slay thou demonic presence shou nourish in the heighest points of heaven\". So, after I got away from them satanic signs I started to become somewhat suspicious of this game. I pressed play and began to sweat as the jesus juices excreted from my body. I crossed my heart and prayed to God to forgive me for this act of satanism and waited for the match to started. Upon the game starting I was stunned by the amount of pagon rituals and signs that were in the game. I closed my eyes and picked a random hero only to discover something truly horrifying. My beer had run out. My bacon stained, sweat soaked vest had ripped. The russians were here, they were everywhere. My ears started to bleed as the russian flame began. I tried to continue on the righteous path but sin was inevitable. I pressed enter, I started to flame back, my fingers were numb. And then I realised, I had sinned.

Their dreams of conquest I'll destroy.\" Of Warcrafts Custom Maps, one stood a little taller than the rest: Defense of the Ancients. Here the heroes of Azeroth, freed from the tedious management of cities and armies, could fight as they were meant to: with weapons and experience, teamwork and tactics, all unadulterated by some abstract general and convoluted mission. A vast pool of heroes, pulled into one map, normalized and equalized through patches, armed with improved weaponry, combined to cement a gameplay experience that appealed to our encyclopedic minds, our fantastical tendencies, and our social impulse. Here was an unthinkable union of knowledge, skill, mythology, role playing, individuality, and balance. Here DotA matured to perfection. But this perfection was uneven. The brilliance lay there, but burdened by the crust and grime of history. The games greatest hero, Ice Frog, was a player who saw in DotA a wondrous achievement and vowed not to let that masterpiece deteriorate and die. Seeing the game as a growing process, owned by a community, ever meant to experiment and improve, Ice Frogs leadership kept DotA alive. Suffocated by a dated engine and forgotten game, he and his team worked with the legion of adoring fans to nourish what could be saved, and eradicate what could not. But even tenacity has limits, and in order for DOTA to break free it needed a new body; a new platform in which to siege the world. Here, as ever, an angel swooped from above. It was Valve, and they released the building pressure of DOTA into the atmosphere of mainstream gaming; steam that would finally power the community it deserved. The rest is history. Adopting the FTP model, utilizing the source engine and steam community, DotA has its outlet: DOTA 2. Players marvel at the games sheer number of balanced heroes, how it feels difficult yet strangely compelling, sophisticated in its strategy but gleeful in its murder, at times silly but still dark, oppressive but always promising emancipation if you practice hard and reflect often, so reliant on your allies, often complete strangers, that autonomous action can never rival teamwork. Like members of a symphony, clashing with your enemies in near perfect tug-and-war, entailing chess-like prediction and FPS-like twitching, your team fights together, wins together, and dies together. Never before except in professional sports has your weakest link dragged you down or raised you up. But drag you down they do. Even in the most porcelain masks do we see blemishes, and DOTA 2 has its fair share. Teams can and do exploit the weakest member of the opposite team, bullying with a savagery only seen in competitive gaming. Because of this exploitation, and the difficult nature of the game as a whole, frustration often runs high in the experience. Losses feel more painful than wins feel enjoyable, and the hope for those rare games in which perfect harmony among both teams leads to razor-sharp tactics and thrilling plays can be ruined by the cruel hand of fate, where a single hero out of position or a single RNG move can turn the tide of battle. DOTA 2 is, paradoxically, rarely satisfying, but when it is players never forget that feeling of triumph. Video Games, more than any other art, rely on us to deliver an experience. Whether they tell a story or present puzzles to solve, games need us to be competent and attentive. DOTA 2 takes this to new heights, and presents us with an outlet where the more we pour into it, the more it gives back. Eventually our exhaustion clouds the luster somewhat, but we shouldnt judge the game by our own limitations. Feral, profound, and terrifically challenging, DOTA 2 is competitive team-based gaming in its prime.", "num_reviews": 5, "num_screenshots": 2}

Also you must be smart and strong to survive people harassment. Definitely harder than League of Legends, World of Warcraft and many others games. Game play improved by many years of development and will be improved until Dota exist.

Then our world was sh*t upon by the powers that be; Gaben and Icefraud, both nigh on untouchable behind their shroud of lies and broken promises. We queued, ready for the action, the thrill, the skill, to survive and thrive in a high skilled scenario we'd spent over a thousand hours training for. This, this was our moment. We chose our heroes, heroes we have always enjoyed playing, heroes that happen to be OP this patch. Our spirits were higher than Snoop Dogg in a forest fire. We hit 'Play'. I entered the game... Josh did not. My brother-in-arms had fallen, nay, been tripped at the first hurdle! Gaben would simply not allow him access. His dota would restart and he'd spam the play button again and again but to no avail. This sordid process went on for 5 minutes. 5 minutes I will never forget. The worst 5 minutes of my life. Eventually Josh gave up, uninstalled and played Poker Night. And in that moment I remembered the hundreds of pounds I have poured into Valve. The armory of virtual hats I have treasured and loathed in the pursuit of cosmetic gratification. And a great rage swelled within me. A rage that threatened to burst upon volvo customer support in a dire tide of expletives and jokes about HL3. But I contained this anger, because I still had a game to win in honour of my betrayed comrade. I will not forget the injustices I have seen this day, and the hats might find themselves getting rather short of company in the months to come... #justice4josh #pray4josh #Ti4godssake #gameisbroken #biginternetwords #watchyourselves #Kappa", "num_reviews": 5, "num_screenshots": 49}

Game looks good at first, but at the end of the day, its just a horrible online experience. If you have a 5 man stack, with good game knowledge, good coordination, yeah matches can be decent (but i recommend setting up \"inhouse matches\" with another 5 man stack!!). If you dont have a 5 man stack, its a pub train all day (or just plain bad/noobish). You win 50-5, then you lose 45-7, then you win 41-17, then you lose 60-28 and so on. Its all about the \"lucky roll of the dice\" named matchmaking. Most players that play this game have lvl 0-1 accounts, with only dota or other free to play games. So dont think if you report them, they care. They just make another account to troll, feed or w/e. Also, alot of people play this game drunk, stoned, or just very tired. That can be ok i guess in a 1v1 game, or a 2v2 with one of their buddies. But in a 5v5 team game, its not nice. They just ruin the experience for alot of other people. Most people use their own language. Chatting or writing. Teamspeak or just skype is not on their menu. So most russians will speak russian, most turks will speak turkish and so on. There is no region lock. Again, for a 1v1 game, maybe that could work. But for a game like dota, having a player from Australia or Peru joining the Euro server with 300-400 ping is not cool. And alot of people just check more servers for faster queue times and also check more languages. So if you check EU West or US East, and expect all people to have good pings and speak english, think again :)). At least some of the dota 2 players, played wc3 or dota 1, dont even get me started with the other mobas... Its the only genre that makes me feel ive wasted my time in most cases when i play the game. Bonus: People either flame/curse etc, or just dont know what the hell they are doing. In most cases both ^_^ So, i recommend using your free time / gaming time, playing other games. And stay away from all free to play team games / MMO's. They are a magnet for trolls, kids or just noobs that dont care. And you know why? Bcuz they can make 1000 accounts... So if they get banned or their ranking has gone down, its no problem, new acc on the way. Its kinda sad, game could have been fun. But its not. And thigs will never change bcuz of all the reasons ive stated above. The game at its core is good, but the overall online experience is bad. Cant recommend this for a new player, a true newbie. Cant recommend this either for an old skool RTS player. These guys online dont even look at the minimap!! So most of the time the games/matches wont be good and fun. Even most of the wins are fun just bcuz you had fun / a good talk or w/e, with a real life friend that you had on skype, or a gaming friend that you laned with, not bcuz of the dota match tbh. So just go and drink beer with that mate, or just play other games with him/them. With this concept of f2p and team gameplay, i cant see valve fixing this, so i cant see a reason to recommend this. Sure you can get random good matches, but after all my experience playing this, i think you are better off without this game / genre completely. Peace!", "num_reviews": 2, "num_screenshots": 1}

Youll learn to hate your friends and love random strangers during the forty five minutes an average match takes. In that short amount of time, grudges will be born, heroes will rise and poor plays will be vilified like a G R R Martin epic. And yet for all its emotional drama, both the highs and the lows, youll still yearn for more. Just learning to play is an adventure into masochism. Everyone begins as a dreaded n00b, unable to contribute anything but gold and XP to the opposing team. A few weeks later, and theyll have learned a few tricks: where to place wards, how to turn off auto attack in the options and crucially, the ability to take abuse on the chin without rage quitting. Give it a few months and theyll be rolling with the regulars. Double stacking, recrowing and GGWP will become part of their vernacular. Immunity to the insults will be delivered to them upon chins which have since grown thick with stubble and caloused skin. They'll have succesfully joined an inclusive club whose members include the heroes of the world's burgeoning e-sports scene. Consider the football metaphor, pub matches are like a kick about down the local park using the same boots, strips and footballs Rooney, Messi and Neymar use in packed stadiums full of shouting people. If all of the above sounds a bit much, ask yourself, whats the point of playing if you dont feel something in the end? Dota 2 delivers passion and fury in spades, and like all great games, its hidden depths forever tease like sirens upon the rocks, always ready to punish an overblown sense of ego. Just dont look at the item store; your partner/parents/common sense will never understand why you spent $35 on some virtual eye candy for your favourite hero", "num_reviews": 2, "num_screenshots": 0}

Oh, about the game... revamped the classical moba from warcraft 3. Same gameplay minus bugs because of the engine, voice acting, particles all around, cosmetic items so you can be fancy as , acid community but some fun can be achieved though. This game is HARD, in this game, there must be a victor and there must be a loser. In today's America WORLD, no child ever loses. There are no losers anymore. Everyone's a winner. No matter what the game or sport or competition, everybody wins. Everybody wins, everybody gets a trophy, no one is a loser. No child these days ever gets to hear those all-important, character building words: \"You lost, Bobby!\" \"You lost, you're a loser, Bobby!\" They miss out on that. You know what they tell a kid who lost these days? \"You were the last winner.\" A lot of these kids never get to hear the truth about themselves until they're in their twenties. When their boss calls them in and says \"Bobby, clean the  out of your desk and get the  out of here, you're a loser.\" Of course Bobby's parents can't understand why he can't hold a job, in school he was always on the honor roll. Well what they don't understand of course is that in today' schools everyone is on the honor roll, everyone is on the honor roll because in order to be on the honor roll all you really need to do is to maintain a body temperature roughly in the 90F (32C) So be ready to face some insults, hateful gamers with absolutely no empaty for your learning cause. You will begin to draw pleasure as you learn the game and all your team relies on you to win the game, those are the moments where skill and happiness are at your side, while agony and pain are in the other side.", "num_reviews": 20, "num_screenshots": 166}

The main protagonist is you, Jakob. You are a lone survivor and every other player in the entire damn universe is an enemy. Jakob's model really matches his personality. A hipster, emo, gothic sex-driven male paired with the voice acting of Morgan Freeman really make this character pop out and helps make him really relatable. The storyline is great. I love how the developers have a completely separate \"prologue\" chapter for the story, explaining how such an apocalypse could have ever risen from the deep depths of hell (that's not a spoiler as you see that in the first 15 minutes of the game). You start out in the middle of ... er, Russia, spending time with your beloved family, and find out you are really, REALLY attracted to your cousin. You take her out to \"show her the world\" when suddenly a crack opens from the ground beneath you. Your cousin falls into the crevice. You are devastated. You try to rush home, but then all of a sudden, you hear a big ... er, plop. You look behind you, and there are robot zombies, all drinking vodka. You then turn all around and find yourself surrounded. And I'll stop there, otherwise I may end up spoiling the prologue! The PvP in this game is SPOT ON. It's like the developers KNOW that you're the main character and give you the most overpowered arsenal right from the get-go! It's brilliant, need I say more? Fine, I shall! Just like the amazingness that was Dungeon Keeper Mobile, you too can attain the most powerful arsenal by slamming your wallet into EA's pockets! It's fantastic! The best part too? It's --free.     ,    ,   . Um, what I meant to say was \"It doesn't even cost a dime!\" Overall I would say this game is a 10/10, a must-have game. EA has really shown how to create such a game.

Current main issues: Pros: - A friendly and positive community - Possibility to make friends and discuss delicate topics with new people from various ethnic backgrounds, chat comes with emoticons and other essential stuff - Strong focus for learning new languages - Full of fun mini-games if the main game is not compelling, like the Shopkeeper's quiz, buying stuff from the Valve shop, in-game advertisement clicking, guess-games for DOTA 2 network offline times etc Cons: - I picked the Sniper class but had trouble aiming in the first person mode, needs to be fixed asap - Playing the game with Oculus Rift resulted in nausea - Low replayability, after their first game everone I know has practically reached their skill cap - Basic things like in-game quicksave and quickload functionality is missing - Raid bosses like Roshan and Troll Warlord are hard to understand and severely imbalanced - Steam achievements were teased but are still not working, I already ate my 500th tree but didn't get the achievement - The crafting system is confusing and unintuitive - Want to create a drum? Well, you need a robe and a bracer, of course! Want to create a buckler? Yep, you guessed it, you need a chainmail shirt armor and a branch! - Hitboxes are off and often clipping; for example, I bought a bigger sword for the Sven class, but game doesn't register hits that clearly happen against smaller models like the Phantom Assassin - NPCs like the mud golem and the shopkeeper only have few lazy dialogue lines, I was more interested in hearing their immersive part of the story while constructing a hut in a nearby forest out of treebranches - RTS system for building or repairing base components are limited to only a few heroes and could use a revamp - Character wipes happen a bit too often in the servers I've been at Without going into too many spoilers, finishing the campaign left me with more questions than satisfying answers. For example, why was the evil Dragon Knight so eager to hurt the seemingly innocent creeps for monetary gain? Why did the mysterious Drow Ranger attack our valiant hero? Why does Axe look like a tomato? So many questions, yet so few answers. Overall, the game is OK for an early access FPS-RPG hybrid but doesn't entertain the more hardcore gamers for very long. For a small-time indie developer team I guess it's acceptable, but I'd wait for more available DLC expansions before paying anything for the main game.", "num_reviews": 0, "num_screenshots": 0}

At that moment I didn't want to but for the sake of friendship, I decided to give it a shot. At first, the game seemed hella confusing. The only thing I liked back then was the Main Menu music and how ironic the menu and heroes looked :P We played it through and through and ultimately there came a time when the confusion came to an end and that's when the addiction started. As of the game, it's a Strategy based MOBA game. Difficult to understand all at once but easy when broken into segments. You have to choose a hero from a pool of 100+ heroes. Each and every Hero is Unique in their own way, having different abilities/powers etc. Your main goal is to destroy the Opposition's Home Base Building \"Ancient\" in order to secure win. It sounds easy but  always hits the fan xD. You are given a shop, from where you can purchase items to upgrade your hero's abilities and attributes. My experience with this game sucked at the start, but turned opposite as of now. The Competetion is real hard. There's also a Leveling system for the Casual record along with a ranking system for competetive mode(Ranked Match) called \"MMR\" or Match Making Rating. Just like Counter Strike Global Offensive, there's a match making system, which helps each and every player of similar skillz to compete with each other. So, I'd say to download this game asap because I already regret for not playing it from the start :P Remember, I was one of those who said \"Dota sucks\" and now it's an integral part of my life. Above all, there's something calm about this game unlike CSGO xD It's always fun to play. Few kids.", "num_reviews": 0, "num_screenshots": 0}

Gameplay may seem a Bit hard for the First time, but after you Play Tutorial + Some Matches, you'll get familiar with it. It's quite fun and Teamwork-ish, nothing here is Possible without Teamwork ( and Creeps ). Plus, it's this kind of a Games, where you have to be Sliced in a Half, and Complete some Objectives while Farming for Some EXP and Gold. The Match is getting REAL somewhere around 17 Minute of a game, Both teams got Heroes with Special Attacks, new Items, more Creeps. That;s where it starts. When you Bash through a Horde of Creeps and Kill a Sniper who was About to use a Shrapnel, then attack Creeps from Behind and you Push through Towers and even More Creeps with your Teammates.

How annoying ! This is a Tower Defense game . there is an \"Ancient\" inside of each teams Base . The objective of the game is to kill the creeps , destroy the towers and work your way into the opposing teams base and destroy their \"Ancient\" . it is Very competitive and addicting . So give it a try it's something new and i'm sure you will find a [ Character/Hero ] that suits your playstyle", "num_reviews": 18, "num_screenshots": 2335}

So this makes leveling up your dota profile a bit of useless to me. Leveling up a profile knowing that there is no use or benefit can be disappointing at some point. And hopefully soon there will be an AUTOBAN for rude players in-game. Some sort of a \"PROFANE\" word detection thru out any language. There are a lot of rude and tactless players out there that can most of the time disappoint newbies from playing the game. Not everyone though.

I've been into games and I have over 800 hours plus and still being called an noob and everything and blames me. there is some situations that I couldn't do anything and my friend keeps trying to help, and no one else trys to come to the lane. and i'm the one getting blamed. also, the game seriously need either: more servers, or region locks. because I am sick and tired of being matched with peruvians, portugese, russians, etc. and not to mention, if you're in a parties. more chances you're gonna find some stupid clan team that does nothing but just does stun stacks while we just wanna have fun. the worse of all, is the people who always spam \"UMADBRO?\" and take insults from . but seriously, it's impossible to not be frustrated in a video game, espacilly dota... seriously. it's just sad that these kind of communities just ruin a game, and I can no longer have fun.

When I started I did not have any experience and much expectation of the game, due to the genre - it was all new to me, however before trying out the game it took my friends awhile to get into the game because I did not like the fact the game was still at Beta and at that time I was detesting its predecessor DotA due to the fact the gameplay was confusing which it turned me off and also the graphics was years outdated without even trying the game out. I was able to give its successor a chance when a friend of mine introduced the ESports scene within the game community of the genre. I was hooked due to I never have expected that a type of sport has been running for almost a decade which it has been under my radar. I personally was not a fan for Sports in general although after hearing about ESports is completely change my perspective on both of the game and sports. ESports is a term for organized video game competitions, especially between professional. It is known as competitive gaming, professional gaming and cyber sport. The most common video game genres associated with electronic sports are real-time strategy, fighting, first-person shooter, and multiplayer online battle arena. Generally Dota 2 would fall under the MOBA genre due to it consists of session-based online multiplayer matches, in which two teams of five players attempt to destroy their opponents' fortified strongholds known as Ancients. Each player controls a \"Hero\" character and, over the course of an individual game, focuses on improving their Hero's abilities, acquiring items, and fighting against the other team. Welcome to Dota, You Suck, is a well-known proverb within the DotA Community, which is aimed at new player. In fact is the truth, especially for new to the genre, for the first dozen hours or so, you will be showered with too much information and an often unforgiving community of extremely competitive players. On the other hand if you persevere, Dota 2 becomes one of the most rewarding and tense team-based multiplayer experiences anywhere in gaming. It's an achievement owed to uncompromising depth and complex gameplay, being a free-to-play, and the great features developer Valve has built up around it. That said, you should not expect to have fun on your first day playing... or even your first week. It is due to the unforgiving players within your team which expects you to do your job flawlessly although it is impossible even pro players can make a mistake, however theres a method of this insanity. In order survive in Dota 2 you need to understand every single hero and mechanics and how they interact with one another. Everything from learning to work as a member of a coordinated team to the counter-intuitive practice of killing your own AI units to deny the enemy experience points and gold theyd get from doing it themselves, and understanding the effects of hundreds of complex abilities. There are 102 Dota 2 heroes (and counting) each consist of different abilities and mechanics and serves different roles from each other. For example Riki, is an melee Agility hero in which when he acquire his ultimate at level 6 he becomes permanent invisible, which is an obvious choice for most of new player. However there are various ways to counter an invisble heroes, this can be done by purchasing either a Dust of Apperance, Sentry Wards or Gem of true sight, anyone can purschase these item during a game, making the game more balanced. In addition some heroes has an ability to track an invis heroes for a short period of time. In conclusion, DOTA 2 is fun and challenging and deeply rewarding unlike other games, and despite its vast popularity it still feels like a secret waiting to be discovered. It has clear visuals and more balance gameplay unlike League of Legends and has an incredible longevity", "num_reviews": 2, "num_screenshots": 469}

I switched to DotA 2 a couple months ago from all my friends shifting over. Here is a short list of pros and cons that I have seen in DotA 2 as opposed to DotA 1. Pros: * Better mechanics, many heros function differently in DotA 1 due to the restrictions of the Warcraft 3 World Editor. * Visually stimulating, DotA 2 has many ways to customize heros, couriers, wards, animations, and more. * Item drops, as opposed to DotA 1, even casual players can end up making some money just by playing. * Spectating * Much easier for new players to learn due to the new system to help starting players. * Builds display on the item panel * Has many events in which additional items can be earned * Has an in game mic system as well as quick toggle phrases. Cons: * Currently doesnt have all the heros or neutral camps that DotA 1 has. * Lacks some of the game modes of DotA 1. * Surprisingly, lacks some of the important mechanics of DotA 1. The most notable one that I can pull off the top of my head is Batriders napalm does not trigger any damage bonus on radiance + veil even when the threshold for doing so is met. * Servers tend to be down for a brief period of time after nearly every update. * Doesnt have as well of a language division as DotA 1. I que US east and west with the language of English in DotA 2; yet 1:3 games, if not more, will have another language. I wouldnt even mind if it was something like Spanish or French, but I am getting everything from Russian, Chinese, Portuguese, Ukraine, Korean, Japanese, and many more that I cant even identify. * Double courier is a lot harder to use in DotA 2, even with hotkeys and grouping. I find this to take away from bottle crowing as well as make it harder for 2 farmers to get their items quickly for they will likely be on the opposite sides of the map. Even if they arent, the offlane will still likely need it to get items to survive. Every game will only have 1 courier unless someone accidentally buys another. Neutral: * DotA 2 has much better pathing and makes it harder to get stuck on unpathable areas. This makes sure you will never stupidly get stuck somewhere, but also takes away from some hero abilities that do move other heroes or yourself. * There is currently no public lobby system. There is everything from private, fiends, guild, etc., but there is no way to host them publicly for anyone to join. * Your computer needs to be decent to run DotA 2. At least 4 GB of ram and a decent graphics card is highly advised. In conclusion, DotA 2 is definitely a f2p game that you should look into. If you have yet to play any MOBA it may seem a bit difficult at first, but it will grow on you. To avoid the initial hate you may come across, I advise having someone assist you with learning the basics or look up some tutorials online.

DOTA has its roots as a Warcraft 3 modification. Warcraft 3 introduced a unique mechanic in its campaign and multiplayer modes of \"hero\" units - units that actually gained experience points, abilities, and items as the game progresses. This really made it feel like you had an investment in these units, and you grew attached to them. To a degree these hero units, effectively commanders of your army of relatively disposable units, became your avatar in-game. It was a brilliant concept, and DOTA took it a step further. DOTA created a multiplayer mode that focused *exclusively* on playing these hero units - it removed the base building and unit management seen in the standard RTS format. It's one of the best examples of \"less is more\" than I've ever seen, and that description hardly does it justice. Managing your individual hero and your income, position on the map, constant decision making, and being able to size yourself up versus your enemy brings more depth than any other game I've ever played. I've yet to play any other multiplayer game where *every* member of your 5-man team is crucial to your victory. Everyone must do their part, and do it better than the other 5-man team. There are very few cases of where a game can be winnable 4v5, and teamwork becomes a huge factor. In the most intense and close games, the level of immersion really can't be matched. It's hard to think of another game that draws you in more than DOTA, especially when other people are counting on you to do well! It's a hectic, stressful, enormously complex and in-depth experience - not to mention absurdly fun. This is what keeps me coming back, and I'd recommend it to anyone looking to really experience what multiplayer gaming can truly offer. If you're new to the game and want some background on specific heroes and strategies, or just want to watch some gameplay, be sure to check out my YouTube channel.

There are so many aspects of the game to learn. But even at the begining it is insainly fun, and as you develop your skill the game becomes more and more enjoyable.

This can be fun and challenging. -> It's very fun when you play pub games with your friends and WIN the game.

(more than 100 heroes). -> If you like MOBA/RTS game, when you spend a lot of time in DotA 2 and learn advanced plays you'll not stop playing. Well, I do not know if it's a good or bad quality.. Cons: -> DotA 2 is a RTS (Real Time Strategy) 5x5 game, so it's very frustating when you play with people you do not like. -> It does not have a good tutorial explaining all the advanced plays.. you'll have to learn by yourself or by a friend.

And remember, it is never, ever your own fault. This is also a great game if you're looking for nicknames. From your first day you'll already get some cool nicknames like '', 'noob', and so on. This game also let's you learn russian very easily, all you have to do is click 'Find Match' and it's for free ! But remember, you don't have to speak english in here if that's not your main language, just speak your own, i'm sure it'll be nice for your team. A tip for when you play a hero with a big ultimate such as Enigma, Magnus and all of those. Buy a blink and as soon as you see a good time to use it, use it, don't tell your team you're going to use your ultimate. Just do it and then blame your team afterwards for dying when they didn't go in with you. Also, make sure to bring lots of food when you play Dota 2, and share it with the enemy team. Feeders are greatly appreciated in this game. If you are a russian, or any person that doesn't want to speak english, be sure to visit the english servers, you'll make lots of friends for sure. When you play a game that's going back and forth and takes over 50 minutes, be sure to say 'EZ GAME GG NOOBS' if you win. If you end up losing, just open all chat and say your team sucks and threw the game, no matter what your own score is. If an enemy or a teammate tries something but fails to kill anyone, make sure to laugh in all chat and call them noobs. Then they'll say something like ' 1x1'. Be sure to accept, it's always fun to make nice friends when you're alone. A tip for laning: Always take mid, no matter which hero you are, mid is mostly a solo lane so nobody to steal your exp or last hits, never gank a side lane, if they're good they'll win the lane no matter which heroes they are up against. If they lose their lane, just call them noobs and say you can never gank because they're always dead. If you have 2 supports and 2 carries in your lane, the best option would be to put the 2 supports on the safelane and carries on the hardlane. If people go with you in a lane when you tell them not to, just call them cykas and take all their last hits. When playing a support hero, make sure to take all the last hits on your lane, a good support always takes last hits so he can buy support items early such as dagon or a maelstorm. Also make sure to tell your carries to buy the courier and wards, a support can't afford to waste money on things like that, he needs lots of farm. To kill a hero, just right click the enemy hero and let your carry do all the damage, then, when your carry dies and the enemy is low, you can safely use your skills now because you are sure to get the kill. 10/10 would recommend, never played a better game", "num_reviews": 15, "num_screenshots": 469}

I refused to play it. No one could convince me to go through the pain and suffering of repeatedly dying, being outplayed by everyone and the abuse that came with those performances. During The International 3, I decided to make an effort to watch the tournament and it completely blew me away. Orange tearing through the Losers Bracket, taking out DK and pushing towards the finals. The commentators were going wild, I had absolutely no idea what was actually going on but I knew it was epic. This brought me back to the game. We're now in the middle of The International 4 a n entire year later, I now have over 700 hours played and almost 450 games listed on my Dotabuff. Dota 2 is like an abusive relationship. It's a genuinely great game, competitive gaming at its near finest. When you do well you feel fantastic, you've earned it - you outplayed and outsmarted the opponents. You'll have games you won't forget about with big performances and dramatic team fights. But there are games that will haunt you due to ferocious emotional abuse from team mates. These games don't end quickly, you can be harassed for half an hour during a slow and painful loss. The community isn't as bad as other MOBAs, but it's very easy to blame other people. If you win, people will sing your praises through the game. If you lose, and if you're a support like myself - prepare yourself. I've played a fair amount of MOBAs, from League of Legends and HoN to the more abstract Awesomenauts and Smashmuck Champions. Dota 2 has to be rated as the best. It's tactically sound, it's gorgeous to look at, the 100+ heroes are all interesting and challenging and the team synergy is there to be picked up on. You can win games by choosing a more aggressive or pushing lineup. Go for team fight heroes and combine to wipe out the opponents or make space for certain heroes to keep the game going for as long as possible and win late into the game. Games can range from 10 minute stomps to 75+ epics. The game mechanics are for your team to gain gold and experience from killing creeps and opponents, but also to deny gold and experience by denying creeps and team mates - killing them so they can't get the kill. Everything is tactical, where you go in the map, at which times, controlling vision, acquiring runes or when to defend and when to push for towers or ancients. This is again, why the entry point into the game is so difficult. There is a very steep learning curve. You also have a shop menu to work out which items you should buy to help your heroes in different ways. You will learn this with experience. I have put this much time, effort and stupidity into this game and I still don't know a lot of things about the game. I still don't fully understand what heroes counter which, and I don't have full understanding of some abilities or item builds. It takes time and patience. Dota 2. It's a game I grew to really appreciate, but still a game that can ruin your day in one disastrous game. The competitive scene is great and fully supported by the game developers, it's constantly updated with community created cosmetics, mini events or new heroes. And the only time that in-game purchases are required is for specialist things like team pennants, tournament passes or cosmetics for your courier or hero unlike that of other MOBAs that require you to earn or purchase heroes to have the chance to broaden your playing experience.

This classic strategy game offers a substantial amount of playable heroes (each with their own unique and blatantly overpowered abilities to fit any playstyle), only one map and a metric buttload of entirely worthless cosmetic items. Being the best video game in existence comes at a price: Dota 2 has a very steep learning curve, requiring an estimated 14 years played before gaining a basic understanding of how the game works and another 30 years to get a very weak grasp of any one hero's hundreds of thousands of spells and abilities. On top of individual skill, this game heavily relies on teamwork, coordination and communication - this ensures that you will get buttraped the first 500 games you play. Also it's free.

It requires knowledge of many unique aspects and only after encountering every hero at least once, will you start to get comfortable. If you want to take Dota 2 seriously, or even casually, prepare to invest a lot of time. Guides can of course cut this time substantially. When you do learn to play, you will be rewarded with one of the biggest feelings of accomplishment of any game. You will feel like a god among men - but remember, most people feel this, and as such, the Dota community is one of arrogant and toxic tossers. There are nice players, but there are plenty of unpleasant ones. If you want to play Dota 2 properly, you need to play with friends - or just learn to mute people.

Finishes at 10pm he does. -Hate yourself because you didnt finish any work, talk to any non-Dota friends, and played 7+ hours of Dota. -Cry yourself to sleep and wake up in the morning to do it again. Dota has essentially ruined my life. I went onto the steam store to find a F2P game because I was always bored with hours of time. I played stuff like warface and what not and I kept seeing this. I had also heard about youtubers making jokes about the game so I figured why the heck not. Played the game ONCE. That's when the addiction started. Soon my hours of freetime reduced to minutes, seconds, sometimes I would stay up 3+ hours later just to play more matches. DONT EVEN THINK OF MAKING FRIENDS ON HERE, THEY ONLY ENCOURAGE YOU TO PLAY MORE. Dota has essentially taken my life away, and I must say im ing loving it. Dota is love Dota is life. Warning game causes following symptoms: -Racism towards Russians for reasons you don't even udnerstand, -Insomnia -Anxiety -High blood Pressure -Low blood Sugar -Malnutrition -EXTREME LEVELS OF STRESS -Hyperventalation -High amounts of giddyness and happyness -Extremem amounts of sadness -Rage And carpul tunnel.

After playing them all I believe that DOTA 2 is probably the best moba out there if you like strategy and a more grownup moba game. DOTA 2 does well with a focus on each hero being unique and each having their pros and cons to assist the team in their own special ways, so this means that each match will never be the same due to the choices of heroes and peoples playstyles. Its developers and lead designer Icefrog have a focus on balancing every hero on every major update and making sure that no hero is extremely overpowered. The game follows Valves concept of Free to Play games where the only thing up for purchase is cosmetics with nothing that will change or alter the gameplay, the game also has item drops at the end of the matches but at the time of this review the drop rates were changed and its current nigh impossible to even get a single item. The only issue I really see is the issue with some of the servers due to the outsourcing of servers to other companies and their locations. So Ill write down the list of servers that have issues that I know of: SEA (Location: Singapore) (E-Club) - Its a gamble, there is two servers and one is good and one is awful. Sometimes up, sometimes down. Good luck. Japan (Location: Tokyo) (NEXON) - It doesn't exist yet, they are holding it hostage for the past year. US Servers (Valve) - They are currently using Mail Pigeon for packets. (West - Seattle, East - Sterling) Russia (Stockholm) (?) - The server is perfectly fine, the only issue is the distance from Russia to Stockholm causes increase latency -------- Other than some of the server issues you can have loads of fun and you might even pick up the Russian, Spanish, Portuguese or Filipino languages. Dota is a quality gaming addiction and language learner. 10/10", "num_reviews": 7, "num_screenshots": 225}

Again and again on each Russian within my grasp, my grin was growing crooked. Now stretching across from cheek to cheek. I began to laugh and squeal with delight. At the power that was bestowed upon me. Imaging what i could do with this button, first i will report the Russians, THEN America, why stop there i might even attack China! I had reported every teamate but one. My friend. With a wry smile, and a cackle i whispered one utterance to my friend through a messenger pigeon called \"Skype\" With a click and a report i felt that my work here was done and the game had lost all enterainment value for the day.

One of the finest MOBA's to date. From a background of StarCraft, LoL and HoN - without playing the original DotA, my expectations for it were slim as I refused to see what valve, through DotA, could bring new to the genre. However what I see in DotA is a refined version of previous MOBAs' with new strategic and tactical decisions, rather than the spamming of all your skills hotkeys and your heroes auto attack, what DotA does is realise what items benefit you and your team as you try to destroy the enemy's ancient. Also including a concept of denying your own creeps, towers and items which adds a whole new dynamic to the game. However what DotA fails to achieve is consistency. Just like other MOBA's it updates and refreshes the game to keep players coming back, but when this update is applied the game breaks down instead of growing stronger. This includes' the shutdown of all servers for hours or days with the odd chance you get into a match but fail to have good game as your ping is at 1000ms. However, for a daily shutdown every couple of months is the price to pay for a great time which has recently became free to play. DotA's community is also the most rewarding with players being able to become pro and play their favourite game for money to benefit acclaim fame it also allows designers to create customisables for heroes that can get into the game if it is voted up by the community itself. However the community in-game can be irritating at first but you can make friends and have a laugh. In conclusion with its small problems', DotA is my preferred MOBA and I will continue to play it until the apocalypse. 9/10", "num_reviews": 1, "num_screenshots": 8}

You can also yell at your teammates for trying to 1v5 , or farming the jungle while your team dies! Communicating and working together is crucial in this game to get the high score for \"Longest time trying to carry your team\" You can choose from a wide selection of really well-made and balanced heroes like Huskar and Death Prophet. You fight the enemy heroes on \"Lanes\", pathways across the maps where your creeps spawn and try to attack the enemies on the other side of the river, people refer to these lanes as Top, Bot, and Mid or feed. You can also tell your teammates that the enemies on your lane are missing, warning them about a possible gank, but for some reason that function doesn't seem to work. Last - hitting creeps and enemy heroes grant you gold, but keep in mind that no one on your team besides you has the ability to do that . Getting kills or good items only help you defend against the enemies longer, since the result will ALWAYS be the same! DOTA 2 is also a very educational game, yes!

There are two teams of five players - the Radiant, and the Dire. Each player picks from a list of many characters, each with a different set of abilities. The two teams start on opposing sides of the map (there's only one map in the game). Each team has a base area, in which resides an \"Ancient\". From each base, creeps - these autonomous NPC creatures - spawn periodically in waves, and start a journey toward's the other teams base. Towers are scattered around the map that will automatically fire on any enemy unit. The goal for each team is to destroy the other team's Ancient, while defending their own. Hence: Defense of the Ancients. Sounds simple - but there's a lot more to it than this. Imagine the game starts and both teams just stay in their own base. Creeps from both teams will wander out from one base and head to the other, meeting somewhere in the middle of the map, where they will fight (again, they do this automatically without any player input). The creeps are evenly matched so typically they will both wipe each other out. The next wave of creeps will clean up anything left over - or they'll reach a tower, and get smashed by it - and the cycle will continue. Basically, nothing will happen - the game will not end, because the creeps can't get anywhere. Now imagine just one player from one of the teams goes out with his creeps. He can attack the enemy creeps, and support his own creeps as they make their way across the map, knocking down towers along the way. Eventually, he'll get to the enemy Ancient, and be able to destroy it. But if just one enemy player comes out to meet him, the teams will be more evenly matched - and it comes down to a player versus player (PvP) scenario. The PvP is, of course, the heart of the game. It is of a high level of complexity - the learning curve is quite steep, making it challenging for noobs, which is one of the reasons why the community was famed for being full of what I will euphemistically call \"short tempered people\". One player who doesn't know what he is doing can easily bring down the whole team. The complexity comes from two main parts - first, the sheer number of selectable characters in the game. At the time of writing, there are 102 characters - with more added periodically as the game is updated. Each character has four different abilities (sometimes more) that are active (requiring the user to press something to make them go) or passive (they just operate automatically). The abilities are character-specific, though there are common elements between them. Some of the abilities require chaining to use them effectively, and each ability is leveled individually as your character earns experience. After you've done the maths and figured out how many different abilities there are between all the characters - and thought about how long it would take to become familiar with even a small handful of them - consider that in addition to that, there are over 120 different items that you can equip your character with. Items can perform new actions or augment your existing ones (again, they are active or passive in nature). Oh yeah - each game takes a long time to finish - around 45 minutes is pretty common. You will never get away with saying \"I'll just have a quick game of Dota\" to your significant other - at least, not once they've put up with you playing it a few times. So - learning curve. Big one. Time investment (or sink, if you prefer). Big one. Especially when you're trying to play with other people and they're abusing you for not knowing what you're doing. But the real question is - is it worth it? I've clocked up almost 400 games (and there's still some characters I haven't played). I'm not turning pro any time soon, but have a reasonable handle on the fundamentals. My win rate is about 50%, which seems to be fairly normal. Losing is often traumatic, especially after you've lost a couple of long 45-60 minute games in a row, or you're saddled with random teammates in the matchmaking who are abusive idiots (or just bad). But the games that are good - they're really good. With so many combinations and different ways to exploit them, the level of satisfaction when you're playing with friends and manage to co-ordinate a five-person push on a tower, laying down that perfect combo that takes advantage of all your abilities, wiping out the other team.... well, that's what keeps me coming back for more. Not only that, but once you've invested a bunch of time and gotten over some initial learning humps, it's genuinely fun exploring the different characters and item combinations. There are always new builds to try and new items to buy. I've gone through several \"favourite characters\", depending on which new ones I've played recently and how well they worked out with my natural play style and with my teammates. Even after around 400 hours of gametime, I still have more to explore. I do, however, only really enjoy playing the game with my friends. I've tried a few games \"solo\", just picking up teammates using the matchmaking service, and I find this massively less fun. It's less engaging because I typically don't like to communicate with randoms via voice, and your chances of picking up toxic players are increased. I've had good games with randoms, but generally don't bother playing unless my mates are online. As with all reviews, this one attempts to help answer the question: \"should I buy this game?\". Well, good news - Dota 2 is free. It has just come out of a long invite-only beta period, so your actual financial investment in whether or not you should get into the game is zero. But there are two big questions you need to ask yourself: 1. Can I justify the amount of time I need to get decent at this game before I start enjoying it? Make no mistake, the learning process for this game is An Ordeal. If you're prepared to spend many hours reading guides and playing with bots until you can beat them on a reasonable difficulty - maybe 10 games? - then that's a good start. If you've got mates that are happy to babysit you then that's good - but note that most of them will not want to do this because it almost certainly means they'll be losing (a lot) while you're still struggling with the basics. The best way to approach it is to read some guides - I recommend Welcome to Dota, You Suck - and play with bots until you can beat them on Hard, reliably, with one character. Then find some friends who are happy to play with you knowing your noob status, and play some games online with them. The more friends the better; if you're matchmaking with randoms they will probably be less tolerant. 2. Why is it free? I seriously can play this without paying anything? Dota 2 is built on the \"freemium\" model. It's free to play, and you can purchase in-game items for money. By giving the game away, Valve hope to make more money selling in-game items than if they'd charged for the game. This is an increasing trend - so get used to seeing it more, especially for games with a strong network effect (i.e., anything with multiplayer). The things you can buy for Dota 2 are basically adornments for the characters. For example, you can outfit them with new armour, or a new sword, or some new spell effects, that are different from the stock-standard one that they come with. You can get some of these for free - they'll randomly drop at the end of games - but the good ones for your preferred characters you'll have to shell out for. It's very important to note that these items are purely decorative and have no impact on the gameplay at all. You can't pay money for a new sword that does more damage - it just looks different. This is critical and stops the game from becoming a silly pay-to-win thing. If you're a content creator, you can also create your own stuff and sell it in the store (splitting revenue with Valve).", "num_reviews": 1, "num_screenshots": 3}

All you CAN buy is Cosmetics (skin parts for Heroes, like hats, shoes, Weapons and so on, new skins/models for your Courier, narrators or HUD skins) You think that is nice? Wait, best is coming: You get these Items for FREE! No way? Than let me explain: You have a chance of getting a Item after every match you play(against other players, or against Bots in the Koop mode), but thats not all. You gain something called \"battlepoints\" and it is Basicly a experience, BUT if you lvl up, the ONLY thing that happens is: You get an Item for free! So you have a chance of getting a Item after every Match AND a item after every lvl up....yes it stacks and you can get 2 items after just 1 game! So not only is it free to play, but you get the things you can buy for free! If that is not awesome, i dont know what is! So, we got the Pay concept, now lets talk about Gameplay and than Community. Dota 2 is a Strategie Game, sub class - Moba -> Multiplayer Online Battle Arena That means, that you have Control over your Hero as if in a Strategie Game(top down view), you control a Hero you selected in the first place ( out of 104 Heroes if i remember right) You start the Game with no buffing equipment(so skins you have to equip too, but they dont \"buff\" you in any way, other than you are better looking) and some starting Gold. You than have to choose where you gonna go (one of the 3 \"lanes\" or \"paths\" that connect your Area with the Enemys) After the timer run out(1 minute) the Game begins, and Soldiers of both opposite Teams spawn. These are non Hero creatures, that give less experience and Gold than a Hero, but are way easier to kill. Now you and your enemys kill each others Soldiers(and each other) and try to progress faster than the opponent, to basicly crush the enemys base(where the Soldiers spawn and you resurect after you die) I will not go more in Detail about the Gameplay, because it is way to much to explain. Lets instead talk about the Community. The Dota 2 Community is not better or worse than any other Community i would say. You have the spammer/scammers, but it is easy to just ignor list them. You have the people who are frendly and Help you if they can(even if they themself dont know much) and you have the people who are rude. This can have many reasons, but i would suggest to Ignor them for the most part. Just remember everybody can have a bad day so just ignor his flame and enjoy the Game as much as you can. I would recommend Koop-Bot Matches after finishing the toturial, till you manage to have a Positive score against the Hardest Bots. If you do so you should: 1. Get enough experience with many Heroes, so you know what they can do(skills) 2.Get to know the different (at least 3 out of) 5 roles 3. Know where to buy the different Items 4. How the Jungle and the Rune system Works 5. Get some reflexes you may not have in the first place You will lvl up and progress your Gameplay if you do so, but dont worry: If you dont play against other Players in the Normal matchmaking, you will not get to play against more Profesional Players. You will be Playing against new People mostly who dont have as much experience as you have, and you can adjust your Gamestyle(because there are differences if you play vs Bot or Humans) So i hope you know know what this Game is about. I love this Game and have over 1000 Hours of Gameplay(think it is somewhere at 1300 at the moment), i recommend it highly and I believe that is the Best MOBA out there right know.

To make an un-biased opinion as a faithful Dota player, ever since the Warcraft 3 custom map, Dota is hard to learn at first and expect other players to flame you if you're new and you join in the matchmaking fray. If a friend of yours dragged you into this life-draining game, or if you're a girl, most likely your boyfriend (because he needs a support), worry not! There is a coaching system for new players to be guided by their Steam friends and a very thorough tutorial at the start which I could not emphasise any more but to complete. Trust me, it may seem like a long tutorial but after awhile you'd realise that it really isn't as much and it was worth doing - plus it saves you from other players flaming you. Oh, and always pick Sniper. Sniper is life. Sniper is love. Or Viper, use Viper. If coming from League of Legends: It's just like the LoL 3-lane 5v5 matchmaking map with different game modes which you should be familiar with after awhile. Unlike League of Legends, in Dota 2 all the heroes are balanced in-game and no external bonuses are given to them if you buy cosmetics (pay2win) such as runes but they do make your heroes (champions) look good and gives you that good feeling that you're supporting the eSports pro-scene. Here in Dota 2, the meta-game is similar: jungling, supporting, wards, carries, towers (turrets), etc. and you'll learn these as you go by just as you did in LoL. In this game, you also get to deny creeps (minions), heroes, and towers to rob enemy heroes of their exp or possible gold and that, in my opinion is a big quality which new Lol-to-Dota2 transferees don't realise. Now unless you've been living under the rock like Patrick, you'd realise that there's a huge hate factor between LoL and Dota 2 players. Just don't listen to them, they're immature. A big difference between LoL and Dota 2's meta-game is how LoL relies more on skillshots while Dota 2 relies on strategy - this you'd agree upon if you're not like the immature fanboys/fangirls of each side. On the other note, just give the game a shot, seriously. This review is an attempt to making an un-biased personal opinion on the game but however much someone tells you how good or bad a game is shouldn't affect your personal likes and dislikes. Although personally, I would recommend this. Hope to welcome a new player to the Dota 2 community soon! And if you ever feel like raging - keep calm, relax. It's just a game.", "num_reviews": 2, "num_screenshots": 1}

Actually i could say that the transition from Dota->Dota 2 gameplay was amazing,they didn't forgot a single thing and added even more than original Dota.The game got amazingly cool graphics and a great Soundtrack.The menu organisation are very simply and easy to understand to all new players.Valve really cares about your learning in Dota2 so they've made a \"Learning\" page where they \"teach\" you how to play better by making you a recommendation of the best items (Dota 2 have in stores always recommended items for you to purchase for each hero),because Dota 1 didn't had that option,so you need to now by your experience what to buy.They have videos where they show you each skill of each hero and it does.If you also want you can play with tips in your game if you need more help and also ask a more \"professional\" player to teach you (it's called coach),he will spectate your game and make you tips. The gameplay is amazing,i love it because it's very realistic and logic (dota 2 got a lot of logic,instead mobas like lol don't have).The art of Heroes are sorry but i'll repeat it,are amazing,everything is amazing in dota (almost) xD Still dota got some problems that need to be corrected: 1st-The community.Dota 2 community is full of stupid noobish kids,who don't know how to play and don't even learn how to play,and when you say them don't feed or other item,they'll always say to you fuc...you,noob,i've fuc.. your mother...(typical answer of russian 12 y.o kids). 2-Some updates that don't needed to be done (like removing the pudge fountain hook,because it had a lot of logic....and they removed it).but nevermind to this. 3-I can't tell you if Dota2 still got many bugs or not,but i notice that they still have a few,like shop bug where you can't buy items. 4-Servers.I don't know why but it's normal to have the servers down in dota2,and sometimes in the game will appear \"Searching for Dota2 Network\",don't know why this happens but probably their servers can't hold so much people?(my opinion). So yeah thats pretty what i've wrote.I hope you play this game and like it and enjoy as i do. Good Luck & Have Fun :)", "num_reviews": 0, "num_screenshots": 0}

To make an un-biased opinion as a faithful Dota player, ever since the Warcraft 3 custom map, Dota is hard to learn at first and expect other players to flame you if you're new and you join in the matchmaking fray. If a friend of yours dragged you into this life-draining game, or if you're a girl, most likely your boyfriend (because he needs a support), worry not! There is a coaching system for new players to be guided by their Steam friends and a very thorough tutorial at the start which I could not emphasise any more but to complete. Trust me, it may seem like a long tutorial but after awhile you'd realise that it really isn't as much and it was worth doing - plus it saves you from other players flaming you. Oh, and always pick Sniper. Sniper is life. Sniper is love. Or Viper, use Viper. If coming from League of Legends: It's just like the LoL 3-lane 5v5 matchmaking map with different game modes which you should be familiar with after awhile. Unlike League of Legends, in Dota 2 all the heroes are balanced in-game and no external bonuses are given to them if you buy cosmetics (pay2win) such as runes but they do make your heroes (champions) look good and gives you that good feeling that you're supporting the eSports pro-scene. Here in Dota 2, the meta-game is similar: jungling, supporting, wards, carries, towers (turrets), etc. and you'll learn these as you go by just as you did in LoL. In this game, you also get to deny creeps (minions), heroes, and towers to rob enemy heroes of their exp or possible gold and that, in my opinion is a big quality which new Lol-to-Dota2 transferees don't realise. Now unless you've been living under the rock like Patrick, you'd realise that there's a huge hate factor between LoL and Dota 2 players. Just don't listen to them, they're immature. A big difference between LoL and Dota 2's meta-game is how LoL relies more on skillshots while Dota 2 relies on strategy - this you'd agree upon if you're not like the immature fanboys/fangirls of each side. On the other note, just give the game a shot, seriously. This review is an attempt to making an un-biased personal opinion on the game but however much someone tells you how good or bad a game is shouldn't affect your personal likes and dislikes. Although personally, I would recommend this. Hope to welcome a new player to the Dota 2 community soon! And if you ever feel like raging - keep calm, relax. It's just a game.", "num_reviews": 2, "num_screenshots": 1}

However the language is very hard to master with complicated grammar and pronunciations. During my first year in school I only could reach a D in grade. Later on, my teatcher gave me tips to improve myself in Russian. She told me that next years course will be much harder and that I have to come in contact with the language on a daily basis to improve my Russian. Knowing that I like video games, she recommended me to play a game she usually plays. \"In Russia everyone plays DOTA 2\" she said. Obviously, I could not really belive that the whole Russian population plays a single game. But if the solution to my grade was video games, I would not complain. Desperate for anything to help my grade I gave DOTA 2 a chance. I loaded up on the Russian server, but all I found where a german open mic stack where talking to each other. It was very courious, how could possibly find no Russians on their own server? The following day I told my teatcher about my problem. Frankly, I was more than surprised by her answer. \"Oh ,don't you know? Russians allways only play on the Eu west server\" she said laughingly. Now this this truly seemed like a mystery worth investigating, why are Russians not playing on their own server? The answer I recieved from my teatcher made me only more confused. There seems not to exist an acceptable answer. I have tried to answer this question later on in life in my master's dissertation, but it's no use. Finding an acceptable answer to that question is like finding the meaning of life. Anyway, if you could ignore this issue and proceed with playing on EU West you will improve your Russian greatly like I did. Everyday after school,I played DOTA 2 on EU West. With each game my understanding for this complex game increased aswell as my Russian language skills. Thanks to DOTA 2 I have gotten a chanse to come across Russian in both speech and writing. This game is really spectacular if you; like me want to become better at Russian and have the time to play it. As for my grades in Russian I recived a B in 2 grade and A in my third when I started to spend a lot of time on DOTA 2.", "num_reviews": 3, "num_screenshots": 36}

How willing you are to do reserch(online) and sit in created games to practice combos/lh ect.. will dictate how well you will progress. 2) *Easy to jump right into with a group of friends.* If you have a group of friends that play it can be very fun to LEARN tegether. 3) **It is a competative enviroment** if you are a competative person this is the game for you. 4) **A lot of classes of heros to choose from** over 100. Although some are better then others every hero in the right/wrong situation can be very useful or bad. 5) **NOT A PAY TO WIN GAME**... Doesn't even nickle and dime you to death. You pay for HUDs, skins, loading screens ect; But, nothing that can affect how well players play or others. 6) **Dev's are quick to respond to issues on offical forums** They also fix them in a timly manner. CONS: 1) **A lot of reserch and guided practice is NEEDED to be decent at this game.** This might be a bummer for those who like to d/l and game and insta win.... If this is you stay away...far away 2) **The \"guantlet\" most mmr players need to go through\".** This \"guantlet\" consist of other people players will be teamed up with that will troll, not speak your selceted language, or just not give a damn about your game. These people tend to ruin games and will hinder advancement in the MMR (ranked) or hidden mmr (un-ranked) system. The \"guantlet\" consist of the lower tiers usually low hidden mmr and 1-2.8k MMR area. It is possible to pass the guantlet but a lot of practice is needed or you can party with friends. 3) **Server Issues** Everynow and then they will have laggy servers or down networks randomly but a restart of steam or a bathroom break easily solves these uncommon issues.", "num_reviews": 3, "num_screenshots": 0}

However, much like TF2, it has its fair share of problems. For starters, this game has a stupidly high learning curve. There's no one true way to play any of the 100+ heroes, and it can get very frustrating very fast trying to find what you can easily work with for any of them with the gigantic selection of items. Other than a small pool of heroes that I'm confident enough with to pick on a regular basis, the largest part of the roster is alien to me, with my success {or lack thereof, which is normally the case} depending largely on the skill level of the enemy team and my teammates. Which brings us to the next point. 90% of the people who play this game are stupid. Now, I don't claim to be good at this. I'm slightly above average at best. However, it's hard to play on anything outside of solo bot servers when you're constantly thrown in with stupid people, first timers, people who don't speak the server regions language, people who are only there to prance around in costumes, or don't want to follow simple orders/use common sense. Or any combination of the above. Meanwhile, you can rest assured that your opponents will almost always have their act together, and be an unstoppable force that you futilely try to at least hinder. Which is made even harder when your teammates insist on throwing themselves into unwinnable battles, further feeding them until the point where there's a 10+ level gap between you and the lowest leveled enemy. On the other hand, you might go up against a team that's super bad. As in, it's a game that lasts less than 20 minutes. In which case, you've learned nothing, and your time is wasted just as thoroughly as it would be against people out of your league. Or, on the occasion that you get teammates that know what they're doing, you can expect them to whine about your choice of hero, your starting items/abilities, your lane choice, or god forbid, your costume. At which point, 9/10 of these people will purposefully feed the enemy or go afk, and then either rage quit or stop when you've ceased your apparently unforgivable behavior. Or they might report you to try and get you thrown into low priority, which is Dota's equivalent of hell. And unlike TF2, you can't just drop out whenever you wish without taking a heavy penalty for doing so. So have fun being in matches where there will be almost no fun a majority of the time. Now, there is a report system, which in theory, is supposed to shoo away the vermin that don't need to be playing this in the first place. In practice, it's horribly broken, due to being automated. Doing amazingly good, but you're the odd man out in a Peruvian 4 stack that you've somehow managed to offend? Expect to have the low priority message pop up when you exit to the menu after the match. Or maybe you want to report that 0/25 Treant that refused to do his job, and started purposely dying to feed the enemy. The entire server could report him, but he could still easily slip through without getting lp. In all seriousness, it's down to luck if it does work when you want it to, and doesn't when it's being abused. Up next, hero balance. Thankfully, this isn't quite as bad as it could be, but there is still silliness here and there. Some heroes have one or two overpowered abilities, while others are all around unbalanced, and others still are in sore need of buffing. At the same time, some heroes are nicely balanced, but are easily outclassed by other heroes who can perform the same role, only much better and easier. Why pick Legion Commander and eventually out damage the enemy team using skill, when you can pick Ursa and out damage them from level 3 onwards and rarely have to press more than one button? Why pick Weaver and alternate between your 2 escapes when you can pick Storm Spirit and have an escape with no cooldown? Why pick Centaur Warrunner to be durable when you can pick Axe and not only be durable, but be so durable the lane gets locked down for your enemy? There's tons of examples like this. Also, you'll see some heroes almost every match, {Pudge, Sniper, Zeus, who all have skills that can be more or less mindlessly spammed/have low risk high reward play styles.} but lots are seen either rarely, or rarely outside of comp play {Io, Meepo, Dark Seer, who all take some degree of skill/have high risk decent reward play styles}. What it sadly boils down to is, why play a hero where you have more than 1 button to press and risk being overwhelmed but have a more rewarding experience, when you can pick a hero that more or less does the same thing, but with less complexity? As with TF2, Valve is slowly but surely turning this into another hat simulator. I played a ton of the original Dota, and I sure don't remember any customization, because that would have been silly. This game is hard enough without being distracted by someone's super pimped out loadout, or worrying if you're going to get a nice drop {if any, only 2-3 people usually get drops at the end of the round}. The main problem with character customization though, is that much like TF2, it attracts half wits that only want to play the super easy classes and dress them up, then look down on everyone else who isn't wearing a 20c wolf hat. Yeah, take your little wolf hat into a ranked match. See how they like it. Also like TF2, Valve focuses more on cosmetic items than the game itself, which started off small, but in recent months has led to them: 1. Canceling popular game modes, in order to {in their own words} 'focus more on cosmetic sets'. 2. Building entire game modes around expensive sets {although in fairness, said sets only enhanced the modes/tracked stats for them, but still...}, or just flat out making new modes pay to win {the Year Beast Brawl was p2w to the point that disgusting amounts of money and cheap tactics trumped genuine skill almost 100% of the time}. 3. Doing inane things like changing the perfectly fine models of heroes, and then using that as an excuse to make more money {Shadow Fiend's model was just fine, but then he got a redesign that looked like an angsty 12 year old made it, and a $35 cosmetic that looked like an even more angsty 10 year old designed it}. 4. Possibly the worst, outright ignoring critical server issues to focus on cosmetic item bugs. Overall, the game would be greatly improved if Valve would do the following things: 1. Mandatory region locking for everyone, to heavily cut down on the language barrier. 2. A proper {and required} tutorial for new players. 3. Rather than adding new cosmetics every week, finally adding the remaining heroes from the mod, as well as much needed balancing for all the heroes. As fun as this game is, I reccomend it to no one, other than someone willing to go through absolute misery to occasionally have fun.", "num_reviews": 0, "num_screenshots": 0}

Dota 2 seems to have more consistency between heros as to what works and what doesn't. It's map is much larger and allows for more juke spots and places to farm safely. The game is a welcome sequel to everyone's battle.net favorite Dota. Not recomended to newer MOBA players but for those who have played League and found the game too fast, too simple or too hard to come back from when behind this is a great game. Those who enjoyed s1 and s2 League where boots were one of the earliest items you got and many champions were unforgiving will enjoy that feel once again in Dota 2. This game has a very wide pool of itemization for all roles although it still suffers from gold starved supports like most MOBAs. I would say that this game is a MOBA for those who have already learned the basics in other MOBAs and are ready to try something a bit slower but more complex. Bugs, balence issues etc are dealt with in a very timley manner which allows for stable gameplay. I think this game has sucked away my soul more than my wife and that is saying something.

I have since been fired from my work at the hospital for shouting out FIRST BLOOD every time I use the scapel to open up a patient - apparently it scared the other nurses and created a hostile environment. BUT I have the last laugh! - I now work for the Russian embassy translating war manuals taken from the recent acquisition of Crimea, Ukraine. I convert these documents to English because the Kremlin leaders are on a 18 month crash course to learn English. So I make them read document after document and lol at them reading in English. Anyways, About Dota. This game is really good. I would not have toughened up in life as much as I have if not for this game. From the numerous taunts to the calls for feeds, gotta love this game. Most favorite thing in Dota? Low priority - its like the physcially gruelling SAS passing course - only its for your brain. Highly recommended for Charlie Sheen.

Not better, but something different. Both games have many similarities but also some differences in the way of playing. Hardcore fans of the original Wacraft 3-Modifkation Defense of the Ancients definitely feel at home because Dota 2 is practically only a technical remake of its predecessor. But even those who have over the years played League of Legends tired and looking for a new challenge in the genre, will find pleasure in the game. Genre newbies may take a look of course, especially since Dota 2 is Free-2Play. Beginners should expect frustration moments when it comes to first games against human opponents but despite the solid tutorials. Only if some experienced players come equal to each other, unfolds Dota 2 its full potential fun. For me, DotA 2 is the best MOBA and with his multitude of heroes and revised engine, significantly better than the outdated League of Legends. In addition, I think that DotA (in work with Steam) will become more and more players with the time. CAUTION: Makes you addicted to more. 97/100", "num_reviews": 17, "num_screenshots": 3033}

However this game does have a rather steep learning 'cliff' (similar to a learning curve but instead of gradually learning, it takes some time then the game *snaps* into focus for you and you become pretty good and then it's a normal learning curve from there on).

I started playing it because my friends convinced me, and because almost everybody in the forum I post on play this. So I started playing it both with my friends and solo. Today at the end of my very last match(which I lost) I realized that I have never had fun in this game. I mean, out of 900 hours I can only remember like, 7-8 really funny moments where I actually laughed. Oh, the irony of fate, the very last laugh was in my very last match. I was Earthshaker top dire in lane with Warlock against Death Prophet and Batrider, we got first blood like 10 seconds after the 00:00 mark, I spotted DP warding our jungle, I used fissure to block her escape way and Warlock used Shadow Word. While we were AA her, she started to move left and right like she didn't know what to do, it looked like she was dancing, and it reminded me of that case of mass hysteria happening around the early XVI century in France, where several people started dancing uncontrollably for weeks until they died(yes I know, my interests are ed up), and THAT actually made me laugh, THAT to me was a funny moment, not the quick first blood, not the 2 more kills we did on bat in the next couple of minutes (warlock got all of them btw) but the fact that DP started dancing while we were beating her up. This made me think a little, but only for a couple of seconds, there's a game to win here guys! Focus! There's very little to say about what happened next, the typical things that usually happen in a bad, unranked, 0 MMR, trench  tier match; me without blink until 25:00; our Drow disconnecting (and abandoned) cause of PC problems, Lina with Aghanim and no Meka; wards only for half match(I'm guilty of it too); we lost Roshan two times, over 20 kills of difference for the Radiants, Lina and Storm Spirit arguing with each other, calling names, your mama did this, your fatha did that, your sista lul  don't evel let me start on that one, and so on. At the very end of the match, we hid in the fountain waiting for them to FF GG WP EZ QQ M8S ecc, and in that moment, reading the argue between Lina and Storm, i asked myself some questions: Am i having fun? Is this game making me laugh? How many funny moments i can remember about this game? Is that normal that to me every single match i've done looks exactly the same as the others(lul of cuz yes u ing <2kh scum n00b)? The answers to the questions were: no, no, not even 10, i don't know. In that instant, I realized that this game, to me, was just a gigantic waste of time. How many times have I actually enjoyed what was going on on screen? Why am I taking this so seriously? Why do I want to win so desperately? Why do my teammates want to win so desperately? ... How many times have I smiled while playing this game? ... These are not pro player matches we play, we are earning nothing from this, there's no need to yell at each other! This makes me sad. I've heard yelling my whole life, I play games because they help me forget about how life is hard, to relax and laugh at the hundreds and hundreds of funny, silly, nonsense moments this beautiful piece of software can gift me. Games really help me, they help me a lot. Please, guys, stop, dont get mad, Im serious! This is a game, right? Games are meant to be fun! Please stop arguing, we lost a videogame, its not the end of the world, next time you will win, we will all win :) and even if you don't, who cares! Its just a videogame! Enjoy the little things you can get out of it! Remember DP dancing to death? Wasn't that fun? Remember Pudge denying himself after we wasted literally all we got at him? And then the Radiants team wiped us? Yes, we lost money and experience, but wasn't that kinda fun? Sorta fun? Even a little bit? Yes we lost this match but cmon! Don't hide in the fountain! Lets do something silly to them! Lets annoy them! Storm, use your ulti to get near them and then immediately go back in the fountain! Lets watch them throwing everything at you in the attempt of catching you! Isn't that fun? :D <<Storm?>> <<Storm?>> <<Storm?, are you listening to me?, Storm are you still arguing with Lina because of her Aghanim? She made a mistake, everybody makes mistakes, there is no need to take it personally!

Dota 2 seems to have more consistency between heros as to what works and what doesn't. It's map is much larger and allows for more juke spots and places to farm safely. The game is a welcome sequel to everyone's battle.net favorite Dota. Not recomended to newer MOBA players but for those who have played League and found the game too fast, too simple or too hard to come back from when behind this is a great game. Those who enjoyed s1 and s2 League where boots were one of the earliest items you got and many champions were unforgiving will enjoy that feel once again in Dota 2. This game has a very wide pool of itemization for all roles although it still suffers from gold starved supports like most MOBAs. I would say that this game is a MOBA for those who have already learned the basics in other MOBAs and are ready to try something a bit slower but more complex. Bugs, balence issues etc are dealt with in a very timley manner which allows for stable gameplay. I think this game has sucked away my soul more than my wife and that is saying something.

Major Theme: Serious gameplay to be found here, with Valve's item system. Bought at Price: $0 - Beta test Put it this way, I have over a thousand hours in this title for a reason. Something always brings me back to it. It has even elapsed my hours in Counter-Strike somehow. What is it exactly that keeps bringing me back here? First off, this game is of the \"MOBA\" breed. It isn't an RTS, FPS, or even MMORPG. It's roots are from Warcraft III, and other RTS games. Someone brought these games out of the shadows and gave them an overhaul. You have probably heard about LoL, being League of Legends, the most direct competitor with Dota 2. Not getting into the whole thing, simply put, Dota 2 is more \"hardcore\" and \"punishing\" than League of Legends while still providing a fun and inviting atmosphere. This I can say with certainty because I have played both titles in their infency. Valve is known for their work. There's obvious reasons for this. They don't scam you out of your money (*cough**cough*EA*cough**cough*), but rather let you spend money. Items are cosmetic, and you don't really have to participate in trading, collecting, or even buying anything in Dota 2. Just like Team Fortress 2, all items are random drops at the end of a game -- which can be from 20 minutes to 90 some odd minutes. Just like other Valve games, they are best played with friends. Reasoning being that you know how they play, and they know how you play. Enjoyment can come from winning, but I think it comes more from a collective win, where everyone felt like they did something to win. This is more obivous in the matchmaking in ranked play. Unranked seems to be all over the place, but with ranked, you play with players of like skill. Plus this is the only game I can think of where pausing a multiplayer game works more than half the time. Graphics aren't a huge thing here. They can be scaled down quite well, but be expected to run a reasonable setup. This isn't Half Life 1 or 2 in terms of system requirements. I've managed to get it running on my laptop which says something. Overall, like I've said before, there's solid good reasons to play and continue playing Dota 2. Since the title is free, hop on and try it out.", "num_reviews": 53, "num_screenshots": 1694}

I managed to achieve nothing in life over the course of 1100 hours. However, with these hours I have learned a lot about the game, like for instance if you ever meet people from Bali they're like some of the coolest people you can meet. If you meet an american sounding Indian you will find one of the funnest s I have met. If you meet and angry Japanese boy, that kid is Tigha, stay away from him at all possible. This game overall is a battle between Pinoys and the World. Well as far as the South East Asian server is concerned. Pinoys are at constant odds with everyone else in the game. They seem to live in a world where when they do worse than you, you are the noob. Very intresting philosophy by them. The Dota community has something that we can all learn, \"If you talk , you will get hit.\" This has been demonstrated many times over the course of my dota career.

A newly learned word is knowledge! lol) - I became logical (in a way.. yeah) - Good game to combat depression or any negative feeling (no need to take meds, this is your medicine! lmao). Cons: - I always end up doing impulse buying (whenever a set is on sale). - Sleepless nights @.@ - Goodbye social life Advises: 1. Please do not use Vladimir's offering if your hero is Sniper. 2.

Some queens shoot lasers, some summon huge Golems and some sing so hard your eardrums burst. Dota 2 is definitely one of the best games of this generation, and I'm certain it will remain as popular and as influnencal for many years to come. Graphics: 8.5/10 Very pretty, the art direction in DotA 2 is one of the best. The source engine ensures you can run it on anything more powerful than a toaster, and have it look great too. Cosmetics look great, and fit perfectly, with some exceptions,(I'm looking at you Alpine Ursa) but many stay true to the heros artstyle. Sound: 9.5/10 All heros have a multitude of voice lines,and some even respond to one another (e.g Tidehunters hatred for Kunnka). If you find the default anouncer not too flash, theres a huge variety of optional packs, from the smoth talking Narrator from bastion, to the harsh condescending tone of Pyrion Flax. Gameplay: 10/10 The big one. Theres a reason DotA Allstars got so popular, not just from the incredible passsion from the community, or the dedication of IceFrog and co., but from the incredible gameplay that spawned one of gamings most popular genres. From perfectly co-ordinating a fountain hook, to getting stuck on top of a cliff accidentally as Storm Spirit, no other genre rivals DotA 2 outstanding strategic gameplay and near-vertical learning curve. At the time of writing, I have 7,469 hours played and I've only just scratched the surface in the combos, stratagy and 107 availble heros to use, it takes year of hard work, dedication and passion to become truly great at the strategical masterpeice that is Dota 2. - beardATTACK @ fren", "num_reviews": 0, "num_screenshots": 0}

Before Im going into details I just have to say that I recommend the game for everyone. It can be fun and challenging and it is mostly very well balanced (compare to other game of this genre) Positive: -Its free to play and not pay to win -There are like over 110 heroes to choose and everyone got its own special play style -Its a very great game to play with friends -The game is based on high skill, sometimes a bit luck and of course on teamplay -The game has a \"never give\" up effect -Once you started to play Dota 2, you wont every be able to stop playing it -The workshop adds nice new thing into the game like skins (Made for fans by fans) -There are many cool gamemodes -The competitive scence is very fun to watch and you can learn very much from the pros -There are many reallife events based on Dota 2 like the TI -The game never gets boring -Its like a passion Negative: -Lets be honest: The Community (There are so many arrogant and  people in Dota 2 that sometimes its just make me wanna cry and thats of course very brutal for noobs. But i have to say just move on and play, ignore these stupid players) -In my perspective, Dota 2 is very well balanced but there are still heroes who are just too strong and broke which can frustrate hard -Language problems (There are like in every game some Russians who think they can freely write russian in the chat although its an english server. I think thats unrespectful towards the people who actually write english although they are also from other countries besides Russia like me) -Pauses (Seriously these unpauses s everyone up and nobody is able to wait for like 3 minutes -.-) My rating for Dota 2 would be 95 out of 100 Thats all from me.

As you finish completing the tutorial you would have options to either play with bots or with online players. There is a wide variety of modes to choose from. All of the heroes are unlocked from the start so you don't have to unlock them one by one like any other MOBA game. Each heroes have their own specific roles so choose wisely and don't anyhow go whatever you feel like. There is no in-game money in this game and you earned different rewards as you play many matches. There is a lore for you to read for each character if you're interested. However these game have a steep leaning curve and those who are new to MOBA genre will struggle how the gameplay system work. It require a lot of tactics & teamwork in order to win a match........that is if your partner will listen to you cause a lot of player i found will quickly rage at you if you make a minor issue while some other just rage quit because they felt like they cannot make a comeback. A lot of heroes are memorable mainly because sometimes you would see those heroes interact with one another depending if they are rival or allied. GRAPHICS : 9.5/10 This is one of the best looking MOBA games i ever seen. The environment,character details and the visual are neatly done. Some skills are pretty to look at and the particle look awesome. Despite only having one map available to play only,you won't get sick of looking at it just because the details they put into those maps are amazing. Did i not mention it also featured day & night time as well ? These feature sometimes grant a huge benefit to specific heroes. AUDIO : 9.5/10 Icefrog did really well with the sound effects. A lot of the heroes skills are jaw-dropping due to how pleasing and awesome it sound. While there is only a few music in the game,i wasn't bothered much because of how great the sound effects are. Voice acting is pretty well done too and none of them want to make you block your ear because of how horrible it sounds. LONG-LASTING APPEAL : 9.5/10 I would say that this game have a lot going on. Even though you keep playing the same map or heroes. Every match offered some sort of challenge mainly because you have against other players that have better skills than you. There is some crazy modes to choose from if you bored playing normal match. By leveling up,you unlock certain gears which you can use to customize your heroes appearance and many different more modes. There is a compendium where you able to complete numerous challenge which gives you compendium points. If you gain more compendium points,you level up your compendium. From there you able to gain numerous boots,items,courier and many more. FINAL VERDICT : 9.4/10 To those who want a challenging MOBA games and not too noob-friendly,then this is the right game for you. I spent quite a lot of time playing this game and it a really an enjoyable experience. BEWARE....the community like any MOBA games are the worst i ever seen. You would find people trash talking at you,raging at you and even people that like to troll. The game seem to have a lot of server issue also which can be extremely frustrating when you almost win a match. Nevertheless the game is really great. Also play with bots if you hate playing with d0uchebag because you gonna encounter a lot of them. GRADE : A ( Excellent )", "num_reviews": 23, "num_screenshots": 11}

Although heroes are \"Cheap\" as people say, this is not completely true, every hero in the game is counterable (And yes that means Sniper). The game entirely depends on teamwork to win the match and skill as well. One hero cannot win you the game *NOTE* 2 hero's may be able to win the game with previous experiences. PROS - ALL heroes are FREE - Skins and accesories are fairly cheap - Lots of playable heroes - Unique game modes - Nice community with lots of friendly players - Good report system - Most of the heroes require some amount of skill - Frequent updates and patches - Voice Chat (Very helpful when communicating with teamates CONS - Players neglect lane calling - Players base lanes on what hero you go - Extremely buffed heroes (ex.

It has no hope... The community of this game is most awful thing i saw in centuries, its impossible to confront a thousands of idiots that u have given by the mmr system (by the way, popular rating system that doesnt work completely, its pure luck if u had a good team or if u even have a good team there is always 1 idiot who try to ruin it on purpose or on accident). Dont even try to install this game, i spent almost 2300 hours playing this  until realised how awfully made it was, the low priority ban doesnt work to search and punish all the idiots for their mistakes or pranks, the mmr system always finds you teammates not matched your skill and their skill comparatively. If u want to waste ur time for nothing go on and take it, you will regret this whole time, and u may like it in the first time until u will realise all things that i wrote up in that review. My english may not be good, but i sent my message to you all, if you already playing this game, please, dont spent money on this , other GOOD games need your support, not the volvo machine that consumes only money, not positive feedbacks about their multiplayer games lately. Thx volvo for a great game, i think you should send this game to alpha, cuz its broken hard.", "num_reviews": 2, "num_screenshots": 0}

Naughty Dog's latest title, and their first foray into the first-person shooter genre, is without a doubt a dazzling success. Drumstick of the Albatross 2, co-designed by Gabe Newell and David \"Phreak\" Turley, has everything: HUNDREDS of weapons to choose from, an ENORMOUS array of materials obtainable to build one's own home base, and THREE different unlockable character models. At the low price of $5.99 each, booster packs are an amazing addition, allowing one's character and mount to be personalized even further. But where DotA 2 really shines is in its gameplay. The tight control scheme, designed exclusively for the Steam controller, allows a seemingly seamless interface between man and machine--you ARE the character. The experience of battling with enemy mechs up-close and personal is unrivalled by any game, especially with the advanced mango physics. Overall, I would rate DotA 2 a 9.8/10 experience; its only flaw is the slight lack of purchasable, pay-to-win content that I usually rely on to make my gaming experiences successful. I'd love to see a DotA 3, especially if Zynga takes a note out of Blizzard's book and makes the game dozens of times easier for paying customers to succeed at PvP.", "num_reviews": 0, "num_screenshots": 0}

I owe Valve a lot for making: CS 1.5 and 1.6 ;) No doubt, game turned out to be a success. Graphics are amazing, hero models are well done, voice-overs are awesome. There has to be something wrong with this game, and yes - it is - the community. It is most likely one of the biggest reasons why all of the other MOBA-players are trying to stay away from Dota 2. They find it unfriendly and harsh, but whatever. I approve that fact but I got used to it, so whenever I hear any of the \"cyKka\" or \"jaja\" it feels like: \"home, sweet home.\" ;) Haters gonna hate but I still find Dota 2 - the best RNG-based action game that has ever happened to the human kind.

There once was a time, long ago when Karl played games expecting no help from the team... He chose snowball heroes his MMR rose, there was a certain joy in his victories no matter how badly his team did. Then after long nights of 1v5 he thought to himself \"I wonder how it would be if i played with those other four russians\" For a week he tried to help lead others into the light of smart plays, excelent ward placement, and proper item choices. He led by example keeping the games close through the mid-game. But when the late game struck and the enemies BKBs were built, the team he spent the past thirty minutes of his life guiding and supporting were not there. They were not there when the bottom rax fell, they were not there when the ward spotted the Radiant attempt on roshan's life, they were not there when the mid rax was taken, they were farming, chasing illusions and supports. When the time came. When the last set of rax seemed doomed to fall, they came. In came my four hard carries like the lost children of a single mother they came to defend my home from the void. They had spent so much time farming and leaving the fighting to me that they hadnt a clue how to fight together. the four of them died a horrible death, only killing a crystal maiden they saw on their way back to the base... Why do i tell you this tale? Because there is a moral to the story, never play a support to climb the MMR bracket. It only leaves you heart broken, and 25MMR less. 10/10 would Carry again.", "num_reviews": 1, "num_screenshots": 0}

Just don't ignore the tutorial it's boring at first but really important. and do ask you friends while in game which item is good for which hero and go for easy heroes at first like Rikki or Razor, don't wish to make lots of kills at first just hang around your friends and towers and defend, it's generally a helping community, Start making friends when you understand the game better to make a team for when you have to play ranked matches. People do say go after the recommended items and it's right for when you start playing first but after that every item has an detailed explanation just go through them and with your gut feeling because it doesn't matter what skills the heroes have what matters is how you use their skills and no one knows it better than you yourself.", "num_reviews": 32, "num_screenshots": 61}

However, from my personal experience I found it easier to recover in Dota 2. That is because Dota 2 is slower paced than LoL.

It is very well crafted and improves the gameplay from orginal modification in the source engine. Gameplay mechanics are solid and is very difficult, it requires to be attentive at all times. Positioning is key throughout due to the very long stun times and high damage output by every hero at a certain point in the game. Dota 2's graphics are much improved from the original Warcraft III modification in the Warcraft engine respectivly and shows great colours and lighting on the map and characters. Unfortunatley due to it's difficult nature and very large learning curb and tends to push back a large amount of players. My recommendation is to start with a group of friends in bot matchs, and play every single hero at least once to figure out their abilities. Then play the game online where everyone is an idiot or russian. GLHF", "num_reviews": 2, "num_screenshots": 14}

And you will have to learn A TON! Trust me, before you're any good at this game, you're going through a hell of climbing up a mountain of things you need to learn with people at the top  all over you while insulting your mother (or insulting you in a language you can't even read). If you're prepared to face the most toxic community of all game genres out there, you will find a game here which could potentially accompany your whole life! It won't get boring EVER - literally. To be fair, the learning part goes for every game of this genre.

I can see this going the way of TF2 where it stays a relevant game for years to come. I bet Blizzard is kicking themselves over cause if they had picked this up before Valve did, they'd be making a whole lot more money. M.o.b.a. games are a trend these days and the original DotA was a game i really got into for years. I recently only started playing again and immediately i remembered how petty and elitist certain players are. Sometimes you don't even enjoy playing the game, sometimes you just play cause you wanna even up the losses from the last time you lost. This game makes you rage in ways you thought you never could. Ah but the feeling of crushing your enemies is a fair trade off, no? Good graphics, gameplay hasn't changed that much, events are pretty cool, marketable items are nice too. If they do promotional tie-ins with certain games like how TF2 did (for rare items. other than that genuine master thief set.) that'd certainly make it more interesting. Pudge with a super meat boy outfit or maybe Sniper with a tf2 sniper set. I give it an 8 out of 10. Play it if you don't mind getting flak from your teammates when you mess up one tiny bit. I'd play LoL but then its too cutesy for my taste. To each his own.", "num_reviews": 38, "num_screenshots": 587}

Wut!? how is this PROS instead of CONS you say!? Let me explain... Every game you play you either win or lose. Now not all games are meant to be won ;) Cause its when you lose you learn something and even when you think you havn't learnt a thing from a game of loss? You just did. You learn't that you did something wrong to have achived that loss and should try to improve in that missing element. Knowing the fact that no ones perfect. This is what makes Dota 2 fun and keeps you playing over and over, day after day so its hard to get even close to 1% of being bored. Plus in top of that there are 100+ Heroes, that makes getting bored of this game dead impossible :') and that gives us point #1 ;) So I recommend everyone to play this game, even if you're a cat...... cause cats are awesome.......so is Dota 2 ;) Happy Gaming! -Arafat / TRAPWOLF", "num_reviews": 1, "num_screenshots": 6}

You will most likely pick up this game at some point, due to the fact that it is free, and well why not? From a Graphics point of view at maxed out on a GTX 660 easily it looks fantastic and that isnt even the best graphics card so the requirements arnt huge but much lower than that on budget PC with the worst graphics card ever and you might get a few people compaining about your *Wooden PC* increasing the time to load up into the game, and if worst comes to worse you can turn it to complete minium and I bet you that even if you laptop has one of the worst GPU's on the market you can eventually get it to run at a playable pace. From a gameplay point of view, as you can see I have spent well over 500 hours on this game so it must be pretty good and some other reviewers have spent from 1000 hours and above, the reason? Well there is 1 map that has a few variables that can change the game such as the runes, weather you get a good creep from the jungle to control and take on your enemies with. So 1 map you think hummm that must be pretty limited, well yes i would kind of agree with you but the fact is that becuase of the 100+ heros and many hero combinations and counters no game is the same with each game changing the way you play slightly depending the character you play, how you play it and who you are against and how they play it so the game does take a while to get old and even then having the same map means that you can really know it, like REALLY know it. How to do specific techneques and pulling creeps, where the enemy heros can see you and how to position yourself. So in that term the gameplay remains fun and interesting while still for players like me challenging. The Community: This is the one issue you get with this game some people are not very forgiving for your mistakes and there is a lot of anti-russian stuff, mainly because when you go to play on an English or US server and you get strange man shouting at you and your team in a strange language that no one on your team but him can understand, people get a little (to say the least) annoyed. Althrough the higher your battle rank and mmr (I will talk about that later) means that eventually you will get players who actually make an effort to co-ordinate with you. The Ranking system and how valve makes its money: So the game is free and so how does valve make its money? Well first let me explain the ranking system: Basicaly after each game you will recieve an ammount of battle points for you to increase your battle point level, each level you will recieve an item (I think) and acasionally you will be able to open a present to get free items, these items can also be dropped through luck randomaly to people at the end of the game. Valve also sells hero costumes in the dota store/in game shop these items will only change the look of your character and will not actualy affect the gameplay which I find very unique and means that there arnt huge pay to wins in the game which annoys me hugely when people make a good game and then make it pay to win. These costume items are very effective with the steam market allowing players to sell their items cheaply to other players but valve still profits of that by taking a transaction fee. Also due to the popular steam workshop players can submit their item designs to be avaliable in game and they will also get a cut of the money made which is a nice thing for new artists to make some money while having something to potentially put on a CV. Also when you reach a battle point rank of 13 you will unlock ranked matchmaking which will allow you to play games with other people of that level 13 and higher to increase your MMR with the top MMR being 7500 and bottom 0 (You really have to be bad to get 0) with 5000+ mmr being very high. MMR is for more serious players that want to really test their skills with others of that level, but on a down side note, 2000-2700 mmr is very hard to get past as there are people from all different abilities so that can be a little dificult to get past. but eventually with experience and a little luck you will get past and eventually be on the climb you your ability level.

On top of the \"seemingly\" repetitive one map and mode there's actually different events with a very distinct gameplay and features.. ranging from Team versus Team like Diretide and even Co-oP like the Wraith Night.

But at the same time, one courier... one announcer... one \"set\" on your favorite hero is enough to make the game experience just SO MUCH more! Be Vary though.... Amongst the player base lurk some really irrittating and annoying children from all across the globe, who's primary aim and goal ( in game and in life ) is to just annoy people and  them off for their own pleasure.

Developed by Valve Corporation, Dota 2 was released as a free-to-play title for Microsoft Windows, OS X and Linux in July 2013, concluding a Windows-only public beta testing phase that began in 2011. The game is available exclusively through Valve's content-delivery platform, Steam. Dota 2 is played in discrete matches involving two teams of five players, each of which occupies a stronghold at a corner of the map. Each stronghold contains a building called the \"Ancient\", which the opposite team must destroy to win the match. Each player controls a \"Hero\" character and focuses on leveling up, collecting gold, acquiring items and fighting against the other team to achieve victory. Development of Dota 2 began in 2009, when the developer of the DotA mod, IceFrog, was hired by Valve as lead designer. Dota 2 was praised by critics for its gameplay, production quality and faithfulness to its predecessor. However, the game was criticized for its steep learning curve and inhospitable community. Dota 2 has become the most actively played game on Steam, with daily peaks of over 800,000 concurrent players.", "num_reviews": 1, "num_screenshots": 3}
