With the time you spend on this game, you could do all sorts. Study on learning a new set of skills to further your career. You could raise money for charity. You could be an aid worker for a foreign country and help improve the lives of others. You could even just play other games, you know, those ones sitting in your backlog, pushed aside by DotA 2. But you won't. You will always return to this game. The maximum you will learn from playing this game is how to insult others in various languages (mostly these languages will consist of Russian and Peruvian.). This game will become as much a part of your life as eating or blinking. Half the time you will not even remember having played DotA 2 on a certain day. It just becomes natural to you. If you start playing this game, you will become addicted. You will also spend obscene amounts of money on cosmetics. A quick chest purchase here, a few random items on the market there, and boom. Like me you'll have spent far too much on a game which needs no money spent on it. If you start DotA 2, not only will you be subjecting yourself to a motivation-destroying hobby, but also subjecting yourself to a wallet emptying one too. tl;dr This game will take away your time, money and patience for others.

Don't get me wrong, I am not hating or anything. I was from HoN for like 2-3 years before Dota 2 was released and tried LoL and actually enjoyed it for a bit but then went back to HoN. Dota 2 is a great game, an awesome game. I really should have thought about spending money on a free game but to hell with it I say. Mechanics are well designed, what makes a hero OP is the player behind it and the team that surrounds it. This is a team game people, so team work is a must (unless you are solo queuing, then you have to carry your garbage of a team but it can be the other way around). Monster gamers are real. Dota 2 has taught me a lot of things, you can only be good at something if you focus on it, learn from mistakes, be aware of your surroundings, trust your instinct, use common sense, trusting on your team to always have your back, believing in your capabilities, always try to be better than you were yesterday, and that.. THE COMEBACKS ARE REAL!!! This game bought me and my friends together for lan parties and strengthen our bonds. A mere game that brings people together, not just friends but complete strangers too. Dota 2 is a game that will never be forgotten. All in all, I recommend this game to everyone who wants to experience pain, suffering, and torment because at the end, you will come to a sudden realization that things are always bound to get better.

Instead of being sarcastic and writing a funny review that jabs at russians, I'm going to tell you how Dota 2 really is at it's core. In a nutshell Dota 2 is a great game, but a terrible experience at the same time. You want to keep going back to it, but you also hate to go back. Why? One word: community. Dota 2's community is for the most part rude and hateful (and undeniably filled with russians who refuse to speak any other language than that of their own), sapping the joy out of this otherwise polished and addicting MOBA. It's unfriendly to beginners and the basic mindset is to belittle anyone who makes a mistake. Make one wrong move and you are called a noob right away... at the best of times. Often it's much worse and I would prefer not to go into the details. Sometimes you get a crapstorm of hate and blame even if you haven't actually done anything wrong. Occasionally, though, you come across friendly players, and when that happens, the game is a pure joy to play. However, since the game is 5v5, coming across four nice players at the same time (if you're solo queueing) is a rarity. Why then have I played the game for over 2000 hours? The sensation of winning. Your determination to keep playing, despite of the discouraging community, is fueled by the fantastic sensation of a glorious victory. That sweet moment when you see the enemy Ancient blow up and look back on the match, remembering all the plays and teamwork that lead you to victory is ever so gratifying. But even a victory can come with a grain of salt. Many times you have rude teammates that rage in the chat even when your team is winning. There is a mute option, but that doesn't stop the bad manners that extend outside the chat. People can intentionally feed the enemy team, ignore their own team, teamkill with some abilities and just generally be a bad player. It's really frustrating and the worst part is it happens all the time. Going ranked doesn't really solve the problem either, at least not completely. Ranked matchmaking is a more serious type of mode in Dota 2 that ranks you based on how well you do and finds opponents of equal skill. It feels much more professional and \"tryhardish.\" Although you meet nice players more often, nothing stops the rude players from jumping over the fence and playing ranked aswell. Having played some matches in ranked, I can say the mode isn't \"hate free.\" I had some of the worst matches in regards to teammates in that mode. Another problem with ranked is that, like I said, it's more \"tryhard.\" Many just want to play the game casually and not have to worry about ranks and the \"this is ranked, you better be a damn good player\" mentality. But don't get me wrong, Dota 2 is a great game in itself and that's why I keep going back to it. The core mechanics are spot on and gameplay flows well. No technical issues to speak of (not counting the occasional missing texture bug or so, of which I have had none myself). Graphics are great and have a subtle water painting type feel to them. All the various spells and abilites look great. The game is very deep and complex with tons of items, skill and item builds and strategies to learn. It can be a bit terrifying to beginners, but once you get the hang of things, it's engaging. All the playable heroes are well balanced (although there is always some debate on a couple specific heroes being \"OP\") and free to play from the start. That's another thing the game does right. All the heroes are free and playable from the start, unlike Dota 2's undeniably very successful competitor, League of Legends. Dota 2's microtransactions focus on purely cosmetic stuff, which means there are zero \"pay to win\" elements in the game. It really falls unto you to decide whether if you want to suffer the rude community for the sake of playing this brilliant game. If you're one of those people who can just calmly ignore everything rude being said at you, you have a better chance of not finding Dota 2 so terrible. To put it roughly in perspective: Playing Dota 2 is like playing Skyrim, but having someone stand next to you the whole time yelling at you for every mistake you make, calling you a \"fooping idiot\" every time you miss an arrow or fail a quest objective. Failed to kill Alduin? \"Uninstall Skyrim, noob.\" Don't know how to make dragonbone armor? \"Learn to play, tard.\" It would just completely sap the fun out of your epic adventures, would it not? Sadly that's how Dota 2's community is. Having played the game as long as I have, I would say that you are better off not playing Dota 2. The game is fun when you're winning (because people tend to rage less when your team is doing fine), which is 50% of the time (and sometimes not even when you're winning). It isn't the losses that make the game unpleasant, it's the unfriendly people. Often your day will just be worse after playing Dota 2, instead of it cheering you up as games do. People will tell you that Dota 2 is great, but that greatness comes with a price. Do take in notice that this is all coming from a solo player point of view. This review is meant mainly to those who are likely to play the game alone most of the time and want to know what it's really like, not just the great things. If you have four friends who you can play with on a regular basis, then you're good to go. The game is at it's best when you play with friends and don't have to worry about getting \"a stick in the mud\" player on your team.

A mod that has been worked on by many, and therefore it was hard to determind where the rights belong. A lot of legal hocus pocus were going on between Blizzard and Valve last year, and it ended to valve's favor. The Dota name and franchise is now legally a part of Valve, probably thanks to the sneaky acquisition of IceFrog the year before. Dota 2 is a real-time strategy game in the sub-genre called MOBA (multiplayer online battle arena). A genre that has grown rapidly the past few years, with different type of alterations in favor of success. Dota 2 is a close second to being the most popular MOBA, right behind the giant League of Legends. Just like LoL, Dota 2 is gaining success throughout it's competetive e-sport scene, and it's clear that valve is highly pushing it towards the first position. The latest and biggest tournament was The International 2013, which included a total prize pool of over 2.8 million US dollars, which was the biggest prize pool in e-sport history. Gameplay is easy to understand but very hard to master. The map consists of 3 lanes that are constantly being pushed by NPC creeps. You are controlling a hero amongst 4 other in your team, and are fighting against 5 in the opposing team. The goal is to push your heroes and NPC creeps to the enemy base, where you have to destroy the ancient. It sounds pretty easy, but it requires hours upon hours to get a hold of the base mechanics, the more advanced mechanics and the professional mechanics. Plus the over 100 heroes you get to play and face. After 300 hours I have only touched what I call the more advanced mechanics, and I am not even close to professional level. The most experienced players have around 5000 hours of playtime and have spend the majority of their past 3 years to Dota 2. Since the game is Extremely competetive there will be a lot of curse words flying around while you play. These type of games are known for very hostile encounters with other players. There is an optional tutorial that you can take before going out there, beware though - the tutorial does not cover any Russian. Dota 2 might be competetive, extremely enraging and the learning curve is steep as crap, but it is still the game that I have spend the most time playing on Steam (mostly because my collegues and bosses were playing it). Somehow I keep returning to it, so I suppose I am enjoying it. You better have people to play with though, and you better not be good friends - because this game will take your beloved friendship and wipe it's  with it until you hate each other. Only play this if you plan on getting some mental disorder. Time will fly, and you will realize you still suck and people hate you no matter what. It's free so why do you need a review anyway?

Dota 2 is an addictive experience; however, this game also draws a player base from the bottom of society. If that statement is an insufficient description of the game, continue reading. This game is not for the casual gamer, this game is for those who have the capability to log in hundreds of hours into a game. If you play this game, I can attest that there will be times you love it and times you just want to break your monitor with your keyboard. I have a few hundred hours into the game and no matter how long you play, no matter what you do, you will encounter someone who will complain about something you're doing poorly or not doing correctly and it may ruin the gameplay for you. I can only recommend this game if you have thick skin or you have friends to play with. So here are what I consider the pros and cons of the game: Pros -This is a very intricate strategy based game that relies heavily on teamwork and timing. -Free to play with optional cosmetic costs. -Gameplay always varies due to each individual hero selection. This, in effect, increases replayability tremendously. -Wonderful voice actors with interesting dialogue choices by the developer. -Winning matches in this game often triggers the release of dopamine in the reward center in your brain creating the desire to play more. This in effect causes players to really want to win and may be the trigger of many cons of the game. Cons -This game has a steep learning curve, believe me, there is way more to this game than you might think at first glance. Unlike hero customization in League of legends, not all heroes are created equal and not all ward placements are either. It can be a little intimidating to think that your team is already at a disadvantage from the hero selection, but thus is DOTA. -Secondary to the steep learning curve, games tend to be won or lost by the actions of an individual on either team. This can be ameliorated by steam implementing some sort of \"fundamentals of gameplay\" video instead of the current lackadaisical tutorial they have. Suffice to say, many new players do not understand that every time their hero is killed by the opposing team, the player loses gold and the other team gains gold. This doubles the impact that each individual has for gameplay. -Unlike other video game developers, Steam does not region lock. This brings about an unforeseen consequence where individuals from any country can join any server despite having a language preference. You can imagine how difficult it is to create a coordinated cohesive team push when there's a Russian only speaker, Spanish only speaker and a Portuguese only speaker on the US WEST server. -Blame is a word that is thrown around in this game like the word inequality is thrown around in America. Unfortunately, this is by far the worst aspect of the game. The game community has very little to no interaction prior to gameplay or thereafter and there is no review conversation on what an individual can do to improve in the future. More often than not, an individual will oversimplify the ongoing team loss to 1 action by 1 individual because of time constraints and heated emotions. -There is no team forfeit vote option in game and often you are sitting there for 10-20 minutes as the other team wastes your time despite securing a victory much earlier. This review is from personal experience and your gameplay may vary. Of course, if you do meet someone ingame who is a decent person, be sure to commend them at the end of the match for their ingame courtesy.

First of all, this review is not a humorous one. I'm writing it seriously to give information about this game. Because it is so popular and too many people want to learn something about it including who has never played it and starters. I think this review will be informative for these people, gamers who has spent couple of hours like me, knows everything i am going to try to tell. After this short introduction, we can start: -Russians' problem is not about being Russian. Due to the game's popularity among Russian players, there are too many bad (always swears, doesnt play as its a team game, doesnt speak english in eu servers etc.) Russian players. But there are also too many nice Russian players. Briefly, the problem is not about being Russian, if there are 10 gamers in dota, 4 of them will be bad players, if there are 1000, 400 of them. Thats the point. -If you want to play this game to get relaxed, dont do it. After few matches you will find yourself more depressed, angry or sick instead of relaxed or enjoyed. The bad players are the reason for it. As an illustriation; you started a game to get enjoyed, looked the picks, someone rushed carry heroes without saying anything and suddenly said \"me mid\" or \"me solo\" etc., ok thats right you are still relax, you picked a support for your team, they somehow fed the enemies, ok still you are relaxed, they started to argue with each other, they started to swear and fed the enemy team on purpose just because of their arguement, ok you are still trying to convince them to stop it but you feel angry, and then you will lose the game. This type of games are not so rare in dota. 3 over 10 games are being played according to this nutshell. Therefore, it is highly possible that you will find yourself in a very bad mood instead of enjoyed after playing dota. -Then, why people still playing it too much? Why there is not just bad players in the community now? Because it is addictive. You can not get rid of it. If someone trolls your game, you want to play again and wish to play with better players, if you win the game, you want to win again and increase your mmr, if you lose the game you want to play again to get your mmr back. Shortly, you will want to play again after every game. However, if you are sure that you can stop playing whenever you want, this reason is pointless for you. -Meaningless mmr system. When i first heard about mmr system i was quite excited. Because it ideally provides an environment that includes less trolls and bad players. However, the system is completely meaningless. Player profile and skills are same at 1k,2k and 3k mmr. Once you get your mmr, it is very hard to increase it too much since every win increase it 25, every lose decrease it 25 and as i said before, player profile is same at 1k 2k and 3k, when you have a bad player in your team it is nearly impossible to win that game etc. It is completely up to your team. So, how people get too high mmr's? They have this mmr at the begining. And how they did it? There is no clear information about it. Valve does not announce how it is being calculated. For example, i played 10 first ranked games with 8 wins, i played support and carries, buy wards and couriers when i was support, i carried the game almost on my own when i was carry, but my mmr was 2200 when some people get 4k starting mmr. This system also a fact about this game's addiction but doesn't help kind players about creating a better environment. -All in all, i dont recommend this game just because of its community. The game is a master piece, master of MOBAs, it is a great thing that only you can spend your money on cosmetic items in the game, it has great graphics etc. However, it has a really bad community and you will find yourself as one of those bad players when you play more and more and it becomes impossible to get rid of it. On the other hand, if you have a great mental power and patience, play it, i completely recommend it. This review was written for normal patience leveled people. I dont say \"Dont waste your time, go and do some social activities\", if u want to play video games, dont play it go and play more enjoying games. -Lastly, i have an advice for valve, it would be better if there will be an administrator system in dota. People who works professionally and for money for this administrator job would examine players' matches who get reports too much and if they see that they are bad players (as defined at the beginning) they should be banned from game for few days or their mmrs should be decreased. Now, it is done completely automatic and so after some low priority matches bad players can continue trolling. I hope it would be helpful for people who hasnt spent too much time on dota and it would be read by people except from my friends :D ************************Some Suggestions************************ I wrote this review when this game made me feel so bad and desperate. I lost my will to play dota. However then, thanks to some sensitive comments, I started to play dota only with my friends. Now I have some suggestions for people who have similar feelings about dota as I mentioned in my review months ago. -As some people say in comments of this review, play this game with your friends. After writing this review I have rarely played solo games and it feels better. -Participate in some tournaments. After lots of bad pub match experiences, that tournament atmosphere offers a great dota experience. You can participate in ESL's or other platforms' open tournaments for free. -Finally,never give up! You can encounter very kind players as well. After a bad pub game performance, your teammates maybe say \"uninstall dota\" etc. but after then you can participate in tournaments with your friends. Just do not give any importance what they say. You can see similar things in this review's comments section. There are very kind, sensitive and suggestive comments which try to help me and lots of depressing, offensive comments. Same is true for the player profile in dota, just dont give any importance what the haters say! ***Final Note*** For the guys who say \"why don't u recommend the game while playing it too much\", please read the review again, this review is a complete answer to your question. GOOD LUCK & HAVE FUN :D UNFORTUNATELY, IO LOST THE ARCANA SHOWDOWN :( Edited: Game hours are updated and some grammar mistakes are corrected. \"Some Suggestions\" section added.

The blend of well-balanced multiplayer, infinite replayability, gorgeous aesthetics, and the time and care Valve has put in to support the community is a recipe for perfection. I simply cannot reccomend Dota 2 enough. The game boasts a roster of over a hundred heroes, and each one feels unique and well-designed. In any given match, you take control of a singular hero, and victory or defeat hinges not only on how well you play that hero, but how also on how well you synergize with your five person team. Unfortunately, the barrier of entry is high. Quite a lot of research, preparation, and knowledge is required to be sucessful, and it can be frustrating losing repeatedly. However, tutorials are available to guide new players, and the time spent learning only adds to the satisfaction of landing a five-man Black Hole or pulling off that perfect Blink-Poof combo. Spectacularly enough, the battlefield is not the only area where the game shines. Dota TV is an in-game spectator mode that allows the option to watch professional teams play in tournaments, including the multi-million dollar International that Valve hosts on a yearly basis. And all of this for free. There are cosmetic items that can be used to customize your favorite hero, however nothing availble changes gameplay in any way. They are mostly designed by members of the community and can be purchased or recieved randomly while playing. Content patches and new heroes are being added all the time. Dota 2 will continue to grow for years, hopefully continuing to find new players interested in a fast-paced online multiplayer experience that is equal parts exhilirating and engaging.", "date_posted": "August 8, 2013", "username": "Zarilenth", "num_friends": 11, "num_voted_helpfulness": 1302, "achievement_progress": {"num_achievements_attained": 52, "num_achievements_percentage": 0.4369747899159664, "num_achievements_possible": 119}, "num_groups": 13, "num_badges": 59}

LoL has childish names like Blue Team, Red Team, Minions, Turrets and Inhibitors. Not to mention all the champion names are like that too. Its targeted at 4-9 year olds that recently quit runescape and want a DirectX9 game because their computer is too wooden. These days, easy games attracts NOOBS. Many LoL players used to play Dota but they got wrecked too hard, so they just play LoL, therefore the all the worlds worst gamers are addicted to this no brainer game. Same reason goes why Dota TI players OWN in ranked LoL, but LoL Worlds players cannot even survive in unranked Dota. The gap for the skill requirements for these 2 games is simply uncomparable. Simply amazing how Riot earns millions of $$$$$$$ yet still can't keep their servers functioning. The time it takes to download and install Dota2 is about the same as the time to update LoL. Its true that its a selfish company created for REVENUE ONLY. WTF is $10 for a NAME CHANGE? WTF is $20 for a server transfer?

In Dota 2 is a pure free-to-play game, which means that you don't have to unlock heroes, maps or other stuff. The only way to be good at Dota 2 is to know the game. You need to know every single item and hero to become a really good player. And that's the reason i like this game so much. However, this can be a problem for new players. You don't know anything about the game when you spawn in your base with 4 teammates. So, what is this game all about? Well, you play as one of the 105 available heroes and you have to destroy the enemy base. Sounds easy right? Well, to do that you have to fight your way through towers, creeps and of course the other team. At the start of the game you just stay in your 'lane' and farm and harass enemies by attacking or even ganking them. After this 'laning stage' is completed, your team and the enemy team will face eachother in so called 'teamfights'. After a while, one team will have a large gold and experience advantage, and they will push to the other teams base. And then of course destroy it. Verdict --------- I really enjoyed and still enjoy this game. Dota 2 isn't a pay-to-win game, which makes this game much more enjoyable. Dota 2 also has the best eSports support, you can easily watch a match and select one of the several Broadcasters to make watching eSport matches more enjoyable. The only downside of Dota 2 is the fact that you'll need a lot of knowledge to be good at this game. If you manage to survive all the mean teammates and learn everything about the game, you'll easily spend 200 hours on Dota 2. If not, you'll quit within 20 hours.

Your home is abuzz with laughter, and the smell of fresh baked goods drifts up from downstairs.

You turn to your mother, father, and two siblings and smile; for you know that your adventure into opening your gift is about to begin. You go to open your unwrapped box, and BWONG.. A horn bellows, deafening you.

Your mother tuts and scolds him, for being out of position. The dwarf darts under the tree, looking for a hole in the wall to continue his pursuit of rat-DOTA. \"Gank him,  blyat!\" your father roars, as he sits on the couch lazily and watches. You crawl, desperate for your gift of victory over the rat, under the tree, and he continues to elude you. Suddenly, with a flourish, he produces a lighter, and proceeds to methodically burn down your house while muttering \"GG 2 EZ\", and your family sits in the living room muttering \"garbage team\" and \"reported\". Your family home burns down around them, and only you escape the engulfing flames, accompanied by the chortles of the dwarf.

While many other titles label themselves with this distinction, there are often convenience purchases or some form of power available for real money transactions. While Dota 2 has an extensive cash shop, all offerings are completely cosmetic. HUD options, voice packs and character costumes form the basis of a store lacking even an iota of power or convenience for purchase. All gameplay elements are absolutely free and do not require collection or usage of any kind of in-game currency. Once a player has determined that theyre ready to commit to a steep learning curve and potential negative interactions with teammates (Again, learn with friends to reduce this aspect), Dota 2 is incredibly enjoyable and possibly one of the best multiplayer games ever made. Every match is different, and watching perfect team fight execution is gaming art. Players have access to a huge range of hero styles and the interactions between teammates and foes are incredibly diverse. Its twenty to forty-five minutes of gladiatorial bliss, the end result carefully orchestrated from the first enemy tap to the final crushing blow. Dota 2 can be experienced and enjoyed at multiple levels of engagement, and its a title that rewards users for a deep dive. Heavy investment, heavy reward. The barrier to entry isnt quite as bad as it was years ago, but it would be disingenuous to say that the game doesnt have a colossal learning curve. As a free-to-play title readily available on Steam, it offers players a frictionless doorway  but the challenge may be keeping new players interested and willing to commit to the epic journey that is learning, playing, and enjoying Dota 2. The game is in a strong place right now. Its rewarding and sociable like few other games, and despite its vast popularity it still feels like a secret waiting to be discovered. The next few months will be crucial: its currently the best expression of Valves progressive attitude towards players, and if it can continue on that track it describes a future for online gaming that is far more hopeful than the one were used to. Just remember to spend your starting cash, and make sure someone buys the courier. Oh, and when Riki starts showing up in your games, just get some Sentry Wards down and don't run away. Also, you always want a Bottle when in mid-lane, and runes spawn at 0:00 and again every two minutes. Practice last-hitting before you go online. And if you're jungling, memorise where the low-level Creeps are. Actually, you know what? Forget all that.

I've been playing Dota 2 for around 10 years since it was DotA, the Warcraft III custom map and I'll tell you right now there's still a lot of room for personal improvement. This game boils down to far more than individual skill, tactics, and teamwork/cooperation. The author of \"Three Lane Highway\" (see pcgamer.com) has called Dota an \"isometric wizard-em up\" game, and I think it's fitting. There are so many aspects to this game, so many factors that control the outcome that if you try and sit down and list them all it'll take you a couple hours. And you'll still miss some. I have played pretty much every single \"Multi-player Online Battle Arena\" on the market, and no matter how interesting they are or what different elements they try to bring to the gameplay, I always end up coming back to Dota.

Alright, guys, listen. My name is [IG] D[andi] SingSing aka WildDigger1998UA and i will throw some of my wild gameplay suggestions in a game that is totally not corrupted by trends, pro leagues where people play like lobsters on acid (denying your own aegis because you click like a frenzied ape when nothing around is happening) and totally not toxic community where every Ivan, George and PingPongClingClong is a distinguished pro gamer with 200 years of training at Icefrog's monastery of enlightement somewhere inbetween Tibet's asscheeks. Okay, let's go: This riding on cat Mirana chick with face that looks like she just seen a dolphin putting on a condom. Her ultimate allows teammates to get invisibility for given time. Which can, for instance, save your carry+ support who is getting dived by frenzied Bristleback and enemy mid hero with 2 runes up his butt. So just press r - and since they didnt have any dusts - your carry is safe. Haha, no! We can't have any of that! I need more damage on my arrow that i will miss anyway. Plus if my allies are dying, i can just blame them instead of doing anything. If they are russians - just double your blame output. Okay, so we have that hero, Spector, but it doesnt look like this gay guy from Bioware game. So she has ability to move through obstacles and units, has free tons of pure damage (can't be reduced by armor) on every illusion, and map presense with her ultimate that allows her to fight at any given time without leaving her farming spots until necessary, and with high enough agility her illusions can just inflict enough damage so your team can fight freely while you patiently taking your farm. SO WHAT DO WE DO? OF COURSE WE AINT GONNA DO ANY OF THAT: we will get her phase boots because spectral dagger is clearly not enough, we will never ever get free damage on carry, and we get a bloody skill that blocks and returns damage instead (when enemy team has like. ugh, same damage output as yours?and you have no hp yet anyway?). Get vanguard that just doesn't work because of dota 2's RNG programming and then will farm radiance till 50' timemark because expensive aura with item's green damage that doesnt work on illusions (even though aura does work and can do a lot of good things, like blocking enemy's blink dagger that will be blocked by your ult in a second anyway) is clearly better than stat-gain or mana-burn. Okay, so we have that orange bird guy, that can hold solo lane against 2 or 3 people with minimum deaths (except some specific combos that just screw up his escape) and set of abilities that allows to eviscerate enemy team if your allies have at least ANYTHING to hold them in place. What are we gonna do with this hero, you may ask. Of course we will put him on a support role and make him buy mekansm, so he would never have any mana for his high damage dots that also have ridicilous slow debuff and ult that is easily countered only like by ten heroes out of 150. We have Mirana without ultimate to go get all this exp, remember? Alright, these situations are obviously too situative, so we will talk about global scale meta: Let's get to most obvious question: what hero should we pick? The answer is - PUDGE. You need mid - you pick PUDGE. You need support - you pick PUDGE. You need offlane, jungler, roamer, carry, social worker, girlfriend, president of the united states of 'Murrica? - Just pick Pudge. Why? Because someone did that on twitch.tv, you silly noob cheekyscrublord. You, of course, have same skill as pro players so you can just mimic them and game will be magically won! You don't need to think about anything, just buy recommended items and blame your teammates if something is wrong. You got a motherflipping DRAGONCLAW HOOK afterall. If you bought an item that is worth of 3 years of your school lunchboxes - nobody will have enough guts to argue with your divine skill in pressing q button at cursor location to lasthit a creep (mute everyone at the start of the game just in case tho). Next important issue is map presense, lane control, creep control, ability to analyze situation, counter-warding and all that important elements of this pseudo-strategical map game. For all of that just remember these two lines: \"BUY WARDS\" \"WHERE THE GANG\" (it is important that you will never type \"gank\" properly). This is basically all you need to know about this game. Remember: its not important to win! It's the whole competetive spirit and sportsmanship that matters! Everyone has around 50% winrate anyway because of matchmaking, and ELO system in rankeds is based on wizard-science and tarot-fortunetelling (it's supposed to work only in chess anyway). Yeah, developers may tell you their rating system is not based on elo, but can Volvo really pull off their own mathematic rating model for the game that after all these years still lags when someone is picking a hero, armor rating still doesnt work properly, and hero with 320 movespeed can chase down and kill hero with 350 because of model animation? Oooh i think not. Anyway i give this game 100 dirty apes out of 100 and encourage you to start playing as fast as possible, to join in most viral addiction the world ever saw since taking heroin rectally, poping polyethylene packages or throwing water filled condoms out of the window became a thing.", "date_posted": "October 25, 2014", "username": "MightyHonk", "num_friends": 222, "num_voted_helpfulness": 0, "achievement_progress": {"num_achievements_attained": 8, "num_achievements_percentage": 0.4, "num_achievements_possible": 20}, "num_groups": 6, "num_badges": 40}

I'll keep it brief. Dota 2 is probably the most frustrating game ever created. Your team will let you down constantly, the enemy team will consistently pick the heroes you hate playing against the most, you will never get the hat drops you want, and your own mind and body will frequently betray you and make you contend with the fact that you are not nearly as good as you think you are (or, more likely, force you to live in a fantasy dream world where you are as good as you think you are and just blame your teammates some more). It'll turn you into a monster and destroy your life. It'll murder your loved ones and feed them to you. But you'll play it anyway. You'll ragequit and uninstall and stare at your library of games as the creeping realization sweeps over you that you not playing Dota 2 will not effect the universe in even the smallest way, will have no conceivable effect on anything. You will be filled with a sudden dread that nothing you do matters and life has no meaning. Basically the same feeling you get when you play Dota 2. And Dota 2 will be your only distraction from this dessicated husk of a life. So the next day you'll find yourself drawn back into it like a moth to a flame, staving off the moment when you'll have to face your demons for as long as you can. You will probably die alone some day and nobody will remember how high your MMR was or your sunstrike accuracy. So what are you waiting for, you worthless peons?! Get out there and dance!

Sound: 9.5/10 All heros have a multitude of voice lines,and some even respond to one another (e.g Tidehunters hatred for Kunnka). If you find the default anouncer not too flash, theres a huge variety of optional packs, from the smoth talking Narrator from bastion, to the harsh condescending tone of Pyrion Flax.

Dota 2 is basically a game based around teamwork, except the community only does three things. 1. Call each other f*gs and berate one another for slightly foolish decisions. 2. Do solo farm and try to win the match by themselves (which never works, ESPECIALLY if they are playing against a team of 5 players in a party, also known as a five stack.) 3. Make fun of, and ruin everything for, new players. If you want to learn how to play Dota 2, you either need a really good guide, or a good friend who has more than 500 hours into the game. The tutorial just teaches you the basics. No, you can't learn by yourself by playing matchmaking with random people. All you'll learn from the other players is that you suck because you're new and don't understand any of the tactics, and that the best course of action would be to uninstall. There's also the fact that some people create new Steam accounts so they can be matched up against newbies and annihilate everyone. Also, this game stole all my friends. We used to play other games, now they play nothing other than Dota 2 and one of them has spent $40 in the game... ON SKINS! COSMETIC ITEMS THAT ADD NOTHING TO THE GAMEPLAY! YOU CAN BUY SOME OF THE BEST GAMES ON STEAM FOR LESS, I REPEAT, LESS THAN $40! AND THEN HE TOLD ME HE ONLY PLAYS DOTA BECAUSE HE CAN'T AFFORD ANY GAMES ON STEAM!!! So there. Terrible community, steals your friends, incredibly addictive for some people. Don't touch this game. I spent way too much time hating myself while playing this. Never again. EDIT: 172 people read this review. Wow. Also, I have to say, I think the in-game tutorials are better than the actual game, because the actual game has only one map, unlike the tutorials. I know this is pretty standard for MOBA games, but for me this contributes greatly to actually ruining variety and fun in the gameplay. It's just all the same tactics over and over on the same map. This doesn't only mean less variety, but it also means that veterans will know the game just that much better. On another note, this game is like the opposite of everything I like about TF2. Unbalanced classes (According to Google, every Dota hero/champion/class/whatever the hell is overpowered), only A SINGLE MAP, relies too much on teamwork when it's hard to find online (whereas TF2 benefits from teamwork, but still, it's not the key to winning a game, and it's much easier to achieve teamwork, because TF2 doesn't rely NEARLY as hard on your early-game. The early-game in Dota literally either makes or breaks the whole game for you, setting the outcome of the match in stone almost literally during the first ten minutes of the game.), and also, a horrible community. Not saying TF2's community is good, but hell, it's miles above Dota. Don't really know why I am comparing this game to TF2, maybe because Valve made both games, but still, just wanted to throw out there some actual criticisms about the game itself and not the community. Now, some people have been telling me \"Pfft, just block the trash talkers\". That doesn't change anything. They're still horrible at teamwork, which, like I said, is the entire point of the game. And if you block them, you can't coordinate with them. Basically, it's not only a bad game for new players because you suck, it's also a bad game for new players because everyone else sucks. Except for Koreans, whenever you see one in a game, bam, you already know his team has won. Overall, I think Dota, nay, the whole MOBA genre, has great potential, but it's just too bad I've yet to see any game in the genre actually achieve to fulfill it. EDIT 2: I just came back to this game and tried it out again the hopes that maybe it has gotten better. No. There's still absolutely no communication between the players except for casual pings here and there. Seriously. There are tonnes of balancing issues in the game, and the one character that stands out the most is Sniper. He has good abilities and does real good damage at a real fast rate if you play the game right. He can easily annihilate two to three heroes by himself later on in the game. Frankly, he is cheap, and it is incredibly easy to kill steal with him. Valve is a company structured in a way that, if you're employed there, you don't really NEED to do these things. You don't NEED to patch bugs from a game. You don't NEED to fix balancing issues. At Valve, the employees' primary concern is getting recognition. If you add something that looks cool, you're gonna get recognition. If you're going to fix something, you're not, because you're not showing off your creativity or imagination. You're doing an important job to ensure that the product works as intended. No-one cares for that, give me more cosmetics. There's also the kill stealing. Now, you get much more experience and gold, as well as the kill credit, if you actually deliver the killing blow. Yep, just the last hit, no questions asked. It doesn't matter if you've reduced someone from full to 1% health and someone from your team pops out of nowhere to take the kill credit and leave you with a measly amount of gold and little experience. A lot of players hate these kill thieves, but you know what? That's exactly what this game encourages. To screw other players over. Couldn't, say, the gold and experience be divided equally between the two players based on the damage they did? Nope. Instead the players are forced to hate each other and if you are an actually fair player who doesn't want to rely on these cheap tactics, you'll be behind in the game. What is this, Defense of the Capitalists? I mentioned that one friend spent $40 on items in DOTA 2. I actually played this game with him again, and he has spent about, well... $300 on the game. That's enough to buy 4 copies of GTA V here in Australia. He was also recently hacked and had $200 worth of items stolen from him. That's what you get when you blatantly overprice some items and drive the game's economy into the ground. Refer to the previous joke on capitalism. Now, the worst part of this game, in my opinion, is the long matches. Matches usually take anywhere between 30 to 50 minutes. The longest I've seen is 70 minutes. You're not going to have time to go to the toilet (people with indigestion beware, I bet Valve is in on a conspiracy to make profit from increased adult diaper sales), you're not going to have time to eat, you're not going to have time to speak to people while playing the game or do little chores around the house that you're parents need you to do because you're impatient), and if you're gonna get addicted to the game, like a lot of people are, you're not gonna have time to have a life. See: my Russian cousin. It also really sucks that when your early game sucks, you're going to be stuck in a losing match where you know you've lost and all your team is doing is delaying the inevitable. It's not enjoying to lose, and if you quit at that point,THE CONSEQUENCES WILL NEVER BE THE SAME!!! LITERALLY!!! The more you abandon games (doesn't matter if the game crashes on you or if you have a slow internet connection and the entire thing stopped working or if you have a really slow connection and it messes up and boots you out of the game or if you have a slow computer, like my $300 friend, and your entire computer crashes and you can't get back in the game), the more you will be punished. So, on your first few abandons, you will get low priority matchmaking games (low priority games are pretty much like the normal priority games ON STEROIDS! So, more insults, less teamwork, more s, more kill steals). Then, as you keep abandoning games, the punishment gets more severe each time. The amount of low prio games you get for abandoning never goes down. This game would be much better if it was made by communists", "date_posted": "October 24, 2014", "username": "AndreyKva the British Chaps", "num_friends": 20, "num_voted_helpfulness": 0, "achievement_progress": {"num_achievements_attained": 2, "num_achievements_percentage": 0.06666666666666667, "num_achievements_possible": 30}, "num_groups": 18, "num_badges": 4}

You are going to die alot and probably yell at your team mates but that's just the nature of this game. Dota 2 takes place in an arena where you will fight to destory the enemies Anicent if you destory it; you win. The Ancient is protected by 11 stuctures called towers that protect it. Each of these towers are found in each of the three lanes bottom, middle and top. You take control of a unit that is a hero, many of them are diverse and have a lot of pros and cons such as Crystal Maiden who is really good at locking down heros early game with her stun but she is also the slowest hero in the game. You are accompanied by 4 other players including yourself to fight against another 5 players. You need to push lanes to be able to destory the enemy towers in each lane but the catch is the enemy team is doing the same thing, so you need to not only push to your victory but to stop the enemy team from pushing aswell. There is 107 heros in Dota 2 out of the 112 heroes that are in the Warcraft III. They are categorised into 3 groups. Strenght, which are usually the tanky guys. Agility, most carries are found in this category and Intelligence which most of the supports are usually found. All these heroes have different skill levels, such as Invoker who is an intelligence hero with 14 spells. He is able to create spells with 4 of his spells, creating the other 10. He is able to create tornados which disable enemies, meteors which looks epic and burns enemies that stand in front of it. Just an all round crazy hero. Viper is arguably the easiest hero which as 2 passive spells (Passive spells are spells that work all the time, you don't need to activate them) and 2 other spells which are targetable. You can customise your Dota experience with annoucer packs which change the voice of the annoucer which include Glados and the narrator from the Stanley Parable. You can change your HUD to different themes. The game allows you to buy tickets where you can support tournments, some of these tournments allowing you to directly contribute to the prize pool. Most of the time it is 25%. In 2014, The International is a annual tournment created by Valve for Dota 2. In 2014, the prize pool for this tournment became 10.9M dollars. First place got 5M dollars! If you are into ESports then this game will be up your ally. Dota 2 is a hard game, but if you look in the right places you are able to learn a lot, if you aren't sure you want to play this game, you can PM me and I can teach you how to play.

It feels gratifying when you win. It feels frustrating when you lose. In DotA 2, you will lose alot whether you want it or not. What matters in this game isn't your hero or this pointless 'counter picking'. Your performance is solely dependant on skill, experience and reaction time. However, no matter how good you are, defeat is inevitable with a bad team. At the beginning when you're matched with new players such as yourself, this can be quite infuriating and almost made me stop playing after approximately 10 hours. That's why I strongly advise you to play with friends, so you actually have a coordinated team. About the game itself: It's a solid MOBA [en.wikipedia.org] with a big diversity of unique heroes. The majority of the community is quite unpleasant at times and isn't very beginner-friendly which can be really off-putting. If you ignore these people (a.k.a. muting) and just keep doing your thing, you will find yourself genuinely having fun after ~50 hours. 50 hours sounds kinda extreme but it really isn't.

Within a few days, however, you'll feel an urge to play it. You're going to watch videos of pro people teaching you how to play, and you're going to think that now you're really good. You're wrong. Over time, however, things will get better, and you'll actually start winning. Then, you start losing again, but this time it's not your fault; it's your teams fault. Always remember that NOTHING is EVER your fault. Your dumbass anti-mage was complaining that you were stealing his farm, but it's your farm dammit! Then pudge is getting butthurt about losing lane because he never had a flying courier, when the real reason he lost is because he didn't give you unit control when you are clearly a better pudge! Meanwhile the enemy team is getting fed because your teamates never backed you up when you blitzkrieged in 1v5, and they even have the nerve to question your methods! Then you notice that your dumbass anti-mage is in the jungle farming because \"he couldn't farm in lane.\" You know, however, that he is just a noob. Eventually the enemy is pushing your tier 3s, and the game is obviously over. This is the time when you give up and sit in base. Ignore the fact that your team has won the last two teamfights and you are starting to catch up, it's better if you just quit now. While you're waiting in base, make sure that the enemy team knows that you are not at fault in your loss. Make sure you type in all-chat \"team noob\" followed up by \"report anti-mage.\" If they ask why you want them to report him, ignore them, if your team has the bodacity to try and defend themseves, repeatedly say phrases such as \"lol ur so bad\" and \"ur just mad cuz you cant play.\" You could also take the alternative route and say things like \"  \" and \"   .\" Yea, the game and communtiy can be a  sometimes, but it's also a super fun game that requires fast paced decision making as well as strategical analysis. Plus, it unifies gamers and conservatives by creating one common hatred: Russians.

This game is like a shower fight between you and another naked man. You're both in a small shower tub trying desperately to shove each other over while at the same time trying not to accidentally touch peens and catch the gay. When you slip over and land painfully on your  the other guy, completely by accident, gets his soap-stained foot into your mouth just as you both realize somebody downstairs is hogging all the hot water. Then one of the guys from downstairs who should be helping you get back up on your feet instead comes into the room and yells at you for stealing all the hot water even though it's the other way around. You're the noob who can't get better at naked shower fights no matter how hard you try, the other guy in the tub is the  from the enemy team who mains bounty hunter, anti-mage, puck, ursa, or some other broken class, and the people downstairs who made you run out of hot water are your teammates getting last hits on what would be your kills and turning them into assists on your end. The guy who comes in from downstairs to yell at you is the teammate who, even though you're farming plenty of creeps and earning plenty of gold and experience from them, insists you're killing them \"the wrong way\" and are therefore an idiot noob. The naked shower fight is also a one-way road: once you jump in, there is virtually no returning. You become enslaved and before long all you'll ever want to do for the rest of your life is play dota. You won't even want to talk to or interact with anyone from the outside world unless they are similarly enslaved, by dota (or LoL). The video game world then slowly proceeds to divide and coalesce into two and only two distinct spheres of existence and reality: people who play mobas, and people who don't. Neither side ever so much as glimpses at the other for the remainder of each of its constituents' entire lives because its masochistic addiction level is insane enough to leave Starcraft and WoW in the dust. If you complain about how slippery the surface of the showertub is, people will just yell at you because you're terrible at the game and don't consult the online guidebook and metagame like they do for every minute, individual step taken throughout the game. If you want to get \"good\", you are unequivocally required to follow the instruction book down to the exact letter even if it hardly makes a difference in-game, if at all. If you do otherwise, you will get yelled at. Every single time without exception. To not get yelled at, you have to assimilate into the formless mass. This is all a part of the self-enslavement process: you won't come back, ever. And within a month you'll find yourself just parrotting the same  people were yelling at you for earlier, because you'll be one of them by that point. And you literally will not return. You'll be doing this for the entire rest of your life and will be speaking it like a language.", "date_posted": "April 6, 2014", "username": "cC Chen, Honkifex Maximus", "num_friends": 146, "num_voted_helpfulness": 0, "achievement_progress": {"num_achievements_attained": 20, "num_achievements_percentage": 0.4444444444444444, "num_achievements_possible": 45}, "num_groups": 144, "num_badges": 28}

In fact, thinking of dota as a game at all is a mistake; games are designed to be enjoyable and fun . Enjoying yourself and having fun is the the lowest priority for those who play dota, (especially for those in low priority.) they prefer instead to stubbornly not enjoy themselves while simultaneously making sure nobody else is having any fun either. Every facet of the game has been finely tuned to reflect the players personality to the point that each decision they make in game is synonymous with how russian they are they conduct themselves in their day to day lives, what kind of attributes they hold in high esteem and strive to emulate in pursuit of bettering themselves becoming the transcendent doto master they know they're destined to be. Although it seems at first to be a team game of 5v5, this is a very shallow perspective which will correct itself after around fifteen minutes of your first game. Same goes for the goal of destroying the other teams towers, barracks and ancient. These objectives are simply filler while you forcibly and decisively assert your rightful dominance over your team via your mic or hastily written yet crushingly witty remarks in the chat. (don't worry about the other team, they're fighting amongst themselves and don't matter anyway  remember: you're better than your team-mates and it's inconceivable that there's any possibility you did or will ever do anything wrong, regardless of what may be transpiring before your very eyes.) The interface and mini-map should be largely ignored in favour of committing your attention wholly to the chat box, here you can see the current state of the game clearer than anywhere else, it may take a while to understand some of the games many colloquialisms such as ' ' and 'no courier gg my team are  ff', but don't worry if you can't understand, it's not so much about comprehension as asserting your right to say things that don't need to be said and are generally trivial and unhelpful. If you find yourself doing poorly and being shouted at by your team for feeding, don't fret. They are likely jealous of your superior skills and can't understand that they are actually the ones letting you down.

After the release of the original Dota map in 2003, the WarCraft 3 community began producing a long line of Dota spin-offs, sequels and mods (just as Eul, Dota's creator, had used AoS as inspiration for Dota itself), which culminated in the release of DotA: Allstars by Steve \"Guinsoo\" Feak. Allstars would become the most dominant and consistently updated version of all the Dota maps and mods. In 2005, Guinsoo passed the torch to the enigmatic IceFrog, who has been supporting, updating, and shaping Dota ever since. His changes have been the most significant, the most popular (the mod grew more during his time than ever before), and arguably have benefited and enriched Dota as a whole. By 2010, DotA: Allstars became simply DotA, and IceFrog was showing no signs of stopping. Later that year, Dota 2 was formally announced (with its development spear-headed by both IceFrog and Eul, both of its most important \"authors\"; its past and present, alike), entered a semi-closed beta in late 2011, and was finally officially released in mid-2013... and the rest is history. History lessons aside, Dota 2 is a game of uncompromising depth and complexity. Though its gameplay intricacies can appear opaque, arbitrary and incomprehensible at first sight, the way these expansive game mechanics interact with one another when exposed to the element of player imperfection is truly remarkable: over a hundred heroes, each with at least four spell-based abilities and all capable of using up to six magical items, from a massive arsenal of over a hundred. Games can last anywhere from 25 to 55 minutes, and possibly far more! Dota's metagame is constantly shifting, and as of writing the game and mod are at total parity through version 6.80, released earlier this year. On top of that, it is completely free to play, with no features locked out to any players whatsoever. Not even cosmetic items, which form the backbone of the game's vast micro-transaction-based economy: these items are freely distributed by Valve to all players through level-based gift drops and random-chance item drops. Free game updates alter the game balance significantly, while introducing new seasonal game modes, and far more. And that's not even scratching the surface of the game's competitive scene, with its many tournaments, its constantly evolving teams and its own storylines, all leading up to the annual Valve-organized grand championship: The International. It may be incredibly difficult and frustrating at first, but given time, patience, simple memory and a keen mind, anyone can ultimately come to see Dota as perhaps the most enjoyable, enthralling and captivating game experience ever conceived.

Mix in 1/4 cup confectioners' sugar, vanilla extract, and salt; mash mixture together until mixture looks like a slightly crumbly cookie dough. 3. Moisten your fingers with a little water and press dough into bottom of prepared baking dish. Use a fork to prick holes all over the crust. 4. Bake crust on center rack in the preheated oven until crust edges are barely golden brown, 22 minutes. 5. Beat eggs and egg yolks together in a bowl; whisk in white sugar and 2 tablespoons flour until smooth. Add lemon juice and lemon zest; whisk for 2 minutes. Pour lemon custard over crust. 6. Bake on center rack until custard is set and top has a thin white sugary crust, 25 minutes. Let cool completely before cutting into bars. Dip knife into very hot water, run around the edge, and cut into 16 squares. Dust cookies with 1 teaspoon confectioners' sugar.

Your teammates will cater the enemy team, not back you up, and refuse to call missings or place wards. The enemy team will always pick combos or  heroes that will make you want to immediately leave the game while your teammates pick 4 carrys after you randomed Phantom Assassin and tell you to buy the wards. Every other game you will get a Russian Pudge picker that feeds 3 kills mid in 5 minutes and immediately ruins all the work you've done last hitting every creep and harassing the enemy out of lane. You'll rage and call \"GG\" early and trash talk your teammates but you'll still keep playing in hope that the game will turn around. As things start to finally look good, you get bashed 5 times in a row by a faceless void or the Ogre Magi will get a 4x multi-cast on you 2 times in a row while the Nature's prophet is pushing your top barracks. But after all the rage inducing pain, you keep playing. You suffer through it for the chance of that amazing, satisfying comeback even though you're 20,000 gold behind the enemy team. Only to have your dreams crushed when the enemy team finally kills your ancient. But you still keep playing due to the feeling you get when you get that rampage that allows you to push to victory. Even so, after the game you'll still rage because of the common chest you get as a reward for your 60 minutes of pain and suffering. When you finally get that mythical you've always wanted, valve will come out with an event that lowers the price and makes it almost worthless. It's a drug that once hooked to, is almost impossible to break. You almost don't even realize you're raging and forget that you're telling your best friend how much of a feeding  he is and how this lost game is because of him when you're the one who has 1 kill and 13 deaths. You keep playing in hope that you'll get good enough where you'll be able to play with Dendi or the other pros and you know that'll most likely never happen but you keep playing in hope of it happening one day.

And with this horribly broken matchmaking I see no sane reason to play this game anytime soon. And because Icefrog and the his devs ignorance about the EU servers turning to s'hit because of russians, who select english on purpose because their own servers on East is unbrearable with the horrible people who mostly feed and rage in their games, talking smack all the time. Now don't misunderstand, this is a great game with huge potential. But the truth of it is it's rotten from the bad matchmaking and somewhat horrid and lack of brain community. Main reasons not to play this game goes undisputed as follows: 1# Russians ruining games, talking russian when they clearly selected english as the preferred language. In case anyone hasn't noticed dota is a team game. 2# Solo queue has been removed(this means that you can be matched against an enemy 5 stack when you are playing alone) 3# No real community Q&A support from developers, and complete ignorance on the game dev forum, mods deleting posts that's not deemed \"worthy\" even though there is issues surrounding the topics. 4# Ranked is viritually a joke in comparison to normal MM, the only difference is a number for self gratification purposes, It viritually means nothing when most MMR's you are still playing with complete '. 5# Broken Solo-Queue. At times, matches you whether you are alone or 2 players playing together, you will often or not(depending on your luck) you will be matched with an enemy full 5 man team communicating in game, while your team is just 2+2+1 or just all solo players. This creates a huge disadvantage at the start of the match. Now Valve, has it ever occured to you in the small strains left of what corporate moral fiber you have that you should fix Dota 2's blatant community issues? Is this really how you get out of your responsibilities by ignoring and deleting users expressing concern in a non-inflammatory way? It's shameful considering how much of a profit you're making on it. At least you'd have the dignity to give us something back no? I've personally almost quit this game two times because I can't handle the community and players I am matched with constantly, they don't speak my language, share my mindset or my skill level the least, except an actual good match on some occations.

In the early 2000s, when I had a lot of free time, Quake 3, Elite Force, Jedi Knight 2, et cetra all took up a ton of my time; but as my age progressed, I had less time to dedicate to gaming. Mass Effect 1 and 2 both took about 100 hours away from me; but that was probably the most I'd invested in many years. I currently have around 500 hours of Dota 2, and don't plan on stopping anytime soon. The gameplay is spectacular, the community is great (I have made more Steam friends on this game than any other), the meta is interesting, the professional scene is a blast to watch, and the game is extremely well supported - especially with the recent Wraith Night/Legion Commander content update. The thing is that I'm not great at Dota 2. I've put almost 500 hours in, and there's still more for me to learn - there are still some heroes I have yet to play! It is a lot of investment, but once you 'get' it, you will have an absolute blast. EDIT: Just updating this now that I've put around 1600 hours in. I still completely stand by everything that I said previously. The game is super fun, and I'm really enjoying playing with all of the friends I've made in it. I've also experienced some of the negative parts of the community, and they're unfortunate; but I must say that they are far and few between.

If you are a newbie to this kind of genre or this game in particular, think carefully about getting into it. Not just because it's very hard to get the basic right, but also it will slowly consume your life. Look at the average player spending their time in this game. Look at my record. GG. No refund on your life spent. Legal addiction. Despite all this, you should enjoy the game once everything's in place. This game, hands down, gives the best feeling of victory ever. As well as the worst feeling ever if you get to play with stupid people in your team. This game requires skill and teamwork. The more you play the better you are. It would be ideal to play with your friends. So it's easier to work together as a team. Solo is a bit of a gamble. The community is toxic. If you can't deal with something like this, you should avoid it. This is quite normal in competitive games. Victory matters, you know? There is a mute option too. On the racist part, some people are branded as noobs depending on the region. Russian on EU. Pinoy on SEA. You will encounter different kinds of bad words, again, depending on the region. Some examples are , tangina, pota, bobo, gago, lanjiao, sohai etc. I know all of them including the meaning. See? Play dota 2 for free language course. Being russian or pinoy doesn't mean you are a noob. You should see this more as a joke. There are pro russian and pinoy players. Some rank really high. No need for it to be high bracket, some can play well. So it doesn't mean that it's untrue. It's just true to some extent. The game is free-to-play. But you would eventually buy cosmetic items for your heroes anyway. Similar to CS:GO, for some items, the price can be ridiculous. GL HF. Don't forget to blame people unreasonably if your team starts losing.

The two is not to refer to the game being a sequel, which it is, but rather to specify the number of ancients in a game. The objective is to turn it into Dota 1. In Dota, you need to defend an ancient, which is either a tree or a rock depending on your religious affiliation. Since I'm one and two-thirds Bhuddist, I usually end up defending one of them at random, much like all the other players. Dota is a very unique game, in that includes both offense and defense. There are lots of characters, and all of them are mostly good at different things. In my opinion, the best part of Dota is playing it. This is because Dota is an extremely unique combining many difficult strategies, such as attacking the enemy team's Ancient or defending your own Ancient. The goal of Dota, much like other games, is to win. If you become proficient at this skill, you will win very often, leading to more victories. Scientists show that six out of every three Dota players that win matches tend to be on the winning team when the game is over. This is because winning substantially increases your chances of not losing. Dota takes a while to learn though, and that is because it is an extremely offensive, yet defensive, game with many complicated nuances, like being a farmer or trying to help your teammates do good. One interesting feature of Dota is that dying is really bad, in the sense that you lose money and time because respawns are really long, like when Halo 3 would just beep at you instead of spawning you and you'd get really angry, except this is an intentional feature intended to spice up the classic innovation of offfense vs. defense vs. offense. Why did I write a third position in that last sentence? Excellent question. There are neutral enemies in the game, and they usually don't do a whole lot except sit there and be neutral. If you don't respect their space, however, you may find that they beging to fight back, much like an offensive form of self-defense. Early in a match of Dota, you find yourself buying useful items like tp scrolls, also called Town Portal Scrolls, or Town Portal Scrolls for short. Why did I mention Town Portal Scrolls multiple times? Good question! That is because there are multiple teams. Once you've bought items, you go kill enemy creeps, and they aren't people so it's ethically sound and completely morally fine to do. :) Once you've spilt some blood, or watched as they comically struggle to kill each other for your favor, you may realize that you have more money and have leveled up. That is because creeps are made of gold stitched together by experience and points, and that usually transfers to you after they die. Think of it like inheritance or maybe a n involuntary tribute system. Once you've levelled up and gotten rich, you can buy better items that make you stronger, and then get new abilities like skills, active abilities, passive abilities, or passive-aggressive abilities. These abilities let you hurt creeps and other palyers more effectively, which may or may not be socially acceptable in your region of birth. Please refer to local ethic codes and statutes to determine whether victory is a viable gameplay style for you in your chosen country of choice. Once you've become the best all-around person you can be, or at least made some incremental progress down that road that usually takes about an hour on average, (resets between games, so you never get bored) it's time to go tear down the other team's towers (those, like many buildings in the united states, canada, or certain US territories, will fight back and damage you) and then eventually go and destroy their Ancient, which is what the A stands for in Dota. That makes your team the winner, and implies that you are better people in a metaphorical sense than your enemy team counterparts.", "date_posted": "November 12, 2013", "username": "Ibitsu", "num_friends": 55, "num_voted_helpfulness": 39, "achievement_progress": {"num_achievements_attained": 23, "num_achievements_percentage": 0.34328358208955223, "num_achievements_possible": 67}, "num_groups": 2, "num_badges": 7}

These two games have brought out a racist side in me that I never thought existed.

As you can see, I've only played 50 odd hours of this game at the time this review was made, but if I had to add at least ONE positive note to this review, its this. I've mananged to learn russian in only a few hours, grasping the most important phrase, \" blyat\". This phrase runs through my mind, every day of every minute. I sometimes even say it to myself in my head IRL when I see someone doing something moronic.

While most of the friends I play with play LoL, I quit that in order to seek refuge from the spanish epidemic there is over there, but instead, have been sucked into this South America/Russian racism simulator wasting most of the extra money I have on steam to buy cosmetic items for heroes I've just played. I never liked history when in school, I hated it, with a passion, just like the Americans with their hatred for the Russians. This game has taught me everything I need to know on why to hate russia, how to hate russia and question the very existance of that country based on the ape like intelligence that I've seen coming from the country.

Here is the reasons. 1)Broken stupid  meta , icefrog's nerfs and buffs. First of all the guy who makes all the balancing things doesn't even play the game itself. IF a hero gets picked too much in the pro scene , icefrog will nerf the  out of that hero and make it unplayable (Exp:Ember Spirit). Or he just buffs a hero like Riki since the day he came in Dota 2 (Riki is generally easy to counter in high skill pubs but he wrecks the  out of new players) and nerf a hero like Crystal Maiden both nerfing her damage movespeed etc. 2)THE ING COMMUNITY+MATCHMAKING (+Russians on English Lang.) AND RANKED Aaand here we are at the best part of Dota , the community... It is filled with immature kids who will rage at you and say stupid  like ''omfg u so noob'' ''learn2play feggit'' ''y u use midas on big creep'' , it's literally cancer for someone sensitive aganist stupidity . Believe me after spending hours and hours inside those people you will slowly become one of them or atleast it will cause depression + anger issues. Ranked system of Dota is just simply broken. There is no difference between a 3.5k player and a 1k player , it is all the same. The points are just there so some  can brag about his non existent 6k mmr lie.(Hell i typed a comment under a vid related to Dota some guy just came in and said he had 6k and you are a ing noob you should kill myself omfg) And the public matchmaking, slightly better than ranked a little bit because 1 out of a KAJILLION BILLION CHANCE you can actually meet with people who are funny and nice to play with (i made a lot of friends like this) but believe me most of the time you pick EU server with ENG language you will get Russians who farm Dagon on CM in hardlane and never communicate with you. You will slightly learn Russian because these guys never speak English even if they know it and since they love to scream in mic (like idi nahuy pidor suka blyat padaroshnik pizdec bla bla bla...) you will instantly learn MOTTHEEERR RRRRUSSIA ACCENT.+Either you will get (Not being racist here , but Dota really does make you racist) Esta muerto mexican fellas , Spanish people on American server (or Russians with 9000 ping). Btw don't ever write guides like I did. I innocently wanted to help the other new players with a few guides about the heroes I know really well. Some Armenian kid called me a  with his poor English. (For telling people to use Midas on the big creep in jungle camps to get a level advantage) 3)Lastly (Because i dont need to say anything more why this game is so piece of ) the ing effects on you... Why do you even want to play this game , it is like eating an apple with 4000 worms inside. Anyways arguing with a Dota player made me realise that this game completely destroys your social life and your ability to think, go try it yourself try to say something opposite to these s... (There is a big ''real life'' world for you to discover out here. Get a hobby instead of playing this.)

Perhaps if he came into the forest and hummed koans with me, and he had done so as the giant, walking tree, then he would see his greater consciousness. All the negative energy would leave his body, and wed share a moment of experiencing our Buddha nature. In my experience, sessions last about 10-20 minutes.

I only recommend you this game if you love MOBAs, but I didn't like MOBAs and now I have 1200 hours in it. I was a COD player, an MW2 player. Of course you will not be ''pro'' in your first matches. To be good you need a lot of training. If you played LoL and you have 30 lvl its sure you know the \"basics\". In this game the most important thing is the \"Last Hitting\" at the start, because if you have more gold and XP than your enemy, you own the game. The game may be boring, but if you have friends it won't be. I think the boring part is the first 13 lvl because you can't play some gamemodes before that. If you are new here you need to complete the training! If you are totally new here completing the training will get you a Sniper set. No the setts doesn't give you any bonus, just the enemy can see how rich you are. These decorative items have degree: Common, Uncommon, Rare, Mythical, Immortal, Old and Arcane. This items can be Normal, Auspicious, Heroic, Cursed and Unusual. So these were the decorative items lets talk about the in-game items! You start with 625 gold each hero have their own item build. I recommend you the Healing Slave, Tango and clarity items, this items will fill your HP or your mana. If you are new or never played that hero before i recommend you the guides (Up left the book icon). I recommend you the GreyShark(RU/UA) builds or Purge(ENG) builds.

Others say that dota 2 is not a good game or a bad game (well we all have our opinions :) ). For me it's the best game of all the time :D. I respect the Lol (league of legends) players. Even though they are saying that dota 2 sucks. Here in my country (philippines) many Filipinos say that they like Lol better. But I really don't get their point I mean (no offense to the Lol makers and producers) but Lol kinda copied dota 1 ( I don't even know if Lol have their permissions or paid icefrog for copying the main idea of dota) but valve paid icefrog for dota 2 so it means valve have their license while Lol doesn't have. I don't really know guys if Lol really have their permissions or paid icefrog. But I think they didn't ask for permissions or paid ( if im mistaken please correct me or you can just tell me to remove this review. And im sorry if im mistaken that Lol really have their permissions or paid icefrog.but i really think they didnt. Well the real point in this paragraph is I will play or follow the one who have permmisions or paid and that is dota 2 or (valve). If your noob or getting annoyed it's OK cause we all started like noobs :) and just ignore the people who are saying that you're noob,stupid,idiot, they will just annoy you and they have no hearts (they are monsters). Anyway for them to easily ignored just press the heroes panel at the upper left of the screen. In there you can see a speaker's icon then press it and wahhla you muted the player you chossed. I hope this really helped you guys :) OK thank you guys for reading my review with this game. I hope you recommend this :) bye.", "date_posted": "August 3, 2014", "username": "Chitoge <3", "num_friends": 103, "num_voted_helpfulness": 38, "achievement_progress": {"num_achievements_attained": 45, "num_achievements_percentage": 0.6, "num_achievements_possible": 75}, "num_groups": 21, "num_badges": 7}

My play time reflects how much time I have spent appreciating the team work and competitive spirit of the game. Supports who actually support the team, carries who can carry the team to victory, and players who can execute a base push as timely as the New York Sunway. By the way, I love subway sandwiches. I eat a BLT without the T almost every week. Bacon is the most delicious meat. Lettuce is like the cup to the tea party. You can't have tea without water, and you can't hold water without cups. Unless of course you use your hands. Or your mouth. But lettuce cups are pretty delicious. So imagine the bacon and the lettuce together but without the disgusting creatures known as tomatoes. Which while they rhyme with potato, don't taste anything similar. If potatoes tasted like french fries, tomatoes would taste like awful fried wet vegetables. Speaking of wet tables, If you put water on tables, it gets wet. Not stuff like multiplication tables that are way too complicated. What is 6X6? Its like 64 or something. Which is like 10 if you add them all together. What does that mean? I am not sure. Math is hard. Unlike DOTA2. Which is a great game. Especially as a carry. Actually I never played carry before. It seems like a pretty easy job though.Just kill things until you win the game. That is a pretty simple job description. Unlike support or mid or offlane or jungle. I mean jungle is a location, how is it a job? It is more like a forest than a jungle. I mean jungles have lions and stuff right? Forests have angry bears. I am not sure where man-birds and horse-men are from though. Horses aren't jungle creatures I think. They sound more like mountain creatures to be honest. I haven't seen a troll before or a gnoll, but I bet they are forest creatures as well too. So jungle should really be called forest. Mid is a pretty self explanatory position. Its the middle of the map lane. Like if you had 3 lanes, he would take the second one. Or she. There are female heroes as well. Are they called heroines? Well I wouldn't want to call anyone a dangerously addicting drug. That would be sexist. I mean playing Lina is pretty addicting though. Fire fire fire fire fire fire fire fire fire fire . Its like if you had a charmander and combined it with a jynx. Thats what lina is. Which reminds me that pokemon recently came out. X and Y are pretty popular with my friends, so I wamt a 3DS. Those things cost money though, but I head I can trade my items for cash. That sounds pretty amazing. Earning money while palying games, its like the American dream for people who don't want actual jobs. Not that I have a job yet. All I do is stay home and read manga. Which is pronounced mane gah, Like mango but with an a. I sometimes forget myself and add a false accent though and pronounce it mahn gaaaa. So offlane is the lane opposite of the safe lane. So the dangerous lane as they would call it. It isn't very safe cause you cross the mystical safety river to fight bad guys. Its like chinese vampires and running water. I don't think they can cross running water. Many they would have a hard time with modern day plumbing. One flush of the toilet and the go poof. Or do they? I actually know nothing about chinese vampires. I only know vampires from the books my friends lent me. It was the Twilight saga. I really preferred the Jacob to the other guy though. I was pretty upset when Bella made the wrong choice. I mean who wouldnt want a guy you could play fetch whenever you wanted. Plus the other guy was like 439434 years old. Yuck! So Support is the last job you can play. Not only do you provide moral support because most teams don't ever have asupport, but you also help buy buying items no one else in their right minds would buy. Like a slave donkey to carry your items for you. He can even be given magical wings for more than his actual buying price. Why wouldn't I want another donkey instead of one flying one? I am pretty sure two donkeys are cooler than one flying one. I mean how would you even catch a flying donkey? It could poop from like 60 feet and it would be awful. Like a divebombing terrible smelling equine terror. But donkeys are pretty cute. So keep them on the ground. If donkeys were meant to fly, god would have evolved them wings instead of using magic. So that is Dota. Its a pretty good game. But it has some problems too. After all, even BLT's have T's. Here are the digusting parts of the BLT. Games take a while to finish. So if you tend to have sudden gas attacks like me, you might have an accident while you are playing a particular game. A game of Dota can last from as long as 30 seconds to 50 hours. Like I am not even joking how troublesome it is to stay on the toiler for over an house to finish my game of Dota. I mean look at my avatar. That is my face for like the first 5 minutes of Dota before my legs fall asleep and I start getting cramps. It also has too many different heroes. I think the game could cut its hero count down to about 7. It would also encourage faster hero picking if the last 3 players couldn't choose any hero. It is a definitely annoying to choose the tree hero and the enemy hero picks an all fire team and the lumberjack hero. You are literally counterpicked because you chose too early. It would be better to give some kind of gold option or a repick option. Some game modes take forever. Like captains draft can be much shorter if they removed all the bans. Sometimes I want to make team electric, but then a ban comes up and I accidentally ban Mr. Thunder or the masked electric emo. Then Team thunder is ruined. I can understand why bans could be good though. Cause everyone chooses fat butcher guy. He uses his hook to hug you then you smell him to death. Sometimes he tickles you for extra damage. What is worse is that he eats you, he gets fatter and stronger. The biggest tomato of the problem is the fact that the game has too much action, but not enough story. Its like worse than Dynasty Warriors when it comes to story. I could use a few cutscenes telling me why I am teaming up with a giant spider, a porcupine, a baby rock, and a angel man. At least there was a reason in Dynasty Warriors 7 about why I am fighting Guan Yu with my hated enemies the filthy Wu. Were those filthy Wu actually even men? The way they fought with their cowardly fire arrows and powerful navy instead of facing the numerically and superiorly led enemy army head on just screams uncultured barbarians. So I think I will give the game a 1/10/14. Its a pretty good game, but the lack of story gives it only a 1 in that category. I understand that every hero has its own lore, but the bigger connection is quite lost when I team up with my biggest rival against my best friend. A 10 grade for the excellent team spirit of the game. People play like men instead of filthy Wu women. But Ali, why the 14 and not a 17? Because the game has that huge tomato. And I hate Tomatoes. I love BLT's without the T. BL is the greatest invention of man, till someone introduced the uncessary T. I would have BL everyday if I could afford it, but I have no job and spend all my time reading manga.", "date_posted": "January 10, 2014", "username": "Tippytoe", "num_friends": 7, "num_voted_helpfulness": 42, "achievement_progress": {"num_achievements_attained": 1, "num_achievements_percentage": 0.029411764705882353, "num_achievements_possible": 34}, "num_groups": 2, "num_badges": 3}

As far as most MOBAs are concerned, this one has a good blend of strategy and relfexes that rewards those who can use both to their advantage. The gameplay is, as a result, solid, and every sessions provides new opportunities for fun and strategy. The UI is a little underpopulated, however, and doesn't explain much. learning how to do some of the functional things, like leaving a game that's safe to leave, or muting people, or reporting people, are not super intuitive: you have to dig. Furthermore, the options available, though very powerful and plentiful, are not explained super well. As a result, it's important to toy around with your settings a bit, which can be a hassle. As far as the F2P model goes, it's pretty fair: you can play the whole game without needing any of the micro transactions. The only thing they do is customize your aethetics, and happily not to an extreme extent. Because of this, the game has a really unified look despite all the different items your characters can wear. This might dissuade people from buying them, because some of the items are barely even visible. Overall, I would recommend this game to anyone with a hankering for a challenge.

I recommend this game to any and all casual gamers, especially fans of light, friendly games and their community, like Club Penguin and 4 ch. an. Also, characters in this game are very easy to learn and their abilities are easy to utilize, allowing easy collaboration with teammates and friends, for example: Meepo the Geomancer is a great character for those new to the game, and I recommend all new players choose him. There's minor drawbacks in useful content though, like certain things are outright useless (like Couriers and Support characters) and they should be removed from the game to make it perfect and this is coming from a long term investor of this game who has dedicated many hours (1337, to be exact) to this extremely fun indie game.

Dota 2 all characters are free so you dont have to waste your time trying to unlock them, the game takes more skill (IMO), characters have a bigger learning curve, the community is not toxic, game allows you to use your mic (You can turn off mic volume in less than a minute), no micro transactions, you can trade item sets (A.K.A Skins), you can combine item sets, you can buy item sets on the Steam market, you can parts of item sets for money. This list can go on for another 2000 words. The game only has one map so the game probably sounds repititive but its not, there is many ways to play the game, such as carry, support, tank, jungler, etc. When you check out this game it probably is going to look boring but definitly check this game out, one of my favorite games.", "date_posted": "March 26, 2014", "username": "Canadian Muffin", "num_friends": 291, "num_voted_helpfulness": 37, "achievement_progress": {"num_achievements_attained": 63, "num_achievements_percentage": 0.3772455089820359, "num_achievements_possible": 167}, "num_groups": 7, "num_badges": 27}

As someone who's been playing Dota since its beginnings, the first thing you may recognize and notice is that many of the games features such as map layout, heroes, and gameplay is almost, exactly the same but with a better and more refined look with updated graphics, making the entire map feel more lively and a refresh of old. Of course, that's all good but at the heart of Dota as many may know is its gameplay and replayability. The amount of hours I've pumped back in the first Dota was unforgettable, clocking more than +2500 hours of time played. Just like Dota 1, Dota 2 shares the exact same formula, pick a hero, last hit creeps/farm up gold, and win team fights to gain victory. Simple and straight forward, right? Wrong. If you played back in Dota 1, you'd come to realize the more you played it, the game had a fairly, high skill requirement in order to do well, especially if you're pushing to be top in a region or tournament. The amount of time and practice makes perfect as you will want to eventually learn every hero, how they synergize and working together with your teammates. It gets rough but extremely fun and satisfying, especially if you're on high level play. Unfortunately though, most people tend to ignore these kinds of games since difficulty is fairly high or they just can't stand to put the effort to actually play the game well and properly, otherwise various issues can occur, such as getting hate from other players and getting reported for not being able to play well. It's an immediate turn off and can easily have people packing their bags and finding another game. Unfortunately, again, this is thanks to the toxic communities that have spawned across all MOBA genre games. You will always have to deal with these kinds of people who will give you  and you have to bare with it as those kinds of players won't be going away anytime soon. I strongly believe competitive games have the highest chance to have ragers compared to other types of games out there and it's tough to avoid the negativity that comes with it. Now with some additions, they've added a store where you can purchase from hero skins, UI skins, to different voices for the default announcer, different couriers and selling/buying through the steam market. The thing that seperates skins here compared to others is that skins come in seperate, armor pieces you can equip on a hero, meaning you can say, keep a helmet and sell the other parts, like gloves to someone else on the steam market. It goes to show how much control the players have and what they have in their hands. The best part of all this, is that all heroes are free right off the bat to everyone, so no need to spend money and unlock the heroes you want to play. It allows us, as the players to explore and see what heroes we enjoy playing the most and if you're into cosmetics, you also have the option to buy a skin. The business model for me personally, is fair and likeable as I've had no issues with it whatsoever, it's equal for both the customer and developer. Now, while the gameplay is still the same and fun at its core, what else has been added by Valve? Well, we now have various events that take from time to time, usually worldwide holidays such as Christmas or Halloween are some examples. These events bring in replay value to want and play the game more such as getting limited skins for heroes, UI skins, couriers or just straight up rare items that can be sold across the entire steam market so you can get some funds put into your wallet for perhaps other items/skins on the market or even just saving up to buy another game entirely from either the steam store or in-game store. They've also made several changes to the UI compared to back in Warcraft 3. The UI is bigger and straight forward, and buying items through the shop are easily seen as everything is now categorized properly, and accessing them with a simple click. It's easily noticeable but just in case, you may have noticed, some heroes have not been put into the game yet and are missing. It's mainly due to copyright issues with Blizzard, seeing as how Brewmaster was a Pandaren from Warcraft and now Valve has changed him to a Koala beast of some sort? In fact, every champion for the most part, have been changed in their appearance because Dota started off by using Blizzard races and even some famous lore characters such as Thrall (Disruptor) or Rexxar (Beastmaster). It's certainly slowed down some heroes from being brought back, the recent being Legion Commander (male to female) and Terrorblade (no longer the demon hunter/Illidan). Valve still has a few more heroes to change and get out, such as Techies, so if you're a big Techies fan and/or mainer, you're going to have to wait a while longer until Valve finally pushes him out. Alright, and now my few personal grips about this game other than having a toxic community as I mentioned earlier throughout these types of games. I just do not appreciate or enjoy the art style that Valve has brought into this game. NOT in terms of quality but art style. The quality is fine for some but most heroes I feel, lost their identity and instead of something different, or unique, Valve just made most of the heroes look ugly and feel uninspired in my honest opinion. I mean now Earthshaker now looks like a mutated version of Beast from X-Men with a mix of a Koala (similar to the new Brewmaster). Hell, I still appreciate Blizzards art style so much more in Warcraft 3 than this new look, look at Pudge and Slardar, they had the look, voice and feel back in Warcraft 3 but now it's just not as strong anymore here. Even the almighty and fearful Zeus doesn't look like an intimidating god anymore, but a scientist. Another thing that I do not find a lot of fun a whole lot anymore is the gameplay itself, yes, the core gameplay. It's literally been the same thing over and over, nothing new or innovative, just a rinse and repeat of picking a hero, farming up gold for items, and winning team fights. Maybe it's just me after playing thousands of hours in this genre or perhaps if you take a look past the gameplay and look at what it really offers, there's really nothing going for it. Last hitting isn't fun anymore, as that's all you're doing most of the time early on, with team fights mid to late game (unless you personally find it fun). The worst part, is you will fall behind if you say die a few times to an opponent carry, it pigeon holds you because now your team has little to no retaliation or chance of hoping to win since that carry will just roll face your entire team and there's a decent chance someone on your team will call you out, meaning more anger and frustration can occur. I can safely say as a long time Dota 1 player/fan, Dota is still fun but it's not fun if you want to play decently at the average level because the amount of mechanics people know in that level will put you in a disadvantage if you just learn a few because most just don't have time to do it. So what can I say, I mean in the end, this is basically Dota 2.0 with better graphics, same gameplay like the original, a few added features like events, and the in-game store associated with the steam market. Everything looks great except the art style for most heroes (personal opinion) and of course, the ease of access to newcomers while it may seem straight forward, it gets more complicated in-depth, meaning there's a harder learning curve and barrier to pass through to fully enjoy the game at its fullest, meaning you'll need to spend some time and practice.", "date_posted": "April 10, 2014", "username": "Treantwuver", "num_friends": 126, "num_voted_helpfulness": 23, "achievement_progress": {"num_achievements_attained": 8, "num_achievements_percentage": 1.0, "num_achievements_possible": 8}, "num_groups": 28, "num_badges": 50}

This is the first Valve game where I haven't had fun at playing it and made me question their work. After a year of gameplay I can easily say that if you don't play it with friends you can end up with a brain tumor or end up in a nuthouse. You need to play it with friends because it's the only way to enjoy the suffering. The artstyle and voices are great, but the gameplay can be a little tricky and it can go unbalanced very easily. The only time where I found the gameplay balanced was in the Greeviling because everyone was in the same level. But the gameplay it's not the biggest issue with this game. The community it's REALLY toxic and Valve itself suffered this recently. They are equal or worse than the CoD community. The only good thing about this game is the business model. The big difference between Dota 2 with TF2 and CS:GO it's that those games gives you fun and money. This game only gives you money. No matter if you win or you lose a match, you will always end up with the same bitter taste. I only recommend this game for those who lost their minds or just want to make a couple of bucks to buy another game.

I quit, that's the long story short. Wan't a long story long? Well... read ahead then my dear no-lifer (says the one that spends time writing game reviews in Steam)! So... where should I start? Of course... from the start! A friend of mine invited me to play this \"Super badass game\" with him and after days and weeks of pleads I finally bent to his will. Entered the game, all felt fine. He was a pro player and guided me through it. I am also a sharp person that never does anything if he's unprepared so I read a few tons of guides from DotA legends and watched plenty of tournament videos before my first game. I started high above all the newbies and my lerning curve was quite fluent. This means I rarely got to deal with raging idiots, though rarely is not the same as never. Even I that played at a higher level than my matches got raged at from time to time. Imagine how a normal player felt... brainless, super confident brats keep yelling at everyone they don't like (even if he is playing well) that he is terrible and should uninstall the game. Heck, the best guide ever writen for the game starts with a description on how to mute players and how to shield your psych... So yeah, nail number one in DotAs coffin: The terrible playerbase. Yeah, there are some nice guys that survived but their numbers are rapidly dwindling and honestly... even the kids at LoL are nicer these days! Well... DotA could have still sprung out of it's coffin if that was all... but it isn't. Things like the terribly broken matchamking system count as well. Even if you rock you can hardly progress through the ranks and as gamers say \"Leave the trench\". Since all depends on your partners and you mostly get raging kids and game-abandonig russians (no racism, simply plain facts and statistics, hell I'm a fan of Putin!), you will never be able to roll up enough wins to play with skilled people. Yeah... Valve says it's fair and it doesn't rank your wins/losses but your overall performance in the game... but... yeah, you guessed it, that's pure ! The heroes... See, the game has this goat fella named Riky that is wrecking public games because of his easy-to playiness and he is overpowered as hell to any unexperienced player (yeah, good ones can counter the  out of him with plenty of heroes). So... instead of getting this guy nerfed (reduce his stats) he is getting boosted with every update. Same goes for plenty of heroes which ruins the game. The balancing of heroes and skills is being lost gradually over time and lately, if you see a certain hero in a team on a pub game you know he will win (and yeah, only jerks pick such... but that's almost all the players you'll meet!). Other heroes that are so fragile and weak like the poor crystal maiden which gets killed 50 times per game are getting nerfed instead... And another nail goes in. I can keep this up for quite a bit but I realise readers are dropping off from the review like mosquitoes near \"Raid\" with every line I add so lets cut it here and shoot the word: The game is duying and unless it gets a restart it will keep degrading. Don't bother... you lose a lot of time playing it, matches take ages at times, no one pauses for you if your mom gets a blackout next to you... well either help her or lose the game... you see? It's not a good game to play, you won't learn russian (apart from swears)... you wont get smarter (quite the opposite)... you wont make cash unless you sacrifice your whole life to play professionally. You pour so much nerves, time and effort in this game and you get nothing apart from a few and far between games where you actually match with good guys who pick normal heroes and don't spam the mic with swears. Well the game isn't a  as someone who is on a rage spree might claim... it's a decent one but it's not worth it: I would mark it as a 4.65/10 (yeah, indeed: 4.65... what a nice number) and advice you against playing it.

Audio and video are incomparable. There were cube, cross in the older version, but in everything's smooth in new version. I mind the looks of some heros (sorting by race), but I used to it. Though what I miss from the older version is graphical visualization of objects, which was glowing out of them (aura, colors). But sound messages are just wonderful! Control, choice of using spells, items ... it's up to player, also like graphics and sounds. Great benefit is that you don't have to download and search maps, there is automatic update and synchronization. I give a big plus for buying, gaining of trading items. It's just huge jump and movement in this game. Who was devotee of the older version, he will also fall in love with this one. I recommend for 100%. Rating: 10/10 Slovak Review Bol som fanikom a hrom DOTA ''1'' a som i novej verzie DOTA 2. Audio a video s nezrovnaten. V starej verzii boli ''kocka, krik'' v novej ve pekne vyhladen. Trochu mu vad na poniektorch herov vzor (rozdelenie poda rasy), ale to som si u zvykol. o mi avak chba z prvej verzei je grafick vizulizcia predmetov, ktor z nich vyarovala (aury, sfarbenia, ...). o sa tka hlok: ,,S uasn!'' Ovldatenos, vber pouvania spellov, itemov, ... je na hrovi, taktie ako grafika i zvuky. Obrovksou vhodou je nesahovania a nehadanie mp, ale automatick aktualizcia a synchronizcia. Vek plus dvam i kpu, zskavania i trejdovania itemov. Proste obrovsk skok a posun v tejto hre. Kto bol zarytcom do starej verzie, tak isto si zamiluje i tto nov. Odporam na 100%.

While Dota 2's gameplay might seem daunting at first, it's one of the best and more engaging ever seen in a game, and learning it is just one of the reasons why this game is addicting. Other games such as League of Legends end up falling short because their devs decided to cut much from the original formula, but Dota 2 kept it intact, and makes sure you learn something new everyday. Not only the core game is strong, but also the eSport scene surrounding it is amazing and growing, with several tournaments going on, including Valve's own The International.

You have a selection out of 108 unique heroes, each with a unique skillset. Every hero is also available from the minute you start. No playing X amount of games before this hero becomes available. The object of Dota 2 is to destroy the other teams Ancient. To do this, you can work your way down any of the 3 lanes (Top, Mid or Bottom) by destroying the outer towers. Youll start most matches pairing up or going into a lane solo trying to get some experience and gold by last hitting creeps. As the game progresses, youll start teaming up more with your other team members to take on the other team or to quickly kill of a solo member of their team. Because of the importance of coordinating your attacks with other team members, communication is a very important aspect of the game. I therefor also recommend playing this game with some friends because random people that youll be teamed up with wont always show the same willingness to communicate. If youre just starting out playing Dota 2, I also recommend playing with a friend who already has some experience in the game because the learning curve is very steep, especially when you have to figure everything out by yourself. The skill ceiling is also extremely high. So every time you play, you might learn something new. Due to the high number of available heroes, skills and items, you can be sure that every game is unique. Something to be wary of is the community. There are people out there that take this game way more seriously than you might. Most players have an opinion of what you should have done in a certain situation and will be happy to blame a lost teamfight on you not taking that action. Flaming is something that could happen often. But if youre playing with a team entirely made up of your friends, this shouldnt prove to be an issue. If this is not the case, dont worry. You can always mute the players that are causing you grief and continue enjoying this wonderful, team oriented game.", "date_posted": "September 29, 2014", "username": "[CARE] MrMountains", "num_friends": 123, "num_voted_helpfulness": 19, "achievement_progress": {"num_achievements_attained": 23, "num_achievements_percentage": 0.1377245508982036, "num_achievements_possible": 167}, "num_groups": 23, "num_badges": 38}

How to Train your Dragon 2 is a story of a young Shaggy Rogers discovering the wonders of \"Sandwiches\" for the first time with the Rottweiler he owned before Scooby. Our protagonist, a rebellious socialist who never came to grasp the true meaning of Republican Motherhood, is a frequenter of the parks, motivating the homeless by promising them peace and beating them until they promise to get a job or preaching to the innocent picnickers about the evils of animal cruelty. A subtheme of gun control is dished out discreetly as the script writers encourage us to do better than what game theorists think we are capable of with flawed moral consciences. In the same way viewers are assured that we have learned from the days of the arms race by subtly bringing up the Marilyn Monroe-JFK scandal. Obnoxious and unorginal, the production draws content heavily from the movies E.T. and Avatar, indicating that it could have been funded by a collective effort between PETA, James Cameron, the public health institute, Heidi Fleiss, and Joseph Stalin. In the end, the main character's tyrannical liberal-minded father boards a boat to Russia under heavy artillery fire by social darwinists, portrayed as defiant and unruly teenagers that want nothing but an end to civilization.

But I will say the following generic things: Dota2 is not a simple team game. There are a huge amount of advanced techniques that you will have to be told or lookup online. You come into Dota to have fun with \"tools\", every character is a different tool. They move different, they turn different, they attack differently. If you enjoy playing the same game over and over and perfecting little, small tricks to give yourself a slight advatange, then this is for you. If you come from any fighting game for example, you can get into this. Like really into this. What makes Dota2 different from other MOBAs? Depth. Dota offers much more variety, much more freedom to experiment. Other MOBAs shy away from the huge complexity that is giving more tools to the tools. You have items that give you more movement options, that take away movement options from the opponent, even random modifiers that spawn on the map periodically. In other games you will find these \"options\" baked into a character, they try to guide you into learning how a character \"should\" be played. Dota2 gives you the sandbox to experiment, As a reminder, it's never anyone's fault when you fail to build your tool properly. This is a game. Have fun. Most people just look up to a player and copy his playstyle, and Valve facilitates this. But you don't have to. Everything depends in Dota2. Should you try Dota2? Yes. But remember to have fun. You will be playing a game that can last 1 hour per match. Enjoy. Smile. A lot of people forget this. If you're not enjoying Dota2.

Let this be a warning note for all gamers that have been a prisoner of their own style but then again trying to give Dota 2 a shot for a change of scene. if you are new to MOBA or just downright have had suck at it for whatever reasons, this game wont be any different by any means. So let us begin reviewing the game where comeback comes back and hits you in your face more than the Taken Franchise (i know they should have stopped after the first film..) -+- The game itself is pretty darn vast with approximately 112 heroes in the roster and just a bunch of different purchasable items to buy from the Gold you receive every second and by kills with. Its your job to figure out the strength and weaknesses of each of the character you are about to take down/ lead with and set your perks accordingly. -+- Objective aren't any different for other MOBAS, you take down enemy structures to make the 'Ancient' aka the final tower vulnerable and then take it out. -+- The community is definitely one of the most rage induced people piled together in a game where communication and tactical planning are crucial. Every team i was assigned to there seemed some guy Screaming his throat out at me or some other bad player in out team. Just like an ex-boyfriend with emotional issues. I don't really blame them, it is one of the most competitively played games out there. -+- The graphics are better than most and seem well thought out. the animations of characters on the lower box really adds to it. Its well thought out and isn't much flashy, should help most people unlike my ADHD sufferer cousin. And the system requirements aren't as much so you should do fine with most potatoes. -+- Sounds are quite varying for all items and also visually the effects are quite different that is definitely a mention for the creative team responsible for it. -+- They have drops! yep just like CS:GO you have a chance to get an item drop that can be tradable/marketable. some drops do cost a lot and can buy you a game on steam sale (cumulative drops) if you are dedicated to it. -+- I'd also like to mention playing with bots will only get you so far in a game against people. The tactics people use are nothing like they programmed those binary butts with. There is still a lot to conclude in what seems to be a game based on a chessboard turned side ways, but i wont ruin it all by discussing it here. So spend some money on a better internet and try it for yourself, Gaben knows you'll need it. This game did have its moments for me but it just sadly wasn't a meant to be. Well the opponent team will surely mourn for me for all those victories i snagged them. sadly i cant say the same for my friends.

It seems really stupid, but you suck it up and play through the tutorial. Then you stupidly decide to play your first game of real dota. Put short you fed, badly. After going 0/30 your first game you kinda hate dota. But you stupidly decide to play another, and chances are you lost again. And this keeps happening until you discover your first newb hero. Drow seems so op doesnt she. Afterwards you decide to play this hero again and again, and doesn't it feel good to win. 50 games deep you'll hate noobstomp heroes like riki, sniper, drow, and bloodseeker. Obvisously these heroes are really op. 100 games deep and you'll find yourself trying out some new heroes, tidehunters ravange is pretty epic you have to agree. 200 games deep and you'll have played every hero, with the exception to earth spirt. How the hell do you play that guy, I dont get it. 300 games deep and those newb stomp heroes dont seem so bad anymore. Manfight riki, stand right next to drow, get blademail for sniper, and buy a tp for bloodseeker. And dont forget to buy dust. 400 games in you will know how to ward, rune control, stack and pull and play a support. You will understand the basics of having one person farm while another supports and harrasses. Holy  you've made it to 500 games. Remeber your first match if only you could see yourself now. By this point you understand the basics of dota! Remeber to dodge the sunstrike! 600 games in and you'll realize that for the past months dota is the only game you have played. Like the only game, because once you start playing dota you never come back. Unless your power dies.... By 700 games you'll start playing against trilanes. Now as an offlaner you have to do your best to not die, and get some farm. Hide in the trees and sap xp where you can. By 800 your tempted to buy that arcana. Not saying you will but it sure does look tempting. By 900 you know what to buy, and you get what every hero can do. You know where to be and when and you get the feeling when there smoke ganking and roshing. Gamesense op! By 1000 games you hit a milestone. The game doesnt seem like colored creatures punching eachother. Welcome to dota 2. Noob Advice: read guides when your trying out new heroes. Practice in bots, and dont stick to one hero, play them all. And stick in there, your first 10 games will suck. Purge has some great guides that you really should watch before you even step into your first game. And also play with friends, otherwise you might have to put up with peruvians who keep screaming noob in chat when you make one mistake. People who have to rage at everything (thats why theres reports), and russians who will play uber aggresive all the time, which to be fair on there part works half of the time. Welcome to dota 2.

Late Last March, I was naive enough to dip a toe in its beguiling waters and today, 450 hours of gameplay later, I return as a semi-functional human to regale you with tales from its realm. Dota 2 is unlike any other game Ive ever played, both in its nature and history. It started off as a StarCraft mod popular enough to be ported to Warcraft 3, which then exploded into a kaleidoscope of player-made variants and eventually coalesced again into a single entity titled Defense of the Ancients Allstars. There is no single author of Dota, though all the anonymous contributors whove made it what it is have come from the community that first started playing the mods. As such, Dota is the very definition of grassroots game development. The idea of a game made by the people for the people, as a certain American president might put it, fills me with a particularly warm and fuzzy sensation. Of course, I knew none of this when I first picked up Dota. A friend recommended it because its free and Im cheap. I understood that the game had a team-based format where killing the other guys was a good thing, like with first-person shooters, but your character also leveled up through the course of a match, as in role-playing games. That seemed like a recipe for unbalanced gameplay, but as it turns out, its precisely Dotas balance that makes it so unbelievably addictive. You start off as a member of a ragtag group of five heroes intent on destroying the enemys base, which is embodied by the titular Ancient structure. Through a series of skirmishes against the other team, their defensive towers, and waves of autonomous creeps, you gain experience and gold, the latter of which can be spent on items that make you stronger, swifter, and deadlier. The more you kill, the more you make, the more you buy, the more you kill. Rinse, repeat, and make sure to say \"gg\" at the end. LEARNING A LANGUAGE MIGHT BE QUICKER THAN MASTERING THE FULL BREADTH OF DOTA Excuse me if Im making this sound simple, because it really isnt. Dota 2 has a roster of over 100 heroes to choose from, and the combinations of items they can obtain is an order of magnitude greater still. Each hero has four or more unique abilities, and to have any hope of defeating a skilled opponent, you have to know what those are, what items he or she is carrying, and how they affect your chances of survival. Ignoring all of that nuance, I jumped straight into the game with the Juggernaut and was promptly beaten into a pulp of samurai sushi. A dozen humbling  whoopings later, I was online and reading the Dota Fire hero guides. DOTA 2 CHOICES The key reassurance I can offer is that all of these intricacies are, in fact, worth learning. As daunting as Dotas complexity may be, without it the game just wouldnt be as rewarding. My way of rising to the high bar of basic skill required was to pick the last enemy hero to destroy me. Thus I went from playing Juggernaut to Bounty Hunter to Bloodseeker to Ursa to Spirit Breaker. Each time I was sure I had the \"right\" hero, a better player would come along, expose my weaknesses, and teach me something new. Im the worst loser I know and yet I played Dota 2 for nearly 100 hours before I could get my winning percentage above 50. Maybe if I could actually see that I was being dominated by 14-year-old kids listening to Darudes Sandstorm on repeat, I might have felt sufficiently embarrassed to retreat in shame. I stuck through it, though, because, in the immortal words of Agent Smith, \"as a species, human beings define their reality through suffering and misery,\" and Dota delivers both with just enough victory to keep me titillated. And once I had a couple of hundred hours of experience under my belt, I too started passing on the sacred knowledge of Dota through the time-honored tradition of owning noobs. IM THE WORST LOSER I KNOW AND IM ADDICTED TO A GAME THAT KEEPS KICKING MY  This is not a game for the impatient. Success in Dota 2 requires the strategic forethought of chess, the unselfish teamwork of basketball, and the steely nerves of poker. None of those skills are acquired with ease and theres no magic number of matches or hours played to achieve Dota competence. Its a lot like learning a language: I never felt discrete upgrades in my knowledge and skill, but eventually I got to the point where I could tell you every typo in the games hero descriptions and every corner of its single asymmetric map. Just know that the commitment required is on a whole different scale to other games. You could complete the epic Mass Effect trilogy (plus all of its expansion packs) in less time than it takes the average Dota player to familiarize himself with everything from Abbadons Aphotic Shield to Zeuss Lightning Bolt. But thats really the point. Mastering this game in 50 hours wouldnt feel anywhere near as satisfying as taking a good 500.", "date_posted": "February 6, 2015", "username": "KOHH MASTERRACE", "num_friends": null, "num_voted_helpfulness": 0, "achievement_progress": {"num_achievements_attained": null, "num_achievements_percentage": null, "num_achievements_possible": null}, "num_groups": null, "num_badges": null}

Basically in tems of speed DotA 2, along with Strife (which is basically DotA 2 in graphics style of LoL with a pet+item system which you can level up by playing) is average, so if you think a MOBA should be slower you should try League of Legends and if you think it should be faster you should try Heroes of Newerth. If you are looking for an alternative that is less knowledge based you should probably try Heroes of the Storm, since you dont have to learn as many item effects. DotA 2 in a \"nutshell\" after ~2400h of playtime: -New players (if interested in cosmetic items) will have to visit the shop now because game drops have become so incredibly rare that it has become hilarious. -IF you buy item chests in the shop and dont get the set you bought it for, you can't sell the items since volvo put a trade+market cooldown (2 months I think) on every new item that gets released (yay!) so if you dont want to spend money until you have each possible drop from that single chest (RNG is strong in this one) you're better off waiting until the desired item is marketable and then buy it off the market. -Volvo greed simulator: The old loot system, in which you could acutally gain items after a game ,for DotA 2 profile levels, and a leveling chest you had in your inventory (which could be opened every few profile levels and contained a new chest to open later) was successfully reworked into greed-mode. The chances to get ANY items after a game are as low as getting a legendary (or higher) before. Sure they drop ENTIRE sets now, but most of them are common to rare, which overall is still less rewards than before if you add up singe items and put them up against the set drop chance now in both, item quantity AND value. Maybe you should try some \"never change a running system\" in this particular function. -Mostly developer/support abandoned game. the new content this game releases is mostly made by the community since the hero sets are workshop based and hero releases/patches are just really really rare. Special events are mostly the same every year and the report system is most likely 100% count-based/not reviewed by support employes (for example if you express your annoyance towards...lets say russians...for not being able to communicate in english on EU servers, you will most likely end up muted because out of the 10 players in a EU game 3 (probably more) are most likely russian and will report you for speaking english) -These days russian-infested to the max...8/10 games you play will result in eyecancer due to russian chatspam, even though they have their own servers(!) because its way cooler to go to international servers and spam your native language, thanks volvo for letting that happen! maybe one day the EU servers will be renamed into russia 2 and russia 3 and the actual EU will have to play on american servers after all :D *EDIT*-In addition to the listed issues, the game servers are now absolute ! 1/4-1/5 of the games crash and are not counted due to connection issues with the servers, great job of making it even worse when ppl thought that wasn't possible... Conclusion: If you want to play a game in which you get rewarded for playing (in terms of cosmetic effects and/or profile progression) this probably is not the right choice anymore, because as stated you don't get level rewards or similar stuff anymore, just REALLY rare item drops (probably in the 0,2% range). If you want to blow off some steam with trolling other players, spamming your native language while being sure nobody will be able to understand you this might probably be YOUR gamechoice #1. The community these days is mostly toxic and troll based so this is NOT your game for some serious gametime (at least not in solo matchmaking). I didnt check the other games these days but the community in HoN was much more friendly and less russian. In my personal opinion DotA 2 isn't playable solo anymore because there is too few games where you can actually play properly, without being annoyed by trolls or russians...

The game works like this ,that there are two teams, first team is called \"Radiant\" , second team is called \"Dire\" and each team will have a base, that base is called \"Ancient\" , then to win this game you have to destroy there base. So basically the first one to destroy the enemy's ancient wins, but before that you must go through the enemy's towers, there's three tower on each lane, so you can't destroy their ancient if you don't destroy the three towers and you cant advance to the second tower or third tower, you must destroy the first, second and third then finally their ancient. Last thing is , each team will have five players so you and your teammate must cooperate if not you guys will lose instantly the game, then each player will have a to pick a their role. There are 10 roles. After you guys pick a roles. There will be three lanes there's \"Mid\" , \"Top\" , and \"Bottom\" . So it can be like this 1 in the mid, 2 at the top and 2 at the bottom. 10 Roles Carry - will bring victory if he levels up faster and makes gold faster. Support - will provide wards and courier, also will upgrade the courier. Lane Support - useful even without farm and can go to other lanes to help others Initiator - will start the teamfight. Jungle - can get gold in the jungle so the other teammate can solo top/bottom. Pusher - can push faster through first, second and third tower. Escape - can bait the enemy or bring the enemy to your trap. Disabler - will stun the enemy or cancel the enemy's spell cast. Durable - will tank(shield) the teamfight so he's teammates wont die fast. Nuker - will bring massive damage too the enemy. This the common role in game, if you have this team you have 50/50 chance of winning Player 1 Carry this role will kill all the enemys and finish the game Player 2 Support this role will help the carry to farm because the other team will try to kill your carry Player 3 Durable this role will help in the teamfight, he will take all the damage of the enemy so the carry will live Player 4 Initiator this role will start the teamfight so you guys will have an advantage of the enemy Player 5 Disabler this role will stun the enemy so the enemy can't cast spell or attack I hope you like it and I really recommend this game, so good luck and had fun :) Pls like my review Originally posted by author : Steven Baes A.K.A.

We had a down time during Christmas time... and lately it seems that the player(s) were more frustating than before (closed beta, invite-only period). Also the leavers and the disconnected players are more rampant now. Which make this game more and more unenjoyable now. Noob-calling, negative not-team-players and the blame games involved, yes those kind that you have to expect when playing with total strangers. You'll be wasting 30-45 or even 60+ minutes of your life, thanks to them, losing easily. So this time around, you have to prepare yourself mentally to face those kinds. :D Good thing is that they have implemented the local lobby feature, so that you can actually play locally within your LAN. Should be a very good game worthy of having a LAN party again. I like the balance changes they put into the game, the item changes and things that make the early games more \"fun\", but... I'm putting this as a \"No\" for those who play only with a friend or two. You better play this with a full five-person-team to fully enjoy this game and the time not wasted. Or perhaps due to its current state, players similar to me might not have the reason(s) on how to fully enjoy this game.

As a true christian, I was raised to to believe the true saviour, gaben. But when I heard about this game I said \"This game has everything I need, religion, no sinners and a very casual experience.\" I praised the lord for this mighty gift from the highest heights of heaven. So, like any other true christian would I decided to play and not stray away from the reightous path, but when I loaded up the game the loading screens were riddled with satanic images and meanings. I was outraged by this atrocity more than when my son told me he had \"sinned\" by doing some dispicable acts. As Matthew McConau said in chapter 16:9, \"Thou hou slay thou demonic presence shou nourish in the heighest points of heaven\". So, after I got away from them satanic signs I started to become somewhat suspicious of this game. I pressed play and began to sweat as the jesus juices excreted from my body. I crossed my heart and prayed to God to forgive me for this act of satanism and waited for the match to started. Upon the game starting I was stunned by the amount of pagon rituals and signs that were in the game. I closed my eyes and picked a random hero only to discover something truly horrifying. My beer had run out. My bacon stained, sweat soaked vest had ripped. The russians were here, they were everywhere. My ears started to bleed as the russian flame began. I tried to continue on the righteous path but sin was inevitable. I pressed enter, I started to flame back, my fingers were numb. And then I realised, I had sinned. My heart stopped, I could hear God reaching down to me, but even he could not stop this. I had become the thing I dreaded most (more than a gay person)...

Their dreams of conquest I'll destroy.\" Of Warcrafts Custom Maps, one stood a little taller than the rest: Defense of the Ancients. Here the heroes of Azeroth, freed from the tedious management of cities and armies, could fight as they were meant to: with weapons and experience, teamwork and tactics, all unadulterated by some abstract general and convoluted mission. A vast pool of heroes, pulled into one map, normalized and equalized through patches, armed with improved weaponry, combined to cement a gameplay experience that appealed to our encyclopedic minds, our fantastical tendencies, and our social impulse. Here was an unthinkable union of knowledge, skill, mythology, role playing, individuality, and balance. Here DotA matured to perfection. But this perfection was uneven. The brilliance lay there, but burdened by the crust and grime of history. The games greatest hero, Ice Frog, was a player who saw in DotA a wondrous achievement and vowed not to let that masterpiece deteriorate and die. Seeing the game as a growing process, owned by a community, ever meant to experiment and improve, Ice Frogs leadership kept DotA alive. Suffocated by a dated engine and forgotten game, he and his team worked with the legion of adoring fans to nourish what could be saved, and eradicate what could not. But even tenacity has limits, and in order for DOTA to break free it needed a new body; a new platform in which to siege the world. Here, as ever, an angel swooped from above. It was Valve, and they released the building pressure of DOTA into the atmosphere of mainstream gaming; steam that would finally power the community it deserved. The rest is history. Adopting the FTP model, utilizing the source engine and steam community, DotA has its outlet: DOTA 2. Players marvel at the games sheer number of balanced heroes, how it feels difficult yet strangely compelling, sophisticated in its strategy but gleeful in its murder, at times silly but still dark, oppressive but always promising emancipation if you practice hard and reflect often, so reliant on your allies, often complete strangers, that autonomous action can never rival teamwork. Like members of a symphony, clashing with your enemies in near perfect tug-and-war, entailing chess-like prediction and FPS-like twitching, your team fights together, wins together, and dies together. Never before except in professional sports has your weakest link dragged you down or raised you up. But drag you down they do. Even in the most porcelain masks do we see blemishes, and DOTA 2 has its fair share. Teams can and do exploit the weakest member of the opposite team, bullying with a savagery only seen in competitive gaming. Because of this exploitation, and the difficult nature of the game as a whole, frustration often runs high in the experience. Losses feel more painful than wins feel enjoyable, and the hope for those rare games in which perfect harmony among both teams leads to razor-sharp tactics and thrilling plays can be ruined by the cruel hand of fate, where a single hero out of position or a single RNG move can turn the tide of battle. DOTA 2 is, paradoxically, rarely satisfying, but when it is players never forget that feeling of triumph. Video Games, more than any other art, rely on us to deliver an experience. Whether they tell a story or present puzzles to solve, games need us to be competent and attentive. DOTA 2 takes this to new heights, and presents us with an outlet where the more we pour into it, the more it gives back. Eventually our exhaustion clouds the luster somewhat, but we shouldnt judge the game by our own limitations. Feral, profound, and terrifically challenging, DOTA 2 is competitive team-based gaming in its prime.", "date_posted": "October 14, 2013", "username": "Basilius", "num_friends": 31, "num_voted_helpfulness": 7, "achievement_progress": {"num_achievements_attained": 19, "num_achievements_percentage": 0.2375, "num_achievements_possible": 80}, "num_groups": 4, "num_badges": 16}

Well, Dota 2 is definitely the best game I have ever played in my whole life. From this game I gained so many awesome friends,mates and never felt bored while playing with them. It's a fun game if played with friends. Dota 2 requires TeamWork in order to win the game properly. Dota 2 is purely based on Skill. And I said this for four reasons : 1-Counter picking. 2-Map awareness. 3-When to start a team fight when to defend. 4-Picking right items. Plus the more you play Dota 2, the more you want to learn about the game, and then you will enjoy playing it more than anytime! So actually Dota 2 is more like a team game. But playing solo is an other story... In solo matchmaking TeamWork is laughable. People will most likely tell you what to do step by step. If you don't follow what they're telling you. [All chat] \"report player\". Your random teammates will blame you for every single mistake you have done. And they won't even try to help you. They will just start insulting you in [All chat] and this will result to a lost game. I have tried to be nice with all my teammates when playing SOLO but as everytime, it's either I carry the team or I will lose the game. it's my mates attitude, I rarely get to play with people who speaks English properly. I will always get the \" squad\" spamming in [All chat], \"REPORT INVOKER NO GANK!!\" \" blat, adi nahoo\". I'm not quite sure what they're saying, but I'm positive, they're insulting me or my mother, most of the time. Well of course there are nice guys, but they are rare. Overall this game is awesome and somewhat addictive.

Instead of being sarcastic and writing a funny review that jabs at russians, I'm going to tell you how Dota 2 really is at it's core. In a nutshell Dota 2 is a great game, but a terrible experience at the same time. You want to keep going back to it, but you also hate to go back. Why? One word: community. Dota 2's community is for the most part rude and hateful (and undeniably filled with russians who refuse to speak any other language than that of their own), sapping the joy out of this otherwise polished and addicting MOBA. It's unfriendly to beginners and the basic mindset is to belittle anyone who makes a mistake. Make one wrong move and you are called a noob right away... at the best of times. Often it's much worse and I would prefer not to go into the details. Sometimes you get a crapstorm of hate and blame even if you haven't actually done anything wrong. Occasionally though you come across friendly players, and when that happens, the game is a pure joy to play. However, since the game is 5v5, coming across four nice players at the same time (if you're solo queueing) is a rarity. Why then have I played the game for over 2000 hours? The sensation of winning. Your determination to keep playing, despite of the discouraging community, is fueled by the fantastic sensation of winning. That sweet moment when you see the enemy Ancient blow up and look back on the match, remembering all the plays and teamwork that lead you to victory is ever so gratifying. But even a victory can come with a grain of salt. Many times you have rude teammates that rage in the chat even when your team is winning. There is a mute option, but that doesn't stop the bad manners that extend outside the chat. People can intentionally feed the enemy team, ignore their own team, teamkill with some abilities and just generally be a bad player. It's really frustrating and the worst part is it happens all the time. Going ranked doesn't really solve the problem either, at least not completely. Ranked matchmaking is a more serious type of mode in Dota 2 that ranks you based on how well you do and finds opponents of equal skill. It feels much more professional and \"tryhardish\". Although you meet nice players more often, nothing stops the rude players from jumping over the fence and playing ranked aswell. Having played some matches in ranked, I can say the mode isn't \"hate free\". I had some of the worst matches in regards to teammates in that mode. Another problem with ranked is that, like I said, it's more \"tryhard\". Many just want to play the game casually and not have to worry about ranks and such. But don't get me wrong, Dota 2 is a great game in itself. The core mechanics are spot on and gameplay flows well. No technical issues to speak of (not counting the occasional missing texture bug or so, of which I have had none myself). Graphics are great and have a very subtle water painting type feel to them. All the various spells and abilites look great. The game is very deep and complex with tons of items, skill and item builds and strategies to learn. It can be a bit terrifying to beginners, but once you get the hang of things it's engaging. All the playable heroes are well balanced (although there is always some debate on a couple specific heroes being \"OP\") and free to play from the start. That's another thing the game does right. All the heroes are free and playable from the start, unlike Dota 2's undeniably very successful competitor, League of Legends. Dota 2's microtransactions focus on purely cosmetic stuff, which means there are zero \"pay to win\" elements in the game. It really falls unto you to decide whether if you want to suffer the rude community for the sake of playing this great game. To put it roughly in perspective, it's like playing Skyrim, but having someone stand next to you the whole time yelling at you for every mistake you make, calling you a \"fooping idiot\" every time you miss an arrow or fail a quest objective. Failed to kill Alduin? \"Uninstall Skyrim, noob.\" Don't know how to make dragonbone armor? \"Learn to play, tard.\" It's like that. Having played the game as long as I have, I would say that you are better off not playing Dota 2. The game is fun when you're winning (because people tend to rage less when your team is doing fine)... which is 50% of the time. Sometimes not even when you're winning. It isn't the losses that make the game unpleasant, it's the unfriendly people. If you're one of those people who can just calmly ignore everything rude being said at you, you have a better chance of not finding Dota 2 so terrible. But realistically, why should you even have to? Videogames are supposed to be a form of entertainment and when you can't have fun half of the time, the game isn't worth it. People will tell you that Dota 2 is great, but that greatness comes with a price. Do take in notice that this is all coming from a solo player point of view. This review is meant mainly to those who are likely to play the game alone most of the time and want to know what it's really like, not just the great things. If you have four friends who you can play with on a regular basis, then you're golden. The game is at it's best when you play with friends and don't have to worry about getting \"a stick in the mud\" player on your team. Great game with a bad community.", "date_posted": "January 31, 2015", "username": "Vaskez", "num_friends": 82, "num_voted_helpfulness": 0, "achievement_progress": {"num_achievements_attained": 128, "num_achievements_percentage": 0.7664670658682635, "num_achievements_possible": 167}, "num_groups": 70, "num_badges": 16}

The main protagonist is you, Jakob. You are a lone survivor and every other player in the entire damn universe is an enemy. Jakob's model really matches his personality. A hipster, emo, gothic sex-driven male paired with the voice acting of Morgan Freeman really make this character pop out and helps make him really relatable. The storyline is great. I love how the developers have a completely separate \"prologue\" chapter for the story, explaining how such an apocalypse could have ever risen from the deep depths of hell (that's not a spoiler as you see that in the first 15 minutes of the game). You start out in the middle of ... er, Russia, spending time with your beloved family, and find out you are really, REALLY attracted to your cousin. You take her out to \"show her the world\" when suddenly a crack opens from the ground beneath you. Your cousin falls into the crevice. You are devastated. You try to rush home, but then all of a sudden, you hear a big ... er, plop. You look behind you, and there are robot zombies, all drinking vodka. You then turn all around and find yourself surrounded. And I'll stop there, otherwise I may end up spoiling the prologue! The PvP in this game is SPOT ON. It's like the developers KNOW that you're the main character and give you the most overpowered arsenal right from the get-go! It's brilliant, need I say more? Fine, I shall! Just like the amazingness that was Dungeon Keeper Mobile, you too can attain the most powerful arsenal by slamming your wallet into EA's pockets! It's fantastic! The best part too?

Youll learn to hate your friends and love random strangers during the forty five minutes an average match takes. In that short amount of time, grudges will be born, heroes will rise and poor plays will be vilified like a G R R Martin epic. And yet for all its emotional drama, both the highs and the lows, youll still yearn for more. Just learning to play is an adventure into masochism. Everyone begins as a dreaded n00b, unable to contribute anything but gold and XP to the opposing team. A few weeks later, and theyll have learned a few tricks: where to place wards, how to turn off auto attack in the options and crucially, the ability to take abuse on the chin without rage quitting. Give it a few months and theyll be rolling with the regulars. Double stacking, recrowing and GGWP will become part of their vernacular. Immunity to the insults will be delivered to them upon chins which have since grown thick with stubble and caloused skin. They'll have succesfully joined an inclusive club whose members include the heroes of the world's burgeoning e-sports scene. Consider the football metaphor, pub matches are like a kick about down the local park using the same boots, strips and footballs Rooney, Messi and Neymar use in packed stadiums full of shouting people. If all of the above sounds a bit much, ask yourself, whats the point of playing if you dont feel something in the end? Dota 2 delivers passion and fury in spades, and like all great games, its hidden depths forever tease like sirens upon the rocks, always ready to punish an overblown sense of ego.

The main protagonist is you, Jakob. You are a lone survivor and every other player in the entire damn universe is an enemy. Jakob's model really matches his personality. A hipster, emo, gothic sex-driven male paired with the voice acting of Morgan Freeman really make this character pop out and helps make him really relatable. The storyline is great. I love how the developers have a completely separate \"prologue\" chapter for the story, explaining how such an apocalypse could have ever risen from the deep depths of hell (that's not a spoiler as you see that in the first 15 minutes of the game). You start out in the middle of ... er, Russia, spending time with your beloved family, and find out you are really, REALLY attracted to your cousin. You take her out to \"show her the world\" when suddenly a crack opens from the ground beneath you. Your cousin falls into the crevice. You are devastated. You try to rush home, but then all of a sudden, you hear a big ... er, plop. You look behind you, and there are robot zombies, all drinking vodka. You then turn all around and find yourself surrounded. And I'll stop there, otherwise I may end up spoiling the prologue! The PvP in this game is SPOT ON. It's like the developers KNOW that you're the main character and give you the most overpowered arsenal right from the get-go! It's brilliant, need I say more? Fine, I shall! Just like the amazingness that was Dungeon Keeper Mobile, you too can attain the most powerful arsenal by slamming your wallet into EA's pockets! It's fantastic! The best part too?

However, unlike the basic knowledge that you require to play in LoL and HoN, this is more like an expert mode game. You need to practice and know a lot in order to be good in the matches and be respectable in the community. Dota2 has nice graphics, if you have played Dota in 'The Warcraft III - The Frozen Throne', you will absolutely love it. Nice details of the models of the heroes, nice animations and the voices of heroes are nicely done by expert professionals. I've been playing this game for 2 years, I've played LoL, HoN, Starcraft, Warcraft III, Torchlight II and many similar games. My Facebook Page: www.facebook.com/youngscientist This is one of the biggest growing RPG-MOBA in the gaming industry. The Dota2 community have some issues, people are not very likely to be friendly. The people in Dota2 are thirsty to play with and against skilled players -even if they are not one of them. There are updates, where bugs and glitches with items,heroes,models,voices etc are fixed. If you are looking something just for time pass, i would not recommend this for you then. If only you are willing to pay off some loads of time and are willing to learn and stay in the Dota2-community for a long time, only then thy shall be recommended to play it! Once you get the hang of it, it's incredibly addicting, fun and massive time-killer!

At that moment I didn't want to but for the sake of friendship, I decided to give it a shot. At first, the game seemed hella confusing. The only thing I liked back then was the Main Menu music and how ironic the menu and heroes looked :P We played it through and through and ultimately there came a time when the confusion came to an end and that's when the addiction started. As of the game, it's a Strategy based MOBA game. Difficult to understand all at once but easy when broken into segments. You have to choose a hero from a pool of 100+ heroes. Each and every Hero is Unique in their own way, having different abilities/powers etc. Your main goal is to destroy the Opposition's Home Base Building \"Ancient\" in order to secure win. It sounds easy but  always hits the fan xD. You are given a shop, from where you can purchase items to upgrade your hero's abilities and attributes. My experience with this game sucked at the start, but turned opposite as of now. The Competetion is real hard. There's also a Leveling system for the Casual record along with a ranking system for competetive mode(Ranked Match) called \"MMR\" or Match Making Rating. Just like Counter Strike Global Offensive, there's a match making system, which helps each and every player of similar skillz to compete with each other. So, I'd say to download this game asap because I already regret for not playing it from the start :P Remember, I was one of those who said \"Dota sucks\" and now it's an integral part of my life. Above all, there's something calm about this game unlike CSGO xD It's always fun to play.

Even when I've played with a \"plague\" of Dota 2 and CS:GO - Russians, I've heard 5-6 Swears and mostly because they were amused. About the Game itself. Gameplay may seem a Bit hard for the First time, but after you Play Tutorial + Some Matches, you'll get familiar with it. It's quite fun and Teamwork-ish, nothing here is Possible without Teamwork ( and Creeps ). Plus, it's this kind of a Games, where you have to be Sliced in a Half, and Complete some Objectives while Farming for Some EXP and Gold. The Match is getting REAL somewhere around 17 Minute of a game, Both teams got Heroes with Special Attacks, new Items, more Creeps. That;s where it starts. When you Bash through a Horde of Creeps and Kill a Sniper who was About to use a Shrapnel, then attack Creeps from Behind and you Push through Towers and even More Creeps with your Teammates.

However when you dig yourself through the wall of Dota2 and got to the point, where you start understanding what you are doing wrong. Then the game gets very rewarding and fun. Playing Dota2 is a combination of strategy - which hero to pick, where to lane, what items to buy and satisfying combat, one hero usually has 4 abilities and one of them being there ultimate ability, which is the hero's strongest ability, for newbies, there are a lot of hero's with passives and few abilities. Something, which I don't usually mention in reviews, is the voice acting, this game, although it has 108 different characters, has really good voice acting for every single hero. Although the game is getting to get a bit older now, its graphics are definetly up to date and personally I really like the water, it looks really good. Overall if have a lot of spare time and for a very strategic in-depth game go for it! It is free and you have excess to all heroes from Level 0 on.

Now I'm a licensed Interior Designer and I still play this game. In-game items make this game a whole lot more interesting than before. But since I'm a new player, it's sad to know that DYNAMIC PRESENTS are now unavailable. Rendering Old Players an edge of having good set of items while New ones can never have while they level up. So this makes leveling up your dota profile a bit of useless to me. Leveling up a profile knowing that there is no use or benefit can be disappointing at some point. And hopefully soon there will be an AUTOBAN for rude players in-game. Some sort of a \"PROFANE\" word detection thru out any language. There are a lot of rude and tactless players out there that can most of the time disappoint newbies from playing the game. Not everyone though. But nonetheless, this game is still as awesome for me as it was before in Dota 1. Very nice graphics and enjoyable game.

The game is getting massive content every now and so and it feels fresh, the map is fantastic and simple to learn. same with the heroes too and the community made content is fantastic! but the cons.. where do I begin? now, I love this game and everything... but the community is just what ruins it. I've been into games and I have over 800 hours plus and still being called an noob and everything and blames me. there is some situations that I couldn't do anything and my friend keeps trying to help, and no one else trys to come to the lane. and i'm the one getting blamed. also, the game seriously need either: more servers, or region locks. because I am sick and tired of being matched with peruvians, portugese, russians, etc. and not to mention, if you're in a parties. more chances you're gonna find some stupid clan team that does nothing but just does stun stacks while we just wanna have fun. the worse of all, is the people who always spam \"UMADBRO?\" and take insults from . but seriously, it's impossible to not be frustrated in a video game, espacilly dota... seriously. it's just sad that these kind of communities just ruin a game, and I can no longer have fun.

Then our world was sh*t upon by the powers that be; Gaben and Icefraud, both nigh on untouchable behind their shroud of lies and broken promises. We queued, ready for the action, the thrill, the skill, to survive and thrive in a high skilled scenario we'd spent over a thousand hours training for. This, this was our moment. We chose our heroes, heroes we have always enjoyed playing, heroes that happen to be OP this patch. Our spirits were higher than Snoop Dogg in a forest fire. We hit 'Play'. I entered the game... Josh did not. My brother-in-arms had fallen, nay, been tripped at the first hurdle! Gaben would simply not allow him access. His dota would restart and he'd spam the play button again and again but to no avail. This sordid process went on for 5 minutes. 5 minutes I will never forget. The worst 5 minutes of my life. Eventually Josh gave up, uninstalled and played Poker Night. And in that moment I remembered the hundreds of pounds I have poured into Valve. The armory of virtual hats I have treasured and loathed in the pursuit of cosmetic gratification. And a great rage swelled within me. A rage that threatened to burst upon volvo customer support in a dire tide of expletives and jokes about HL3. But I contained this anger, because I still had a game to win in honour of my betrayed comrade. I will not forget the injustices I have seen this day, and the hats might find themselves getting rather short of company in the months to come... #justice4josh #pray4josh #Ti4godssake #gameisbroken #biginternetwords #watchyourselves #Kappa", "date_posted": "May 1, 2015", "username": "Jimmy Rustler", "num_friends": 70, "num_voted_helpfulness": 0, "achievement_progress": {"num_achievements_attained": 55, "num_achievements_percentage": 0.16717325227963525, "num_achievements_possible": 329}, "num_groups": 8, "num_badges": 24}

Game looks good at first, but at the end of the day, its just a horrible online experience. If you have a 5 man stack, with good game knowledge, good coordination, yeah matches can be decent (but i recommend setting up \"inhouse matches\" with another 5 man stack!!). If you dont have a 5 man stack, its a pub train all day (or just plain bad/noobish). You win 50-5, then you lose 45-7, then you win 41-17, then you lose 60-28 and so on. Its all about the \"lucky roll of the dice\" named matchmaking. Most players that play this game have lvl 0-1 accounts, with only dota or other free to play games. So dont think if you report them, they care. They just make another account to troll, feed or w/e. Also, alot of people play this game drunk, stoned, or just very tired. That can be ok i guess in a 1v1 game, or a 2v2 with one of their buddies. But in a 5v5 team game, its not nice. They just ruin the experience for alot of other people. Most people use their own language. Chatting or writing. Teamspeak or just skype is not on their menu. So most russians will speak russian, most turks will speak turkish and so on. There is no region lock. Again, for a 1v1 game, maybe that could work. But for a game like dota, having a player from Australia or Peru joining the Euro server with 300-400 ping is not cool. And alot of people just check more servers for faster queue times and also check more languages. So if you check EU West or US East, and expect all people to have good pings and speak english, think again :)). At least some of the dota 2 players, played wc3 or dota 1, dont even get me started with the other mobas... Its the only genre that makes me feel ive wasted my time in most cases when i play the game. Bonus: People either flame/curse etc, or just dont know what the hell they are doing. In most cases both ^_^ So, i recommend using your free time / gaming time, playing other games. And stay away from all free to play team games / MMO's. They are a magnet for trolls, kids or just noobs that dont care. And you know why? Bcuz they can make 1000 accounts... So if they get banned or their ranking has gone down, its no problem, new acc on the way. Its kinda sad, game could have been fun. But its not. And thigs will never change bcuz of all the reasons ive stated above. The game at its core is good, but the overall online experience is bad. Cant recommend this for a new player, a true newbie. Cant recommend this either for an old skool RTS player. These guys online dont even look at the minimap!! So most of the time the games/matches wont be good and fun. Even most of the wins are fun just bcuz you had fun / a good talk or w/e, with a real life friend that you had on skype, or a gaming friend that you laned with, not bcuz of the dota match tbh. So just go and drink beer with that mate, or just play other games with him/them. With this concept of f2p and team gameplay, i cant see valve fixing this, so i cant see a reason to recommend this. Sure you can get random good matches, but after all my experience playing this, i think you are better off without this game / genre completely.

When I started I did not have any experience and much expectation of the game, due to the genre - it was all new to me, however before trying out the game it took my friends awhile to get into the game because I did not like the fact the game was still at Beta and at that time I was detesting its predecessor DotA due to the fact the gameplay was confusing which it turned me off and also the graphics was years outdated without even trying the game out. I was able to give its successor a chance when a friend of mine introduced the ESports scene within the game community of the genre. I was hooked due to I never have expected that a type of sport has been running for almost a decade which it has been under my radar. I personally was not a fan for Sports in general although after hearing about ESports is completely change my perspective on both of the game and sports. ESports is a term for organized video game competitions, especially between professional. It is known as competitive gaming, professional gaming and cyber sport. The most common video game genres associated with electronic sports are real-time strategy, fighting, first-person shooter, and multiplayer online battle arena. Generally Dota 2 would fall under the MOBA genre due to it consists of session-based online multiplayer matches, in which two teams of five players attempt to destroy their opponents' fortified strongholds known as Ancients. Each player controls a \"Hero\" character and, over the course of an individual game, focuses on improving their Hero's abilities, acquiring items, and fighting against the other team. Welcome to Dota, You Suck, is a well-known proverb within the DotA Community, which is aimed at new player. In fact is the truth, especially for new to the genre, for the first dozen hours or so, you will be showered with too much information and an often unforgiving community of extremely competitive players. On the other hand if you persevere, Dota 2 becomes one of the most rewarding and tense team-based multiplayer experiences anywhere in gaming. It's an achievement owed to uncompromising depth and complex gameplay, being a free-to-play, and the great features developer Valve has built up around it. That said, you should not expect to have fun on your first day playing... or even your first week. It is due to the unforgiving players within your team which expects you to do your job flawlessly although it is impossible even pro players can make a mistake, however theres a method of this insanity. In order survive in Dota 2 you need to understand every single hero and mechanics and how they interact with one another. Everything from learning to work as a member of a coordinated team to the counter-intuitive practice of killing your own AI units to deny the enemy experience points and gold theyd get from doing it themselves, and understanding the effects of hundreds of complex abilities. There are 102 Dota 2 heroes (and counting) each consist of different abilities and mechanics and serves different roles from each other. For example Riki, is an melee Agility hero in which when he acquire his ultimate at level 6 he becomes permanent invisible, which is an obvious choice for most of new player. However there are various ways to counter an invisble heroes, this can be done by purchasing either a Dust of Apperance, Sentry Wards or Gem of true sight, anyone can purschase these item during a game, making the game more balanced. In addition some heroes has an ability to track an invis heroes for a short period of time. In conclusion, DOTA 2 is fun and challenging and deeply rewarding unlike other games, and despite its vast popularity it still feels like a secret waiting to be discovered. It has clear visuals and more balance gameplay unlike League of Legends and has an incredible longevity", "date_posted": "November 8, 2013", "username": "sadpanda.jpg", "num_friends": 177, "num_voted_helpfulness": 24, "achievement_progress": {"num_achievements_attained": 20, "num_achievements_percentage": 0.06968641114982578, "num_achievements_possible": 287}, "num_groups": 27, "num_badges": 62}

Current main issues: Pros: - A friendly and positive community - Possibility to make friends and discuss delicate topics with new people from various ethnic backgrounds, chat comes with emoticons and other essential stuff - Strong focus for learning new languages - Full of fun mini-games if the main game is not compelling, like the Shopkeeper's quiz, buying stuff from the Valve shop, in-game advertisement clicking, guess-games for DOTA 2 network offline times etc Cons: - I picked the Sniper class but had trouble aiming in the first person mode, needs to be fixed asap - Playing the game with Oculus Rift resulted in nausea - Low replayability, after their first game everone I know has practically reached their skill cap - Basic things like in-game quicksave and quickload functionality is missing - Raid bosses like Roshan and Troll Warlord are hard to understand and severely imbalanced - Steam achievements were teased but are still not working, I already ate my 500th tree but didn't get the achievement - The crafting system is confusing and unintuitive - Want to create a drum? Well, you need a robe and a bracer, of course! Want to create a buckler? Yep, you guessed it, you need a chainmail shirt armor and a branch! - Hitboxes are off and often clipping; for example, I bought a bigger sword for the Sven class, but game doesn't register hits that clearly happen against smaller models like the Phantom Assassin - NPCs like the mud golem and the shopkeeper only have few lazy dialogue lines, I was more interested in hearing their immersive part of the story while constructing a hut in a nearby forest out of treebranches - RTS system for building or repairing base components are limited to only a few heroes and could use a revamp - Character wipes happen a bit too often in the servers I've been at Without going into too many spoilers, finishing the campaign left me with more questions than satisfying answers. For example, why was the evil Dragon Knight so eager to hurt the seemingly innocent creeps for monetary gain? Why did the mysterious Drow Ranger attack our valiant hero? Why does Axe look like a tomato? So many questions, yet so few answers. Overall, the game is OK for an early access FPS-RPG hybrid but doesn't entertain the more hardcore gamers for very long.

I switched to DotA 2 a couple months ago from all my friends shifting over. Here is a short list of pros and cons that I have seen in DotA 2 as opposed to DotA 1. Pros: * Better mechanics, many heros function differently in DotA 1 due to the restrictions of the Warcraft 3 World Editor. * Visually stimulating, DotA 2 has many ways to customize heros, couriers, wards, animations, and more. * Item drops, as opposed to DotA 1, even casual players can end up making some money just by playing. * Spectating * Much easier for new players to learn due to the new system to help starting players. * Builds display on the item panel * Has many events in which additional items can be earned * Has an in game mic system as well as quick toggle phrases. Cons: * Currently doesnt have all the heros or neutral camps that DotA 1 has. * Lacks some of the game modes of DotA 1. * Surprisingly, lacks some of the important mechanics of DotA 1. The most notable one that I can pull off the top of my head is Batriders napalm does not trigger any damage bonus on radiance + veil even when the threshold for doing so is met. * Servers tend to be down for a brief period of time after nearly every update. * Doesnt have as well of a language division as DotA 1. I que US east and west with the language of English in DotA 2; yet 1:3 games, if not more, will have another language. I wouldnt even mind if it was something like Spanish or French, but I am getting everything from Russian, Chinese, Portuguese, Ukraine, Korean, Japanese, and many more that I cant even identify. * Double courier is a lot harder to use in DotA 2, even with hotkeys and grouping. I find this to take away from bottle crowing as well as make it harder for 2 farmers to get their items quickly for they will likely be on the opposite sides of the map. Even if they arent, the offlane will still likely need it to get items to survive. Every game will only have 1 courier unless someone accidentally buys another. Neutral: * DotA 2 has much better pathing and makes it harder to get stuck on unpathable areas. This makes sure you will never stupidly get stuck somewhere, but also takes away from some hero abilities that do move other heroes or yourself. * There is currently no public lobby system. There is everything from private, fiends, guild, etc., but there is no way to host them publicly for anyone to join. * Your computer needs to be decent to run DotA 2. At least 4 GB of ram and a decent graphics card is highly advised. In conclusion, DotA 2 is definitely a f2p game that you should look into. If you have yet to play any MOBA it may seem a bit difficult at first, but it will grow on you. To avoid the initial hate you may come across, I advise having someone assist you with learning the basics or look up some tutorials online. Going into this game with absolutely no knowledge of how this game works is definitely not a good idea. Once you learn the game, it can easily become the most enjoyable strategy game you have ever played.", "date_posted": "December 22, 2013", "username": "Tacet_", "num_friends": 268, "num_voted_helpfulness": 5, "achievement_progress": {"num_achievements_attained": 23, "num_achievements_percentage": 1.0, "num_achievements_possible": 23}, "num_groups": 67, "num_badges": 37}

DOTA has its roots as a Warcraft 3 modification. Warcraft 3 introduced a unique mechanic in its campaign and multiplayer modes of \"hero\" units - units that actually gained experience points, abilities, and items as the game progresses. This really made it feel like you had an investment in these units, and you grew attached to them. To a degree these hero units, effectively commanders of your army of relatively disposable units, became your avatar in-game. It was a brilliant concept, and DOTA took it a step further. DOTA created a multiplayer mode that focused *exclusively* on playing these hero units - it removed the base building and unit management seen in the standard RTS format. It's one of the best examples of \"less is more\" than I've ever seen, and that description hardly does it justice. Managing your individual hero and your income, position on the map, constant decision making, and being able to size yourself up versus your enemy brings more depth than any other game I've ever played. I've yet to play any other multiplayer game where *every* member of your 5-man team is crucial to your victory. Everyone must do their part, and do it better than the other 5-man team. There are very few cases of where a game can be winnable 4v5, and teamwork becomes a huge factor. In the most intense and close games, the level of immersion really can't be matched. It's hard to think of another game that draws you in more than DOTA, especially when other people are counting on you to do well! It's a hectic, stressful, enormously complex and in-depth experience - not to mention absurdly fun. This is what keeps me coming back, and I'd recommend it to anyone looking to really experience what multiplayer gaming can truly offer. If you're new to the game and want some background on specific heroes and strategies, or just want to watch some gameplay, be sure to check out my YouTube channel.

The game also has access to cool cosmetic items that give players direct access to their facebook allowing everyone to see how vibrant and colorful their language is when losing an mmorpg.

The matchmaking in DotA 1 was completelity random! So you could not improve too much your skills playing pub games. Now, past 2 years DotA 2 has been released, the matchmaking is much better (their system 'wants' you to win 50% and lose the other 50%). I play DotA more than 7 years but 90% I know about DotA it's because I improved and learned the past 2 years . Pros: -> DotA 2 have a steep, daunting learning curve. You can't just be a good DotA 2 player with 100 games.. sometimes you'll have to get tips with friends, search strategies on google and watch competitive games. This can be fun and challenging. -> It's very fun when you play pub games with your friends and WIN the game. Otherwise.. heh -> Although it's always the same map and objective, there's a lot of combination and strategy plays you can do ! (more than 100 heroes). -> If you like MOBA/RTS game, when you spend a lot of time in DotA 2 and learn advanced plays you'll not stop playing. Well, I do not know if it's a good or bad quality.. Cons: -> DotA 2 is a RTS (Real Time Strategy) 5x5 game, so it's very frustating when you play with people you do not like. -> It does not have a good tutorial explaining all the advanced plays.. you'll have to learn by yourself or by a friend. You can search on forums in the internet too. -> It's very difficult in the beginning, if you do not have patience and time it will be a very difficult game to enjoy.", "date_posted": "December 22, 2014", "username": "Pen.Apple", "num_friends": 122, "num_voted_helpfulness": 5, "achievement_progress": {"num_achievements_attained": 140, "num_achievements_percentage": 0.8383233532934131, "num_achievements_possible": 167}, "num_groups": 4, "num_badges": 24}
