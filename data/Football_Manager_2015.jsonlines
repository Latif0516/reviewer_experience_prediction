For me, as a pretty hardcore player, I feel like I'm in a vicious circle just feeding my malcontent about the game, but cannot break my addiction. And hell, I've had many spells of FM addiction throughout the last fifteen years, but they are only truly rewarding when I feel I can make a difference with my particular style of play. And my preferred scenario is the lower league model, excessive scouting, wheeler dealer kind of approach, which is worth very little in 2015. The thing that works the least, for me, is that I don't feel I can truly play the game the way I would want to play it. My expectation is that somehow getting a few amazing players in a League 2 or Conference team should show. But whether it shows or not depends on chance, player ratings are very position dependent, with central midfielders taking the runt of bad ratings, however amazing they may seem. So I might spend hours searching for the coolest prospects I can find, fishing for work permits for my non-eu conquests, but getting phenomenal players on a mediocre squad matters very little. The general feeling is of a wooden game. Bizarre things happen which seem to defy reason. Some are buggy, like goalkeeper reactions, some are fixable via lengthy tactical tinkering, like defending corners, and others are the worst of all: monotonous. Long distance goals? Maybe on TV. A fast player outrunning a defender unless the latter fumbles it? Keep dreaming. Half competent goalkeepers seem harder to find than the proverbial needle. And then there's an aggressive randomness to how a team behaves and matches unfold. My \"concede within the first ten minutes syndrome\" seems unshakable. I am not saying it cannot be done, but the feeling is that it is something that needs to be fixed from the get go, rather than something that should be reasonably fine under normal conditions, like corners. And when there's a huge quality gap between your players and the opposition, it all gets hard to fathom. So why have I played hundreds of hours of this? On the one hand, the addiction. On the other, that elusive feeling when things actually do go right and you win an amzing match. But I am left frustrated because FM seems to be going nowhere, the development of the game fails to address key issues year after year. A balanced match engine. A bit of flair and a bit of the unexpected. Some character and individuality to the players. Unbiased ratings. Consistency and logic in the transfer system. Of course it's not easy and there's a lot of back and forth in trying to get it all together, but considering the heritage of this series, I cannot avoid a distinct sensation of complacency, padded with the occasional UI revamp or a couple of shiny new features. Bottom line: if you have not played this yet, maybe wait it out some more, like until SI decide to take the bull by the horns and create another classic. There are many people who enjoy working on this game and its database is a treasure trove, an inimitable advantage for anyone interested in joining the fray. The risk with taking it up is that even if you get it for free, time costs incurred are not worth the experience and chances are your passion for football will be your downfall, in spite of this.", "total_game_hours_last_two_weeks": 0.5, "date_posted": "Jan 13, 2015, 3:50PM", "num_badges": 50, "found_helpful_percentage": 0, "review_url": "http://steamcommunity.com/id/fcpolifan/recommended/295270/", "achievement_progress": {"num_achievements_attained": 59, "num_achievements_percentage": 1.0, "num_achievements_possible": 59}, "num_friends": 27, "date_updated": null, "rating": "Not Recommended", "num_found_unhelpful": 0}

Manager customization has been inserted and is a step in the right direction, but not entirely. So, you will get to \"customize\" the stats of your manager. Are you more laid back or more technical? The option to customize and edit stats as such as adaptability and understand of things like attacking, defensive, etc are there. However, i don't entirely know what impact they have on the game as In my 9 hours of playing I haven't really noticed it or came across them again. I also do not know if these stats improve or worsen over time, depending on what you do - as the game does not tell you, even in the very brief tutorials. The new user interface layout is amazing and is long overdue. I actually found that I stopped playing Football Manager 2014 because of the UI. It was clunky, it was a mess and I had no idea where anything was. It was all just text and drop down menu's. Now there is a nice sidebar which provides links that take you to the most important and most used parts of the game as such as tactics, scouting, team, etc. Purchasing players is odd this year. Sometimes it is extremely easy to buy a player and others extremely difficult, for no reason - even if you are trying to purchase an already transfer listed player or a reserve player getting no games at his current club. The old \"Let me pay 100m on a 48 month deal\" STILL works. You can buy any player that wants to come to your club if you use this method and it totally breaks the entire game. My biggest gripe and the sole reason why I need to give a bad recommendation to this game: The AI and the match engine. The AI in Football Manager 2015 is the worst I have ever seen in the series. If you actually sit and watch the match unfold you will see some of the following: - Players running for a ball and stopping for no reason - The goalkeeper saving the ball, standing back and staring at the ball, which is touching his feet - A Player will chase the ball down the wing at full speed, slow down and allow a opposing team player to catch up and take the ball. - Opposing team player has the ball and stands still. All of your players are polite enough to let him stand still. - Outrages tackles: Ball is moving out of your box, opposing striker is running out of your box. There is no threat. Defender will slide tackle him as he is leaving the box and give away a penalty. - CB's that seem to play as strikers, leaving entire gaps in your defence. Red cards, injuries and own goals - EVERYWHERE. I have not went through a game yet where there has not been at least one own goal either by my team or the opposing team. They are everywhere. Red cards and injuries happen in abundance - I have had 10 players injured within the first month of a season even though I had average training and not too many games in quick succession. Tactics do not work as they are intended. If you sit down and take the time to read and learn how to create tactics, you will be so frustrated. The game gives you descriptions of what each position and instruction does, in depth. This is great. However, they do not work as they say. Short passing, retaining position and not punting the ball up the park? Team constantly just fires the ball all over the park with next to no short passing. Push higher up the park? Team sits deep. Because of these issues, scorelines can be ridiculous. In my first 5 games of the season there was a combined number of 30 goals between me and the other team. My first game finished 5-4 and my second was 6-3. This all leads to a very frustrating experience overall. Every year SI always say \"we are improving the match engine\". Where are these improvements? I have not seen any improvements, just more bugs and terrible AI. I love this series and I am a huge football fan, but I feel obliged to tell fellow consumers not to purchase this product until it vastly improves.", "total_game_hours_last_two_weeks": 0.0, "date_posted": "Nov 8, 2014, 8:45AM", "num_badges": 65, "found_helpful_percentage": 0, "review_url": "http://steamcommunity.com/id/XB92AI/recommended/295270/", "achievement_progress": {"num_achievements_attained": 4, "num_achievements_percentage": 0.4, "num_achievements_possible": 10}, "num_friends": 29, "date_updated": "Nov 8, 2014, 9:19AM", "rating": "Not Recommended", "num_found_unhelpful": 0}

Since I started this game, I've won the league once and the treble in another season. I'm in my fourth season. So it's not like I'm whinging because I can't win. But there is clearly something wrong with the matchday engine. The most succinct way I can put it is that it's like they've decided Brazil vs Germany from the last WC is commonplace. I'll keep 8 straight clean sheets (or something like that) then get beaten by a promoted side 6-0, or 7-5! What's more, I've noticed other games in the league finishing 8-6, and stuff like that. Since I started counting, in three seasons I've seen goalkeepers chipped from the touchline or from inside the defending half 27 TIMES!!! The game needs a lot of work. It's a winning franchise; so, all they need to do is fix it. But don't spend your money on it until they do. They have released a very dodgy product. I've never seen an FM release like it.

Just too many issues (and it appears I'm not the only one), to mention in one review so I will list my biggest bugbears; - Injuries - like many others, each save game has been dominated with injuries (FM (Liverpool), FMC (Liverpool), FM (custom)). Of course many players get injured but I have rarely managed to field an entire matchday squad without bringing in 2/3 reserve and youth players. This means on average i have about 8 senior players injured (6-8 weeks is the most common length) - Training - there just seems to be no improvement on this side of things. It is embarrassing that you can only train your whole team as one (for example - attacking training). There is not one professional team that have all their players do the same group training schemes. Why would i want the likes of Skrtel, Toure and Sakho doing Attacking training the majority of the time? It is just lazy game designing. On top of this there appears to be a bug that a few players in your team are always upset about the high training workload - no matter what you try to fix it. - Talking to players - again it feels like this is a bit on the weak side. You only have the same options available. Sure you can try to \"convince\" players but only with intangible promises. - e.g promise to bring in high profile players but with no obvious way to figure out if the player you buy is going to appease the player - Everything is short term - \"this is my plan for this season\" - Most clubs have a 3 or 5 year plan. You should be able to lay out your plans for your contract entirety - e.g have more money in the first year to build a squad that will develop, or lay away your transfer kitty for later seasons because the squad you have now will get you promoted etc - teams still wont bid for new players or contract signees - it is very frustrating to buy a kid for the future and have to wait 6 months to loan him out. -tactics are inflexible - rarely does it work if you want to play a fast, short game. Or a slow, direct game. This is nothing like real life, remember Liverpool last season? Or Stoke every season? plus they still haven't brought back player runs - a huge miss for tactical control. The biggest problem? Matchday - I watch it on 2D to try and avoid some of the bugs but a lot of them still persist. The two most common are players not chasing down a loose ball 5 yards away from them and the worst one of all......Opponent takes a shot, kepper makes a save, ball comes back into the penalty box, keeper watches it for 5 minutes whilst the opponent runs 25 yards to stick it in the back of the net......funny thing is it only happens to your keeper. Plus the tactics you use don't have a big effect on the game. I tested this out by doing the old save/restart cheat against West Brom at home. (Tried 442,451,433 with different player combinations and tactics......each time lost 2-1 or 2-0 On the plus side it looks prettier. Unfortunately as most people point out there is no motivation for Miles and the SI team to make real improvements. Each year we will shell out 30 and receive some old rope in return. At least now you can play the beta access and get bored of the game before it's official release date.

Where to start? The pros? The game is so in-depth, detailed and looks great that at first glance you feel like you are in heaven. Unfortunately, the absolutely ridiculous AI and randomness of the game ruins it for brand new players and seasoned veterans alike VERY quickly. I have played football manager games since the 1990s. I have bought every game in this Football Manager series. I have probably tens of thousands of hours of experience playing these, and have thoroughly enjoyed every FM yet. Until this fiasco. I have only played this one with two teams, Man United and Sheffield United, but the experience has been identical. The game is so damn unrealistic, that it will suck the life out of you. These are actual situations that happened in my season with Man United. A month into the season, I have lost nearly third of my team to long injuries. Some players cannot put together two games in a row before returning to the injury list. Not TOTALLY out of the question, but highly unlikely. Queens Park Rangers finished 2nd in the EPL in my first season, while Tottenham and Liverpool barely missed relegation. I finished 9th, and got fired. I kept beating the top teams repeatedly, while collapsing at home 0-5 to teams like QPR and Swansea. I lost 5-0 to a 9-man Manchester City, after winning the shots 14-5 and hitting the post/crossbar five times. Frustrating, but not impossible. But scenarios like this unfold throughout the season; the likes of Rooney and Mata cannot score regardless of opposition or their position on the field while James Wilson bangs out a 30-goal campaign, you can LITERALLY have a guy of van Persie's stature standing on the 6-yd line with an empty net and hit the post over and over again, and don't even get me started on these phantom goalies... You can be playing against a backup to the backup goalie 2 divisions below yours, and fail to score, while the opposition sinks 3 behind De Gea on three shots. I scored 2 or 3 goals from direct free kicks all season, and maybe twice from a corner. My opponents? You got it, somewhere around dozens. Now, it might sound like I'm making excuses and don't know how to manage. But as I said, I have enjoyed these types of games some 20 years, whether I win or lose. Why? Because the games have been as fair and realistic as a simulations sports game can be. Sure, there will always be that crazy 7-5 home win against some World Class team, but when it happens once every 150 games or so, that's pretty okay... There will always be that game where an underdog takes you down and leaves you extremely frustrated. But guess what, it actually happens... What doesn't happen are the scenarios I discussed above, and after some 150 hours into FM 2015, I feel like I have enough personal experience to call this game total garbage. Fortunately, FM 2013 and FM 2014 are still installed on my computer, and still offer limitless hours of fun and entertainment.

I will play it for countless hours again because I am addicted to this sort of game and I play FM because frankly, there is no alternative. Does this mean I will either recommend it or give it a good review? Once again, not this year. The lack of ability in SI to actually listen to the reviews of its customers is just awful. This is a company that has been excellent in the past at implementing user ideas. In the past few season such bugs as far too many injuries (they argue there are fewer than real life, blah, blah) and goal keepers who just let the ball in after catching it have been glaring issues, just to name two examples but I could go on like this for hours with things they just choose to ignore or tell us are not issues at all. The new user interface is just trash, especially the tactics screen and this does not seem to be getting addressed despite cries from the user base, once again. I don't really need to write a long list of things wrong with this game, just quickly browsing the review section here will show you what is sorely missing and what is over looked. I want to love FM again, but it looks like they are just making too much money and only listening the fan boys on their main forums to care about the user base anymore.", "total_game_hours_last_two_weeks": 23.3, "date_posted": "Nov 28, 2014, 5:26AM", "num_badges": 34, "found_helpful_percentage": 0, "review_url": "http://steamcommunity.com/id/tieio/recommended/295270/", "achievement_progress": {"num_achievements_attained": 85, "num_achievements_percentage": 0.8095238095238095, "num_achievements_possible": 105}, "num_friends": 135, "date_updated": "Jan 22, 2015, 6:37AM", "rating": "Not Recommended", "num_found_unhelpful": 0}

They should take more out of your budget for them since at the moment you can spend 100M on a 25M budget Match engine is terrible. Best way to win is by playing like Big Sam, hoof it up to the wingers and have a big man in the middle. Keepers are also terrible, constantly fumbling into the path of oncoming strikers, getting caught in posession and passing to the opponent. Defenders can't mark in the box and miss free headers constantly. I would say 3/4 of all goals come from a cross or a keeper / defender doing something shambolic. Overall: Great new features, coming at the expense of all the simple things. If they fix the match engine then this could be a very good installment.
