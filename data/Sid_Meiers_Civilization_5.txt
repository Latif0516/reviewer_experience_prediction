review: 50 Hours into your latest save, all is going well. Only 3 leaders left Gandhi, Caesar and Washington. you draft an 'end game' plan in your mind, you will make friends with Gandhi (for obvious reasons he's chill) then procede to befriend Caesar. Then you will take out Washington because he is a  and did not accept an open border agreement 3000 years prior HE MUST PAY. 20 turns later all is going to plan, we are now on Washingtons doorstep, Gandhi and Caesar appear to love and probably fear your superpower nation. All we need to do is eliminate the pesky Americans and ith all our military now on American soil this should not take long. Then after the swift invasion of America we will make a vote for world peace at the U.N (in rome of course) with our new found Indian and Roman brethren it is a sure win! But all of a sudden the distant droning of nuclear sirens start, quickly they become louder and louder, "what is this!?" you think to yourself, a false alarm? You shrug it off maybe Caesae bombing a city state. The game pauses... Gandhi appears on the screen, with a sinister grin he shouts "WAR" in your face. Only seconds after you see a gut wrenching sight. The camera focuses on a nuclear submarine stationed just off the coast of your pride and joy, the capital of your glorious nation. You then hear a rumble, just seconds after a nuclear warhead emerges from the previously hidden submarine, you realise it is too late... you can only watch as the missle closes in. As your city goes up in a giant cloud there are short lived screams from your beloved people, then silence. Before what had just occurred had sunk in, before you could make rescue efforts to save your much loved citizens the humming of quiet engines fall upon your ears. Suddenly countless 'stealth bombers' appear seemingly out of no where, soon the sky is blackened by planes, the game falls almost silent only the whistle of falling bombs remains. You faint from the shock of what is unfolding. You awake shortly after, Gandhi is still flattening what remains of your once prosperous empire, now with 'giant death robots' making the most of his seemingly never ending turn. As Gandhi clinically and relentlessly razes what's left of your broken nation all you can do is weep, your people hacked down in their prime and your glorious nation so mighty just minutes before has just been been all but eliminated in 1 turn. Why oh why did you turn of autosave? did it really speed your game up? was it worth it? Ghandi is a complete , he acts like your friend but WILL nuke the  out of you if even the slightest oppurtunity presents itself. 10/10

They are evil, traitorous demons. NEVER TRUST THEM. However, Genghis Khan is my best friend. He came up to me and was all like, "De full do bu la chi mendo." And I said, "Okay! Let's be friends!"

review: I was playing Civ, and I only just realized how amazing this game is after playing it for so long. First... allow me to set the mood. The year was 1700-something. France, the only civilization who was even close to challenging my might as the leader of the powerful empire of Japan, was being landgrabby and attacking my allies, so I, being the superpower that I was as leader of Japan, decided to ride in and knock him down a few pegs (and by that I mean conquer five of his cities, isolate his capital from the rest of the world, annex three of the five cities we conquered, and give the other two to my nearby allies the Iroquois, who razed one.) Napoleon, of course, denounced me, but the rest of the world was like Japan saved our asses from your entitled ways, so you can go  yourself, shorty. Then I high-fived the Iroquois because Hiawatha and I were besties. Fast forward 100 turns and roughly 200 ingame years: Napoleons grabbing land again, but this time its the land of city-states around him, because I decimated his military so badly that he honestly wouldve killed himself going after any major civs. Being the superpower that I am, I immediately rush to the aid of these city-states, but I realize that I cant afford to risk war because the other civs would start to think I was just abusing my power. So I secretly provide the city-state Budapest, who is at this point in a state of permanent war with France, with two Mechanized Infantry - a solid two AGES ahead of Frances cannons and horsemen. Budapest successfully repels the French invasion, and becomes my ally. I do the same with the city-state of Stockholm when theyre attacked by Darius, who I previously attacked and captured one of the cities of because Darius was an irrational, entitled prick of a leader who had decided that everything to the west of his land (aka MY land) is rightfully his. Stockholm, to the east of Darius, successfully repels Dariuss invasion. But Stockholm doesnt stop there. Apparently, Dariuss military is so incredibly weak that one of his own cities falls to Stockholms new advanced technology. Stockholm razed the city. I just kind of smirked, at this point. Darius just got what was coming to him, so I thought to myself, "I'll go on my merry way, making more and more city-states my allies and protecting them from the menace of France - and each other. This system obviously works, and these city-states supply me with enough that maintaining my relationships with them is well worth it." Fast forward a few turns and roughly ten ingame years. My buddies the Iroquois publically denounce me, telling the entire world that Im not to be trusted. These were the guys who I not only saved from Napoleon, but gave two entire CITIES to. I was, of course, angry, but shrugged it off and kept going - I had a science victory to get to and couldn't let them get in my way, and if I were to teach them a lesson for their "irrational behavior", it would only solidify their claims in the eyes of the rest of the world. A science victory would require me to devote much more energy to the production of scientific advancements and certain buildings required to accomplish this goal than I would be able to afford if I had a war or two on my hands. Then I realized something - Budapest had been churning out things like SAMs, armored tanks, rocket artillery, things far beyond anyone's technological progress but my own, and giving most of it (but by no means all of it) to me, their ally and sworn protector. Of course I didnt realize the implications of this until Darius (remember Darius?) denounced me, too. I didnt think anything of it because that guy was always denouncing me, but then I remembered when Stockholm razed his city and something clicks - Im singlehandedly responsible for that, as well as the decimation of the French countryside by Budapests new military forces, which I also viewed as righteous retribution, in a sense. The French had been weakened so badly already, but Budapest was in a state of CONSTANT WAR with them. Even being passive and supplying them with resources and the occasional few pieces of gold was tearing France apart. Stockholms razing of Dariuss city was because of me. What I hadn't counted on was the Iroquois realizing that for themselves, let alone their negative reaction to it. I mean, I had been protecting the little guy, maybe even the good guy, the whole time! Stockholm... would've been wiped out if I had just stood by and watched... right? But Darius's military was, as I had proved, too weak to wipe out a colony of ants without foreign aid, and I had supplied their mortal enemies, Stockholm, with ing ARMORED TANKS. Stockholm also happened to be right near Hiawathas land, and was never *my* ally despite the units I gave them. In fact... They had been marauding near the outskirts of the Iroquois borders ever since I gave them the military technology they needed to defeat Dariuss invasion. I had singlehandedly thrown half the world into a state of complete and total chaos without even realizing it, and even believed that I was a savior and that I had done a good deed, ending with the complete and total ruination of not just half the world, but even the alliances I had built up over hundreds of ingame years of diplomacy, with all the other world leaders distrusting or blatantly loathing Japan. Just the fact that this is possible in this game at such a low, *casual* difficulty despite how simplistic the game appears on the surface is wonderful, and I didn't even MENTION the gameplay, the strategic depth, the multiplayer, the absolutely-ing-everything - I could go on and on about this game, every aspect is wonderful. I love it. I honestly can't bring myself to say anything bad about it - this is, without question, my favorite TBS game of all time. Ten out of ing ten, absolutely brilliant. edit: I wrote this forever ago (read: like a year) and as much as i'm cringing at my past self's writing I still agree with it, so that should tell you something about this game if you're still not convinced

review: If you're new to Civlization, this is where to start. Everything is simplified for the better, even if you're new to stradegy, it has a lot of difficulty settings. This is one of the best, most complete stradegy games once you buy its 2 expansion packs, Gods & Kings + Brave New World (Not needed but recommended) There are 5 different types of victory, they are Cultural, Domination, Space misson, 2055 and Diplomatic. They are all fun to go for. This is a stragey with some thinking involved and a lot of map/game options and great mods are on the workshop, so you could end up with hundreds and hundreds of hours eventually withnout noticing. Basically, you start in anicents times and settle your first city with nothing, you have to then guide your Cilization to stand `The test of time` right through to 'da future! Only ONE Civilization can be victorious. So aim for victory ahead of everyone else. There is Multiplayer but I prefer not to stick to that 'due to people not finishing games. A standared game can last litterly a full day. Recommended to anyone who hasn't played Civlization.

review: This game is one of a kind. Well, along with Civilizations 1, II, III, and IV. If you enjoyed other Civilizations games, it's highly likely you will enjoy this one as well. There are a few things that are notably different from other versions of Civilizations. The most obvious is the units per tile restrictions. In Civ 5, there is only allowed 1 unit type per tile, meaning only 1 combat unit can be on any tile. In some ways it's better, in some it's worse, but it does lend itself to strategy of positioning of your army being much more important than in earlier versions. Another is that cities, when attacked, take damage themselves instead of any unit defending. I believe it's related to the 1 unit type per tile, because it would be odd if you only had to kill one unit to take a city. These two differences from earlier versions does give the game a different feel from earlier versions, but it does still feel much more similar to Civilizations than it does to a game like Colonization/Civ4Col, although not that it would be a bad thing if it was similar to Colonization, another great Sid Meier game. Overall I highly recommend it to anyone considering, just make sure you have time to play because you will be hooked.

review: What else to say than: "Just... One... More... Turn..." The legendary series/franchise/time-consuming-void, that is Civilization, continues to conquer the hearts of all us would-be world leaders who lacks the ambition, and are too lazy, to strive for power outside of the digital realm. To ascertain whether or not to play Civilization, there is really only one question you need ask yourself: "How many days off can i afford before getting fired?" If the answer is below five, you should probably leave now. I'm serious. Leave! Anyhow. If you have never before played Civilization, you owe it to yourself to try it. You will not regret it. (except for when you get fired, of course.) It is simply awe-inspiringly brilliant. An epic journey through history. Rewriting history.

review: Too bad I'm not completely fluent in any other languages yet, because English certainly doesn't have the words to describe how epic this game is. I'm currently playing my bazillionth game, and I've played nearly 750 hours, but every game still feels like a brand new experience. The UI is probably the most user-friendly in any game ever, and the music is just plain awesome, plus every game is randomly generated. There's a demo; download it and you'll see what I mean. So when you DO get hooked, and you DO dish out 80 bucks for the Gold edition plus Brave New World (as you should!), don't get upset when you start failing your classes or missing work because you played all night and didn't even notice, because trust me, your time is better spent here.

review: Fireaxis has managed to pull off a fantastic game here - Civilization V has a very in-depth play system that is easy to understand for beginners, and yet complex enough to keep even the most advanced user thinking. The turn-based system is quite fair, though a little bit does rely on luck if you're playing multiplayer (Who gets to host is 1st player, and thus gets "Priority" on wonders, so if both you and player 1 have 1 turn left on The Great Library, Player 1 will get it first), but I personally play a lot of singleplayer. The bot difficulty level increases at a high rate as you go up - 1 is basically playing against yourself, 2 may be challenging for someone learning the game, 3 is an ok difficulty, though still a bit easy, 4 is the equivalent of a moderately skilled human player, and 5 has the tactic of a skilled player, plus extra science/food/production, so I personally play on level 4. I won't go into details about levels 6-8, because I've never tried them, nor do I plan to in the near future. The UI is quite user-friendly - If there is an action that needs to be done, it will show up in the lower-right corner just above the minimap. There are 4 "advisors" that help new players understand what to build, and how it will benefit them, as well as whether or not to attack an enemy unit, and even who you may stand a chance against in a total war! Spies also add a new level of strategy to the game, as you must decide whether you will try to steal technology from other people, or if you will protect your own technology. Then you add spy promotions, in which Recruits will almost always be beaten by Agents, who will almost always be beaten by Special Agents. By changing spies around that have different promotions, you can achieve a different level of defense and offense in espionage. For example, if you want to steal from a country that has lots of tech, but you just want intrigue about another nation that has little tech, you can send your Special Agent over to the country that has lots of tech, and your Recruit to the other nation. Overall, this is a really fun game, the only drawback is it's price, but if it ever goes on sale, it is definitely worth picking up if you're into strategy games.

review: Nuked Japan while Germany watches, grabbing a hold of Rome as their precious ally turns into dust before their very eyes. Germany looks to Rome and asks them to push their Giant Death Robots towards my capital, dubbed "Temple Prime (obvious reference)". The robots march their way into a mountainous area where a wall of mountain protects several missile launcher platforms (MRLS basically) who launch a barrage at them. Rome pulls back the robots but then, what's this? An army of XCOM soldiers rip the poor robots to shreds. The robot survivor reported to Rome that Russia has taken over the middle-eastern regions and pushed toward Europe, with Rome being the meat shield of Germany. Caesar looks at his ally and goes "Wait, what?" and was suddenly silenced when a reign of nuclear warheads wipe out his only defending army. Cities tremble under Russian troops who then surround the German capital. Germany goes and askes if there can be peace. Catherine then gives out a "lol nope" then proceeds to demolish the capital with it's main army on the OTHER SIDE OF THE CONTINENT... Great game, nice AI, interesting terrain, awesome gameplay.

review: *NOTE: This review includes the Brave New World add-on, it makes the game alot better. Trust me!* Alexander the Great (Greece) reviews the components needed to make the Spaceship. He notices that he needs the engine, but doesn't have the proper technology to obtain this piece for a Scientific victory. Angered at this, he asks his remaining friends for some research agreements to get the tech he needs to win. He gets two from his friends, Ramkhamhaeng (Did I spell that right? Anyway, Siam) and also Pedro II (Brazil) but it wouldn't go into effect for about 30 turns. Alex just groans and begins to switch up his productions and his science so he can aim toward getting that engine. Oda Nobunaga (Japan) then begins to take down Ramesses II's (Egypt) last city, which was his capital. Siam gets angered by seeing that Oda is taking down all of their allies, and attempts to charge at him. Japan was able to sweep his army and destroyed all of his cities with his deadly ability where wounded units still fight at full strength. Pedro II sends a Spy to Oda's capital to see where he will strike next: Him or Alex. Alex and Pedro set up some defenses and attempt to build a wall to defend themself from this unstoppable force. Oda decides to hit Pedro first, and slowly takes down all of his cities, one by one, and took down Rio de Janeiro. The Greek forces began to hold the enemy Marines and Paratroopers off. After a successful ambush by an XCOM Unit, Alexander had some time to finish up the engine technology. The next turn, Sparta and all of the other cities besides Athens were destroyed by Oda's unstoppable force. However, right when Oda was about to charge in and destroy Greece, both Research Agreements were used and got the technology needed. Alex quickly moved all his units away from Athens and used his remaining gold to purchase the engine. It was pricey, but he was able to attach it to the Spaceship. Japanese units were closing in fast, and the Greek soldiers started dying quickly, but right when the artillery was about to fire, they all see the glorius sight of a spaceship flying in the sky and going to space. Oda looks at the spaceship and starts yelling in defeat, knowing that he lost to Greece with a Scientific victory, right when they were about to get a Domination victory. In Civilization V, or Civ, those events are actually pretty common. It takes a little while to get used to, but once you get into it, it becomes very addictive to the point you haven't slept in days. Yep, days. My head is pretty rotten right now from playing this, but god, you NEED this game. If you got to purchase any game on Steam for free, make it this. Just buy it. You WILL love it, and I guarantee it. Even if the AI can be annoying... But yeah, just friggin BUY IT. Why are you still reading this!? Why haven't bought this game yet? Gandhi is going to NUKE YOU SO HARD, he could just- *whack* Hello, Gandhi here. You better buy this game or else I'm willing to nuke you and your cities. And your family. And your friends. And everyone you know. And just about everyone else on this planet. 11/10

review: I am the peaceful nation of the Celts. We shall be the nation of religion, and of diplomacy. This went well; we ended up next to the Babylonians, and we expanded nicely in peace. However, I have always believed in "dibs", so I placed down Glasgow onto the land between us, to provide a little buffer. They seemed annoyed by this. A few warriors glared at each other across our borders for a few hundred years, but otherwise, nothing too bad happened. In order to spread our religion further (because we were known for our Confucian beliefs which helped us grow our borders and spread our religion faster), we begin to invest in boats. Soon we covered the oceans in missionaries, Inquisitor and warriors to help defend our religious allies. Babylon was making friends with a local city state, Genoa. However, they were trying to spread Zoroastrianism; those heathens! Despite both our religions being known for their peace, we passive-aggressively sent missionary and Inquisitor to Genoa. Over the course of about 700 years, we had probably burned a few thousand people for swapping religions; those same Warriors had been given spears now, but they continue to glare at each other from across the borders. I offer Babylon some sugar for their spice; they wanted my sugar, iron, coal and all of my money. I then asked Germany if they wanted sugar for spice; they accepted. North of me, Rome had begun a war with France. Due to my time of peace and massive amounts of trade, I found myself with a huge amount of money. Everytime France and Rome made peace, I knew that Rome was beginning to look on my relatively peaceful country with greedy eyes. So I bought... I gifted many city states my religion and gold, and then I bought... gifted France and Germany enough money to declare with with Rome. While they fought, my Spearmen (now Musketmen) continued to glare with Babylon's, and we continued our 1500 year religious passive-aggression over Genoa. They said I was spying on them; I said I wouldn't. When my spies returned, I sent them back to Babylon. A squad of 5 Great Prophets charged into Babylon, converting left, right and centre. Babylon complained I was being a bit aggressive. I apologised. I then sent more missionaries to Babylon. I had now found every single Civilization; we decided to have a United Nations meeting in 1600A.D. I, as the host, gave everyone a single vote. Except myself. I gave myself 16, due to my popularity. I declared my religion to be the world religion. Every one opposed. I listened to their opinions, and then passed it anyway. When Rome got angry about this, I then paid France to declare war again. When Babylon got angry, I then paid Rome to declare war on them. My civilians were amazingly happy; hugely more than any other place. But because I was an Emperor, they declared me Declis the Terrible; despite my universal healthcare, happy citizens, peaceful religion, not a single war in my entire history and massive popularity in the word. My army consisted of mostly my friends, my city states, and my Musketmen (now Great War Infantry) continued to glare at the Babylonian Great War Infantry, after 2000+ years. A great duty to my nation, their descendants shall continue to frown at the Babylonians until the civilizations of the world fall. Eventually we reached a grand United Nations meeting; I sat on one side of the chamber with my 12 City State friends, and the other 7 nations glared at me from the other side. I said that the People's Confucian Republican Empire of Scotland was the best nation in the world. They all voted against me. I smiled, and then declared I won anyway. Democracy is overrated. Freedom of religion only applies to my religion. I don't need to be stronger when I'm more popular (and my people are probably more beautiful). And if you don't like me, I'll pay your best friend to backstab you. Through this, I came to understand American foreign policy. So Civilization is if nothing else, an educational tool.

review: I've done the 1000 hour mark today, it is time for a review now: This game is just fantastic. The game is easy to learn, but in the end it will surprise you with its complexity. I must not only pay attention to how I set up my cities before the war begins to rare luxury resources. I have to take care of my religion and culture, while Wonders of the World built and new technologies are explored. Incidentally, my population is dissatisfied and my neighbor is spying me. In the end, it's time for the atomic bomb! In addition, there are numerous scenarios, each with their own requirements. In short: With my previous 1000 hours play time, I'm not done yet. Please don't forget to rate my review if it was helpful ;)

review: Amazing strategy game. Civilization is one of the best games I've ever played if I want to go casual or have a little thinking. From trade routes to the welfare of your people. From allies with other civilization to building a utopia. And from building an army to starting wars- Wait, those start tears. You play as a random leader (Or pick a leader) with various units and skills and you try to build the perfect civilization or beat the other players (Other civilization) in a war until you are the last one alive. You have to worry about gold income, happiness of your people, and the welfare for the population to go up and a growing civilization. What I really like is the personality of each of the AI playes if you play solo (I think it can happen in multiplayer too). As for the victory, so far, you have to build a utopia (Adopt 5 full policy) or be the last civilization. And that means, you guessed it, war. It is also a game of trust if a civilization likes you or not (Or a player decides). Interesting facts: George Washington adopted communist in the year of 1400 AD. Napoleon Bonaparte was a huge a-hole around other civilizations and declares war after being on their good side. Askia Mohammad is friendly even if he is carrying a sword and has a burning kingdom behind him. Mohandas Gandhi has disposable nukes in his closet. Sources: This game

review: Civilization V is one of the most interesting strategy games I've ever seen! This game gives you absolute freedom. You can build anything you want, you can conquer any country you want, you can buy everything and everybody (yeah) you want, you can explore new territories, you can create your own GREAT empire. Don't know how to start? Your councillors will give you some advice. Don't want to play it only by yourself? You can take your friends to play with you. Moreover, everything is accompanied by various sounds; figures are not static. And what I found really good is that you don't have to do boring quests like:"Build 10 factories and 5 farms", because you decide what to do by YOURSELF. I think that everyone, who like strategy games, should try this one. It worth every penny (btw, it isn't expensive at all).

The next thing you know, he's knocking at your door with his false promises of friendship and his army of missionaries carrying nukes. You want to start that awesome new religion, Bejebus cHeist? Hindu Missionaries. Want to get rid of the Hinduism religion that's spreading throughout your cities? Hindu Missionaries. You want to spread Bejebus cHeist to Delhi? Hindu Missionaries with Nukes. Gandi don't mess around.

review: Ok. Where should I start? How I'm in love with history of humankind? Or how Sid Meier made a deity of history-based sandbox games? Nope, there are too little space for that. Do we need some comparisons, like with Paradox games or Total War series? Nah, they are distinct. Too many details, too narrative. Those games are awesome, no doubt, but not in an aerial way, like Civilization does. Main catch of this game is in its simplicity. Everybody can rule an empire there. Though, it's a sandbox, it has a different face for every player. You want to rage a war and hold the whole world under your color - do that. Or you want to be in peace with everybody? Oh, you can do that too, in dozens of variants. Dozens? I mean, thousands! The devil is in the details, you know. Civilization V - is a peak of long lasting walk. I liked first and second games, especially second, those fundamentalists are gorgeous. I'm still prefering third Civilization, when I'm going for domination victory. Fourth game feels like Win Vista to me... Overall, fifth Civ game - the most complex and balanced of all. Cultural achievments, market deals, political unions, and religion issue - all are far better than before. If I was supposed to play in one game for life, there are good chances that I'd picked that one. One thing I have to add - no matter what strategy you want to use: make a Louvre and Hermitage full of stuff, build a spaceship, or run the league of nations - you want an army. Your army. Every strong player could tell you that. History tells you that. Today news, like Ukranian story, telling you the very same. If you don't feed own army, soon you're gonna be feeding somebody else. Si vis pacem, para bellum. Peace, people. Make love, not war. Mark? 10/10 of course!

review: One day while I was walking down a serene path I encountered a grave evil that I myself could not have possibly defeated alone. There they were, the great Khan and the great Ghandi marching side by side down a path towards my empire! I the great Paccal, of course, could not let this great transgression aside. So I talked to my great correspondent Frezdful calfrul and asked him for holy advice. He, by smoking a green plant and drinking the blood of sheep, had great premonitions and then told me only by sacrificing my relatives that I could defeat the great evil headed towards my empire. My unbreakable belief in my correspondent lead me to an awakened power deep within the bottom half of my body and there I was flaying my relatives and sacrificing them towards the great sun king. This, of course, manifested a great power within myself. I became ferrocia the great lizard king. I uttered a few words "feerotoa aoiasjiogjoiasj" and by doing those measly acts I increased my kingdom's science output to >9000 and construction to >9000 and built many troops over my 5 city large empire. Truly, it was something to behold.. . as I built an army of xcom and death robots to shatter the power my opponents held. They were at my mercy. And that is the story of me, the great gozz.

There is many different modes to play and multiple ways to win and no two games are ever alike. There is also a ton of mods for this game! So check out the workshop. You will easily lose hours to this game and I can't keep track of how many times I say "Just one more turn" and never realize how late it is until after the fact. If you don't own this game already you are seriously missing out.

review: Civilization: The bread and butter of turn-based strategy games. The absolute pinnacle of eye-needling, back-breaking thousand upon thousand of turns over the course of what I think are the longest "games" you'll ever play. The only game that's longer than a Civ marathon game is life itself. As a huge (pirate) player of Civ4 + expansions I must say I am pleasently surprised with Civ5. I though it was lacking the depth the fourth had, but in reality it's just overall better; (everything probably due to the fact that death stacks are no longer in the game) ------------------------------------------------------------- 9/10 Strategy - if you're a fan of anything that involves tactics, macro-managing, resource-management, general strategy you'll feel at home in this game. Everything is so smooth and straightforward you'll be dying to pass the test of time and try your best to emerge victorious as the greatest civilization. Skill roof is damn high and it's one of those games that's hard to master. Definitely a collosus of the strategy community. Cons: AI in the game is barely potty-trained. It just follows a given route most of the time and it's painstakingly predictable once you played a lot. ------------------------------------------------------------- 8/10 Multiplayer - Awarded a 7.5 because multiplayer, as a concept for this game,is impossible without dedication and a group of friends to meet-up around the clock at various points during a week to pick up on "the last save". It's hard to set up, but boy it's so much fun. Really worth going for multi. Singleplayer rocks a lot if you don't manage to find friends. Cons: Time consuming, difficult to maintain a game or find people who will. ------------------------------------------------------------- 10/10 Game Mechanics - Combat and tactics are just so satisfying compared to old Civ games. Tech advances are meaningful. Territorial management makes you feel like you own your civilization. Balance is properly set, with the exception of the "spawn roulette" that will obviously give random locations with random benefits and resources. Maps are great. Modding community went to space and there's a lot to be imported from their work. Learning curve can go through your regular linear graphs. Everything is intuitive and easy to learn. One game that has a whole lot of depth. Cons: Haven't found any negatives on the game mechanic side ------------------------------------------------------------- 9/10 UI and Graphic style - Everything is smooth as butter. The Devteam have done a great job with this game and everything is polished. Graphic style fits beautifully with the nature of the game and it doesn't distract you from the important part: the game itself. Cons: I would love to have more data and info instead of this minimalism, but that's just me ------------------------------------------------------------- DLCs aren't that great, the only real advantage for me would be the modding community, that usually moves fast towards modding the expansions. Cons: DLC/Expansions. They cost money and divide the community. ------------------------------------------------------------- Big fan of this game and the series. Few games have managed to make me wish for "one more turn" until the sun rose the second day and my clock showed me 7 AM, and this is one of those games. The great heir to the previous stellar game and I recommend it to anyone with any of the following: - time on his hands - great love for strategy - great love for turn-based games - some playful love of history - friends you can play with - money to spare (check discounts if possible) ~ ~ ~ ~ 9 / 10 ~ ~ ~ ~

review: I had a family once. A life. Then i discovered Civilization 5. 'Come outside, daddy! It's snowing!', my child would say. 'In a minute, honey.', I'd reply, 'Monty is threatening me with war unless i meet his demands, and i can't look weak in front of Byzantine!'. Weeks passed. Centuries. My empire had grown large, powerful. I had it all in the palm of my hand. The Pyramids had rose before me. The secrets of the nuclear age were but a click before my command. My people were happy, lively. I had created not a kingdom, but an existence. But alas, all things must come to an end. The wife got sick of me not paying attention to her; The kids had already grown up and started going to school. I checked my hours on steam. '4102 hours on record? no..that can't be right!', i announced loudly. I arose from the chair, my sweat had partially ruined the leather seating at this point, and the smell made her gag. I begged, pleaded. 'Please, i love you! We all make mistakes! Take me back!..right after i finish this last turn!'. One turn. My army was in place for the final strike. All enemies, friends, allies would fall with this one swoop. All i needed was one final turn. It was my legacy, my life, my dedication..Or my family. In the end, looking back, i believe i made the right choice. Civ 5 is a hell of a good game, after all, and love comes and goes much easier than an alliance with Austria that doesn't end in a backstab.

review: Civilization V is one of the best turn-based strategy games Ive ever had the pleasure of playing. Whether teaming up with my friends for some multiplayer, or simply losing a whole night of sleep to the games endlessly replayable single player, this is one game that any strategy enthusiast, or, hell anyone strat-curious should check out. Sure, I miss some of the deeper inter-civilization relations that the more defined religion and government setup brought in Civilization IV, but thats nothing anyone new to the series will even think twice about. With all the tips, advisers and tools in place, this is the first Civilization for PC that I feel is worth just about every persons time. Go forth and create, subdue, and exploit. Do as Firaxis has done, and bring Civilization to the masses.

review: Civilization games keep getting better and better! Civilization V is the latest, and arguably the greatest in the series. Lots of leaders to pick from, and every expansion has added a lot of depth to the game. With several victory conditions and different civilizations with their own strengths and weaknesses to choose from, replayability is endless. Playing with friends in a FFA against AI's civs for hours at a time is also fun. Highly recommended if you're a turn-based strategy fan.

review: Why haven't you bought this incredible game yet?! Words can't discribe the necessity for you to play this game. It is every strategy game player's wet dream of balance, war and progress. Turn your brain on and start playing! You will cry, you will laugh. You will feel pain, you will feel pride. You will fall in love and you will get your heart broken. Build the greatest world wonders behind your big walls and keep peace with your neighbours or conquer the world and burn cities to the ground! Discover the seven seas with your beautiful frigates or drop the nuke on your worst enemy. Create and rule a nation with endless borders, research advanced technologies to keep ahead of your enemies and understand the true meaning of uncle Ben's words "With great power comes great responsibility" when you ride across the ashes of your foes. Team up with your friends or fight them in weeklong multiplayer matches! Learn what "epic" means, challenge yourself and be amazed by yourself when you raise from a hopeless situation! Get it, play it and thank me later.

review: This game is just perfect, as a Total War veteran I was a bit put off by the lack of TW's real time combat. I thought that I'd loose interest in managing a single map, well I was wrong. This game is so amazing that even if they'd scrap the combat entirely I'd still love it. Being my first Civilization game I found it really easy to get into and enjoy, the expansions are great too, although I didn't have much time to play Brave New World yet. I wholeheartedly recommend this game to veteran strategy fans and newcomers to the genre alike.

review: Dwarved by the expectations of feature-hungry fans and a remarkably successful history, the Civilization series is one of the last bastions of traditional, turn-based 4X strategy games, perhaps acting as the sole major life support for an increasingly whittling genre. In retrospect, it is a game that initially failed on many fronts. Upon launch it was rightly heavily criticised for under-performing in many aspects that Civ 4 had proudly refined - trading, religion, and diplomacy, amongst others. However, with the addition of both expansions, "Brave New World" and "Gods and Kings", Civ 5 recovered most of the features it had lost or underdelivered on. Regardless, issues regarding bugs, illogical AI, poor performance, online connectivity issues and abusively priced DLC remain open wounds to this very day. Firaxis has now had 4 years to deal with at least some of the game's remaining problems, but have instead neglected them, preferring to focus on Civilization: Beyond Earth. Overlooking the aforementioned issues, however, will reveal a deep, rewarding, well paced game in which planning ahead is rewarded with the chance to steamroll enemy civilisations. Victories can be achieved either using culture, tourism, science, military force, or diplomacy, laying the groundwork for day-long matches that can twist and turn whilst simultaneously providing endless intrigue, machiavellian scheming and gargantuan military campaigns. Rushing to build the next World Wonder is often equally as thrilling as pillaging a hostile city's tiles whilst trading with allied civilisations for emergency gold supplies in order to purchase those last few bombers needed to take the heavily fortified city. Should you prefer to take a more Littlefinger-esque approach, spies can steal technology, manipulate voting and even provide political intrigue and military intelligence; embargoes can cripple trade-based economies; even international congress votes can be traded for luxuries, resoruces and cities. Allegiances are frequently earned and lost, ensuring the game is never predictable, and with the seemingly endless policies, technologies, units and ways to turn your initial settlers into a sprawling, international empire, Civilisation 5 provides plenty of replayability to be a staple of your gaming time for years. Just bare in mind that if you want to get the most out of the game, you will absolutely have to read its built-in wiki to make up for the needlessley steep learning curve and often infuriating lack of vital information.

review: I got this game because my friend told me this was kind of similar to the Sims 3 (I love this game :3). It is quite fun so far: my people are building houses, learning archery, and getting cute horses to visit their neighbours. However, my asian neighbour isn't really friendly; he always wants to fight with my people (I know he's asian, because he introduced himself, and he said he was mongolian, and i know it is in Asia). Come on, he is worse than a high school girl. >:C Anyway! I gave him a bit of gold and then we stopped fighting and became best friends (forever i hope hihihi ^_^); i wish i could have made my soldier hug him, like in the Sims 3, but i couldn't find this option. Oh well. Lots of adventures ahead of me: i'm so excited! =D

review: One of the best turn-based strategy games I've ever had the pleasure of playing. 2K Games have outdone themselves in making some massive changes without changing the core gameplay and alienating their fans.Improvements to the user interface and AI at all levels result in it being more approachable for newcomers without losing any of the strategic depth that long-time fans crave. It vastly improves combat, making the micro-level gameplay both more complex and entertaining. It trims all the fat, leaving only decision-making, strategic planning, and the sheer joy of crushing your enemies. Civ V is the pinnacle of the franchise to date.As a hardcore strategy gamer who is no stranger to planning out my empire's production dozens of turns in advance, I've already turned to Civ V for my world-conquering needs  but at the same time, if anything is going to rear a new generation of strategy gamers like the very first Civilization did for me, it's this.Civilization V is a fantastic entry in the series, which avoids the trap of getting stagnant thanks to some important novelties on combat system, interface and general design, designed to create a 4X of elegant and clean mechanics.

review: Probably one of the best games I've played. It has a lot of great mods to it, which lets me play as the Civilizations of my favorite TV shows/video games. At first I was a bit unsure on how good the game actually was, but after about an hour of playing it I got the hang of it and it has now become one of my favorite strategy games that I own. I do enjoy other strategy games, but I prefer this one the most. Now if you are thinking about getting this game, be warned that it is addicting. I have played hours upon hours of this game. After a while of playing you will say "One more turn. One more turn. One more turn." and eventually you'll get to about 100 or 200 extra turns. Is it just me there? Because that's what I do. But anyway, this is an amazing game and I suggest it to all my friends (one of my friends that doesn't enjoy strategy games too much even likes this one) and I suggest this to whoever is reading it.

review: My review is mostly related to the single player part and the AI of the game, which i both consider to be very relevant in this game. First of all: With the BNW add-on the CIV5 game gained new potential. Especially in late-game the game has become a lot better. However, Civilization 5 still lacks a lot of the strategic component of former installments of CIV or Alpha Centauri (one of my all-time favourite games). Especially without GK and BNW the game is very simplistic and strategically non-challenging, offering few ways to win and few actual decision-making. This is a shame, especially when comparing the game to its predecessors. With BNW the strategic component got a lot better, allowing many different paths to victory, exploring new strategies, and finally giving culture an actual purpose and allowing you to win with culture. A downside however is, that the different civilizations and leaders are poorly balanced. For example when playing at the last two difficulties, it seem almost impossible to win (unless you use specific AI and gameplay exploits...). This is mostly the case because it is generally not possible to keep up with the rapid technology advance and army production of the AI. The AI can do this because it receives massive bonusses and you receive a massive handicap. As an effect of the research and construction speed handicap, you will very often find yourself in a situation where you cannot build certain wonders in your game, even with an ultimately optimised building strategy and a perfect starting position - which is quite frustrating and will limit your selection of feasible strategies in higher difficulties, to a small selection - most of which are based on exploiting the overall weak choices the AI makes in wars. The AI also often reacts irrational and seems random, for example the way it changes from being your best friend, to backstabbing you and siding with your enemy, in just one turn, or when they declare war on you despite the immediate outcome being obviously negative for that civilisation as well as already having another enemy at its neck. The options for diplomatic interaction are overall weak. My main point of criticism is that the AI is dumb to the point that it can only be seen as challenging by that it produces a lot of military units and advances a lot faster in technology than you. This also means that you inevitably have to prepare for often long wars against an ridiculously large stream of enemy units that you might often destroy easily due to the AI's weak decision-making while attacking. Often you can only win with perfect start position and by exploiting certain game mechanics and the mentioned lack of AI tactics. This is what makes this game of little interest to me. A strategy game that offers a lot of different ways to win needs a good AI and not one that acts as military-unit factory. For example, games with the difficulty setting at which the AI has the same handicaps as you feel like a pony-ride to any halfway experienced player, even when there are lots of rivaling civilisations on the map. However, once you play at higher difficulties, the AI plays with the exact some behavior and underlying "intelligence" but can manage to be ahead of you at all times in matters of creating wonders, researching technologies, producing culture, and army. At the "king" difficulty, where you already have penalties, I found it possible to win pretty much any game at any starting position with any civilisations or leaders. But at the last two difficulties the AI advantage becomes clearly unfair, the intelligence of the AI however is still not any better. It is apparent that the AI "knows" what goes on on the entire map and will use this knowledge to its advantage. In addition, the advantages it receives are not possible to be compensate using smart decisions. For example, at Deity difficulty, Firaxis basically throws you into a gladiator fight where you play a limbless and "slow" person. You fight against dumb, aggressive and cheating brutes that will turn hostile at some point, no matter what. Sounds more fun than it is. I found it to be still possible to win at deity, but you are WILL find yourself limited to a very very small set of tactics and choices and even leaders: The most likely option to win is militaristically: you have to wait for your enemy's rare appearance of a weakness, at which point you have to attack with your limbless body hitting the enemy gladiator continuously, which will feel like cracking a hard nutshell with a rubber spoon, until the target slowly turns into a pudding-like consistency. You will have to forget all the other tactics and playstyles you might have previously liked to use, once you play in that arena you have to stick with what the little that's left, being severly crippled in your abilities and fighting against dumb hostile brutes. Thumbs down for the AI

review: Between the original version, the Gods and Kings expansion, and now Brave new World, I've accumulated 500 hours of gameplay, and it doesn't look like that's stopping any time soon. By itself, Civ V is one of the best strategy games I've ever played; with the right mods (of which there are plenty), it becomes truly addictive. Generally, one of my biggest gripes with empire-building games is that your empire supports your military conquests. In CiV, your military supports your empire. I have maybe one game in ten where I'll initiate a war; most of the time, I'm way too busy creating the most dominant empire in the land. And it varies every time: right now I'm pushing a game where my religion covered half the globe; the game before that, my scientific accomplishments were second to none. Every game is different; if you play the same way every time, you're not going to get far. I can't emphasize enough how important it is to get both expansion packs. Gods and Kings was praised for adding the religion mechanic, but its primary benefit is a major revamp of the combat system and technology tree that makes both of them so much more neat and logical. Brave New World drastically alters both the culture and the diplomacy victories, and both are for the better, forcing you to put effort into those victories through the whole game. And get mods. I can't tell you which ones to get, but absolutely get some. As you play the game, you'll start to notice little things you wish it did differently. And 90% of the time, someone's already made a mod to fix that. I'm playing with over a dozen right now. Some make wonders more usable, some add more luxury resources or religions, one of them makes scouts usable past the medieval era and another removes the cap on XP you can get from barbarians, and a whole mess more. I've actually reached a point where I'm mixing and matching my mods based on what type of game I'm trying to run. This game will very likely become my #1 most played game, and pretty much the only thing that's going to stop me from accumulating 1,000 hours in it is Life. Put this game on your wishlist, pick up the expansion packs during steam sales, and get addicted.

review: With many games more and more emphasizing adrenaline-pumping action, playing a slower paced strategy game like Civilization can be refreshing. Indeed, Civilization V is the kind of game you can sit down, popcorn and soda in hand, and become completely engrossed in political crises, border tensions, and epic battles. While it may not train your reflexes or aiming abilities, you'll certainly find yourself performing insane feats of balance as you try to maintain your Civilization's military defense, culture, scientific advancement, religious development, and economic power. You'll find a game that is admittedly not immediately exciting, but which will involve the player in incredibly complex situations, never playing out the same way each time, always offering a new story. However, there are some valid criticisms worth considering. I will address two primary problems with the game that are connected to smaller issues others have brought up. Firstly, much depth and complexity present in Civilization IV has been stripped from the game, and it shows. In Civilization IV, leaders acted very often according to their historical personalities -- Gandhi would have an aversion to war, wheras Genghis Khan might be attracted to the possibility -- in Civ V, Gandhi will happily crush your entire country to seize your spice resources. The hostility and viciousness of the AI in Civ V, by contrast, detracts from the game's believability. Besides the hostility of the computer players, they are also gloriously stupid, they make insane trade offers, demand whole cities in wartime when they are losing, and capitulate in war when they have the advantage. As deep and involving as the game is, the AI manages to detract from the experience often enough to be worth mentioning. The second criticism worth considering is that too often it breaks the spell of depth and plays more like a strategy game. It IS a strategy game yes, but the game is also about civilization, and how complex and wonderfully intertesting human society can be, and sometimes the play to win mentality that is inherent in the game (especially it's AI) as well as many of the players can weaken the game's ability to absorb the player into the story of human civilization. Beyond these criticisms, the game presents itself well, the interface is much cleaner compared to previous iterations in the series, and the warfare much more interesting. In previous titles, units could be stacked on top of one another, so often the winning of wars came down to who had the most material power to build the biggest unit stacks. As a result of the removal of unit stacking, material power will help, but an ability to position units correctly and actually strategize will win you the battle even in the event you are outnumbered. Thus Civilization V may rightly boast of having the best combat and warfare the series has seen. However shallow the game can be at its' worst, it's intensely engaging and dramatic in the most positive sense at its' best -- every action that is simple or basic in one game is dramatically important in Civilization. For example, moving units close to another Civilization's borders, somewhat tedious and uninteresting at face value, raises the tension as you prepare for an epic war against their evil, imperialistic civilization. In the context of world civilizations, all actions become pronounced and important -- helping the game tell a story of warring global civilizations in crisis rather than simply telling the story of a competitive match between two players, each trying to win. That dramatic worldly context is what allows the game to tell such interesting new stories upon each playthrough and definitely what makes the game so incredibly addicting, involving, and engaging. Despite the admittedly valid criticisms, I couldn't possibly recommend this game more.

review: 50 Hours into your latest save, all is going well. Only 3 leaders left Gandhi, Caesar and Washington. you draft an 'end game' plan in your mind, you will make friends with Gandhi (for obvious reasons he's chill) then procede to befriend Caesar. Then you will take out Washington because he is a  and did not accept an open border agreement 3000 years prior HE MUST PAY. 20 turns later all is going to plan, we are now on Washingtons doorstep, Gandhi and Caesar appear to love and probably fear your superpower nation. All we need to do is eliminate the pesky Americans and ith all our military now on American soil this should not take long. Then after the swift invasion of America we will make a vote for world peace at the U.N (in rome of course) with our new found Indian and Roman brethren it is a sure win! But all of a sudden the distant droning of nuclear sirens start, quickly they become louder and louder, "what is this!?" you think to yourself, a false alarm? You shrug it off maybe Caesae bombing a city state. The game pauses... Gandhi appears on the screen, with a sinister grin he shouts "WAR" in your face. Only seconds after you see a gut wrenching sight. The camera focuses on a nuclear submarine stationed just off the coast of your pride and joy, the capital of your glorious nation. You then hear a rumble, just seconds after a nuclear warhead emerges from the previously hidden submarine, you realise it is too late... you can only watch as the missle closes in. As your city goes up in a giant cloud there are short lived screams from your beloved people, then silence. Before what had just occurred had sunk in, before you could make rescue efforts to save your much loved citizens the humming of quiet engines fall upon your ears. Suddenly countless 'stealth bombers' appear seemingly out of no where, soon the sky is blackened by planes, the game falls almost silent only the whistle of falling bombs remains. You faint from the shock of what is unfolding. You awake shortly after, Gandhi is still flattening what remains of your once prosperous empire, now with 'giant death robots' making the most of his seemingly never ending turn. As Gandhi clinically and relentlessly razes what's left of your broken nation all you can do is weep, your people hacked down in their prime and your glorious nation so mighty just minutes before has just been been all but eliminated in 1 turn. Why oh why did you turn of autosave? did it really speed your game up? was it worth it? Ghandi is a complete , he acts like your friend but WILL nuke the  out of you if even the slightest oppurtunity presents itself. 10/10

review: Play the game. Mod the game. Read guides on the game. Play the game some more. This has become one of my favorite games, if you love history or like strategy games (or both like me) than do yourself a favor and pick this game up! Pros +Good graphics, detailed leader-scenes. +Simple enough mechanics to grasp in a few hours, but complex enough to take a few hundred hours to master. I have nearly 600 hours and i'm still learning new stuff and mastering old stuff. +Good variety of (fairly balanced) civs. A lot of Civs have unique and fun play-styles like Venice only having 1 city but double trade routes, Polynesias incredible naval recon and warfare and Brazils amazing mod-game tourism output come to mind. +Good amount of history to learn, it's also made me look at other cultures (Hawaiian and plains-native americans) completely different and made me more interested in them. +Great mods, ever want to conquer North Korea as Beavis and Butthead? Or Patrick Star? You can do that! The modding community is not as awesome as Civ IVs but its still amazing. +Ximicacan! Ximicacan! Ximicacan! -Cons -Serious con: Vanilla Civ V isn't that great, the game becomes truly great with its expansion packs so try to buy the complete edition if you can! -Unit variety could use some major work. It just doesn't feel right using Polynesian trebuchets, Mayan Frigates and Zulu Crossbowmen etc. -Tech tree isn't quite as expansive as in Civ IV. -Some civs are just boring and uninteresting like America or Iroquois. -Game has made me neglect my other games...

review: I spent 28 hours, over four days building my empire. I spent every minute I could infront of the screen expanding and fconquering, trading and building, researching and discussing with other civilizations. Every second I was away from the computer this game was on my mind. When I closed my eyes I saw Ghengis Kahn fulfiling his destiny, trying to rule the world. I was fired from my job after attacking a customer that looked like Ghandi, screaming that he was the reason that my people were wearing blue jeans and listening to low quality music. I was driving down to dinner with my girlfriend, when we hit a rabbit, she broke down crying, hysterical, and urged me to get out of the car and help the slain animal, but all my mind could do is turn to her and say "A single death is a tragedy. A million deaths is a statistic". After four days I wasnt sleeping, only planning my next move, my eyes were red, my hair was falling out, and I couldn't stomach solid foods, only energy drinks. I lost to Washington of America, who got a scientific victory when I was one move away from taking over his capital city. Now I have no job, no friends, no girlfriend, and my family stopped talking to me, all because of four days I owned this game. All in all 10/10, would suggest to friends/SO/co-workers if I had any.

review: Sid Meier's Civilization V is a 4X turn-based strategy from 2K Games. Once you start playing this, you can't stop. Civilization V is just a good game. It has one more turn factor which makes you want to keep playing even when you already won. Sid Meier's Civilization V has very deep and challenging gameplay. You start from scratch with only a settler and a warrior, build your first capital city, then keep building up your nation/empire. From the dark age of 4000 BC, the dawn of human civilization to the modern globalization age of 2000 AD, you forge your empire from a single capital city and then expand and build more city, do research to strengthen your empire in all aspect, create military power for defense purpose or go on a global conquest, and manage your national economy, culture and diplomacy with other faction. Every unit can be leveled up just like an RPG games which make every unit is unique and count. You can even rename those unit when they level up to make them a little more personal. Choose your own path for your civilization, war, peace, culture, science, all will lead you to great victory. Sid Meier's Civilization V has good graphics quality overall. The maps are beautiful. Unit and city has quite good detail. The UI is also great, you can switch between tactical and world map view. This game is very great and addicting. Sometimes which is most of the times, even if you already won the game, you still continue playing it. I recommend this. Rating 9/10

review: There are three dominant reasons why I recommend this game: 1. No micromanaging 50,000,000,000 things per turn later in the game, unlike other turn-based strategy games like Rome: Total War II. A lot of game mechanics are autonomous, making smooth turn-by-turn play. 2. Nicola Tesla is a Great Engineer in this game. He has done some great stuff for humanity, if you aren't aware. 3. There is a Game Of Thrones mod for this game. There are freakin' Game Of Thrones factions and characters in it. That is amazing. If you don't think it is amazing, go make love to your sister/brother/father/mother/aunt/uncle/nephew/etc. and then try to tell me with a straight face that it is not amazing.

review: I'm finally getting around to playing this after yearning for so long. When it dropped in 2010, I couldn't play it on even medium settings as I tried out the demo. Well, being an all or nothing guy, I didn't want it until I had a PC capable of playing it at max. settings with no hiccups. That wasn't the only thing keeping me from the game, but the announcement of the new hexagonal grid and one military unit per tile rule, I was massively sceptical and honestly didn't think I would go for it. Well, after waiting 4 years and playing religiously for the past week after purchasing it, I can gladly say it's the best move the series has made. I cannot believe I never noticed how mundane stacking 20 units to a tile was, to easily vanquish the enemy without thought. Now, thinking and tactics come into play, and you have to know each unit's attributes, advantages and disadvantages, and suddenly the game series with extrordinary depth, just became that much deeper and more addictive. It's not without some faults, that even with the most recent patch after years of its release, still haven't been fixed. Like for instance, if you have no ground military unit in a city, good luck accessing your missiles and other air units. But these are minor and hardly take away from the yet another incredible addition (or should I say addiction?) to the franchise. 10/10, will rack up far more than the current 47 hours I've put into it, when all is said and done.

review: There's no other game quite like it (even EU IV/CK). Has a lower learning curve in comparison, but it's still a sizable beast to conquer; there are lots of intricate mechanics and strategies you can find yourself learning hundreds of hours into the game. Oh, and it takes forever to finish a game even on Quick so if you're the impatient type, this game may not be for you unless you go Duel/Quick every game. MP is fun. AI becomes much too predictable, so introducing the unpredictability of human thinking into the equation naturally mixes things up. The team mechanics for Co-op are interesting at first, but besides sharing beakers for research, there really isn't much to it and you often end up fighting for things like wonders, land and city-states like any competitor would. Also, no achievements can be unlocked through MP (except the one...), which is mind-boggling. As someone who dislikes the AI, it is annoying having to jump back into SP to get the achievements I would otherwise have received through normal play. Balance wise, there are some aspects that could be improved; there are obviously superior wonders, civs, even resources (I'm looking at you, salt), as well as obviously inferior ones like Angkor Wat, Denmark and most of the plantation luxuries. Some units also have pretty crappy ugprade routes -- Pikeman, the most accessible and strongest Medieval melee unit suddenly becomes an at-best situational anti-cavalry Lancer, and the Crossbowman, also the most accessible and strongest Medieval ranged unit becomes a one range Gatling Gun. Range is huge in this game, so increasing the damage in compensation for the lost one tile of range is like cutting someone, then offering them a band-aid. Technical specifications wise, the graphics are a nice upgrade from IV (and for a game released in 2010, it's fair). Some of the music is pretty awesome, but they're easily forgettable and as I already listen to other music while I'm playing, turning off the music hasn't impacted me at all. All in all, a 9/10. I know most of my review has been negative, but anything not mentioned here, I generally endorse. These were some more pedantic gripes and very subjective, so as always, take everything with a massive mound of salt (those OP ers). P.S. Obligatory "One more turn..."

review: I believe this game is great, but many would disagree... it's the marmite of gaming... up there with the well known Monopoly board game. It's massively time consuming, your friends will get angry if you keep asking them to play and you have to be a die-hard fan of this form of game to bear with it's tedious time consuming yet magnicificant piece of gaming masterpieces. But, it proves to me and many others as a shining beacon, of which pulls you away from the painful, dull and necessary work of life and into the gaping greatly lit tunnel of procrastination and determination. To those ready to Civ... I salute you.

review: Due to the fact i haven't written any reviews for a long time, i feel it is about time i started again with this unanimously magnificent strategy title! What Civilization V constitues is the climax of a renowned series. To begin with ..it looks stunning and its world shines with beautiful and well designed environments. Futhermore when you start immersing yourself deeper inside its universe you will begin discovering more of its many virtues. Not only has this game one of the most sophisticated in-game mechanisms i have ever seen in a strategy title but also it can maintain your interest for years. Trying to offer a detailed insight into Civ V could easily make me write pages over pages though i don't want to become tiresome. Just keep in mind that this game needs patience in order to unfold all its features. On the whole i have no doubt that especially stategy friends are going to adore it!

review: As an experienced Civ series player, Civ V had a rough start initially and was inferior to the expanded version of Civ IV. However, just as Civ IV progressed, so did Civ V through the years. This review reflects Civ V with the 2 expansions (Gods and Kings and Brave New World). Once again, we face the "Just one more turn" syndrome that this game has always provided. This 4x turn-based strategy game continues to evolve by enhancing the multiple victory conditions for the game. Many scenarios are available and the Steam Workshop for Civ now creates easily assessible mods for the game to increase replayability. The AI still makes strategic mistakes, but evens out a bit at the higher difficulty levels due to AI bonuses/player penalties, The end-game has greatly improved over previous iterations of the series due to the enhancements to diplomatic and cultural victory conditions. The replayability and replayability of Civ V is so good, that I will nitpick on a couple of areas for improvement (and mods are out that resovle this too). Those improvement areas are to make the different cultures even more unique (more unique looks between the cultures) and speeding up the preformance on huge maps. Otherwise, this Civ V with the DLCs is an excellent game that will take up just one more turn.

Another really impressive thing is multiplayer option which thanks to turn-based game system is really interesting and well designed.

review: Civilization V would be a very good game if it were not for the shoddy multiplayer and the money grubbing DLC practice. Firstly, the average multiplayer match freezes and crashes. Even if you have less than four players in your match, you will still crash frequently. Multiplayer is not designed well on this game, there are too many gamebreaking glitches to name of which can only be done in multiplayer games. This is because the developers did not pay much attention to polishing this portion of the game, since they seem to have been very busy releasing the 15 (!) pieces of DLC which were made for this game. This DLC has only divided the very tiny multiplayer community further because it can be hard to find a match of people who have the same DLC as you. The singleplayer is where this game shines, the developers obviously spent a huge amount of time polishing this portion of the game, and this is what gives it replay value. You can easily spend six hours on a single game of Civilization V and still want to play more. There are a few balance problems however these are relatively small. Overall Civilization V is my favorite game despite some of the game's shortcomings.

review: Do you like stategy games? Do you like board games? Well then look no further, friend. Welcome home. Civilization's 5th iteration is a great entry in this franchise and is addictive as it is fun. Prepare to loose many hours. Some may tell you this one is a weaker game than 4 or not worth playing without all the DLC. I am not really in that group. I had a lot of fun with the vanilla game. The expansions add depth to mid and late game stages and provide more options for victory, along with new civilizations (each which has its own perks). If you have even a mild itch for strategy games then press buy. Also note this game is VERY moddable - all supported by steam workshop. Which couldnt be easier to use.

review: I want to start off by saying this is a fantastic game, but I think it is worth noting a few flaws to go alongside the many positives which this game has to offer, and reading this review will hopefully help you in deciding whether it worth picking up a copy. So first the pros: This game has an ability like no other game i've played apart from AoE 2 to make time fly, one moment it's 4pm and before you know it you're hunched over besides your computer and it's 11pm, and you still haven't done your maths paper for the day after. The background for music for each Civ is a nice addition, which allows for each Civ to feel unique beyond their colour scheme and unique building,Unit(s) and ability so as you play them the melody keeps things interesting. The gane looks great and is formatted nicely so everything is clean and easy to access, and you rarely feel overpowered by an overabundance of numbers. And now for some cons While at first and religion feels fresh and interesting, as the game advances it quickly becomes a chore even with its increased importance for any deity or cultural victory thanks to BNW. Relgion I found to be much more interesting online vs other human players, as they are likely to suffer from the same boredom you do and makes spreading your religion seem much more meaningful fun as a result. I found myself sometimes being frustrated with a lack of some of the diplomacy tools the Ai have, such as the ability to call you out if you have troops surronding their border, and I hope that for Civ 6 the ai is smarter so this artificial difficulty does not need to be added. My final issue with this game is the lack of balance you find in the policy trees, and games can become stale as you do the same optimal opening strategy over and over, now while you can go for a piety start it is rarely worth it unless you're trolling your friends online, or have some incredibly situational strategy. So all in all I think this is a great game for any pc gamer to pick up, and the flaws I mentioned only really become a issue when you've played as many hours as I have, so what are you waiting for go pick yourself up a copy now!

review: Firaxis games live and die by their expansions, amd Civ V is no exception. The base game feels dumbed-down to appeal to a mass-market boardgaming crowd, and the Gods and Kings expansion adds tacked-on variety but still no depth - systems have no meaningful interaction with each other, and any one decision or strategy feels as good as another, without any lasting consequence. The Brave New World DLC, on the other handm finally gives Civ V the depth you expect from a Civ game, with elegantly interacting system mechanics throughout and actions you take in the Stone Age still delivering payoffs thousands of years later. With Brave New World, Civ V turns from an unfocused and unengaging flop into a must-play strategy title.

You can play it for fun in the prince difficulty and you can challenge yourself in high level difficulties. And it did made me felt challenging, and I cant memorized how much summer class I absented because of it (hahahahaha In a word, this is a very good game. All you need to care is thinking about how to control yourself to stop playing this damn thing.

The game was made perfectly, with no errors at all, for both, Singleplayer and Multiplayer. Battles, science, culture, wonders, religions, maps, characters, bonuses, expansions, all of them are harmonized magnificently. Playing with friends is exciting, 6 hours marathon escalates quickly. At the end, just one more info, I've been playing Civ5 for almost 7 months and even now, I feel no boredom while playing :) 10/10

review: Honestly, Civ could very well be one of the best strategy games I've played (though I'm more a fan of the RTS type stuff, if I'm being completely honest). Picked this up randomly due to a friend talking about the previous one, and although the early game is a bit dull and repetitive, it's well worth the time invested. Multiplayer is amazing, giving you more than the stereotypical "kill your enemy by purchasing units" approach that C&C and Stronghold went with; however, that rush attack is still a really viable strategy for the warmongers like myself. ^.^ as much as I've fallen in love with Civ, its diverse victory conditions, and its generally good gameplay, it falls a bit flat for me at points. The graphics will sometimes bug out randomly, though rarely enough to "break" the game. Also, if you're playing offline against computers, you may as well go solely for domination or a quick cultural victory, as diplomacy is non-existent. AI will attack you after you give them trades, return units, and declare friendships, which takes away from the overall experience - so play either hotseat mode with a couple friends or find a few players in the community online to play with if you want to get the most out of it. Prepare for a long game, as Civ can last quite some time. The learning curve isn't so bad, but it's not a jump in and play game for sure - you really need to get the nuances down and read the tooltips that say what things can do (fortunately, the advisors aren't half bad at keeping you posted). All in all, worth the purchase, so go ahead, pick this game up, and see if your civilization can withstand the test of time. Pros: -Awesome gameplay; can win through multiple methods -Graphics are typically good (barring some random sporadic glitches) -Not a steep learning curve - you can get the basics in one or two games tops -Has a hotseat mode for a more "old-school" multiplayer approach (big deal if you have no internet, or want to play with people who don't own the game -Tons of options to change the game as you please (no barbarians, victory types, etc.) -Lot of modded content for those looking to spice the game up Cons: -AI is frustrating; other leaders will go from allied to at war in a matter of seconds for no real reason -Loading times can be long with multiple players -Graphics can bug out at times -Could use a little more variety across the board (just my opinion) -Montezuma. (Go play a round against him, and you'll get that.)

review: Throughly enjoying this one - I'ts not a total war game yet offers a new type of world domination approach. Main objective is to either out science your enemies, defeat on the battlefield, annex or raise thier cities or go diplomatic and ghandi the crap out of everyone with world peace. Building the effiel tower in Hastings, England & having nuclear subs sink ye olde Austrian pirate boats really will give you a feeling no other game can. Likewise, building nukes and dropping them on your enemies from carriers in the ocean, then moving your workers in to scrub the fallout brings new joy to your fingertips. The game is workshop compatible, and the mod community is thriving with new ones to keep you buzzing and the game fresh. That said there is an unholy number of maps, factions, leaders and civilizations to build, destroy, conquer and make your .

review: This game is such a huge waste of time, you start playing it and next thing you know, a whole week has passed and you've grown a beard and have poostains all over you. I wouldn't want to waste my time any other way. I'm currently sat in hospital for not eating or drinking for a whole week while playing this game but it was worth it. It's my turn now so I must go, I would write more but Gandhi is currently launching nukes at my cities.

review: Sid Meier's Civilization V is the kind of game that almost anyone can get into, even if you are a diehard FPS player, you will likely find some amusement in this game. Civilization V offers a vast variety of ways to play the game, ranging from a campaign-esque scenario mode, to custom games where you pick and choose your opponents (and possibly allies), what kind of map you will be fighting for, and what you will need to do, to win. Do you want to conquer the world? Get a giant earth map, add a dozen or two opponents and fight for world domination! Do you want to start your own religion and watch it spread across the globe like a true pandemic? Well start one, send off your missionaries and start an inquisition, you will be Supreme Pope of Your-Cult-Name-Here soon! Do you want to play out historical battles throughout the history? Well, not much else to be said than: you can! Some people might enjoy setting the difficulty setting all the way down, and steamrolling their opponents; others might do the opposite and try for the challenge of beating the game with a severe handicap. Playstyle plays a huge part in how you will enjoy Civ5, but once you start a map, it is as if it will never end. The multiplayer aspect of the game has both upsides and downsides, when playing with others you need to coordidnate who does what, and it can trim parts of the game from your own experience (as in, you have to share certain wonders, it is not beneficial to have multiple religions and it will suck fighting for superiority). Beyond that, it can be great divvying up an opponents land between you and your friend, for example. Get Civilization V. It is definitely one of my all-time favorites. /One more turn.

review: "Just One more Turn!" is Civilizations unofficial motto, anyone who played the game and enjoyed it will understand. Known as the biggest turn-based strategy game today with it's rather unique hexagon tiled playfield, Civilization has entertained many throughout it's lifespan - myself included. I used to play a bunch load of Civilization III as a kid and Civilization V has done a wonderful job of replacing that for the past 4 years. Back in the days, turn-based strategy games were pretty common but today it feels like most games are real-time. Turn-based means you take turns to make your move rather than everyone making them at the same time, like in every traditional board game. Evidently Sid Meier's Civilization V is the fifth game in the series and it has really just gotten better and better by every game, the core mechanics are always there but with some variation between each game. The fanbase is rather scattered when it comes to agreeing on the best Civilization game, a lot of people still prefer Civ IV, personally I love Civ III a lot but Civ V takes the prize. The main problem with Civilization V when it came was the lack of content compared to what Civ IV already had. Today, 4 years later, tons of DLCs and 2 expansions have been released for the game and it finally has more content than it's predecessor. The game is about to create, reign and fulfill a civilization throughout hundreds of years and overcome the obstacles alongside, either online or vs computers. Explore, expand, exploit and exterminate - 4X - is the best way to describe the typical steps when playing a game of Civilization. Explore is for the first section of the game, where you settle your first city and scout the surounding area for resources or opponents. Expand is when your small settlement becomes several, either through settling another one or through conquest. Exploit is the description of diplomacy, treaties, spionage and rigging elections to make your cause the ultimate. Exterminate is pretty obvious, if diplomacy or expantion does not work, take the matter by the sword (or the nuclear warhead). There are 4 way of winning and becoming the master civilization; Cultural, Diplomatic, Scientific and by Domination. Along those victory types are also paths for your civilization to easier obtain said victories. For example; you could focus your empire on trade and become a superpower through riches. Essentially buying votes for a diplomatic victory, units for domination or technology for science. You could also be the founder of a religion and slowly but steadily gain your trust from the people of other civilizations that way. I was hoping to see a pure Economical and Religious victory condition, but sadly there are none. It feels like I have done pretty much everything in Civilization V since it's release but I still get really tempted to get back in there, and just let the hours disappear. Suddenly you sit there, 5 AM in the morning and be like "What the hell just happened? I am not 12 anymore, I have a f*cking job!". I remember when I used to plan my next move during bathroom breaks, I couldn't even think of something else for 5 minutes! "Just One more Turn!" I am really looking forward to Civilization VI and Civilization: Beyond Earth.

review: Civilization 5 Pros: Turn based strategy, City building, 5 ways to win, large quantity of nations. Cons: Errors, AI Issues Great replay value: One thing Civilization 5 does great is make the game so fun you don't want to quit. You won't want to go to bed, do homework, take a much needed shower or go to work. The truth about this game is that it makes you want to keep playing, you will think to yourself, its 11:30 I need to go to bed, then think i'll be alright one more turn then im done, next time you look at that clock its 5:44 and I have class in three hours. City builder: Something that I love about Civilization 5 is the city building aspect of the game being able to customize what each city produces or specialize that city can give you a huge advantage over your opponents. If you want your city to be able to produce tons of troops or want it to be a mecca for scientific advancement you have the ability to customize, you can make any city what you want or need it to be. Winning: With any game that is a city builder there are many ways to win. My personal favorite is to conquer the world, crushing armies. The feeling when an enemy player comes to you and offers everything they have to save their capital, is the best feeling in the world! Other ways of winning are being the first person to build the space station, or having a culture that influences other nations. One of the hardest victories to achieve is the diplomatic victory, you need to have the rest of the world like you enough to elect you to world leader. Errors/ AI issues: My biggest complaint about this game is the errors that still exist after four years. I wouldnt say its game breaking but very annoying when you have spend five to seven hours and are close to the end game when the game crashes. Then to combine this issue the AI needs to be reworked to make smarter decisions while at war. The AI will continue to suicide units into cities when they could easily take the cities by using archers or other ranged units to weaken the city. Price: Best thing about Civ 5 is that the price. You get a great game that gives you hours if not years of gameplay. Even tho it has been out since 2010 its well worth the asking price, on steam you can pick this game up for $30 or get the complete edition for $40. The complete edition comes with more civs and two expansion packs that add a lot of new gameplay features and just builds on an amazing game!

review: Great game, the vast amount of ways to win and loose in this game make it full of replayabilitie to play as diffrent civilizations. Games can last for hours and the back stabbing, the secret relations, war, this game is just fantastic. The game can get a little slow in the start, especialy if you are playing alone but it really pics up a few turns in especially if you play with freinds. If you play you will have a complete distaste for Barbarians after you experience this game, 8/10.

Amazing Graphics, In depth gameplay, astounding soundtrack, and a variety of different characters with personalities of their own. I would reccomend this to a friend, definitley.

review: Being a strategy game, it is one of my all time favourite games of all time. After the hours I have played, I have become hooked, and can't stop playing. Good Things: The gameplay is fun, You have so many things you can go into, but being the obvious, science, and domination are the main two things to go fourth to. I like that if your computer can not handle the full graphics of the game, or you just want to have a faster, and better view so you can see the resources around you, you can always switch to the "Strategic View" (Pressing F10). Bad Things: It is very TIME CONSUMING, Yet addicting. The amount of time it takes to complete a full game, requires you to play with friends most of the time, and not random people, so you can always save and go back to it any time you want to.

review: Civilization V is an amazing turn based strategy game in which the goal is to rule the world through battle, culture, science, or diplomacy. The new hexagonal grid tiles allow for much more interesting gameplay than the previous games in the series. The game allows the player to choose from a variety real civilizations, each with their own unique perk, unit, and building. While this game features multiplayer capabilities, the games take a very long time to complete, and take more than most people are willing to invest in a single session. If you do have a lot of free time, it can be very satisfying to dominate the world with or against friends. I'd very highly recommend this game, particularily in conjunction with its downloadable content and expansions.

review: Civilization V is by far one of the best Civilization Games I have ever played. The game takes awhile to play through both online and offline but rewards the player with both a sense of progression as the ages unlock and the technology advances. Also the game has multiple ways to win and even if you feel your in the lead in science, a friend can come out of nowhere and hit you with a culture vicotry so you have to not only be productive towards your victory goal but also monitoring all the other victory types to make sure no other civilization completes it before you. I would highly recommend buying the complete pack when it's on sale, so you dont have to worry about dlc issues and not having a civilization that an opposing player wants to play as. The game requires all active players to have the dlc in order to play against eachother and use a dlc civilization so be aware of this if you debating between the base game and it's expansions or the complete pack with all dlc. Hope you enjoy Civilization as my as I do and can't wait for Civilization: Beyond Earth to come out :)...

review: Sid Meier's Civilization V really changed my opinion about strategy simulation games. This game is very diverse and no two games are alike. You start out as a civilization with one city and you slowly build your way up to be the dominator, the diplomatic leader, or the first to finish the Space Race. Not only all this but it is historically accurate!

review: Probably the best strategy game to approach with a group of friends with the intention of partaking in a saga of epic battles and journeys to conquest, and probably the best strategy game that amounts to simply flubbing around with your friends in merely a matter of minutes. Games are rather slow even on the fast game settings (stay away from 'Epic' if you value your lifespan,) and playing with that one guy that always takes at least 5 minutes to finish his turn can be very much agonising (think five player chess wait times.) The payoff however, more than makes up for it. The feeling of carrying your army across the continent to royally screw over your friend who you were suppossedly 'allied' with is like none other, as is launching a nuke at every neighbouring country and bribing Chengis Khan to mount an attack at the Vatican. Rounds may take a few hours, but you'll be talking about them for the next week. Fans of the previous Civ games may however be a little disappointed with this edition as it seems a few majorly awesome mechanics have been removed (along with with a whole bunch of not so awesome mechanics.) Even religions are nowhere to be found within Vanilla but thankfully both Brave New World and Gods and Kings restore all that was missing to make Civ V as great as its predecessors. Between some fantastic DLC and Steam Workshop functionality (YOU CAN PLAY AS CTHULU IN THE WORLD OF TAMRIEL AND FOUND PASTAFASTARIANISM) Civ may not be a 'perfect' game to please all but it's certainly as close as it gets in terms of Civilisation.

review: I get to play as Russia settling in South Africa while attempting to build the Pyramids. 10/10 No but really, this game is pretty addicting. As there is little to no actual historical accuracy it does a great job of familiarizing you with ancient wonders, different civilizations, and ideologies. The game is great and has a lot of different things to try. Maybe one day you want to play with only Native American factions while playing on a Great Plains map; maybe another day you want to play with only the European powers on an archipelago map. Or maybe you just want to play as a faction and see how fast you can get Modern infantry and straight dominate a hunter/gatherer faction. This game has it all. With added mod support via Steam Workshop, there is always something or someone new to try out.

G&K's revamps the technology tree, adds more buildings, units, and civilizations, includes an espionage system, and adds a religion system to the game.

Do not try and make peace with this thing right when you think your safe he will do everything in his power to kill you and he will. Good luck with your citys young children and remember stay clear from Ghandi and do not interact with it or face the power of his mightyness. 11/10 Would nuke again.

If you want to find out what it'd be like if a civilization had discovered how to make rifles and tanks while everyone else on the planet is still waving pointy metal sticks at each other, this is the game for you. If none of these things apply to you, you're probably dead inside. And even then, this is still the game for you.

review: Sid Meier's Civilization V vainilla sucks hard but with both expansions it's a pretty good game. I suggest you to buy the whole thing or not buying it at all since without the expansions there will be no religion, no espionage and the diplomacy will be pretty broken too, making the game kind of unplayable. Three weak spots: 1-You can not found companies like in CIvilization IV Beyond the Sword. 2-Edit: Warmongering is super tricky and difficult now. 3-The "Empire happiness" system was improved a lot but it's still illogical, since every city should have his own level of happiness like in Civilization III or Civilization IV, you could have an empire happiness level system but it should be regulated from the individual level of happiness of every city. Let's say you have an empire with 2 cities, Lisboa and Oporto. If Oporto is under siege it's logical that the happiness of Oporto drops and than that deteriorates it's growth, commerce and productivity but why should Lisboa which is very far away from the warfront be upset about it? Let's be real, every city has it's own problems, should there be factors that deteriorate the happiness of ALL cities? YES, like nuclear war, declaring war against civilizations with the same idiology or religion but happiness should not be only global, the fact that you build a circus in Oporto does not make Lisboa any better, it makes no sense. If Lisboa is overpopulated let Lisboa be upset and unhappy about it but it's madness that because one overpopulated city the whole productivity of your empire drops. Said that, this game is good stuff, good graphics, good combat system (even better that Civilization IV), decent diplomacy, no bugs at all, very nice multiplayer, all civilizations are good but England and France.

review: Easily recommend this game and a must for anyone who enjoys strategy games. Not a steep learning curve, very easy to get into it and learn the game, but there is a lot of more in depth things which give a lot more control, like manual citizen management. Love this game, definitely one of my favourites.

review: I have read alot about dont trust Ghandi and i get it. The guy is an  in this game. One moment you two are peace buddies and the next he is launching nukes at you while creating an alliance with Ghengis Khan to  and pillage your cities. Oh and by the way dont piss off the City States. And if you do make sure to take all of them over or they will band together as a nation to destroy you. And then Ghandi sits in the corner laughing at you. Because thats what Ghandi does. He lets everyone else kill eachother then nukes the survivors. You hear that noise? Its the sound of screams from the Nuclear blast and Nuclear fallout which Ghandi interprets as forgiveness. Long story short dont let Ghandi get the nuke.

review: I thoroughly recommend Sid Meier's Civilization V, as it provides literally hundreds of hours of captivating entertainment at the expense of a mere 40 Earth Dollars. You can have endless fun attacking your (not really) best friends with nuclear weapons of mass destruction, destroying all of their tiresome efforts in one fell swoop. I don't recommend doing that last part too much, as, judging from personal experience, it can tend to provoke suicidal thoughts in the victim's mind. Other than that, it's pretty  and overpriced.

I dont think I have to explain why I love Civilization games, I mean Civ 1 came out in 1991 and Sid Meier has been making games since 1982 (thanks Wikipedia for having a Sid Meier page) Overall Civilization games have been one of my favorite strategy games out there and I hope that the upcoming Civilization: Beyond Earth (can anyone say Alpha Centauri?) is also a smashing success!

review: 50 Hours into your latest save, all is going well. Only 3 leaders left Gandhi, Caesar and Washington. you draft an 'end game' plan in your mind, you will make friends with Gandhi (for obvious reasons he's chill) then procede to befriend Caesar. Then you will take out Washington because he is a  and did not accept an open border agreement 3000 years prior HE MUST PAY. 20 turns later all is going to plan, we are now on Washingtons doorstep, Gandhi and Caesar appear to love and probably fear your superpower nation. All we need to do is eliminate the pesky Americans and ith all our military now on American soil this should not take long. Then after the swift invasion of America we will make a vote for world peace at the U.N (in rome of course) with our new found Indian and Roman brethren it is a sure win! But all of a sudden the distant droning of nuclear sirens start, quickly they become louder and louder, "what is this!?" you think to yourself, a false alarm? You shrug it off maybe Caesae bombing a city state. The game pauses... Gandhi appears on the screen, with a sinister grin he shouts "WAR" in your face. Only seconds after you see a gut wrenching sight. The camera focuses on a nuclear submarine stationed just off the coast of your pride and joy, the capital of your glorious nation. You then hear a rumble, just seconds after a nuclear warhead emerges from the previously hidden submarine, you realise it is too late... you can only watch as the missle closes in. As your city goes up in a giant cloud there are short lived screams from your beloved people, then silence. Before what had just occurred had sunk in, before you could make rescue efforts to save your much loved citizens the humming of quiet engines fall upon your ears. Suddenly countless 'stealth bombers' appear seemingly out of no where, soon the sky is blackened by planes, the game falls almost silent only the whistle of falling bombs remains. You faint from the shock of what is unfolding. You awake shortly after, Gandhi is still flattening what remains of your once prosperous empire, now with 'giant death robots' making the most of his seemingly never ending turn. As Gandhi clinically and relentlessly razes what's left of your broken nation all you can do is weep, your people hacked down in their prime and your glorious nation so mighty just minutes before has just been been all but eliminated in 1 turn. Why oh why did you turn of autosave? did it really speed your game up? was it worth it? Ghandi is a complete , he acts like your friend but WILL nuke the  out of you if even the slightest oppurtunity presents itself. 10/10

I appreciate the genre, I grew up on board games like risk so this is nothing new to me. All that being said, I now love Civ. It may have taken 5 games to get there, but I am hooked. I have spent many hours dominating the world, I will spend many more again. Buy this, you won't regret it.

It's worth every cent. Although if you want (cuz it's pretty expensive with the expansion packs) then wait until there is a sale. Then you can buy the Gold edition. Having an expansion pack adds so much to the gameplay. Either wait or buy now, but once you do buy it, well, ENJOY!

review: Civilization V is an immensely popular Steam game, and rightly so. Its 'Just one more turn!' brilliance is down to lots of brilliant options to customise your game and an abudance of great mods to add for further customization, no playthrough is ever the same. I would recommend this game to anyone interested in history, geography, or just strategy games in general; its realism is sufficient yet not so much as to be boring. First-rate game in my opinion. I would recommend that you buy the gold/complete edition if you are serious about playing the game. It gives you the nice DLC's that are really worth their money.

review: Civilization V is as much a lateral step away from the complicated nature of Civ IV as it is a step forward in the franchise's vaunted history. Most importantly, after 18 months, Civ 5 has improved dramatically from the game it was upon release. The AI is improved, key game concepts have been buffed and nerfed, as needed. And there is welcome, but not critical, DLC. What I love about this version: hex-based game board for more natural movement. No more stacks of doom. Global happiness. No tech trading. Drastically improved AI relations. Improved event notification system means you never miss a beat. What I dislike: The tech tree has been significantly flattened from Civ 4. Tech and Culture victories are terribly boring to achieve: hunker down, press "next turn", repeat 200 times. Overreliance on gold farming to buy off all problems. Overall - a successful attempt to streamline gameplay without removing core elements. Civ 5 is a success, and I welcome the coming expansion(s).

I picked up the Gold version of the game and had a lot of fun with that, but I would really advise getting the Brave New Wolrd expansion too. It adds great new systems to the game. There isn't really anything else I can say that a go at the demo wouldn't say other than if you get this game, get Brave New World too.

review: This is a vast game, with the highest replay value of any other I have ever played. The differences among civilizations range from slim to huge, and they all have a very unique style of gameplay. Put in the many factors that can be modified before a game session, such as map size and resource abundance, and you'll find yourself living with this game for a long time. Big points for the soundtrack and graphics as well. The AI is really well adjusted too, compared to older versions of Civilization. It is now possible to actually stand a chance playing in the hardest settings and still feels rewarding if you lose and yet tried your best. There is nothing left to say other than... play this game!!! Oh and get the expansions too!

review: I've whiled away many an hour playing every version of this game. Civ V has it's detractors among those who want a highly detailed wargame along the lines of Civ IV, but I like it's focus on immersion and versatility. It's still not the perfect version of the game it wants to be, but Brave New World is a giant leap toward that ideal. The layers of possibilities for your Civilization have never been so diverse and interesting. All hail the King of Turn-Based Strategy!

Also, seems to have optimization issues, can run on almost any comp within the last few years on low, but high seems to have trouble on even dedicated gaming comps. Also the more turns have passed, the more time it takes for the cpus to take their turn. Like I would get over a minuite sometimes. Also, the game isn't quite complete without the dlc sadly. The dlc adds a great number of features, fixes, ect, but should have been a free update. You can however get it pretty cheap if you check the steam sales.

If u will play with friends, u will find great timekiller and funny moments in that game. ). Civilization V back us to classic hexagons rather than Civ IV. It's first good sign. 2. Great multiplayer mode. 3. Great scenarios for lone wolves. 4. Extended settings for your own game. 5. Recommended by time. ). 6. Of course, i love that soundtrack. Great work by composers. 7. I think that game HAVE balance. All nations have own bonuses. Choice what u like and beat your opponents. 8. For newbies  easy to learn. Omg... It's just Civilization, what i can say more?! And... Only one bad sign i can say about Civ V  cropped release version... Because, if you want religion  you will need to buy DLC Gods & Kings... Nobody like that marketing politic. Cheers, Mazy.

review: Honestly? Yes, I do reccomend it to any MMO Board game fans or Strategy players out there. Civ V is a time-eating game, it's a game you can casually playand check your emails/facebook while playing, but thatdoesnt mean the game isn't intense, whenever I sit down to play a game of Civ for a few minutes, I end up spending my whole day building my civillization. This game also has great tool-tips and UI. I mastered the game without the need of tutuorial but there areadvisor-in-game diologues that explain everything. (These can be disabled.) In all fairness, I give this game a 8.5 out of 10, buy this game, it's worth every single penny.

Not only does Civ V rise up to the expectations of series, it exceeeds them.While the army stacking may be a small flaw, other features including simplified diplomacy and improved interface make the issue almost non-existant.

review: Strategy fanatics have lost hundreds of hours of their lives to Sid Meier's beguiling creations over the years, and they should prepare to lose hundreds more. Civilization V is yet another glistening example of turn-based bliss that will keep you up long past your bedtime. It exercises its power over your mind using many of the tricks the series has long been known for: varied ways of accomplishing your goal of world domination, the thrill of expanding a paltry city into a bustling empire, and the suspense of venturing into unknown territory. The latest Civilization game takes those basics and layers onto them new features that make moment-to-moment gameplay feel more dynamic than in the past. Most noticeably, the square grids of previous Civilization games have been jettisoned in favor of hexagons that nicely accommodate the other most consequential transformations: Military units can no longer be stacked, and ranged units can fire from multiple tiles away. The tactical combat that rises from these modifications is a lot of fun and makes warfare a lot more exciting than in Civ games of yore. AI quirks and a few other minor issues become apparent the more you play, but these are wholly forgivable foibles in an attractive and sophisticated game that constantly begs you to remain at your keyboard for just one more turn. First, here is a quick primer for newcomers. Civilization V, like previous games in the series, is about leading a nation through the eras of history, starting with a single city and expanding across the map. At the outset of any given game, you select a leader (in this case, one of 18, or 19 if you purchased the special edition from Steam), each of whom possesses a particular benefit that disposes his or her civilization to a particular style of play. Americans get a range of sight bonus; the Siamese get diplomatic bonuses with miniature nations new to the series called city-states; the English get naval perks; and so forth. From here, you collect resources; make deals with other civilizations; manage your economy; and go to war and attack the cities of your enemies when the time is right. There are four main ways to win a typically lengthy game of Civilization V. You could dominate through military means and defeat every civilization's capital city. You could be the first to gun through the technology tree and build the parts necessary for a spaceship that whisks you away to Alpha Centauri. You could ally with nations and city-states across the globe and win a diplomatic victory via a vote at the United Nations. Or you might become the cultural envy of the world by developing a large number of government policies and researching a mysterious undertaking known as the Utopia Project. There is also a fifth victory condition: possess the highest score when the turn limit has been reached. Whether Civ is new to you or not, it's easy to appreciate the newest game's user-friendly interface, which makes figuring out what to do next a breeze, meaning more of your time is spent strategizing and less of it is spent fumbling around. The organized nested menus are intuitive and easy to get used to, and Civ V does a good job of only displaying vital information on the screen while making other information easily available with just a few clicks. A single action button leads you through every aspect of your turn. If a unit is waiting for orders, the button says so, and clicking it takes you to the unit in question. If it's time to research a new technology, you click the button and it opens the research menu. There are a few aspects of the interface that could have been cleaned up. Switching between a city's production menu and the production queue is needlessly clunky, and the diplomatic overview doesn't label the tiny icons indicating what luxury resources other civilizations are producing. But most of the time, you always have the information you need when you need it, and neophytes should never feel in the dark. A few of Civilization IV's features have been eliminated--most notably, religion and espionage--though many players aren't likely to miss them. However, longtime aspects of the series have returned. Your advisors are there if you need a bit of direction, though unit automation and little icons representing each advisor's suggestion in the production menus mean you won't often need to pay them a visit. The exhaustive Civilopedia is only a click away and offers a wealth of information on every aspect of every feature. You still build wonders like the Egyptian pyramids, the hanging gardens, and the Great Wall, which generate the culture resource and provide other tangible benefits, without coming with the turn-by-turn maintenance cost of standard structures. The culture you gain is spent on social policies, which have replaced the governments of Civilization IV. Each time you reach the cultural resource benchmark, you select from the policy list, which is split into multiple policy types, each of which has its own sub-tree. The benefits you reap are cumulative, and while there are certain balancing restrictions in place, you still get a lot of freedom in how you want to progress. The mid- and late-game flexibility make it an excellent addition to the franchise. The first change you'll notice, however, has even more impact on Civilization V: The map is divided into hexagons rather than squares. The move to hexagons sets the stage for Civilization V's tactical combat. In the past, you could stack units into one army of doom (or a few armies) that rolled across the map. Now, with the exception of special units (the great general, for example) and workers, units cannot occupy the same space. As a result, you must be extremely conscious of each unit's weaknesses and strengths; a unit's position in regards to both its enemies and other friendly units; and whether or not any terrain bonuses apply. There is a rock-paper-scissors relationship among units that further deepens as units level up and you progress through the eras. When units level up, you choose one of several upgrades for them, such as an attack bonus when attacking from flat terrain. As they level up further, the possibilities expand, which means healing bonuses for the unit, as well as neighboring units, or greater degrees of the same enhancements. Helpfully, you can also choose to fully heal the unit when it levels at the expense of choosing another bonus, which is a mighty handy ability that can save a veteran unit from the jaws of defeat. This excellent new system layers tactical combat onto the strategic map, making battles much tenser--and much less abstract. It also encourages you to keep your veteran units alive. And while it costs you a bit of gold, you can also upgrade units into more powerful iterations (a trebuchet into a cannon, for example) when your research path allows it. Multiplayer games are also a possibility for the most patient players. You can set a turn timer to limit how long players get to consider their next move, but even so, the pace is at the whim of those involved, so matches can get bogged down in the early hours. Luckily, most of the customization options available to you in single-player games are available in multiplayer games as well, so you can keep things moving with the right options activated. Gone are hotseat and e-mail play options, with online and local network play as the only ways to play with others. By nature, Civilization V is a game you enjoy most with friends instead of random strangers, though the simple interface makes it easy to find and join available Internet games.

review: With only a thousand pounds in my pocket i was just able to afford SID MEIERS'S CIVILIZATION V and the gold edition and the DLC and the limited edition 'SID MEIERS'S' keychain. At first i was fairly sure that i had accidentally bought farming simulator 2014 but then I realised that they have not released that game yet. The defining moment of this game was when i made an artillery cannon and blew up most of Spain. I don't have anything against people from Spain i just think that their country is really hot and once i went there and asked for a glass of milk and was given a shot of vodka. I was going to complain but the man behind the counter was really scary so i didn't. My favourite SID MEIERS'S CIVILIZATION V to play as is Russia because it means i don't have to look at the Russian lady who is not very pretty. I think they could have stepped up their game and bit their lip and hired someone better, because she is negatively portraying Russians as ladys who don't have legs but instead have strange domes which need massive dresses to hide. My verdict overall is ok but i think if SID MEIERS took care of his CIVILIZATION he wouldn't have to keep replacing them.

review: Civilization V is one of the best turn-based strategy games Ive ever had the pleasure of playing. Whether teaming up with my friends for some multiplayer, or simply losing a whole night of sleep to the games endlessly replayable single player, this is one game that any strategy enthusiast, or, hell anyone strat-curious should check out. Sure, I miss some of the deeper inter-civilization relations that the more defined religion and government setup brought in Civilization IV, but thats nothing anyone new to the series will even think twice about. With all the tips, advisers and tools in place, this is the first Civilization for PC that I feel is worth just about every persons time. Go forth and create, subdue, and exploit.

review: Just in case playtime recorded doesn't count as a recommendation on its own: I ing recommend this game. Seriously. Do you like strategy games? Okay, buy this, we don't have anything else to talk about. The expansions are well worth it, too, though if you're only going to pick up one I'd say grab Brave New World (if you can even get the second before the first, I wouldn't know). The trading system gives you a lot more to think about but it's really the update to cultural victories with tourism, museums, and artifacts that make the expansion for me. If you like non-aggressive play, the changes are amazing. There isn't quite as much to offer for you war-mongers, but moving resources around with the trade routes is still going to be important. Not to mention it added Venice which is pretty much the only civ you will ever need to play as ever again. The religion and espionage systems added in Gods and Kings are definitely fun, but I felt both systems could've been a little deeper (I really wanted to set myself up as a sort of 16th century Vatican City puppetmaster-type civ, but alas...). Both systems are integrated in the changes to Brave New World, though, and I found that worth it as well. Get them both! Don't even wait for a sale, buy them all right this instant!

review: Strategy fanatics have lost hundreds of hours of their lives to Sid Meier's beguiling creations over the years, and they should prepare to lose hundreds more. Civilization V is yet another glistening example of turn-based bliss that will keep you up long past your bedtime. It exercises its power over your mind using many of the tricks the series has long been known for: varied ways of accomplishing your goal of world domination, the thrill of expanding a paltry city into a bustling empire, and the suspense of venturing into unknown territory. The latest Civilization game takes those basics and layers onto them new features that make moment-to-moment gameplay feel more dynamic than in the past. Most noticeably, the square grids of previous Civilization games have been jettisoned in favor of hexagons that nicely accommodate the other most consequential transformations: Military units can no longer be stacked, and ranged units can fire from multiple tiles away. The tactical combat that rises from these modifications is a lot of fun and makes warfare a lot more exciting than in Civ games of yore. AI quirks and a few other minor issues become apparent the more you play, but these are wholly forgivable foibles in an attractive and sophisticated game that constantly begs you to remain at your keyboard for just one more turn. First, here is a quick primer for newcomers. Civilization V, like previous games in the series, is about leading a nation through the eras of history, starting with a single city and expanding across the map. At the outset of any given game, you select a leader (in this case, one of 18, or 19 if you purchased the special edition from Steam), each of whom possesses a particular benefit that disposes his or her civilization to a particular style of play. Americans get a range of sight bonus; the Siamese get diplomatic bonuses with miniature nations new to the series called city-states; the English get naval perks; and so forth. From here, you collect resources; make deals with other civilizations; manage your economy; and go to war and attack the cities of your enemies when the time is right. There are four main ways to win a typically lengthy game of Civilization V. You could dominate through military means and defeat every civilization's capital city. You could be the first to gun through the technology tree and build the parts necessary for a spaceship that whisks you away to Alpha Centauri.

Also, seems to have optimization issues, can run on almost any comp within the last few years on low, but high seems to have trouble on even dedicated gaming comps. Also the more turns have passed, the more time it takes for the cpus to take their turn. Like I would get over a minuite sometimes. Also, the game isn't quite complete without the dlc sadly. The dlc adds a great number of features, fixes, ect, but should have been a free update. You can however get it pretty cheap if you check the steam sales.

review: This is a vast game, with the highest replay value of any other I have ever played. The differences among civilizations range from slim to huge, and they all have a very unique style of gameplay. Put in the many factors that can be modified before a game session, such as map size and resource abundance, and you'll find yourself living with this game for a long time. Big points for the soundtrack and graphics as well. The AI is really well adjusted too, compared to older versions of Civilization. It is now possible to actually stand a chance playing in the hardest settings and still feels rewarding if you lose and yet tried your best. There is nothing left to say other than... play this game!!! Oh and get the expansions too!

review: After being an avid fan of the entire Civilization series, especially III and IV, since I was old enough to understand the strategy of them when they were released, I remember becoming rather psyched up when I heard of the impending release of this game. It was an interesting start to a lovely relationship. Any Civ fan from before Civ V will remember the interesting and controversial spoilers: No religion? Shame. No unit stacking? Brave. Hexagonal tiles? Scandal! For those who had not been indoctrinated with the traditions of previous Civ games, I'll admit, the forums all looked a bit silly. Eventually, a demo was released, and I installed it and played it, all 100 turns of it, and I wasn't impressed. It was all a bit boring. And that was the end of that. I wasn't going to spend a wad of my hard-earned dole money on a game that wasn't amazing. I would just play Civ IV instead. Then, one late Spring day almost four years later, a Steam sale tugged at the heartstrings of my throat, and beckoned me and my wallet to join it in virtual matrimony, and, in a whim of impetuous and spontaneous peer pressure, I bought it, and the complete edition with all of its DLC at that. It's the best whim I've ever had on a late Spring day almost four years after Civ V was released. It is a pretty game. It is easy to learn to play. You don't have to micromanage, although if, like me, you want to, then it is quite possible to manage most microscopically. Religions were introduced in the expansion packs, and they work very well. Hexagons are a lovely shape, and I find them even more accomodating than those old squares (Just ask the Settlers). The music is fabulous, unless you play as an African or Middle-Eastern nation, in which case you mostly get wind instruments that sound like dying animals, but other than that, the music is fabulous. The lack of animations for wonders and victories was slightly disappointing, but the artwork that takes its place is marvelous. A nice man narrates the technologies rather nicely, although everyone prefers Leonard Nimoy from Civ IV. The gameplay, although a broad topic, can suitably be described as good. As might be expected, it is difficult to try to lose on the easiest difficulties, and impossibly hard on the hardest. The leaders and nations available are colourful and exciting, and we can still become best friends with Catherine the Great. The civilopedia entries are very useful for the game, of course, but also contain real history and information which is well-written, and which I have personally spent hours reading in the middle of a game. The Steam achievements connected with the game are hilarious, and when you read them, make you want to cross your arms and say to yourself: "challenge accepted." I could go on, but I realise that, in summary, it may be best to conclude by preparing any potential player to adopt the correct mental attitude. This is not an expansion pack to Civ IV, obviously, so don't treat it like one. It is more like a younger brother to it than a son. It's different, and there may be parts of it you don't like, such as hexagons or city-capture or the way he smacks his mouth when he eats his breakfast. But I don't see any reason why, even if you have a preference, you can't be friends with both. Please enjoy this game very much, and be careful with that Attila fellow. He can't be trusted.

review: This game, is a mix of adrenaline, and a mix of relaxation while you spread your culture, religion, or your power. You can win the game by science, domination, culture, and a few more, but those are the most common, and most enjoyable. I personally love playing science and domination. You get a nice mix of everything in those games, and i mean, come on, war is fun, and so is science! From worrying about your happiness to keep Revelation at bay, to worrying about Russia assembling units around your borders, this game is sure to give you a gratifying, and amazing experience. Many of which you will find yourself telling your friends about. This game is addicting as hell, you will find yourself slugging along at 4 in the morning "Just....One.....More....Turn" and so on. The combat is brilliant, the game is pretty balanced, only a few issues with that, but hard to notice, and rare to come across, and it's a blast to play with friends, and by yourself. Now, if you are a civ4 player coming to 5, the new diplomacy will take some getting used to. ALWAYS and i mean ALWAYS have a good defense, or civs who are bigger, and better than you will walk all over you to expand, but if your military is a threat, they will back off. Also, your actions can affect your relations with the other civs. If you were to make a proposal in the world congress a civ docent like, it will make then VERY angry with you, deepening on the proposal, it could be a war on your hands. Overall, the game is worth every penny, and it one of my favorite games of all time, a MUST HAVE!!!

review: I thoroughly recommend Sid Meier's Civilization V, as it provides literally hundreds of hours of captivating entertainment at the expense of a mere 40 Earth Dollars. You can have endless fun attacking your (not really) best friends with nuclear weapons of mass destruction, destroying all of their tiresome efforts in one fell swoop. I don't recommend doing that last part too much, as, judging from personal experience, it can tend to provoke suicidal thoughts in the victim's mind. Other than that, it's pretty  and overpriced.

If u will play with friends, u will find great timekiller and funny moments in that game. ). Civilization V back us to classic hexagons rather than Civ IV. It's first good sign. 2. Great multiplayer mode. 3. Great scenarios for lone wolves. 4. Extended settings for your own game. 5. Recommended by time. ). 6. Of course, i love that soundtrack. Great work by composers. 7. I think that game HAVE balance. All nations have own bonuses. Choice what u like and beat your opponents. 8. For newbies  easy to learn. Omg... It's just Civilization, what i can say more?! And... Only one bad sign i can say about Civ V  cropped release version... Because, if you want religion  you will need to buy DLC Gods & Kings... Nobody like that marketing politic. Cheers, Mazy.

review: (NOTE: I played a lot more of this during the elongated time my internet was down) Sid Meier's Civ V is an awesome turn based stratergy game rich in content and only deepened by the vast collection of online mods. Gameplay is simple at first but surprisingly deep and addictive. You pick a leader, and you rule your country. You start with only a few units and anciet technology but soon amass yourself with large armies, and highly advanced mordern technology. Forging alliances with leaders is fun but the AI is rather idiotic at times and that can be troublesome, but it's only a small problem for such a well made game. 'Just one... more... turn''

review: For those who are not familiar with the Civ games: Sid meier's Civiliazation is a simulation of how and why the political status-quo is as it is today. In randomly generated map (though its not your only option) play the leader of a slightly to heavily flavoured nation and quest for world dominition. Either kill everyone, make them love you, make a utopia or be the first to send the rocket to space. Sometimes you'll be the baddy, sometimes you'll the curse the vandal leader who will play purely combat while you build your latest wonder. This game's realism is really informative and there are many things to learn from this simulation. It's replayability is one of it's strongest points since you'll definitely want to try again for a better setting (resources and other civ placement), different map size, different nation etc. For those familiar with previous installments: Is there anything better than a resuscitation of a game you already love with new graphics, new/different nations and a slightly different approach to some of the mechanics? I cant say this is wholly an improvement or a deterioration in terms of realism since, although the diplomacy is MUCH better and a diplomatic victory is actually an option now, the religion mechanic for example is more of "game" nature than the more realistic Civ 4 counterpart. This is less blocky and repetitive than Civ4 and much easier to play though you may not like all the changes (NO MORE STACK OF DOOM! :P)

review: (NOTE: I played a lot more of this during the elongated time my internet was down) Sid Meier's Civ V is an awesome turn based stratergy game rich in content and only deepened by the vast collection of online mods. Gameplay is simple at first but surprisingly deep and addictive. You pick a leader, and you rule your country. You start with only a few units and anciet technology but soon amass yourself with large armies, and highly advanced mordern technology. Forging alliances with leaders is fun but the AI is rather idiotic at times and that can be troublesome, but it's only a small problem for such a well made game. 'Just one... more... turn''

review: Sid Meier delivered yet again with the latest and debatably the greatest installment of the Civilization franchise: Civilization V. I'm not going to pretend I have played hundreds of hours on this game as you know I haven't becuse it says above. But from what I have played of this game makes it one of my absolute favourites in my library. I personally aren't usually the fan of strategy games because I haven't got the brain capacity to work out simple war strategies, but this game had me hooked from the beggining. So much so even that I managed to convince my dad to buy it which he is now playing by my side religiously. I know I have tried and failed to sound intelligent so I will just say it how it is. BUY THIS GAME!!! The only fault i could possibly pick with this game is a few bugs that will inevitabley be fixed and the occasional crash. I would highly recommend that you save the game every 5 turns to avoid loss because of crashes. But what the hell do I know, maybe its my  laptop's fault. All in all the game is very fun, highly addictive, seriously time consuming and life destroying but however needs some polishing 9/10

review: The depth and replayability are unsurpassed. It took a couple of expansions to catch up to the enjoyment I felt playing its predecessors, but now with all of the new systems in place it has become one of my favorite iterations in the series. Thank you Sid Meier's, Brian Reynolds, Jeff Briggs, MicroProse, Hasbro, Infogrames, Atari Interactive, Take-Two, 2K Games, Firaxis and any others I am forgetting for providing me with years of such boundless entertainment. I can only imagine what the future holds for such an amazing and storied Franchise.

review: Civilization V is a must buy for any turn-based strategy gamers out there. It allows you to grow a civilization of your choice through the ancient era all the way up to the information era, if you can survive until then that is. The vanilla game itself is decent but is lacking in some areas. I highly recommend buying the complete edition which includes two major dlcs; Gods and Kings and Brave New World, with some other small civilization and map dlcs.

This game will make you loose hundreds of hours of your life that you will not even notice. For you it would be mere hours, and you will wonder if aliens had abducted you and erased your memory, cause that will be the only explanations for all those passing days you can't remember. But it's not the aliens, it's this game. So, do not play it! You have been warned. Now, excuse while I make just one more turn. I swear it will be just one more turn.

Build courage when courage sees to fail, gain faith when there seems to be little cost for faith, create hope when hope becomes forlorn and remember....the future belongs to those who believe in their dreams....I have to say, this has been the most fantastic, most amazing game i have ever played. Especially when you get the DLCs that can be be bought to go with it. A generally good game with regular Civilization 5 but the excitement and intensity of it increases when you get BNW and G&K DLCs. Definetly consider getting this game if you havent already and be sure to get the DLCs!!!!!!

review: Hello... friends! I am recommending this game for you not because of steam's treasure hunt, but because my extensive playtime with this game (that being a whole 39 minutes) has made me realize this game is where you can play as a viking building the pyramids, eiffel tower, big ben, stonehenge, pentagon and just about everything. You know, how history *really* should have gone. Actually, I'm not even sure if you can play as vikings, but the idea of it is still neat. I would like a sockpuppet civilzation, but I guess they don't want me to create the perfect world history yet. Gotta keep something for the sequel, eh? Anyway, this is a game and stuff. You should probably check into if you like games, and if this particular type of game is specifically to your liking of specific games of this specific type. Oh holy bananas, did you know there's a kangaroo standing behind you right now? Um, you should probably do something about that. I don't think a kangaroo is supposed to be in your room.

The game is highly addictive and very entertaining, the game will easily teach a new player exactly what to do, but even as you play more and more, you learn new things and gain new tactics. Civilization V is an all round great strategy game, with great game mechanics. The only downside to the game is that the Civilizations do not get smarter as you increase difficulty, they just get a much better start, although this is easily fixed with a mod. I would have to give this game a 10/10 based on my experience with it so far and anyone contemplating buying this game should definately go for it.

review: With the latest expansion, Brave New World, this is probably the best turn-based strategy game out there. Civ 5 has now reached the pinicle of the evolution of the Civ francise. I say this as a player who first played Civ over 20 years ago on my 386 and has played all the Civ games apart from Civ 2. Whereas most 90/early 2000s PC games that have been rebooted or updated in the last 5 years have been dumbed down as if developers think we are all xbawks kiddies with ADHD (I'm looking at you SimCity, Hitman, Wolfenstein, Thief, etc), the Civ series has actually been improved with time and has become a deeper game.

review: An all around fantastic 4X RTS game, Civilization V, once it has the two major expansions (Gods & Kings and Brave New World) is an amazingly engulfing game. So much of it is designed to pull you in and keep you wishing to advance your empire one more turn. Winning the game can be completed multiple ways with large or small empires, and on higher difficulties victory can be a mad dash to the finish. Combat is fun, and offers enjoyment in outwitting your opponent, or holding off large waves of enemies at a choke point. The units are are crafted in high detail, and each civilization plays a slightly different way, letting you try a vast array of different strategies. The game is not without its faults, however. The biggest of these issues is the AI, which can be confusing or downright moronic. Additionally, while the shift to tactical-styled combat is a nice change of pace in the series, the AI doesn't seem to grasp how to make the most of its units and can make obvious tactical blunders with startling regularity. The game's netcode and stability are also questionable at times once larger maps come into play, but when it is working play is smooth and almost seamless from one turn to the next. All in all, an excellent game in a series full of well-made games.

review: One of the best turn-based strategy games I have ever played. Starting from the pre-historic era and having to explore for a good place to settle your first city, you then have to scavenge and trade with other leaders to increase revenue and protect city states from barbarians to gain access to their goods. You can play the game any way you want. If you want to be a tyranical leader who's goal is to kill everyone and take their land as his, or you could win the game through strategic trading and tourism. The tech line is intuative with many ways to get where you want to go in the game. This in depth game with a diverse number of leaders and a great atmosphere always has you watching your back, making allies, signing treaties from previous altercations you had with that nation, and being the most dominent power by the end of the game in order to win. Yes, this game takes a while for a single game to finish, but with every second being like the first one you've had since trying the game the first time it will always keep you smiling and excited for what comes next. Don't even get me started on the multiplayer. XD I can't wait to play this game again! 10/10

review: Oh Civilization V, what a masterpiece you are. Most of you who are interested in this game probably don't know the series. But Sid Meier's Civilization dates back to the 1991 and has span a long time. The second most recent was Civilization IV, a game most fans are calling a masterpiece. With it's advanced gameplay, not fully broken diplomacy and a good mod community it was destined for greatness. Then this came a long. Civilization V is an amazing game. You'll be leading a Civilization through all of human history (And even the future) looking at how your civilization progresses. Will you wage war, and be a war mongler the world fears? Will you lead in science, and be the first to launch to a diferent world? Will you have all of the world succumb to your civilization's greatness? All of this is up to you. You have full freedom of what you want to do within the game. And it benefits from it. Since you can do whatever you want, you end up with fun scenarios, intensity, and essentialy some very satisfying gameplay. The visuals and the overall presentation is good as well. You get a very good cultural appropiate soundtrack while you're playing as a specific civilization, which is very neat. The best is especially the in-game rendered diplomacy screens. Where you will stand face to face with the leader you're discussing with. It is amazing the first time, and it's still awesome the 561th time. The only thing I'm dissapointed with is the AI. in the game. They tend to either be passive, or be down-right agressive. However there are mods fixing this, and you can always play multiplayer against/with other people. Which is a lot of fun in it self. The base-game is already a worth-while purchase, but can you afford it I'd suggest getting Gods and Kings as well as Brave New World. Both expansions add a lot to the vanilla game, and I personally can't go back to the normal experience. All in all, this is a must buy for any strategy gamer, whatever if one's casual or hardcore. You'll be spending a lot of fun re-(or just creating) historic events. Get this game as soon as you can, no doubt about it.

review: One of my all time fav games, this requires you to have a stong economy while ballencing other aspects of your empire on multuple fronts. Not only is this game diplomaticaly focoused it also has extreme focous for combat and war situations aswell. For example your units gain a bonous for attacking from a hill and can often not attack with indirect fire... If i had to make one complant i would say that some of the Civ's need a little re-ballancing other then that if you are a stratigist then you need to pick this game up 9.5/10

review: This games is one of the most addicting games out there. You'll keep telling yourself "just one more turn" then you look at the clock and a few hours have gone by. It's a lot of fun. Positives: -provides hours of gameplay -no two games are exactly the same -big diversity in playable civs and units -city states are a cool feature -many diverse maps Negatives: -computer controlled civs can be extremely irritating -happiness feature can also be irritating Overall great game. Highly recommended. Also HIGHLY recommend getting the expansion packs as they make the game significantly better.

review: This game is really fun to play by yourself but even more fun to play with others. Even the short gamemodes are really long though so it's almost impossible to sit down from start to finish of a game. When playing in multiplayer it's a good idea to team up as the AIs seem more agressive especially Gandhi, don't trust him.

review: This game is amazing. I've had it and played it for years, and it genuinely never gets old. It has an infinite amount of replayability, and no two games ever end the same way. I'd fully recommend getting the DLC as well as the standalone game, seeing as you'll lust for more content after you play 100 hours or so, and the DLC Civ has to offer is fantastic.

review: I've been saying to myself "this is the last turn i swear", but i'm just not able to quit. These are the problems that show up as soon as you begin understanding the fundementals of this game. Sid Meier's Civlization V is a turn-based 4x game, where you manage you cities and make sure your people are well fed and happy. The goal in this game is to be the most progressive population on the planet. You start out with a city that fits the population you've chosen. From here on out you start exploring and building things. With the first unit, you will find things like ruins and barbarian camps. The barbarians are your first real enemy, you will have to try to fight them off while progressing your first city. When you start expanding alot you find out that the barbarians are not a real threat anymore. In fact you will be alot more busy with the other populations on the map. The other populations can be friendly but also an enemy. This is where diplomacy comes in, some leaders of the populations may trick you and create traps to backstab you after a while, so you have to be carefull on what you decide what's best. You also get to trade and discuss with these leaders, for instance, you could trade a luxury that your population wishes for. After a couple of hundered turns you'll get the hang of it and start liking the game alot, for me it's the progressing that makes me hooked to this game. it's the mentality of "just finishing this one thing" that makes it soo addicting to me. I find it to be one of the best games i have every played. This is the first civilization game i ever played, but now i regret that i never played the previous parts of this series. All in all a great game! I highly recommend it!

review: This game is just pure awesome! It allows you to run your own kingdom while either combating or being buddies with others. You must also develop technology and build a military and industry. The beginning game options are pretty nice too, the allow you to pick who you are, how long you want the game to play out, what era it starts in, the world layout, and many more things! It's such a huge games that I could sit here for hours typing up everything! And the best part is... YOU CAN GET MORE STUFFF WITH WORKSHOP!!! I'd say *10/10* for this game!

review: This game and I have a love-hate relationship. While I would consider this game to definitely be in my top ten, it is dangerously addictive. I find myself going down a deep rabbit hole when I play this game because of how engrossing the premice of the game is. For those of you who haven't had the chance of picking up a copy of a game in this series so far, think of yourself as warned; the outside world will not know what happened to you until you can finally find the strength to crawl out of your darkhole from which you have been engrossed in for the passed 8 days known as Civilization; your friends will understand. Game Summary: Now for a quick rundown of how the game works. The title to the game describes the plot in itself: you are the plot. You start by choosing from a number of civilizations listed, ranging from 18th century America under George Washington to Napolean of France. How large you want the planet you are set on and how many other civilizations and city states you want to play against can either be determined by the player or randomly selected. Once you drop into the world you'll start out with a settler and a warrior in order to found your capital city and explore the surrounding lands. Each civilization has the gift of a specific bonus to it's empire as well as excess units and buildings which can be constructed only by that civilization. As your civilization progresses you eventually start to get more and more choice. You will move through each era depending on what technologies you research. With this freedom of choice players can also choose how they interact with other civilizations and city states. Eventually depending on what routes the player chooses to take in developing their civilization, there will be a number of options for how one can win the game. You can either achieve a science victory by researching all of the technologies and blasting off into space in order to plant your flag into the soil of a distant earth like planet! You can conquer the entire world with rutheless military might and capturing the capital of all other opposing in-game civs for a domination victory. These are jsut a few of the options available. The great thing about this game is rather than following a linear path for play, you really get to make history yourself; or if you want to go about doing it with a friend, drop into a match and play it out with your buddy! Mods: The second best thing about Civ V besides it being Civ V is that the game is very community orientated. There are hundreds upon hundreds of mods sitting in the steam workshop in this game ranging from new ingame civilizations to playable scenarios. The development team over at Firaxis did a great job in allowing variety for such a trully immersive game and one of the best ways they've done that is by letting the community take adding on new parts to the game themselves. DLC: The core game itself is fantastic but I would really recommend both DLC's for this game. They are a bit pricy so you might save some cash by just picking up the Civ V Gold Edition during a steam sale if you really want to get the fullest experience of the game. Not only does it add a number of new civilzations (that are personally my favorite to play as), it also brings back religion from the previous games in order to spread your pious agenda across the globe to assist in your victory. It also brings back spying as well as trade routes. Trade routes help for boosting ones economic output when connecting to other civilizations but they can also provide science and spread religion to other cities. These factors are just the tip of the iceberg especially considering there are so many mods on the steam workshop which require either the Gods and Kings DLC or the Brave New World add-on. In the end, they are both fantastic in-game content packs and really worth the extra penny.

review: Civilization V single-handedly drew me into the strategy game genre. The streamlined mechanics allows simplicity for a new player to pick up, but still retains depth for those looking to get more out of it. Each playable civ is extraordinarily unique and the multiple paths towards victory increase replay value to a tremendous degree. This game is defintely worth purchasing, for history nerds like myself, strategy gamers, and just about anyone else (you can't go wrong with snagging this during the holiday sale). Try it out!

Their is no O.P. things that can ruin the game, even Unique Abilities that are called O.P. have a small downside that if exploited is perfect. I cannot think of any gaem breaking mechanic that will destroy it any time to come. Please buy this game, and maybe I may be competing against you to build an empire that will stand the test of time. Another side not is that you will need to buy the Expansions as they are worth it and are brilliant. I brought them then couldn't go back to playing without them.

review: I have owned Civ V now for almost two years, and it has always been nothing but awesome. Even more awesome now with the Brave New World DLC, and the addition of Religion, Spies, Congress, Tourism, Trade Routes, etc. This has made the game even MORE interesting. I lose track of hours on this, building my economy, while trying to build my army and not breaking the bank in the process, watching other civilization's machinations with my spies, and increasing border expansion to an all-time high without pissing off my neighbors. It is indeed very complex and I am always learning new tips and tricks. Besides Skyrim, this is most definitely my favorite game on Steam. I give it 10/10 cupcakes.

review: This is a truly amazing game, its fun to play and has so much replay value it will cause you to play for hours on end thinking; 'just one more turn...' The multiplayer however is also fantastic and makes the gameplay even more interesting, but it can be very buggy and prone to random crashes often making the experience enraging and annoying. Lucky the majority of the time this game runs smoothly and without issue, making it more than worthwhile for any gamer interested in the strategy genre. However I strongly recommend if I was you, purchase the 'Complete Edition' version of the game as the 'Gods and Kings' and 'Brave New World' expansion packs make this game even more exceptional, fixes many of the base games issues and bugs while presenting the player with a massive extension to the base game. The packs basically add two extra massive games into the already massive base game. Overall this game scores a 7/10 + Fantastic experience and replayability + Amazing and worthwhile expansions + Fun and challenging multiplayer - Multiplayer is often full of bugs and random crashes

review: Firaxis took a lot of risks with this game, changing so much from Civ 4. However pretty much all of them have payed off, and made the game much better for it. One great change is leaders speaking in their actual language making metting leaders more interesting. No stacking of military units is a massive plus, in civ 4 you were just smashing stack after stack into each other, it felt like there was no strategy. Now it is much more interesting and feels like it takes skill. The only real thing I don't like about it is the announcer, he has a very boring voice. No where near as interesting as Leonard Nimroys.
game-hours: 79.7
review: First off, I played Civ4 before this and I really enjoyed it. Now Civ5 got more content, like nukes, changed some things around, like that only one military unit can stay on one tile and of course upgraded the graphics. But it is still Sid Meier's Civilization, you start of with settlers and warriors and play from 4000 b.C. to the near future +2100. Play with one or up to 11 other players on one map! But this time around, there are City States, you can either be Allies with them and enjoy their benefits or fight them and annex their city. What I also liked is that you can find natural wonders, which when worked on by the city benefits you with Faith. For new players, they put the effort in to make advisors, but as soon as you know the basics, they get really annoying. Overall a great game, but you better of with the DLC. This game gets an 'G' for Good. (A>G>O)

review: I've never played any of the previous Civ games and I'm a huge fan of Catan (a board/online game it reminded me of) so this automatically won me over. Civ 5 is more complex than Catan in that it has more features to offer and it's more organized, less random, and more relaxed whereas you can never predict what your opponents are gonna do in Catan so it gets pretty intense. You play a historical leader (each civ comes with perks) and choose how you interact with other leaders and their civilizations. You can build whatever you want, from armies to cities, as the technology and resources become available to you throughout the centuries. It's addicting and so much fun; I can only imagine the shenanigans and how awesome it'd be to get a group of friends to play. Plus I'm really diggin a lot of the references made with the achievement names. Can't believe I didn't get into this sooner.

You can play for 300+ hours and still get thrilled by beating the pants off the AI. You still look at your clock every half hour and keep extending your play deadline just a FEW turns longer, until it's like 3am and you have to work in a few hours. Oh and if you somehow get bored with the dozens of civs, scenarios, map and victory types, etc, you can go and MOD the  out of it. 10/10

review: This game is a true must-have for any PC gamer. I read an article, I believe on PC Gamer, that said that this is one of three must-haves for any PC gamer, and I agree. The addictiviness of Empire building in a stregy setting may not be readily apparent to the average gamer, and I must admit, I was skeptical the first time I heard of this game. But then I played it. And I fell in love. The depth of the simulation is offset by the simplicity of the interface of the game, and it can be as in-depth as YOU want it to be, allowing it to be a deep, hardcore government strategy game fore the more hardcore fans of the genre, or a simplistic delve into some fun empire building for the more casual. 0 outta 5!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

review: Amazingly good strategy game. If u're looking for great turn-based strategy game u don't have to search any longer! This is the masterpiece of strategy games, and with it's 2 big dlc's it's even better than just the base game. If i only had more time to play it ... It would be a great game if you're in prison, u'd have a lot of time to improve your strategy. Score 10/10!

review: Much better than "CATS". Also, much better than being assaisnated by my own colleagues at the CIA for 'talking too much'. God, believe me, I've been through that. Also, MUCH better than hearing Pearl Jam cover that crappy song from Frozen. My god....talk about Jumping the Shark. All of that being said, I play this game over and over again and I'm not sure I'm even any good at it. I win and I lose. But I have a good time doing it. If my g'friend is off on a Sunday and I play from 8am to 3pm, there's usually some blowback, but maybe that speaks to the addictive qualities of this thing. I'm above average in my abilities to disuage my lover from resenting me for spending that one extra hour destroying Catherine the Great's legacy across 4 cities because she won't just share some f'in cotton with me for a 'I love the King Day'. Because, if she knew Catherine the Great and how snide she can be, she's be sitting there with me, asking if there's anyway to loosen that corsett and humiliate her in court...but, alas. No such options exist in this game. That's not why I play it, though. I play it for the glory.

review: This game is by far my favorite. If you don't know already, it's a 4X where you control one of history's civilizations from the stone age all the way up to the near future. The main changes from 4 to 5 is the change of square spaces to hexagonal spaces for movement. Also, this interation removes the stacking and limits you to one military unit and one civilian unit per hex, so no more "stacks of doom". I dislike how in the base game they left out a lot of the features from previous games (such as espionage and religion); however, they add those features back in on the expansions. All in all, the game is addictive and hard to resist the "just one more turn" syndrome. I would give this a 9/10 with exapansions and a 7/10 with just the base game

review: Have an hour until you need to get to work? I guess this is the game to spend your time on. Once you start playing there is no going back, until you lose of course. Back in the past, when I had this game torrented, I had spent over 14 hours STRAIGHT playing. It turned me into a monster, that even my parents rejected me. They wanted me off the computer but I denied them and told them that my time is needed to be spent here. Playing Civilization is similar to being locked in limbo. The only way out is to either win correctly or lose with dignity. If you intend to play for 5 minutes, make it a couple days. Your life will turn upside down and you wont know what hit you. Your girlfriend wants sex. What do you say?  NO! Sex is for the weak. This game will teach the ups and downs of society, religion, and war. It will teach you what the true meaning of greed is. Don't let your gaurd down, the  in Greece (The AI BOT), will  that you are 'too close' to their land.  them over when you get the chance, show all who is boss. 10/10 Get this game, 100% no regrets.

review: Do you want to play for more than eight, sixteen or maybe twenty-four hours to become the greatest civilization in economy, religion, tourism, miltary power or religion? Well, if that is the case, this game is extremely addictive. When you start, you don't want to stop until your child, your fragile civilization, becomes the Owner of the World. I would say the only great defect of this game is the multiplayer. It improved a lot but still has some bugs and performance issues. No mention that is really hard to play with strangers without getting kicked or suffer quiters. An important note: the game improves a lot since Gods & Kings, and much more with Brave New World. The vainilla version lacks some importants features which make it too similar to his previous version Civilization IV which is dissapointing at least. But with a complete version, you have fun guarantee and if you bore of this, you can play the Scenarios to get some tasty variations.

Fun with friends. It is always so much fun building your own empire, whether you overpower your enemy or just simply build a utopia for your people and win through peace, the game is awesome. P.S. Just press "next turn" already...

review: Just look at the amount of time reviewers have spent playing this game... Yeah, it's that good. As other reviewers have mentioned, the game is newb-friendly. I was brand new to the Civ franchise, but thanks to the advisor system in the game, I was able to pick up the basics very quickly. After you've started feeling comfortable, or if you are not a newb in the first place, those advisors can easily be turned off in the options. This is a fantastic strategy game that will keeping you thinking for hours... Even when you're not playing! The gameplay is rich, deep and complex. I've spent over 400 hours with this game, and I still notice new things and consider different strategies. I started playing games on Warlord difficulty level (3 of 8), and I've advanced enough that I feel pretty confident on Emperor now (6 of 8). I recommend watching some Deity-level Let's Plays to help develop your understanding of the game and to consider some new strategies. Civ 5 is also stunningly beautiful. However, you can play it on older systems. When I got the game I was running a 2006 Dell Dimension E521 (with an AMD Athlon 64 3800 and an nVidia GT9500 (which I put in specifically so I could do some gaming), and it ran just fine on low to medium settings. It just got MORE beautiful when I built my new rig with a 4th gen Intel i7 and GTX760 and could run it on max settings. The music is also spectacular. I'm still listening to it (not muting it like some other games I play) during gameplay even after 400 hours! I have all the DLC, and I would highly recommend you go ahead and get the Complete Edition. Bare minimum though, get the Brave New World expansion. It adds so much richness to the base game. Enjoy building a civilization that will stand the test of time!

review: This took my life. This took my soul. This took my everything. How can someone create such an addicting game? I mean, I don't normally even like strategy-based games. Still, in just a few days I have accomplished to play 30 hours of this game. At first, I tried it with my friends on multiplayer. I had NO idea what to do, and succeeded to build a city. Then after a few turns I tried to understand it a bit, and at last, I took an interest in the game. Later on, I started a singleplayer save, and hot damn it took time to get off the computer. Everything about the game is great. So many different Civilizations, so many choices for your world's shape. Also, running out of people to play as is no problem, there is always the workshop. I just love how you start as a one small town, and at the end you are some kind of gigantic nation. But that of course depend on how you play it. Also I like about how many things you can do in this game. You can research all kinds of things, you can build all kinds of buildings, and you can train all kinds of units. 10/5 would buy again (even though a friend gifted this to me) BUY IT. NOW.

review: This installment of the Civilization franchise has the best gameplay you will find in any Civilization game. Guiding an empire from fledgling tribal city into world spanning empire is amazing, and does not get stale, even over many iterations of founding and building nations. Excellent graphics help add to the game, and the fact that Leonard Nimoy does loads of voicework in the game is great. Overall, highly recommend the game and the expansion packs for it, including Gods & Kings, and Brave New World, which add new civilizations, scenarios, and units that keep the game interesting.

review: This game is highly entertaining. The city managment, resources aquirement, and combat is top notch for a turn-based strategy. It has eaten away at countless of my hours and I still play it. One of my favorite strategy games easily. When you first start the game will seem overwhelming with alll sorts of meters, counters and menus that you don't know the function of, but don't worry, you will learn. The list of different civilizations is very vast, espicially with dlc. (which I urge you to get). Each civilization gets unique stuff such as buildings, improvements, units, and abilities. Each civ is balanced and is geared toward a certain victory type; Domination (take over the world using your military), Cultural, (influencing the world with social policies, or with dlc tourism), Science, (Launching an intergalactic space ship) (Must have A LOT of techs to aquire), and diplomatic, (Get the enough votes for world leader). For example Japan is geared toward domination, because their unique ability is that their units fight at full strength no matter how damaged they are. This game is amazing and anyone who enjoys long strategy games will LOVE it. The multiplayer makes it all the more fun with countless back stabbing, allainces, and political conversations between friends. I give this game a well deserved 8.5/10

review: Have you ever once looked into yourself in a self-reflective manner, contemplating existence as you stared into a mirror, and wondered?: "What would it like to have George Washington and Genghis Khan duke it out against eachother in a battle for world-domination?" With Civilization, you can accomplish this. CiV is not a game that requires many reflexes; in fact, it requires no reflexes at all; it trades this in for being vexingly complex, filled head-to-toe with different stats and numbers and other things which will have your mind moving faster than it would in your average game, but your mouse much slower. Whether this is a "good" or "bad" characteristic depends on your tastes; if you like action-packed FPSes filled with massive explosions and a fervor of button-tapping, CiV will disappoint you. If you like calming, casual puzzle games where you mix and match coloured gems or other such objects; CiV will disappoint you. However, if you like spending hours slowly building up your empire, moving military units to resources and strategic positions, and discussing diplomatic policies with AIs or your friends with a similar lack of a social life; CiV will *not* dissapoint you; in fact, quite the opposite. CiV is interesting as it has a variety of different playstyles; perhaps you want to create world peace as Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden? Or send a spaceship to Alpha Centauri as Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon? Or raze across the land like a fire, destroying and conquering all in your way as Attila of the Huns? CiV endorses multiple different playstyles which make the game interesting; and different civs have different abilties which make others better at some playstyles; most of which are *fairly* balanced, although some civs can't help but be somewhat mediocre (e.g., America, The Ottoman Empire [before BNW], The Iroquois Confederacy), at least in comparison to others. If a single-player game seems to drag on for too long, CiV has a solution; multi-player. You can team up with your friends for a co-op, split up into tag-teams and viciously try to take eachother down, or even play an "every man for himself" strategy. The one problem is that, unfortunately, multi-player does seem to have quite a few glitches; although these aren't game-breaking, they can be quite the nuisance at times. I'm somewhat hopeful that Firaxis will make an attempt to deal with some of these. To end this short, spur-of-the-moment review; CiV is a game I highly suggest; unless you want to have a social-life, as buying it -and, hence, becoming addicted to it- will often severely damage your "life" to the point of being unsalvageable.

review: Sid Meier's Civ 5 is the latest forray into civilization building from this acclaimed series. It is also the first in the series that I have played, so my review of the game is unbiased by the previous installments. Many have said that "Civ 3 is the best" or that "Civ 4 is the only one to play" but I've found that Civ 5 is an excellent game that stands quite easily on its own merits and is definitely worth a play by anyone that enjoys a long, drawn out, turn based civilization management game. Pros: Wonderfully polished Many civilizations to choose from Great music Extremely variable gameplay Cons: Some DX Bugs Resource intensive (laptops tend to lag) Might spend TOO much time playing this game A relaxing game that you can dump hours into. This is one of the best multiplayer games that I've had the joy of playing, and singleplayer is also a blast. The expansion, Gods and Kings, while expensive, is totally worth purchasing. The other DLC is good, but since there's so much of it wait for a sale. A

review: Veterans of the Civilizations franchise may be immediately put off by the lack of features in this hexagonal iteration, but the expansions (GK+BNW) add a lot of content back and Steam frequently has them for sale. To be honest the smaller scale of warfare due to 1-army-per-square and reduced warfare abilities in general as a result put me off at first. However, I really came to appreciate how much more significant country borders became as a result of this, making each expansion risky due to quick flanking maneuvers by the AI. I still think the AI for Civ is still too predictable and even when set on random, a bit harsh depending on your difficulty level. Still recommend the game for fans and newcomers, you will easily end up spending way more time than you thought carving your perfect Civ.

review: Civ 5 is probably one of my all time favorite games. Though not as in depth as other Civ games, Civ 5 is an amazing game worth playing. Reply value is incredible, every civilization is unique and different in many ways, and never seems to get boring thanks to a wide variety of difficulty settings and expansion packs. I highly recommend this to anyone who is new to strategy games, or to any experienced veteran out there. I also recommend the expansion packs to improve gameplay. Civ 5, to say the least, is a truly remarkable piece of art. And quite addicting at that. The AI may be a little funky at times, but that is to be expected for nearly every game. I would pay 50 dollars for this game (evidently that was the price when it first came out), it is just that good, and that is saying something for myself because I am quite frugal and prefer to only purchase games when they are on sale. This is one of those games that you will be up till 4 a.m. in the morning, telling yourself, "just one more turn......"

review: Ever wondered what the world would be like if the Shoshone tribes had tanks and machine guns to battle some samurais? Or if Ghandi was held prisoner by Genghis Khan and after many centuries of captivity, India was saved by the Irish? Civ V is a very well furnished strategy game where the smallest quarell over some truffles can cause heinous wars. Building, trading, invading/evading, Civ V is all about those stuffs. Some drawbacks though, it is a real time consummer. Also, the game is less meaningfull (not complete) without Gods & Kings and A Brave New World: two extensions that make this game a killer. So prepare your settlers and equip yourself with some fine diplomacy and strategy! (with numerous and technically more advanced troups on the side just in case).

review: An amazing game if you like strategy games. Has plenty of gameplay, can keep you hooked for literally hundreds of hours. And since the strategy is turn based, you have no rush to play moves off quickly, like an RTS. But still, wished it ran a bit faster and the loading time is a bit long, but otherwise a great game. 10/10 WOULD BANG.... I MEAN BUY.

review: Amazing game, I was reluctant at first, saw it pop-up a bunch of times in reviews but I couldn't understand why people like it so much, from the screenshots it seemed like a simple tabletop game, boy was I wrong. This game will keep you playing and playing for hours, just one more turn, just one more turn. P.S. don't expect to finish a game in one go; games tend to last for days.

review: With all the expansions, Civ V is an extremely well executed strategic game true to its root. Full of content and endlessly replayable with friends. Had quite a few hiccups in multiplayer, but now they are largely fixed. Steep price to get with all the DLC, but well worth it.

review: What makes this game is the Expansions, they add lots of content and make the game more enjoyable. With this game you can play as Caeser in 2024 sending a nuke to the warmongering Ghandi. If you like historical accuracy/plausability you may be shocked by this, if you like absurdity and grandness but want a challenge you'll like this. If your new to Grand strategy game this is a good starter as the UI is laid out well and very easy to access. A good game can last for 12 hours from start to finish. I have to force myself not to click the "One more turn" button

review: This game asks one simple question: Can you build a nation that will stand the test of time? Its not an easy question to work out "yes" to if you're looking for a challenge. The AI might be random at times or it might be entirely logical, But from playing it I've learned you should always keep on your toes. Outside of easy, the computer players can outmatch you but not just militarily - unless you hit the ground running you can be quickly overshadowed. This incarnation of the Civilization franchise makes a lot of changes, namely the switch from a grid to hexagons and the removal of the ability to stack units. Some people loathe this but after playing it i've found the whole thing less of a meatgrinder; no throwing your army at a stack of 23 armies on one square, no 31+ stack of armies lying in wait when you attack an enemy city. In fact the system makes it more viable and likely to surround a city (which is what happened in most wars by the way) rather than charge headlong at it with a bulk army. Every detail of the world is beautifully rendered, sometimes I found myself panning the camera over my and my enemies' civs imagining what life is like in the piece of Earth they have carved out. Gods and Kings and Brave New World - its epansions - at a ton of variety to the game. The culture victory option for example, involves tourism and cultural influence, which is how places like America, Japan and the UK ingrain their cultural mannerisms elsewhere in the real world. The game is not just beautiful on a strategic level; I'm a fan of history and culture and this game is bursting at the seams with it, especially with Brave New World; every technology has an associated quote be it a passage of a holy book, a line from a Greek, Roman or Shakesperian play or a phrase coined by a legendary person. Every world wonder you complete shows you an oil-on-canvas painting of it complete with a quote that relates to its purpose or its reputation, in the second expansion your great people can world-renowned paintings and compositions which you, the player, can enjoy for yourself. It makes you want to build wonders even more if this is your kind of thing. Whether you're an empire builder at heart, passionate for history, love high culture or just enjoy watching burning everything to the ground. This is a worthy addition to the franchise so get this, get the expansions too (even if you're nonreligions, Gods and Kings adds a lot of other stuff to the game), this game would be ideal for you. Just don't expect to be done in a three-hour session; Civ is not a game for the twitch player. Its famous for that.

Through violent conquest or peaceful cunning, the game's near infinite number of ways to be played adds a replayability unrivaled by any game before it save some modern FPS's. As one of my top 5 games of all time, I cannot recommend this game enough.

review: Civilization V is a top notch strategy game.It is both appealing for non experienced players and for hardcore fans.It keeps you on your toes from the first turns.My favorite part of the game is the early game.When your main objective is to explore the map.I am always excited about the civilizations that I meet,the resources that I find and the various natural wonders.During the early game I am planning the expansion of my civilization depending on these factors. I also enjoy this a lot because I like history.You learn an awful lot about the history of these civilizations just by playing. The combat is great,there are tons of strategies that you can adopt.Plenty of units and tons of variations because of the terrain.The replay-ability of the game is huge. The vanilla version of the game has some problems,but with all the DLCs and the patches,the game is truly amazing. If you are even a little bit attracted to strategy games.Civilization V should be on your list with all the DLCs!

review: It all started when our protagonist, Civ 5, woke up in a pumpkin patch. It was the fourth time it had happened. Feeling ridiculously exasperated, Civ 5 groped a sock, thinking it would make him feel better (but as usual, it did not). Unexpectedly, he realized that his beloved  of truth was missing! Immediately he called his friend, Leroy Jenkins. Civ 5 had known Leroy Jenkins for (plus or minus) one million years, the majority of which were sassy ones. Leroy Jenkins was unique. He was intelligent though sometimes a little... dimwitted. Civ 5 called him anyway, for the situation was urgent. Leroy Jenkins picked up to a very happy Civ 5. Leroy Jenkins calmly assured him that most koalas yawn before mating, yet otters usually earnestly grimace *after* mating. He had no idea what that meant; he was only concerned with distracting Civ 5. Why was Leroy Jenkins trying to distract Civ 5? Because he had snuck out from Civ 5's with the  of truth only four days prior. It was a saucy little  of truth... how could he resist? It didn't take long before Civ 5 got back to the subject at hand: his  of truth. Leroy Jenkins sighed. Relunctantly, Leroy Jenkins invited him over, assuring him they'd find the  of truth. Civ 5 grabbed his desk and disembarked immediately. After hanging up the phone, Leroy Jenkins realized that he was in trouble. He had to find a place to hide the  of truth and he had to do it thoughtfully. He figured that if Civ 5 took the truck, he had take at least eleven minutes before Civ 5 would get there. But if he took the ? Then Leroy Jenkins would be alarmingly screwed. Before he could come up with any reasonable ideas, Leroy Jenkins was interrupted by seven abrasive aligators that were lured by his  of truth. Leroy Jenkins sighed; 'Not again', he thought. Feeling frustrated, he thoughtfully reached for his mitten and aptly backhanded every last one of them. Apparently this was an adequate deterrent--the discouraged critters began to scurry back toward the thicket, squealing with discontent. He exhaled with relief. That's when he heard the  rolling up. It was Civ 5. ----o0o---- As he pulled up, he felt a sense of urgency. He had had to make an unscheduled stop at Wal-Mart to pick up a 12-pack of pencils, so he knew he was running late. With a calculated leap, Civ 5 was out of the  and went indiscriminately jaunting toward Leroy Jenkins's front door. Meanwhile inside, Leroy Jenkins was panicking. Not thinking, he tossed the  of truth into a box of mittens and then slid the box behind his piano. Leroy Jenkins was concerned but at least the  of truth was concealed. The doorbell rang. 'Come in,' Leroy Jenkins sassily purred. With a careful push, Civ 5 opened the door. 'Sorry for being late, but I was being chased by some funny-smelling maniac in a Vette,' he lied. 'It's fine,' Leroy Jenkins assured him. Civ 5 took a seat vaguely close to where Leroy Jenkins had hidden the  of truth. Leroy Jenkins cringed trying unsuccessfully to hide his nervousness. 'Uhh, can I get you anything?' he blurted. But Civ 5 was distracted. Without warning, Leroy Jenkins noticed a selfish look on Civ 5's face. Civ 5 slowly opened his mouth to speak. '...What's that smell?' Leroy Jenkins felt a stabbing pain in his butt when Civ 5 asked this. In a moment of disbelief, he realized that he had hidden the  of truth right by his oscillating fan. 'Wh-what? I don't smell anything..!' A lie. A insensitive look started to form on Civ 5's face. He turned to notice a box that seemed clearly out of place. 'Th-th-those are just my grandma's mittens from when she used to have pet bunnies. She, uh...dropped 'em by here earlier'. Civ 5 nodded with fake acknowledgement...then, before Leroy Jenkins could react, Civ 5 randomly lunged toward the box and opened it. The  of truth was plainly in view. Civ 5 stared at Leroy Jenkins for what what must've been four seconds. Unexpectedly, Leroy Jenkins groped wildly in Civ 5's direction, clearly desperate. Civ 5 grabbed the  of truth and bolted for the door. It was locked. Leroy Jenkins let out a eccentric chuckle. 'If only you hadn't been so protective of that thing, none of this would have happened, Civ 5,' he rebuked. Leroy Jenkins always had been a little insensitive, so Civ 5 knew that reconciliation was not an option; he needed to escape before Leroy Jenkins did something crazy, like... start chucking mittens at him or something. All of a sudden, he gripped his  of truth tightly and made a dash toward the window, diving headlong through the glass panels. Leroy Jenkins looked on, blankly. 'What the hell? That seemed excessive. The other door was open, you know.' Silence from Civ 5. 'And to think, I varnished that window frame nine days ago...it never ends!' Suddenly he felt a tinge of concern for Civ 5. 'Oh. You ..okay?' Still silence. Leroy Jenkins walked over to the window and looked down. Civ 5 was gone. ----o0o---- Just yonder, Civ 5 was struggling to make his way through the pumpkin patch behind Leroy Jenkins's place. Civ 5 had severely hurt his arm during the window incident, and was starting to lose strength. Another pack of feral aligators suddenly appeared, having caught wind of the  of truth. One by one they latched on to Civ 5. Already weakened from his injury, Civ 5 yielded to the furry onslaught and collapsed. The last thing he saw before losing consciousness was a buzzing horde of aligators running off with his  of truth. About seven hours later, Civ 5 awoke, his butt throbbing. It was dark and Civ 5 did not know where he was. Deep in the humid desert, Civ 5 was abundantly lost. A few minutes later, he remembered that his  of truth was taken by the aligators. But at that point, he was just thankful for his life. That's when, to his horror, a oversized aligator emerged from the cornfield. It was the alpha aligator. Civ 5 opened his mouth to scream but was cut short when the aligator sunk its teeth into Civ 5's face. With a faint groan, the life escaped from Civ 5's lungs, but not before he realized that he was a failure. Less than two miles away, Leroy Jenkins was entombed by anguish over the loss of the  of truth. 'MY PRECIOUS!!' he cried, as he reached for a sharpened spoon. With a heroic thrust, he buried it deeply into his neck. As the room began to fade to black, he thought about Civ 5... wishing he had found the courage to tell him that he loved him. But he would die alone that day. All that remained was the  of truth that had turned them against each other, ultimately causing their demise. And as the dew on melancholy sappling branches began to reflect the dawn's reddish glare, all that could be heard was the chilling cry of distant aligators, desecrating all things sacred to virtuous men, and perpetuating an evil that would reign for centuries to come. Our heroes would've lived unhappily ever after, but they were too busy being dead. So, no one lived forever after, the end. :'(

review: Civ5 is an epic and complex analytic game. Whatsoever, I can recommend it to everybody who likes turn-based strategy and folks who like to use their brain. When you're playing Call-of- and else, don't buy Civ5, I really believe your neurological structure mass will be damaged when you try to find out how the game mechanics of this dainty videogame would work. Hm, yes, I'm really certain you would die. Exruciating and without blessedness and love. Doesn't matter, the game is easier than Civ IV and it has it's own stupidity (click the right thing, next round, click the right thing, next round - oh a nuclear bomb! - click the right thing, next round) but it's in principle good mastered so that it isn't in evidence. Enjoy - or buy Civ IV, both are good, the older is better but the recent is more modern.

The game feels extremely rewarding no matter which victory path you choose, be it Diplomatic Victory, Space Race, Domination Victory, or Cultural Victory. Each game expansion DLC drastically changes the game, from the launch cinematics to core game mechanics, making the DLCs worth their value. From Great Wonders, Great People, Great Works of Art and Literature, to Social Policies and Idealogy, the game also incorporates historical places, people, and ideas into the game, making it even more attractive to our inner history-nerds.

review: This game is a next-level strategy game. Civ V is a masterpiece and now the standard for all strategy 4 EX games, and don't be suprised if you see more hex based games popping up. Civ V isn't the great game it is without the expantions, unfortuantely, and you might think it wanting for more civs unless you get the expansions, which are huge by the way. Civ V is another classic in the series, and it is an experience that you should want to be apart of unless you hate strategy games in general. This is one of the Priemer games on PC, and is definately a must buy for any hard core gamer.

review: Veterans of the Civilizations franchise may be immediately put off by the lack of features in this hexagonal iteration, but the expansions (GK+BNW) add a lot of content back and Steam frequently has them for sale. To be honest the smaller scale of warfare due to 1-army-per-square and reduced warfare abilities in general as a result put me off at first. However, I really came to appreciate how much more significant country borders became as a result of this, making each expansion risky due to quick flanking maneuvers by the AI. I still think the AI for Civ is still too predictable and even when set on random, a bit harsh depending on your difficulty level. Still recommend the game for fans and newcomers, you will easily end up spending way more time than you thought carving your perfect Civ.

review: Civ 5 is probably one of my all time favorite games. Though not as in depth as other Civ games, Civ 5 is an amazing game worth playing. Reply value is incredible, every civilization is unique and different in many ways, and never seems to get boring thanks to a wide variety of difficulty settings and expansion packs. I highly recommend this to anyone who is new to strategy games, or to any experienced veteran out there. I also recommend the expansion packs to improve gameplay. Civ 5, to say the least, is a truly remarkable piece of art. And quite addicting at that. The AI may be a little funky at times, but that is to be expected for nearly every game. I would pay 50 dollars for this game (evidently that was the price when it first came out), it is just that good, and that is saying something for myself because I am quite frugal and prefer to only purchase games when they are on sale. This is one of those games that you will be up till 4 a.m. in the morning, telling yourself, "just one more turn......"

review: Ever wondered what the world would be like if the Shoshone tribes had tanks and machine guns to battle some samurais? Or if Ghandi was held prisoner by Genghis Khan and after many centuries of captivity, India was saved by the Irish? Civ V is a very well furnished strategy game where the smallest quarell over some truffles can cause heinous wars. Building, trading, invading/evading, Civ V is all about those stuffs. Some drawbacks though, it is a real time consummer. Also, the game is less meaningfull (not complete) without Gods & Kings and A Brave New World: two extensions that make this game a killer. So prepare your settlers and equip yourself with some fine diplomacy and strategy! (with numerous and technically more advanced troups on the side just in case).

review: (could have sworn I did osmething liek this before) Ever wanted to take the reigns and manage your own nation? Well now you can! :) Take command of prestigious nations like the USA, Great Britian, Japan, China, Russia, Germany and much more, and contrcut cities (even rename them if you'd like) and bound your nation forward through the starting era of your choosing-be fro mthe "Ancient Era" or even disregarding that and just starting in the future era with all technology unlocked. You can negotiate with other nations through trade agreemnets, Research partnerships and much more. Your peopel giving you trouble with belly aching, or is your nation incapable of producing that little osmething you want? Go talk to a discovered civilizatio nand see if they have it up for trade :) I recommend this game to those who have always dreamed of commanding their own nations. Give it a try!

review: Been playing civ since the first one in the dos days. Genuinely thought this game was rubbish when I first started and preferred to play Civ4. Picked up both the expansions which changed my mind. G+K fixes the game and makes it playable and BNW is an improvement on that. So yeah, good game as long as you have at least G+K.

review: Ah, CivV. The game you don't multiplayer with anyone you like, or you'll never speak to each other again. When I first played CivV, I wasn't sure what to think about it. Civ5 founded an entire genre. It's not the "best" in the genre (my friends inform me that is Galactic Civilizations II,) but it's the bread and butter. Civ5 is the best introduction to strategy games avaliable. Most of what the game offers doesn't appeal to me, personally; the multiplayer has some bugs, and I wasn't joking when I said the game ruins relationships. My boyfriend didn't talk to me for a day after our first match. I don't enjoy the idea of several weeks of playing the same game, and it strikes me as tedious, personally. That's just my personal preferences, though. The game? It's good and worth giving a try, if you're interested. Civ5 is the best one so far. I do recommend getting the Brave New World and the Gods & Kings DLC if you decide to, however. They really add a lot to the game and flesh out some of its weaker aspects.

review: Without any of the addon packages, Civ V is still a decent game, but somewhat of a sidegrade from Civ IV. Add Gods and Kings and Brave New World, however, and you have yourself a heck of a game that's very rich in content, very deep in gameplay, and very, very addictive. My complaints are few: namely, I wish the barbarian levels were adjustable (they'll wreck your civ in multiplayer) and I wish multiplayer were a bit less buggy. However, these are minor compared to all the amazing gameplay.

review: Civilization V is a top notch strategy game.It is both appealing for non experienced players and for hardcore fans.It keeps you on your toes from the first turns.My favorite part of the game is the early game.When your main objective is to explore the map.I am always excited about the civilizations that I meet,the resources that I find and the various natural wonders.During the early game I am planning the expansion of my civilization depending on these factors. I also enjoy this a lot because I like history.You learn an awful lot about the history of these civilizations just by playing. The combat is great,there are tons of strategies that you can adopt.Plenty of units and tons of variations because of the terrain.The replay-ability of the game is huge. The vanilla version of the game has some problems,but with all the DLCs and the patches,the game is truly amazing. If you are even a little bit attracted to strategy games.Civilization V should be on your list with all the DLCs!

review: Play as a variety of civilisations in a fight to survive. Will you be a warmonging country, going for fast expansion and a conquest of the world? Will you be diplomatic, aiming to trade and ally? Will you be sneaky, pretending to ally with a country and then wipe them off the face of the earth? There are so many options, and each country has a relevant perk. Very much true to history... which you can rewrite! Did Japan take over Korea? Did Spain destroy everyone and control the map? Or did Germany choose to be a friendly, negotiating country? It's up to you in a world of endless possibilities. Another must have. My game library wouldn't be complete without it. And neither is yours.

review: Civilization 5 is possibly one of the most diverse strategy games to be released in the past 10 years. Often you are faced with killing everyone in the game just to win but Sid Meirs Civilization 5 lets you choose how to win, Let it be Cultural, Diplomatic, Science or if youre a fan of eliminating the competition, Domination. Civilization 5 puts you in the seat of historical leaders with unique building or units, and also unique traits that relate to how they ruled or dominated in the past. Replay value is a huge strongpoint for this game; the randomly generated maps with customizable options will drop you into a fresh experience every time you play a Match. The game also features maps such as Europe, Mediterranean, and Earth. The maps have accurate placements of geographic features that correlate to the real world landscape. Most importantly for me about Civilization is the huge knowledge you can earn from playing the game. Learn how leaders commanded their armies and how they rushed for continents to settle on. Natural wonders and World Wonders have descriptions that tell you history about them All in all civ is an amazing game that I would recommend everyone to buy, even if you're not a huge strategy buff, this will definitely make you think twice.

review: Civilization V is a very complex but easy to follow game with many different ways to play it; you can invite some friends or people you don't know to have a massive battle for victory with the unique methods of winning: culture, domination, time and science. You can load up some scenarios to play without having to start from scratch. or maybe the single player mode catches your eye by setting up your game just how you like it. Never have I seen a game so fun and player friendly in a very long time. Once you start playing, you cannot stop! Let alone the easy-to-install 2 DLC packs. For 20 each, so worth every penny. If you enjoy a fantastic balance between strategy and action, buy this game right now. Thanks for reading.

review: Certainly one of the best Strategy Games from one of the best Strategy Game companies. Civilization 5 is a strategy game about controling an empire throughout human history-from the settling of the first towns to the near future, and is fun in every part. The game manages to have the same concepts at all times, but still having different flavors depending on how far into a game you are. Great: Incredible amount of Content-doing everything the game has to offer is next to impossible. On top of this the game is very addictive, with stuff going on constantly to keep you hooked. Good: Game Concepts are very well made with one exception, and the game looks very nice and has a fitting art style. Combat is much more refined than past Civ games, ommiting the "Stack of Death" involving placing 30 units into one tile and bashing a city for minutes until one unit happens to win. Bad: Vanilla version of the game is lacking. Not to say it's bad, but the Complete Version for 50$ is far superior. And 50 dollars is a lot compared to some other options. Also, the happiness concept is a bit flawed. Having an unhappy civilization all but stops expanison, causing cities to not grow and also giving you a economic and military penalty. In order to keep a civilization happy, you must find luxury resources, which may be inacessible to you without a crazy amount of effort or trading, or may be right on your doorstep. Also, the AI seems to get a Happiness Bonus, who rarely have a problem with the unruly masses. It's kind of unfair. Ugly: The game is a bit unstable and is prone to crashing. I can't play on full screen, as my GPU becomes overused and the game needs to shut down. Other crashes are seemingly random, with little to no explanation on why. tl;dr: It's good. Crashes sometimes, but it's good. 9/10 Oh yeah, I'd get the Civilization SDK (Whatever that stands for) Along with this in the game tools section of Steam. It's a game editing tool that allows for Map Creation and making your own Mods.

After his conquests in America and Mongolia, Ghandi's bloodlust targeted my puny, pathetic civilization. He nuked all of my cities and razed all those who survived... His giant death robots marched towards my Capitol as I pleaded the great one to spare me, he simply laughed and pillaged all the remaining land I had... With my people starving and unhappy, I had no choice but to vote for Ghandi as world leader in the United Nations in exchange for oranges... GG, Ghandi... GG. 10/10

Not only is this game diplomaticaly focoused it also has extreme focous for combat and war situations aswell. For example your units gain a bonous for attacking from a hill and can often not attack with indirect fire...

review: This game and I have a love-hate relationship. While I would consider this game to definitely be in my top ten, it is dangerously addictive. I find myself going down a deep rabbit hole when I play this game because of how engrossing the premice of the game is. For those of you who haven't had the chance of picking up a copy of a game in this series so far, think of yourself as warned; the outside world will not know what happened to you until you can finally find the strength to crawl out of your darkhole from which you have been engrossed in for the passed 8 days known as Civilization; your friends will understand. Game Summary: Now for a quick rundown of how the game works. The title to the game describes the plot in itself: you are the plot. You start by choosing from a number of civilizations listed, ranging from 18th century America under George Washington to Napolean of France. How large you want the planet you are set on and how many other civilizations and city states you want to play against can either be determined by the player or randomly selected. Once you drop into the world you'll start out with a settler and a warrior in order to found your capital city and explore the surrounding lands. Each civilization has the gift of a specific bonus to it's empire as well as excess units and buildings which can be constructed only by that civilization. As your civilization progresses you eventually start to get more and more choice. You will move through each era depending on what technologies you research. With this freedom of choice players can also choose how they interact with other civilizations and city states. Eventually depending on what routes the player chooses to take in developing their civilization, there will be a number of options for how one can win the game. You can either achieve a science victory by researching all of the technologies and blasting off into space in order to plant your flag into the soil of a distant earth like planet! You can conquer the entire world with rutheless military might and capturing the capital of all other opposing in-game civs for a domination victory. These are jsut a few of the options available. The great thing about this game is rather than following a linear path for play, you really get to make history yourself; or if you want to go about doing it with a friend, drop into a match and play it out with your buddy! Mods: The second best thing about Civ V besides it being Civ V is that the game is very community orientated. There are hundreds upon hundreds of mods sitting in the steam workshop in this game ranging from new ingame civilizations to playable scenarios. The development team over at Firaxis did a great job in allowing variety for such a trully immersive game and one of the best ways they've done that is by letting the community take adding on new parts to the game themselves. DLC: The core game itself is fantastic but I would really recommend both DLC's for this game. They are a bit pricy so you might save some cash by just picking up the Civ V Gold Edition during a steam sale if you really want to get the fullest experience of the game. Not only does it add a number of new civilzations (that are personally my favorite to play as), it also brings back religion from the previous games in order to spread your pious agenda across the globe to assist in your victory. It also brings back spying as well as trade routes. Trade routes help for boosting ones economic output when connecting to other civilizations but they can also provide science and spread religion to other cities. These factors are just the tip of the iceberg especially considering there are so many mods on the steam workshop which require either the Gods and Kings DLC or the Brave New World add-on. In the end, they are both fantastic in-game content packs and really worth the extra penny.

Like the rest of the series, it's decently polished, easy to learn, has a lot of depth, and is periliously addictive. I didn't get into it as much as I did III, but that's probably just nostalgic bias. If I had to complain, I would say that the diploacy is rather limited, and not being able to trade communications blows. Thankfully, the rest of the game does it. Also, I nuked Beijing eleven times in a row, and it still stood, with two citzens who refused to die, District 13 style. 11/10.

review: If you've never played a Civilization game before, expect the learning curve to be a brick wall. You may be a seasoned gamer who's used to playing on normal or hard on other games right from the get-go, but if you are brand new to this series, play on super easy mode first to learn and experiment before trying harder difficult levels. That said, once you've learned the basics of the game and are ready for more challenging experiences, you will be greatly rewarded. Games typically last between 1 and 12 hours (depending on the type of victory you seek and the pace you set in the beginning), and you will never have the same experience twice, giving this game a massive replay value. There are always new maps to play on, new allies to make, new choices that will decide the game's outcome, and new diplomatic challenges to face. Civ V does a great job of landing you into a new game and you always feel satisfied by the game's end, even if you lose. That by itself always leaves you wanting to play more. Even if you somehow get bored of playing in single-player vanilla mode, multiplayer is offered and there are a plethora of mods out there to try. So if you're patient and willing to learn, I highly recommend this game and its expansion packs.

review: I LOVE this game! Its very realistic, allows you to change history with each action in each time period or stick to the books on what really happened in the past. The various ways to win the game gives a lot of choice in how you want to become the greatest civilization in history. There are a ton of mods that add many new ways to play aqnd win. Also you can invite friends and have massive battles or simply be peaceful with more then 10 players. Overall this game is amazing and is 5 out of 5.

review: Thanks to the streamlined experience and some simplification, Civ V makes for the best multiplayer experience out of the series. Unfortunately, for the same reason, Civ IV is probably the better single player experience as there feels to be more depth and you have all the time in the world to finish your turn. Vanilla can feel too restrictive and frustrating due to some of these changes, but Brave New World brings around some exciting End Game features meaning that runaway Civs aren't always guaranteed to win past T150 or so. If you got a group of like-minded friends who like strategy board games like Risk or Axis and Allies, I cannot recommend this game enough.

review: I love opening this game to play it. I do it every 20 minutes. Doing my absolute best to shy away from vulgarity this game crashes harder than the Challenger and bigger than the Titanic, And Far More Often. The game becomes increasingly unstable as you play, crash after crash, until you have to reboot the entire computer just to enjoy a single turn of play again. It also has truly bothersome glitches that cause dedicated units set to work tasks or to travel from point A to point B to just forget what they were doing entirely. I do not run this on a laptop or a toaster either, it does this on optimized specs. Now, let me tell you why you should buy it anyway. The big frustration of this game is that it really is just that fun. When you crash out and lose a lot of time and effort (just save your game before ending every single turn. Every Turn. I mean it.) it makes you all the madder because playing and accomplishing is so fun in this installment of Civ. I'd say it's probably the best one yet and I really got a feel for it lightning fast. Pro job..... other than what I assume to be the coding.

review: WITH the two expansions, Civ V is a brilliant 4X game, perhaps one of the best out there (although I couldn't say; I don't have a lot of experience with the genre). An epic strategy game with an accessible learning curve but a very high skill (and knowledge) ceiling, with hundreds of different techs to research, distinct units for different eras, a functional diplomacy system, stellar religion and covert ops mechanics and big- nukes made better with friends. Just make sure you pick up Brave New World and Gods And Kings with it, because without it the game feels bare-bones.

review: You're sitting on your high horse. You, George Washington, has eclipsed everyone in research. You are hailed as a God by your people. Nothing could be better. But wait... what the hell? Catherine of Russia declared war on you? No matter. Your mechanized infantry will wipe the floor with her crossbowmen. As you pile into her capital, the nuke sirens go off. Wait what? The most advanced of your adversaries is in the At- Dear God. You cower in fear as 7. SEVEN ATOMIC BOMBS PUMMEL YOU AND YOUR PEOPLE INTO THE DUST. Soon after, while you are lying in a ditch, watching your palace fall apart, you hear this, a strange Indian accent 'You should have given me that luxury resource 127 turns ago' Ghandi strikes again. 11/10 Ghandi Survival Simulator
game-hours: 492.2
review: I've wanted to write a review of this game for a long time. Hopefully 459 hours of play-time will make me credible enough to say that this is an AMAZING GAME! First of all, this is a strategy game that let's you shape history! In all aspects! Not only on the war front, but culturally, religiously, scientifically, and diplomatically. It's incredibly immersive, a drawback being that it can trap you for hours and hours on end until you see the sunrise. Well, not so much "see" as "barely notice" cos you're too busy 'one more turn'-ing. But that only proves how great it is! Individual games can go on for many, many hours before a victory, as 3/4 victory types (science, and diplomatic victories especially, cultural usually, but not necessarily domination) rely on latter eras to complete. However, gameplay evolves over the eras so game-changingly that you never get bored. You stop needing to worry about barbarians raiding your lands, and start sending out spies, and voting in world diplomatic congresses. You move on from fighting with arrows and swords to fighting with bullets and nukes. And most important of all, you grow your fledgeling civilization from one small village to a sprawling empire with a huge land area and population, building large wonders and fierce armies. Additionally, gameplay differs from game to game. You may have chosen a civilization with a deeper stress on diplomacy than the last playthrough so you shift focus away from military, for example, or this map has more oceans than last game, so you build a stronger navy. Such high replayability makes you come back for more and more civ. Again, 459 hours... So if you love strategy games, get this one! You can happily stay up all night getting nuked by Gandhi, getting beaten to constructing wonders by Ramesses II, and getting converted to Isabella's religion! Happy Civ-ing!

review: BOW DOWN TO MY EMPIRE Ahem. There are basically two types of people that will get this game. Those who've played the Sid Meier's Civilization series and are looking to get into the next installment, and those who've never tried it and are a little reluctant on embarking on what looks like a very complex strategy game. For those of you who have played the series before and haven't tried Civilization 5, just get this one too. There's really no reason not to go to the next installment. It's got nicer, more realistic graphics, new civilizations and smarter AI. With that said though, the DLCs are absolutely necessary. Vanilla Civ 5 was a bit lacking due to missing features we had just played in Civ 4 and not featuring many drastic improvements. God's and Kings, and Brave New World really make Civ 5 a true sequel to previous ones, and then some. They add religion and more complex politics and economics. Bottom line: If you spent hundreds of hours on previous Civ games, keep doing so on this upgraded version. Just make sure to get the DLCs Now for those of you who've heard of these games but never touched them, take a look at the other reviews on here, especially the hours played. Notice the pattern? 100 hours, 300 hours, some people even clock in 1000s of hours. And I know for a fact that many of them don't even touch the multiplayer and stick to the campaigns (or in many other cases, vice versa). We've all started out apprehensive about how complex the mechanics of the game look. You'd be surprised however, that you pick it up in about 15 minutes. The campaigns let you take on the role of histories greatest leaders and lead your nation to victory using whatever method you like. Do you love destroying opposing countries because they share a different culture than your own? Do you prefer making surrounding nations join you because the just see how happy your subjects are? Would you rather focus on science and discover electricity while everyone else is still using fire? If you answered no to all of those questions, then sure, fine, go play something else. In my case, the part of Civilization 5 that really shines is the Multiplayer. Team up or go against your friends while progressing to world domination. There used to be a lot of problems with starting a multiplayer game. Sometimes there were even crashes. However, it has now been stabilized and the only issue i can think of would be the long loading times. Even then, though, that never stopped us from playing until morning. Bottom line 2: Civilization 5 is incredibly easy to learn. The wide variety of choices let you be the ruler you want to be and make sure that the game never gets stale. It's got a few kinks, but you'll probably be too busy building the Taj Mahal in Italy to notice.

review: Are you serious ? You need a review for CIVILIZATION V and/or expansions ? You had to spend all your life living under a rock, just go, buy and play it if you didn`t already. Yes ! IT IS awesome. Just never ever play it "for a while" before you will go to sleep, it will not going to happen until your wife/fiance will come and slap you. "Just one more turn" syndrome is strong in it, i double dare you !

review: Civ5 is an epic and complex analytic game. Whatsoever, I can recommend it to everybody who likes turn-based strategy and folks who like to use their brain. When you're playing Call-of- and else, don't buy Civ5, I really believe your neurological structure mass will be damaged when you try to find out how the game mechanics of this dainty videogame would work. Hm, yes, I'm really certain you would die. Exruciating and without blessedness and love. Doesn't matter, the game is easier than Civ IV and it has it's own stupidity (click the right thing, next round, click the right thing, next round - oh a nuclear bomb! - click the right thing, next round) but it's in principle good mastered so that it isn't in evidence. Enjoy - or buy Civ IV, both are good, the older is better but the recent is more modern.

All of the aspects in the game (such as production) are linked to each other (building the great library for science, building a worker for happiness, etc) in such a way that every choice you make will shape the outcome of the game. It also offers wide range of potential playing styles, so that no matter what mood you're in you still want to play the game. Because of this, it has amazing replay value and appeals to a large amount of people. 9/10 (the multiplayer is weird) 0/10 if you're playing with Ghandi's AI.

review: I would definitely have to say that I thoroughly enjoy Civilization V. Civ 5 is up in my top ranked games, and many reasons got it there. One would be the fact that you can see your own civilization progress through the ages, which I find to be a very interesting concept. Should I list all of the reasons in this review, it would be a good 5 pages long, so instead, I'm just going to say that I highly recommend this game, just make sure that you have the patience for it. Finally, as I'm sure has been said in most reviews, I would say that although this game is great, like an actual empire, it takes the collaboration of all of the components to work swimmingly, that being said in simpler terms, this game is only worth it with all of the DLC that is available for purchase. It may be a sum of extra money for some, but it will be worth it in the end. If you are a bargain hunter though, then wait until a huge sale, such as the summer or winter sale, and get the game with all of the DLC for less than the price of the game alone when it's not on sale. That's all from me, so happy gaming!

review: I have a very soft spot for the Civilization series. Civilization III, is, to my memory, the first game I ever played. I have since played 2, the SNES version of the original, and this. Like the rest of the series, it's decently polished, easy to learn, has a lot of depth, and is periliously addictive. I didn't get into it as much as I did III, but that's probably just nostalgic bias. If I had to complain, I would say that the diploacy is rather limited, and not being able to trade communications blows. Thankfully, the rest of the game does it. Also, I nuked Beijing eleven times in a row, and it still stood, with two citzens who refused to die, District 13 style. 11/10.

review: After doing a few sex favors for a horny gamer girl that I've known since the vietnam war, I finally traded naked pics with an australian mafia to smuggle videogames and one of them was CiV which stands for "Can't into Vidya", if only starcraft 2: heart of the quickscope were on steam i'd be reccomending that instead but CiV was made by people who clearly failed middle school world geography because i started as mayans and found the city of Venice a few miles or tiles away and those crazy italians tried to culturally enrich my  but I called the powers of montezuma and la muerte peluda to overthrow their , but that wasnt the end because later came the dunegook empire trying to take over my new land and I had to 1v1 quickscope with the arab nerdlord and put them to shame because im american and I still remember the alamo

review: WITH the two expansions, Civ V is a brilliant 4X game, perhaps one of the best out there (although I couldn't say; I don't have a lot of experience with the genre). An epic strategy game with an accessible learning curve but a very high skill (and knowledge) ceiling, with hundreds of different techs to research, distinct units for different eras, a functional diplomacy system, stellar religion and covert ops mechanics and big- nukes made better with friends. Just make sure you pick up Brave New World and Gods And Kings with it, because without it the game feels bare-bones.

review: You're sitting on your high horse. You, George Washington, has eclipsed everyone in research. You are hailed as a God by your people. Nothing could be better. But wait... what the hell? Catherine of Russia declared war on you? No matter. Your mechanized infantry will wipe the floor with her crossbowmen. As you pile into her capital, the nuke sirens go off. Wait what? The most advanced of your adversaries is in the At- Dear God. You cower in fear as 7. SEVEN ATOMIC BOMBS PUMMEL YOU AND YOUR PEOPLE INTO THE DUST. Soon after, while you are lying in a ditch, watching your palace fall apart, you hear this, a strange Indian accent 'You should have given me that luxury resource 127 turns ago' Ghandi strikes again. 11/10 Ghandi Survival Simulator

review: I've wanted to write a review of this game for a long time. Hopefully 459 hours of play-time will make me credible enough to say that this is an AMAZING GAME! First of all, this is a strategy game that let's you shape history! In all aspects! Not only on the war front, but culturally, religiously, scientifically, and diplomatically. It's incredibly immersive, a drawback being that it can trap you for hours and hours on end until you see the sunrise. Well, not so much "see" as "barely notice" cos you're too busy 'one more turn'-ing. But that only proves how great it is! Individual games can go on for many, many hours before a victory, as 3/4 victory types (science, and diplomatic victories especially, cultural usually, but not necessarily domination) rely on latter eras to complete. However, gameplay evolves over the eras so game-changingly that you never get bored. You stop needing to worry about barbarians raiding your lands, and start sending out spies, and voting in world diplomatic congresses. You move on from fighting with arrows and swords to fighting with bullets and nukes. And most important of all, you grow your fledgeling civilization from one small village to a sprawling empire with a huge land area and population, building large wonders and fierce armies. Additionally, gameplay differs from game to game. You may have chosen a civilization with a deeper stress on diplomacy than the last playthrough so you shift focus away from military, for example, or this map has more oceans than last game, so you build a stronger navy. Such high replayability makes you come back for more and more civ. Again, 459 hours... So if you love strategy games, get this one! You can happily stay up all night getting nuked by Gandhi, getting beaten to constructing wonders by Ramesses II, and getting converted to Isabella's religion! Happy Civ-ing!

review: Much better than "CATS". Also, much better than being assaisnated by my own colleagues at the CIA for 'talking too much'. God, believe me, I've been through that. Also, MUCH better than hearing Pearl Jam cover that crappy song from Frozen. My god....talk about Jumping the Shark. All of that being said, I play this game over and over again and I'm not sure I'm even any good at it. I win and I lose. But I have a good time doing it. If my g'friend is off on a Sunday and I play from 8am to 3pm, there's usually some blowback, but maybe that speaks to the addictive qualities of this thing. I'm above average in my abilities to disuage my lover from resenting me for spending that one extra hour destroying Catherine the Great's legacy across 4 cities because she won't just share some f'in cotton with me for a 'I love the King Day'. Because, if she knew Catherine the Great and how snide she can be, she's be sitting there with me, asking if there's anyway to loosen that corsett and humiliate her in court...but, alas. No such options exist in this game. That's not why I play it, though. I play it for the glory.

review: I've spent a LOT of hours on this game, starting at release and up through all the DLC and both expansions. I know Civ is about conquest/domination to the exclusion of everything else for a lot of people, but I am a builder and not a warmonger. From my perspective, this style of play has improved over time. The AI is allowed to 'cheat' economically--running huge deficits that a human player would never be allowed to--but the AI is also not very smart, so that easily balances out their rule-breaking advantage, especially at difficulty level Prince or lower. The implementation of religion and espionage is a lot more impactful and a lot less mysterious, respectively, than in Civ IV.

review: This game is by far my favorite. If you don't know already, it's a 4X where you control one of history's civilizations from the stone age all the way up to the near future. The main changes from 4 to 5 is the change of square spaces to hexagonal spaces for movement. Also, this interation removes the stacking and limits you to one military unit and one civilian unit per hex, so no more "stacks of doom". I dislike how in the base game they left out a lot of the features from previous games (such as espionage and religion); however, they add those features back in on the expansions. All in all, the game is addictive and hard to resist the "just one more turn" syndrome. I would give this a 9/10 with exapansions and a 7/10 with just the base game

review: I'm going to try and keep this review short. So i'll just start by saying, this game doesn't cease to amaze me. If your interested in buying it, I would highly recomend it. The only downside is multiplayer, which is often secluded from the vanilla version of the game, as out of the servers open for playing, most require mods. But overall, a very good game. It nevers stops being fun, and is brilliant for strategy lovers.

review: After being gifted this particular game I was sceptical as to whether or not I would enjoy playing it, I do indeed enjoy strategy games but I also sometimes tire of them easily. I am also not one to read instructions, and for a complex game such as this I imagined it would hinder me at first if I didn't read about the mechanics. However, I decided to just dive in and see how well I could do to begin to understand how it functions, I haven't played a lot of this game but I have played enough to understand how it works and how to role out different units. It is particularly fun and entertaining but borderline addictive - thus my recommendation is to buy this game unless you feel that you will fall into a time sink wherein the only light you will see is from the burning fire and destruction in the massacre of other civilizations you plunder and ruin in your wake.

review: Without expansions, I think that Civ V is not that great of a game. With the addition of Gods and Kings and Brave New World, Civ V has turned into an excellent game. Every victory condition is now fun to play, unlike before the expansions, particularly in the case of the cultural victory. The AI, while not perfect, has siginificantly improved from it's base state. The addition of the World Congress is awesome to say the least, and the Religion mechanics are fun to mess around with. Overall i would say that the game is to the point where it is at the very least on par with Civ IV, and better in some aspects. Remember, the Complete edition is the only way to play this game, and is totally worth it. I even feel satisfied that I bought original GOTY edition the expansions individually years ago. It's tons of fun. Just watch out for Ghandi. That dude loves nukes.

review: Never, have I ever, not even once... had a session of this game that was not a complete blast. What can't be said about Civ V. It's the peak of gridded strategy games, not only will you have to plan out what direction you want your civilization to go in terms of how cultured, scientific, wealthy, and happiness, you'll also have to keep track of the plots and connections of various city-states and of course, other civilizations. You can play a plethora of leaders to be the ruler of your civ, each leader is unique and different to play; however, they are all fun to play, there's no real "bad" or "op" leader. The real fun of Civ V is the mulitplayer, whether you hop on a public server or have a match with your friends, Civilization will have you laughing, sweating, cheering, crying, and swearing. ~From a player with 60+ hours, and no completed games. I <3 this game.

review: I would definitely have to say that I thoroughly enjoy Civilization V. Civ 5 is up in my top ranked games, and many reasons got it there. One would be the fact that you can see your own civilization progress through the ages, which I find to be a very interesting concept. Should I list all of the reasons in this review, it would be a good 5 pages long, so instead, I'm just going to say that I highly recommend this game, just make sure that you have the patience for it. Finally, as I'm sure has been said in most reviews, I would say that although this game is great, like an actual empire, it takes the collaboration of all of the components to work swimmingly, that being said in simpler terms, this game is only worth it with all of the DLC that is available for purchase. It may be a sum of extra money for some, but it will be worth it in the end. If you are a bargain hunter though, then wait until a huge sale, such as the summer or winter sale, and get the game with all of the DLC for less than the price of the game alone when it's not on sale. That's all from me, so happy gaming!

review: Civilization V is the first game I played in the Civilization series, recommended by my friends. The game slowly robs you of your time, absorbing you into its' gameplay, until five hours have gone by and you've gone from trying to not be overrun by barbarians to blasting foreign cities with cannons while building the Lourve. Brave New World made the mid-game a lot more interesting and balanced, and it's fun finding which nations suit your play style (burying your problems in gold, researching faster than everyone else, converting everyone to your religion, etc.). In my first playthrough, I was a militaristic Japanese nation who nuked Washington D.C. for some meta humor. 10/10

review: This game is fun, I mean REALLY fun. You start as a insignificant civilization in 4000 B.C. and work your way up to a global super power in 2050 A.D.. Since I own the complete edition, the vast amount of civilizations (of which there are 43, more with mods. I play as the Americans most of the time) and the fact that one wrong move can lead to your downfall is very interesting. While the game is fun with all expansion packs and DLC, the game gets better with mods. You can download those in the workshop. The game will look EXTREMELY boring to a normal person, but try it. You'll be glad you did! Pros; -43 civs. Whole lotta' choices. -More wonders. Never will building the Eiffel Tower feel so good. -A social policy system better than Civ 4. Adopt social policies to enhance your empire and actually keep them. -Espionage is improved. Spy on your foes and see what they are planning within the click of a button!. -Loadsa mods. Over 4,000 of them. -They have America. -Did I mention they have America? Cons: None! Expect me or someone else to make a mod based on Sonic the Hedgehog's nation the United Federation.

Dont even get me started on the culture you can choose a social polecy on the second round and.....Ghandi has nukes GG.

review: The very first game I ever played of Sid Meier's Civilization V was with a few of my friends. We decided to all random our leaders. I got Alexander the Great. Being a fan of history I assumed that he would be a great leader for war and conquering. I managed to be an absolute power house. I took out the 3 ai civs we had and one of my friend's civ. The next and final target was the best player out of all of us. He was terrified and was desperate for a cultural victory. As I sended my forces to rain havoc he took advantage of his many cities, thanks to his leader's, who was Ghandhi, unique ability that allowed him to have plenty of happiness with many cities. He then switched all of them to science production and then stole the game from me that everyone convinced was mine. I didn't talk to him for a week. Later on in life we made another civ game, hoping to have as much "fun" as before. I selected Brazil, who bonuses from golden ages and is a cultural based civ. The same person who stole my victory as Ghandhi chose Askia, a warful civ who benefits from fighting. I was working on building the Chichen Itza, a wonder that would increase the length of my golden ages by 100%, a huge help to my culture victory. I had one turn left until the Chichen Itza would be complete, making me a powerful contender in this very competative game of civ. The turn ends and I am extact to show off the completion of my new Chichen Itza, however I was met with a very unpleasent suprise, the Chciehn Itza has been built in Askia. I insta enter a fit of rage nearly breaking my computer and then quite quickly rage quit the game. I didn't talk to him for 2 weeks. Teared a friendship apart 10/10

review: Sid Meier's Civilization V is a roundbased turn-based strategy, 4X ( = eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, and eXterminate) game. I'll review and recommend this game together with its expansions, as those DLCs add important things to the main gameplay, making this game so outstanding good. If you like games like Crusader Kings or the Total War series, you definitely should check this one out. (There are of course some minor to major differences) You pick a leader/country for a game and have to reach different goals for different victory conditions. My (formerly) most played game on steam, here's why: + addictive as hell + high replay factor + you get so much game for your money + every country/leader has different strengths + you'll be able to play against friends + lots of diplomacy and different victory conditions + it is so much fun to watch your empire grow + every game you start is quite different + with DLCs: there is now religion and even more ways to win a game + many different characters, with DLCs: even more different characters + Graphics are actually neat, can look quite nice but does also run on older pcs (I guess) About the music: Some parts of the soundtrack are very nice and beautiful, but after playing a long time they can get repetetive and annoying, so it's neither really bad nor good. Some small things do bother me: - I guess this is a matter of taste, but I think there are way to many achievements, like 280 of 'em. - the scenarios are quite boring - sometimes I feel like you should have more diplomacy options and sometims it's annoying how fast another nation dislikes you (but I guess this is somehow realistic =) - Battle is really simple, if you want a similar game with more focus on battle/war, try the Total War Series (e.g. Medieval or Rome 1) Overall, this game is giving you extremely many hours of gametime due to its addictive gameplay and I guess you'll easily get plus 100 -150 hours with this one.

review: Must-Buy Strategy Game This game, when it has all the DLC's is way too addicting, and is a blast to play through your own alternate history. It's way too easy to spent 8+ hours simply building up your own empire, and then several more in a devestating war for more land. Only buy this game if it is with all the DLC's, particularly Brave New World, because the DLC's add some great features that the base game missed. Just buy the complete edition really. Right now.

review: Civilization gets 'mainstreamed!' Less demanding in the micromanagement department but most of the changes make for more interesting gameplay. Culture and religion are now 'currencies' you can expend -- the former to unlock 'civic trees' and the latter to buy improvements. Both are essentially proxies for mini-perks that boost various resources. Espionage is now menu based and more efficient. City-states add a new dynamic to diplomacy and warfare. One unit per hex eliminates stacking and speeds up combat time. Overall: different, less tedious, but not necessarily worse. Only truly egregious thing was the shameless milking of DLC.

review: I played quite a bit in LAN so far in CoOp mod against AI's... it's alot of fun and quite addictive... and well, you tell yourself after lunch... "ok lets play half an hour!" then you look outside after "15 minutes" and its getting dark... well you get the picture... I guess I / we are gonna train a little more vs. the AI taking over the entire map and then do the same in online MP (yeeeeaaaa right) :P On a slight downside though... your view constantly jumps around to units needing orders or your allies battles. this can get very frustrating after a while since you can not do anything while the battle is going on either. There are ways to stop this from happening but often this causes the nice battle animations to not show at all. I have not looked at anything from the modders community, perhaps they got a solution... Anyhow... the game is an overall VERY awsome experience.

Genghis may seem like an  but if you look past his quest to conquer every city state, he's a pretty good friend.

review: I played Civ 2: Test of Time back in the day. It was fun to explore, the city building was interesting, trying out new units was always enjoable, and then of course, marching an army to an opponent was a blast. Fast forward 10 years to Civ 5. Exploration is always fun. Seeking ruins, meeting city states, fending off barbarians and eventually finding your opponents is great. The reasearch tree in this game makes it incredibly difficult to choose: Do I build up my military tech, increase my gold income, push for some good culture wonders, increase my science, grow my city... etc. and every play can be done differently. I have a favourite tech path due to familiarity, but if needed, I will take any road. The variety in strategy for early game exploration, mid game conquests and late game domination is incredibe. I bought this game on the suggestion of a friend and it was the best money I have spent on a game. Do I recommend Civ 5? YES! GET THE GAME! PLAY WITH YOUR FRIENDS! Once you get past the initial learning curve, you will find that the exploration, development, strategy, and eventual victory will be incredibly satisfying and very addictive. I cannot wait for Civilization: Beyond Earth

review: Oh my god, how do I start. This game has been a great....how do I say it......game! Everything about it, the figernail knawing battles, the amazingly annoying barbarians, the evil spies and their leaders and just ahhh, its such a fun game.I have spent quite a lot of my time fighting my brothers from room to room on this great strategy masterpiece. It puts all of the great game-loving ingrediants all into one big ball of mush, and makes it a great fiction journey, that deserves all of the love that it gets! 10/10 <3

review: It's a Sid Meier's game! And it's incredibily fun and nice to play. It's flaws is that the multiplayer session is sort off weird and sometimes you will definitely get disconnected, but other than that the game has been nice and awesome. And bloody hell wtf is there a lot of DLC? I love the expansion but the amount of dlc for this game is ludacrisly much, please do not release a game where you tries to milk your fan base by getting them to get the dlc content.

review: This game lets you choose how you want to progress as a civilization. Whether you choose to relay on scientific research to develop more efficient mechanisms or you want to build a huge powerful army to eliminate the competition. Civilization 5 seems like it'd be boring and a waste, but I found it engaging. The freedom of how you progress and solve problems is definately a plus. I like it.

review: > Start first game > Do a lot of  > Get uranium > Gandhi wants your uranium > You give Gandhi uranium > Gandhi nukes you TL;DR: Play as Gandhi, and everything will be good. (In case you're not playing as Gandhi, never trust Gandhi, and try to kill him as fast as possible. He acts like your friend, but he's the real backstabber.) Oh and also, Gandhi is a warmongering piece of .

review: I've been playing the Civilization games since the first one and I think this is a great addition to the series. Yes, there were some issues with the base game when it was first released, but these were fixed with patches and in the Gods and Kings expansion. I really liked the addition of city-states, the hex grid map, and the removal of the stack of doom. The combat's more fun and strategic on this one and the game as a whole is easier to get into. I recommend playing this with the Gods and Kings expansion for the best experience. Note: I haven't played the Brave New World expansion yet, but it seems to have improved the game even more.

review: This is my first official review on a game so please don't take it too serious. This will be a short review because the game is really good I really enjoyed the game. On my first game I finished in 3 days . The gameplay was interesting But the battles were dissapointing. I thought that the battles were going to be like in Rome Total War. The graphics are good ( dont care about the graphics at all) The music is really good . Enjoyed every minute of each song. The game is well made and loved how every country reacted when you do something. Overall its a really good game , its worth every cent .

review: At the time of writing this review, I have spent more than a whole day on this game. Yes, more than 24 hours! Civilization V is a game where you are a leader of an empire tasked to rule the world. Every turn, you can move your people, in the game they are called units, around, to build, fight and conquer (I think thats how it's spelt!). Other AI Civilizations are also spawned in, and your task is to beat them. There are different ways of winning the game, such as researching different things and spreading your religion (DLC). The modding on this game is brilliant. You get an achievement just for subscribing to an item in the Steam workshop, and another if you play that mod. You can download any type of mod, from a LOTR map (Really good!) to a completely new civilization! The game doesn't need the DLC to make the game good. The base game is magnificent. It really is. But I advise getting the DLC as well. The DLC to this game is amazing. The main DLCs, Gods and Kings and Brave New World, havwe a heavy price tag, so I would advise buying the complete edition, because it saves you ! Overall, I would rate this game 10/10!

review: Civilization V is, by far, my favorite game I have ever encountered. For starters, you can play from a large range of historical civilizations such as the Romans, Egyptians, Ottomans, Mongolians and Japanese; Each one of these civs are unique, since each gets a bonus to help in the game (Example - Persia has a longer golden age / Romans build buildings faster). The graphics are extremely good, considering this is game from 2010, a few glitches here and there with the tiles not showing up or FPS drop when scrolling through the world. What can you do? ... You can be militeristic, take over the world with an iron fist and create an empire. You can be a cultural nation, only having a few cities and being peaceful with fellow nations. The game is extremely fair, no nation has over powered bonuses to give them a boost during the game. A lot of strategy is needed if you wish to succeed in winning, you can't just create a large army and not expect any consequences. Civ's large selection of maps is also amazing. You can play on Earth, with America, Europe, Asia, Africa, and the Middle East, each having realistic minerals inside them (Middle East has oil, America has gold in the west), aswell as islands and Pangaea (Hope I'm spelling it right :C) Now, for the problems of the game, none of these should scare you away from buying this masterpiece, though. 1. Civs will randomly denounce you, even if you haven't attacked anyone. 2. Adding on to Civs doing random things, they sometimes will declare war on you for no reason (Somewhat rare, tough) 3. Lagging & FPS drop. Nothing to overly concern about, but the farther you get into the game, the laggier it gets with all of the cities and units. That's really all of the problems I've encountered, others might have seen more. I recommend this game to anyone who loves Strategy, turn based games. It's seriously one of the best strategy games out there today. Defiantly worth the money! 9.0/10 (Ignore possible grammar/spelling mistakes)

review: One of the best strategy games of all-time, without a doubt. The sandbox mode is unparallled in scope-- every playthrough is completely different. The AI gets really, really tough at higher difficulty settings (Emperor / Immortal / Deity), which keeps things challenging in singleplayer mode, to say the least. The Workshop has some amazing mods as well, which add to the experience considerably. This game guarantees a thought-provoking challenge to all. 10/10

review: Sid Meier's Civilization V is one of the greatest games I have played. With an almost infinite replayability value, this game can be played over and over again and get a different experience each time. Depending on how you set up the game you can play a quick hour or two game or a game that lasts days. If you are looking to sit back, relax and dominate, you can play on an easier setting. If you are looking for a very difficult challenge, you can play on the hardest difficulty mode. And the modding community for this is great and extensive, there are all sorts of cool and entertaining mods. I really enjoyed this game, and its DLC's.

review: I played Civ V for 4+ years before I got the expansion packs. I love the game as a whole, but unfortunately the expansion packs have taken away a lot of the fun that I had while playing Civ V. There is quite a lot more going on than there was in the original game, so much so that the it is almost too much to handle. I'm sure I'll get used to it in time, but, as of now, I would recommend either only buying the game and not the packs, or buy it all, but play without the packs until you get the hang of the game.

review: A very complex game that has a slight curving point for noobs. Though it takes a while to master it, it is still by all means my favorite game. The things I like about it: It has very fun scenarios such as the American Civil War, Scramble for Africa, and the Fall of Rome to name a few. There are a lot of countries to choose and master. It takes true strategy you can't just build a city and say you'll win (You probably won't with that overconfidence). A very good wide variety of maps too choose from. The multiplayer is amazing except for the fact that if you go to war with another human player you have to play in sequential order. The graphics are quite astonishing aswell. The things I dislike about it: There are no multiplayer Scenarios. :( Overall I give this game a 9.5/10 Please leave any critizism in the comments. Thanks! :D

review: What to say, what to say... This is quite possibly the most fun, replayable game I have ever played and the most downright satisfying victories ever. This game is filled with Civilizations. 43 to be exact with all DLC Installed so there is 4 Victory conditions, times that 43 and that equals to 172 wins if you like. Granted many Civs are designed for a set victory i.e. Babylon is mainly a science civ so that would lean to a Science victory and Venice - Diplomatic etc. The replayability is astounding and if you pick up it up in the steam sales it usually is 5. Ok, that is vanilla and isn't the best game infact it's horrible if you played IV so that's why I recommend the Gold edition : base game, 1 Expansion and a good few civs with it along with a map pack all for 7.49 in a sale thats fairly good for a game that can last 4000 hours probably. The gameplay is fun and exciting, it fills you with joy as a civ that as declared war on you and you have fought back to take their capital which in turn removes them from the game. The Multiplayer desires a few connectivity issues bugs to be fixed as I have seen. Also, the actual combat sucks because of the fact that you have one unit per tile and can feel like a bore moving troops across the map. However, with addition to Paratroopers in later game you can move troops quicker. The main gripe with this game is the multiplayer. I want Fraxis to fix this so bad. I have a example, Me and my friend were playing a game we hut a diplomatic standstill threatning war then the game decides 'this sucks lets start a new game' and it disconnects with no save. It's Frustrating as hell. Anyway you have to buy this game it is a fantastic game and thats's why iI recommened Civ 5

review: Because who doesn't like dominating the world? Seriously, though, the game has great AI (and even better if you randomize the behavioral patterns and make everyone unpredictable), an interesting progression of buildings, armies, and otherwise... and the animation is very nice. I don't mind the music either - they chose a well enough melody line for leaders to make it blend in the background rather than clash in your ears.

It provides you with over 30 civilizations to play as(DLC included). Each of them with a diverse yet interesting skill to go along with them. you could play as spain with a double bonus to all "exotic" tiles in the game. Or switch to carthage, giving you the ability to Cross mountains. Both long time strategists and newcomers will love this game. As well as its historical units will excited any history buffs out there. and any game you play in it will always challenge and amuse. if you have not already bought this game, you should right now.

I reccomend enabling the turn timer though even if your slow  noob mates whine about turns going too quick. You'll be glad you set it in the end (60 second turn speed civ FTW!). The brave new world expansion fixes a lot of the issues the original had and the tech tree is a lot more balanced, get it. You need this in your life, well at least untill December 2014 when Civilization: Beyond Earth is released.

Not only do you get to conquer the world in multiple ways and in different senses of the word, but the road to that victory is eternally customizable. Runs great, only a few graphic glitches and almost never has performance lag. The audio isn't bad at all, and the sountrack adds a rather great touch. Smooth gameplay allows for coordinated or improvised moves. The entities and environment both look amazing. Definetely something to consider buying for both strategy and non-strategy gamers.

review: Sid Meier's Civ V is a must have if you are a fan of Turn Based Strategies. Giving you the ability to play as 50+ civilizations from 6000+ years of history it allows you to build them up your way while playing against or with other nations. Civ V gives you the ability to create your own social policies, religions, chose the global path as a UN Leader on a diplomatic battle ground putting sanctions and Embargos on countries and city-states in your way. Build a masive army to back yourself with, with the assistance of Nuclear Blastic Missles and Giant Death Robots you can watch as the world around you burns! or create the perfect Eutopia if your heart so desires. Steam Work Shop with its thousands of choices makes this game worth it even more. 10/10

review: Great game Pro's: -Addactive -The Euphoria from a victory (and not founding a religion) -You can literally play as the Rasta God (Haile Selassie of Ethiopia) -Good interactive with the AI -Good voice acting (1000+ points for Haile Selassie) -Civ related units -Diverse range of options of Civ's to play as -Arab money as either Arabia or Morocco -The Greek City state advantage, to show those Malaka's who really invented Democracy -Found a relgion to pray to the based God! Cons: -Why the HELL did the Devs choose Queen Dido, instead of Hannibal or Hamilcar Barca, for the leader of Carthage? And who the  is Dido anyway? -No British Civ -No Kingdom of Israel Civ -Ghandi -Too adictive -No animated interface when speaking to the AI when playing with Other people -The inclusion of Civ's such as the Shohone and Polynesia, which are hardly even as relevent to history, as say Israel or Britain are Overall about a 9/11, so i would pick it up if i was you, and you don't own it as of now.

review: Civilization 5 is a worthy successor, and I've really enjoyed my time with it. The overall depth of the game is the main strength, and anyone that has interest in history and turn-based stragegy will find it engrossing. Really, the array of possiblities of eventual life is infinite, and this game allows that presecent to breathe. The major downside of this game is the marketing. It's the DLC concept that makes me mad. It's a great product, but they want you to spend like $100 dollars to get the full thing. I waited for sales, but still it's the same. Back to the game, it's good and fun and you will waste hours where you say in your mind, "Well, just one more turn." If you can find a good sale, get this game, otherwise I would wait before simply getting the base game. I can't think of it without the DLC.

review: Oh this game...I poured so many hours into it. Its nothing like attacking the enemy, sucessing and then repopulating their entire territory with your own population. watching their cities turn into your own. I LOVE THIS GAME! Negative sides are...The siege units are pretty useless in the early stages and the early units are...pretty useless, especially the special units which are shown up early in the game, because you can barely make enough of them that it matters any, because the progress in technology are faster then your cities.

review: If your looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if your looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place. Ingredients: 1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter 2. 1/2 cup white sugar 3. 1/2 cup brown sugar 4. 1/4 cup water 5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon 6. 1 pinch salt 7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced 8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie Directions: 1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). 2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside. 3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices. 4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal. 5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust. 6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.

review: This is a horrible game! You start playing and just can't stop. I played the original, many many years ago when it came on one 1.4MB floppy. It was already a good game then, where i wasted a lot of time on. I bought this when it came available on SteamOS and look and behold, the game is still as great as it ever was, still wasting my time like i have nothing better to do. Man, i hate this game for being so good and not letting me go. What's more, the game creators know this, when you complete a game and win, it leaves you an option of 'just one more turn' ... but it never is just one more turn is it? As with any addictive drug you think you can quit, but you can't. Buyers be warned!

review: If you don't own this game, then you need to own it. I could literally play this for hours a day and forget that I was even alive. You can play it with your friends, get your  kicked by Queen Elizabeth (she is a GIANT C U N ext T uesday) because she has every ing ship ever made ever, and likes to denounce me all the time because she is an ape, jokes on her when I nuke her  to Sid Meier's basement. Or, you could ignore my useless banter about England (sorry England, I like you in real life), and just buy the game. You can get the game and the DLC for $15 on Amazon, if you're lucky. You want to stop playing this, but "just one more turn." But when that next turn comes, then here comes a ing Barbarian ready to steal your units, or pulling a ship up to your coastal city like it's a ing drive-thru, so you are gonna pull a frigate out of that coastal city's  and send that Barbarian ship to the bottom of the sea where it BELONGS.

I haven't played this game as much as I have wanted, but it's only because every time I start a new game, I end up sitting on the PC for 8 or more hours straight, more or less. If you're willing to sacrifice your free time to a game, then go for it. It's a brilliant game.

review: A wonderful continuation of the Civilisation saga - as I had previously only played Civ II on my parents' ancient windows xp the complex animated graphics were a nice surprise, as was the hexagonal map pattern which I found allowed for battles to be a lot more strategic than the more constricting chequerboard pattern of Civ II. A very nice turn based game with sufficient 'blood and gore' opportunities for the budding Genghis Khan, while a more diplomatically-minded player can mind their own borders and so attempt a cultural or scientific victory. It has a variety of different win-strategies, meaning that one play through just isn't enough. An excellent game for anyone who likes turn based strategy games.

Oh yeah, and this game has a ton of steam DLC, each one adding in more gameplay mechanics, more civilizations, and more everything else. So if you feel like you'll enjoy it, you probobly will. And if it looks kinda dumb to you, it'll probobly seem pretty dumb when you play it. Or maybe you'll still enjoy it. Thats possible to.

She was mixed-ethnicity and looked a little bit like a woman that worked at the local Panda Express (lol @ all of you who think that angels are white. God doesn't descriminate against any groups. Read the bible.) "You shall be the pillar of a new civilization.", the angel said. Then she told me her name was Lucy. Lucy Furr. I didn't know what that meant at the time, but COINCIDENTALLY, 6 YEARS LATER, I see that this game is on sale for 75% off. So, I bought it. Now I'm just waiting for a heavenly message to come through this blessed WIndows 8 :)

review: This is an exceptionally great turn based strategy game. I haven't played many other games like this but it has encouraged me to. I actually hadn't played the other 4 games in the Civilization series and I found getting into the game a bit tricky but with the help of some mates and the wiki I managed to love the game. I ended up creating a relatively awesome empire only to be crushed by a backstabbing 'friend'. So if you're wondering wether to buy this game or not I would recommend you do and buy the DLC Brave New World, it adds so much and makes it so much better. Buy it, get into the game and start up with your friends.

review: Civilization is a fantastic series, and V finally adds something the series always needed: hexes. With Gods and Kings it has included many refinements that makes this game the most challenging and difficult of the incarnations of this game. Update: The Brave New World incarnation changes faith and culture once more. Cultural victories are still the most common kind in my games, since I tend to forgo warfare for technological advances. I miss the cultural conversion of enemy cities that was part of Civ IV, but that was a conceit that does not generally fit reality.

review: Very fun game where you can command one of many civilizations from around time. Go to war with Montezuma as George Washington with Genghis Khan at your side, or generate tourism for your civ. Fly into space, or be elected world leader. Infinite replay value. The expansion packs and civilization DLCs (Korea, Polynesia, Babylon, Denmark) add a lot to the game, and made my playthroughs a lot more fun. Brave New World, the second expansion, really fleshed out cultural victories. Mods add a lot of content to the game, including maps, civilizations, and scenarios. Anyways, this is a great game, and I personally cannot wait for Civilization: Beyond Earth next fall. 9.5/10

review: This is a game you may not play too often, but when you start a game, be prepared for the next 5-50 hours to be solely focussed on wiping Gandi off the face of the planet with nuclear weaponary. Your visions of being a peaceful civilisation are shattered by your own self greed for world domination, your small tribe of simple warriors have evolved into super death machines that march from London to Tokyo (perhaps because Japan settled too close to you and the city is only 2 turns walk away). DESTROY, CONQUER AND REBUILD! *ahem* A few downsides to this game is that you may never return to an old campign, each session generally feels like its time to begin anew. Also, no one watching over your shoulder will understand how fun/addictive this game is, You just need to play it to understand.

review: One of the best things about Civ5 is it's replayability. Advanced setup, randomly generated maps, and dozens of Civs that all act uniquely, this game never gets old. Even in the middle of a game, theres always the next thing to do, whether it's to reseach a new technology, make your cities happy, or nuke your opponents into a firey oblivion. I've spent entire days playing this game. I regret nothing.

review: This is the first game I tried in the Civilizations series, and it definately will not be the last. Having purchased the original and Gods & Kings DLC nearly a year ago, I will soon be purchasing the Brave New World expansion whenever I find the time. Even if you are new to Civilizations as a whole, this game is still easily adaptable and well worth your time. Civilization V is simple enough to learn in a quick game or two, however offers enough micro-manageable options in order to be completely customizable both pre-game and in-game. This game caters to any play style, and you can adjust nearly anything you want. From game speed, map size, and map type to what resource focus to put your capital on and where to build a city to benefit you the most, the game offers nearly endless amounts of customization and micro-management. I strongly suggest the purchase of the Gods & Kings expansion and/or the Brave New World expansion along with this game. They add much more features to make your Civ 5 experience as enjoyable as possible. Lastly, you do not require any special talent in reaction time, and you do not require "an eagle's eye" to play. All you need is strategy, a sense of fun, and time. Lots of time.

review: Alright here I will review not only Civilization V but also the DLC Brave New World. Let's get started. Civilization V is highly superior over its predecessor Civilization IV, it introduces new challenges like worrying about your Gold Per Turn and how much resources you have. I like the idea of social policies, and I do like how there aren't religions (yet), I found that to be a really annoying aspect of Civilization IV. The leaders in Civilization V have good yet not OP advantages, but that doesn't mean that some leaders are more of a jerk than others (Egypt I'm looking at you). Overall I highly recommend that you purchase Civilization V. Now before I talk about Brave New World, let's talk about something REALLY bothersome (for me at least). It's one thing when you make a DLC expensive and overpriced, but with Civ 5, they felt the need to make BOTH of the DLC expansions the same price as the game! Overall that's about $90, which is a ludacris pricetag for any video game. You hit the border when you make a game $60, but at least with that the DLCs don't cost another $60 they cost more like $10.00. Here, you can buy multiple games with $90, you can buy an AAA title game + DLC for that price, there are so many better options than buying DLC that has the same pricetag as the game. Many people will argue that the DLC is priced that way because it's "a whole new game". Well I call bullcrap with that, now, you can call me a smartass and whatever, but if it was a whole new game, then why does it look identical to the original, has all the same leaders from the original, all the same units, and a whole lot more. Face it, it's not a whole new game, it's just a GOD DAMN EXPANSION PACK. Anyway, onto Brave New World. It's a good DLC, the new Civilizations are great, and I like how the developers fixed some of the policies, like how Commerce is now entirely focused on gold instead of navy and gold. I also like the idealogies, and the new units aren't that bad either. However, this expansion isn't without its flaws. While it is kinda optional, they brought back religions, which are very distracting from the gameplay, seeing as how nearby civs are always trying to convert my cities, and I just want them to  off. They also introduced war mongering, which makes a domination victory unpleasnently harder. What this does is that now whenever you capture a city, you either recieve a minor or major war monger, which effects your reputation among the civs in game. When there's a civ bothering me and I take his capital, now everyone hates me for doing so. In general, it's a good DLC, however, don't be the idiot consumer who purchases it when it's not on sale.

review: Do you like losing time? Do you like missing entire weeks of your life? Do you like being so imersed in a game that you don't realize the sun setting and rising? Then this game is for you! There are a few small bugs here and there and it is not too difficiult to learn how to play. Just don't jump in on Prince and for Cage's sake DON'T LISTEN TO THE ADVISORS!!! Look up guides on the internet if you really need to. I suggest for you to wait until the Winter or Fall sale to get the game because it is a few years old and the new Civ game drops in October, however, it will most likely be riddled with bugs just as this was after it's release. When buying this game make sure you get all of the DLC so you can play the game correctly. If you try to play this game in Vanilla you will not only be playing a broken game and you will be missing out on the amazing content in Gods and Kings and Brave New World. I don't really need to give you a breakdown of gameplay, thats what the big game websites are for, I'm here to tell you to buy this game, say goodbye to your realatives and install a toilet in your bedroom, you're in for a long ride.

review: Side Meier's Civilization V NUNCA vai haver algo to pico... e de nicho. Quando se fala de games de estratgia de maneira gera os primeiros titulos que aparecem so Age of Empires, Age of Mythology as vezes at algum titulo da srie Total War. Muito mais dificil alguem falar Civilization. Por que? Por que civilization no  para qualquer um. Desculpem a sinceridade mas  preciso falar. E Civilization V veio para confirmar isso. Mais do que nunca os pontos fortes dos games antigos so reforados e cada vez mais o game toma a sua forma nica de um jogo de estratgia para quem AMA estratgia. O sistema por turnos, caracteristico da srie, encaixa perfeitamente nas novas formas de administrao. A inteligncia artificial  simplesmente genial criando tramoias e eventos que voc vai se lembrar por um bom tempo. O jogo em si j  perfeito, acrescente a ele depois( apesar do preo salgado) as expanses e voc vai entender por que Civilization  ENDEUSADO por quem gosta e CHACINADO por quem o odeia. 10/10 ____________________________________ Side Meier 's Civilization V NEVER will be something so epic ... and niche. When speaking of games of strategy so generates the first song that appear are Age of Empires, Age of Mythology sometimes even some title series Total War Far more difficult to talk someone Civilization. Why ? Because Civilization is not for everyone . Sorry but I need to speak honestly . And Civilization V came to confirm this. More than ever the strengths of the old games are increasingly strengthened and the game takes its unique shape a strategy game for those who LOVES strategy. The shift system , characteristic of the series , fits perfectly in the new forms of administration. Artificial intelligence is simply ingenious machinations and creating events that you will remember for a long time . The game itself is already perfect , add to it later ( despite the hefty price tag ) expansions and you 'll understand why Civilization is deified by those who love and slain by those who hate him . 10/10

If you are a big fan of strategy genre, you should definetely play this game, it's great. It's also turn-based. Don't rush into multiplayer, try some single player scenarios first to feel game pace and choices that you must do in order to conquer the world. Good luck!

review: This game is such a great game. In fact, I hate almost every RTS and this is the only one I actually like. It's not the hardest to know what to do, but also requires skill. Especially when playing on the harder difficulties. This game is more of a political game, being that you get to start up you Civilization with one city and continue to grow it until it's an entire country. Most problems with the game are solved within the Brave New World expansion. If you enjoy RTS's or would like to conquer other countries with giant death robots then this is a game for you.

Not like difficulty, but continuing the game because it gets a little boring in the later eras (I love future and modern warfare, so I don't know why I don't like to finish). Time- These games take forever, I was playing, and I was less than halfway through the game and it had already taken 300 turns, and over 5 hours. Selection- Your selection of units and civilizations is very limited in my mind. If it were me, I would have over 200 different civs, and as many unique units for every civ as possible, this is close to impossible, but that is just me. Overall: I love it and highly recommend it!

review: Addicting, time consuming, immersive. These are words you hear when you describe the Civ franchise and this is no different. While rough at launch, many updates, expansion packs and dlcs have made it a formidable game in the Civ franchise. It still excels at allowing you to create your own stories, and keep you playing "just one more turn!" I recomend buying the expansion packs as they add many new civs and mechanics that add much needed depth that vanilla is missing, the rest of the various dlcs are optional however. Buy this game, you won't regret it, but your to-do list might!

review: This game is everything perfect in gaming. I tend to be a massive critic when it comes to video games. Especially so to Strategy games as it is my favored genre and, therefore, I am extremely picky about which ones I enjoy. Now, one look at my Steam Library will probably tell you exactly what style of Strategy games I enjoy (RTS). Simply put, I have never really liked Turn Based combat in any form. I can appreciate things like X-Com, and get the appeal to Pokemon and Final Fantasy, but I really just don't like turn based combat in any form. This game, however, has altered my oppinion of Turn Based Strategy completely. I wish there was more to say, but there are just so few words to describe this game well enough. The soundtrack is excellent, the gameplay is truly addictive and has depth the size of the Marianna Trench. The level designs are randomized in most cases, meaning that you'll literally never replay the same campaign ever unless you play one of the presets. The AI can be randomized as well. Throw all this into one bowl, add in rpg-like elements to build an empire that's truly yours, a political and economic system that puts EVE online to shame, and a simple, sleek, beautiful, easy to understand UI that feels like butter on your eyesockets and you still won't be able to grasp the perfection of this game. For those of you blessed to live near an IN-N-Out burger, imagine you've just been told that you can now have free infinite IN-N-Out Burgers and fries for life. The feeling of your taste buds erupting at the thought of all that burgery goodness is the equivelant of playing this game for ten minutes. In summary: Stop reading and buy this game you filthy peasant.

Multiplayer gameplay is amazing, especially with expansion packs enabled, however, make sure you (and your partner/s) have a stable internet connection, as the game may have a tendancy to drop mid-way through.

review: If you're looking for a stratagy game, you came to the right place. Civ's easy-to-learn hard-to-master controls and mechanics make it one of my favorite stratagy games. I honestly did not expect to enjoy this game as much as I have. The AI is clever and unexpected, the gameplay is fun, especially in single player, and multiplayer is... mostly stable. The game does sometimes randomly disconnect you from games, however it's not too difficult to just reconnect. Also, in multiplayer turns can go on for quite a while, especially considering some players have more to do than others, so sometimes you end up sitting around doing nothing, however this is a problem with most/all turn based games. All problems aside, it's a great stratagy game.

Even for someone like myself who has never played another civilization game before, this game had me addicted about 10 minutes into it and I've played for several hours nonstop, only stopping for real-life necessities. You create your own world, own maps, own cultures, all from scrap and then try to see and make them rise to greatness. I cannot implore you enough to acquire this game. Note at 7/14/13: Some people on tf2op are selling it for 2 keys so dont miss this oppotunity to pick it up! You will NOT be disappointed if you love creative, strategic games of any kind. This is a top-notch 9/10 game or higher easily.

Different ways to win or lose, so position your forces and click next turn.

review: This game is fantastic! Wether you are playing with or against friends or just playing by yourself, it makes you have a sense of accomplishment through completing the smallest of tasks. This game also does not have a campaign, wich reallly makes the player concintrate on having fun instead of "beating" the game. Also when playing with friends, it does not create teams. You decide if you want to win the control of civilizations through war or diplomacy. The player decides who he wants to befriend or declare war with. I have a fealing that this will eventually ruin a few friendships.

review: I really love playing this game of the amount of strategy involved. Do build up your army or your towns? What do you research to put your civilization ahead of the others? Do you march into war or be a diplomat? Do you make allies or isolate yourself? Whatever you choose will determine if you win or loose the game. If you don't have a lot of time I would suggest playing against bots as you can pause the game. Multiplier games take a lot of time but are fun if you can afford the time. So go ahead and spend your money on this game!

At first the game seems to overroll you with it's complexity but once you get the hang of it you wouldn't want anything less! A game you will be still playing ten years from now!

review: For those of you who are thinking of buying this game, do so. Here's an play-by-play example of my most recent game I've played: Modded the  out the game. Play as GLaDOS. Mind my own business, focus on only science and barbarians, no exploring. Found the celts. The celts then settled in "the perfect spot". Immediately declare war. Take their 2 cities. Found the New Lunar Republic. Still making science. Make new city. Found Alexander the Great. Still making only science. Founded the religion of Cake-ism. Alexander's being a . Start preparing for war. Have troops on border about to ask Luna for help. Luna yells at me to move. Immediately declare war. Launch Blitzkrieg on Luna. Take her 4 cities. F*ck Yeah. Prepare for war with alexander. Overwhelm alexander with catapults vs. shortbows. Finish him off. Start finding other civs. They're ignorant to my murders. Focusing on science. "Unhappiness is doubled. In exchange, science is also doubled." Backstab london, attack siam. Make Cake-ism the world religion. At this point, I'm an era and a half ahead of everyone else. Backstab persia's last city. Siam is raising coups in my allies. Toke 12 cities. Siam now at peace with two cities. Immediately declare war on The Principality of Equestria. Because why the heck not. Resurect Genghis Khan, use superior naval fleet against Celestia. Because science. Take an entire continent except for two american Allied cities. Make peace with Celestia. Immediately back stab and conquer what's left of germany, america, and gengis khan. Drop nuclear missiles on Siam cities. Finish him off. Theodora has reached the renaissance era. Stockpile nukes. Use superior delegates to rule the world congress. Bomb the  out of remaining armies and let Giant Death Robots finish off the rest. 10/10 would let Theodora reach the renaissance era again.

With an active modding community and so much content for such a small price during steam sales, it's a great experience!

review: Civivilization 5 continues to improve upon this amazing franchise in small and wonderful ways. The addition of the policy trees is one of my favorite because it allows more control over the way your empire grows and gives your civ more personality than it could have in previous games. Diplomacy, combat and the tech trees have all seen improvements as well as a significant upgrade in graphics quality. The two large expansions for this game, Gods & Kings and Brave New World also add a huge amounts of complexity and depth to the game that was lacking in the former titles.

review: Have you ever played any turn-based strategy games? This is the best one since I became a gamer. From the idiom "Rome wasn't built in a day", It's not true after you play CIV5. Build Rome or other civilizations in 1 day (but I always spend 2 days in each games.), Conquer the world with nuke or "Gigantic Dead Robot" and Stealth bomber, Discover the ancient sites and collect artifacts, Meet the world greatest people such as L.Da Vin Ci, Sir Isaac Newton, Ludwig van Beethoven and many!!! Gather all wonders of the world and natural wonders in your cities. Don't miss this and you will shout the sentence - Give me back my time!!!! - out after playing this greatest turn-based strategy games ever!

review: This game will eat many, many hours of your time if you let it. It's easily one of the best turn based strategy games ever produced! I never played a Civilization game before, but this made me regret that. At first the hexagonal type of gameplay feels a bit strange, but quickly you understand that is a very good system. The game has many known world leaders (more if you buy the DLC's) you can play with, each with it's own perks. The graphics are very good, even when you close in on the units and building, the quality remains there. About the sound i can tell you that it's very realistic for a strategy game. I didn't like the soundtrack much, doesn't feel right in the game, but it could be just me. In my opinion it should have more cinematics, maybe when you were entering war, or signing a peace treaty for example. I just love the way the game goes... you can win by different ways (war, science, culture) choose your enemies and allies, get betrayed, the evolution of times and consequent technologies, the experience earned by units and many many features i haven't even found about. Just be careful if you're going to buy the game, you may turn anti social! 9.5/10

review: I bought this game because it was cheap, and I had heard some good things about the series. I expected to, you know, built some farm and then get bored watching my people do their thing, and then get raided by some much more adept nation. Instead, I liked it very much! It's a simple yet surprisingly elegant system, and with the expansions it gains much more depth. It's like the Mariana Trench of game-play choices. My first victory was a Domination victory, and it tasted like iron and blood. Then I tried a different tactic, and won the Science victory. I thought to myself: "Hey, why aren't you trying to win the game with every single tile your domain?" and why the hell not? You can do it. Sure, you win the game much sooner than that, but you can't win yourself before you've conquered it all. I started dreaming about the game. Endless nights of hexagonal shapes and researching how to wake up, always being just a turn away from it. In one nightmare I tried sending my navy to destroy my physical body, because it was only slowing me down. Really, who needs a body anyway? I soon realized my navy won't be enough, and started nuking myself. Just bombing the  out of me. I woke up screaming, realizing I needed to uninstall this game. But I couldn't. The game whispered into my ear secrets, eldtrich tales and rites. I tried the Deity difficulty setting, but found myself not worthy. After all, I've only had the game for a few days, I have next to no experience on RTS worship. So I'm graveling, my lord Civ 5. I'm on my knees. Let me spread the word. Let me! I! I!

review: This game is awesome. You can build your civilization from the ground up, going from flint axes, to chariot archers, all the way to nukes. But it's not all fun-and-nukes.

review: This game is very entertaining, and i recomend it to anyone. I dont like turn based games, but this game is so well done and so entertaining that i never even notice that i have to wait for turns. The npc's move so fast, its almost like you never stop being in control. There are so many unique strategies to follow and the outcome of any two games are never alike. This is a spectacular game, and if i were you, i would seriously consider getting it.

review: One of my favorite games ever. Civ V features such great variety that you can play for 600 hours (like I have) and it still feels fresh. The game is well rounded and each of the victory options is obtainable in an enjoyable fashion. Each Civ for the most part feels different, and most are tailored to a specific victory type. The AI is strong and on higher difficulties very capable of beating you, however its through boosts not skill.

review: Best by far strategy game ever created, and Best Civilization game. Civilization IV is nothing compared to Civilization V On average a game takes about 24 hours to complete on average time setting. There are 8 difficulty levels, 1: settler - 8: Diety WARNING: Diety is only for the most harcore gamers. Tons of achievments, around 280 in total. Steam trading cards are avaliable for this game. Got nuked by ghandi Even though it was made in 2010 dont let that discourage you from buying it. Quality game. Create friendships with other Civiliztions or go to war with them. Remember there are several ways to win. Domination Victory, Cultural Victory, Science Victory (Space Race) Domination Victory is the easiest way. Can you build a civilization that can stand the test of time? 10/10

review: One word: Awesome. Even though it is very fun, it can be quite daunting when you firs turn it on, I really reccomend playing the tutorials, or going on youtube and finding a good tutorial for begginers. Once you get the hang of it it becomes very addictive to build new cities or try to research your next weapon to 1 up your enemies. Also, to me it seems the game has plenty of replay value, while my play time compared to others is small, I still haven't gotten bored. Keep in mind this isn't fan bias, I haven't played a single Civilization game until now, better yet, a strategy game! Although there are some downfalls, the AI can be REALLY annoying to deal with. In example, you can have their entire capital surround with superior military units , (Tanks, artillery, etc) and they will say something along the lines of "are you ready to surrender yet?" even on the lower difficulties! Another thing is, a country you have good relations with will not want to declare war on someone even if the country you want to declare war on has captured one of their cities! Finally, I have experienced some annoying glitches. For instance, an enemy city would get stuck in and infinite attack loop when attacking one of my units, and eventually the game decided the way to end the glitch was to kill my units when clearly the could have survived the attack! Also, when I built the great wall, it simply dissapeared! Overall, the game is a great experience, if you like strategy games try this, and if you don't still, give it a try! (Quick tip! If you are on WIndows 8 don't select windows 8 & touchscreen mode when I launch the game, it caused constant crashes for me, instead chose direct x 10 & 11 mode!)

review: I don't really like turn based games, but this game is differnent and I love the way there are progression trees for both policies and tech, thus maximizing possibilites for each player in the game. The multiple victory conditions are also good as they variate how people play the game so it is not repetitive and not everyone has the same goals. There are plenty of Civilizations to choose from ranging from England to even civilizations like the Zulu. Unfortunatly I find multiplayer can be a bit poor because the games can last a long time and people like to quit, I find this makes it best to play with your friends as you can save game and continue with them later.

review: MAN, this game was one of the first games i got on steam, and i love it to bits. The best part about it is the historical inaccuracies of it, like discovering the nuke with the Maya and bringing about the actual "end of the world". When you get bored of playing the game conventionally, mods can completely change the feel of the game. For me however, i was playing the vanilla version of civ 5 for 100 hours+ (i have no life), so when i got gods and kings/brave new world, it was like a whole new game to explore! I am still enjoying the game to this day, and i most definately will buy the next Sid Meier's game on the line-up. 69/10 - Swaggy as  !! :P

review: Civ 5 is a game I recommend for many types of people. Strategy lovers, 'Risk'-type game lovers and history buffs alike should enjoy this game without even needing a review! If you're on the edge about getting this game, I encourage you to buy it. It's a very popular game for a very good reason. I do warn, however, that if you enjoy fast FPS-like action, this is not the game for you. The game is all about thinking, and requires remembering certain complicated procedures of the game. There are lots of menus, lots of buttons and options and numbers that measure seemingly nothing, which is a bit intimidating at first but I promise, it gets a hell of a lot easier when you get into the mindset of a leader. As a history buff, I love the game for it's accuracy. It's like a history teacher's dream on steroids. Don't let the potential education value discriminate from the fact that this game is mind-washingly, time-wastingly fun! Be ready to spend hours on this game, I lose many nights myself!

review: THE best strategy games/series... One of the best games. Will keep you entertained for hundreds of hours. Puts the best of military strategy together with things like cultural and technological strategy and adds diplomacy (a little lacking but game play makes up for it) to create one of, if not the, best games I have ever played. The internal improvements, such as wonders and buildings, and choosing how to shape your civilization towards a certain victory condition even adds to the strategy. Throw in the GOTY edition, along with G&K and BNW and you have a highly developed and emerged strategy game that will give you thousands of hours of entertainment. Each civilization gives you a completely different experience and there are hundreds upon hundreds of combinations you can try. The DLC may get a little pricey, and the AI has some issues, but it is still, by far, one of my favorite games.

review: Civilization 5 is like the digital equivalent of marijuana and sugar mixed together... You just have to pass one more turn, you say it will be your last. Only now it's 3 am in the morning and you're starting to bump your head on the keyboard as you try to fight the sleep.... just one more turn. But seriously, Civ 5 is one of the most fun games that I have had the pleasure to waste hours and hours on it. I would highly recommend it to EVERYONE, weather this is the first game they have ever played or if they are the most veteran of hardcore gamers. The only people that I would not recommend it to are those who can not expend any more than a few hours or just really don't like turn based strategy games for whatever reason. Otherwise it's simply one of those games that nearly everyone has at least tried or heard of, like Skyrim, Minecraft, or the CoD franchise. Now, if you have no idea what Civ 5 is actually about, then don't worry because I have got you covered here. Civilization 5 is a essentially a turn based 4X (explore, expand, exploit, and exterminate) game. You always play on a map of your choosing, which can be can have randomized or very customizable settings. Then you choose what civiliztion you want to play as, with each having special bonuses or attributes. Starting with just two units, a settler and a warrior, the player founds a city which will be their starting point and expands from there. You must reseach new technologies, expand your deplomacy, and build armies to defend yourself or attack other civilizations with. There are can be several ways to win a match (which can be also be customized), usually either through researching ahead of the other civilizations, uniting the civilizaions through deplomacy, or conquering other nations. Now don't get me wrong, Civ 5 isn't perfect and there are a few things here and there that will invoke some frustration. In particular, the AI (or other non-player civilizations) is very lacking. There is little to no tactices in how it wages war, unless you count clustering random units at you in random formations. It's deplomacy is extremely predictable and nearly not worth caring for: if they have more troops than you or you are so much as slightly ahead of them in research, they will inexplicably wage war with you... This happens ALL the time. Nearly no civilization is willing to find a diplomatic solution and they focus on bringing down other civilations before brinning up there own. Now don't get me wrong, the AI isn't broken, it is merely serviceable. So if you don't mind, then you won't get too frustrated. Other than this, there are only a very few minor complaints that aren't too big a deal. Sometimes you can get screwed if you don't precure a certain amount of specific resources like happiness, gold, or reseach. You might start somwhere that won't allow the player to really expand and the other civilizations could eventually snowball you... Or over time, the player could snowball the other civilizations easily if they get those resources (and then the game becomes too easy). But most of the time the game is fairly balanced and very much worth playing. Again, I would recommend this to almost anybody and everybody. Now if you don't mind, I need finish conquering France with my giant death robots.

review: "This game is the most stratigic game ever, i give it 10/10 the diplomacy, screens where you talk to other civilizations and you get to interact with theam is flawless and beautiful and dont get me started on the battles, The battles are a bit hard for starters you cant march to theam and win you need lots of troops to surround the city and shoot and bombard theam cause this game is like chess, almost you get to attack and move every 1 turn once u move all your armys, and farmers,. There are many factions to play but i recommen buying brave new world next after this for more factions where talking $60 dollors all togather. So i say if you love stratigic battles and bored games of non stop enjoyment then this game is 100% for you"

review: Don't like what some countries have done in the past? Wish some countries died off long ago? Civilization V allows you to play from one of over a dozen civilizations and leaders, ranging from the democratic Geroge Washington to the war hungry Genghis Kahn from as early as 5000 BC. Customize the game as you wish, setting options for random starts, map sizes, victory conditions. Play the game however you wish, whether you wish to rule with an iron fist and dominate all others, build the United Nations and bring everyone together in peaceful coexistance, or sit on the sidelines and either race for the most advanced technology or develop the culture of your civilization. Don't be discouraged from trying to do something, even a militaristic civilization can bring force peace, and a peaceful civilization can bring about destruction. *As a side recommendation: Several mods are avaliable to enhance gameplay, ranging from new civs. to new worlds, to a game editor so you feel like a god. Be warned however, many of the best or most popular mods require the expansion packs.

review: This is my favorite Civilization yet. It's beautiful, fluid, and still retains the "just one more turn" addictiveness the series is known for. The music is outstanding as well, with themes written for each country that shift and change as you progress through the game. The new tactical warfare really makes a difference too; gone are the stacks of doom from previous games. It's a meat and potatoes tactical addition that really sets this iteration apart from previous games IMO. It's a must-own for fans of the series or turn-based strategy in general.

review: This game ate up so much of my time it's not even funny. If you're looking for a strategic game to play solo or with friends get this. The civilizations are great and the technology unlocks are just awesome. The biggest feature that brings me back to this game is the fact that each time you start a new civilization you know the gameplay and the way you complete the game is going to be very different to the last game you played. Extremely recommended!

review: One word: Awesome. Even though it is very fun, it can be quite daunting when you firs turn it on, I really reccomend playing the tutorials, or going on youtube and finding a good tutorial for begginers. Once you get the hang of it it becomes very addictive to build new cities or try to research your next weapon to 1 up your enemies. Also, to me it seems the game has plenty of replay value, while my play time compared to others is small, I still haven't gotten bored. Keep in mind this isn't fan bias, I haven't played a single Civilization game until now, better yet, a strategy game! Although there are some downfalls, the AI can be REALLY annoying to deal with. In example, you can have their entire capital surround with superior military units , (Tanks, artillery, etc) and they will say something along the lines of "are you ready to surrender yet?" even on the lower difficulties! Another thing is, a country you have good relations with will not want to declare war on someone even if the country you want to declare war on has captured one of their cities! Finally, I have experienced some annoying glitches. For instance, an enemy city would get stuck in and infinite attack loop when attacking one of my units, and eventually the game decided the way to end the glitch was to kill my units when clearly the could have survived the attack! Also, when I built the great wall, it simply dissapeared! Overall, the game is a great experience, if you like strategy games try this, and if you don't still, give it a try! (Quick tip! If you are on WIndows 8 don't select windows 8 & touchscreen mode when I launch the game, it caused constant crashes for me, instead chose direct x 10 & 11 mode!)

It requires a good chunk of time to get the full experience, so if you plan on doing a playthrough in one sit down, expect o be up until the wee hours of the next morning. This games has taken everything about strategy games, thrown it together, and amplified it. I love the way the game is and i cant wait to see how it grows. If you like strategy or are interested in testing the waters of the stratedy genre, jump right into this game.

review: From the beginning, there were several things missing to make Civilization 4 the more superior game, with all of the added expansions and DLC, coming from someone who has wasted thousands of hours on the Civilization series...I much prefer Civilization 5 to the others now. This is the closest it's going to get to managing an empire, forging a large group of people the way you want and almost everything about them. There is a large learning curve but I assure you, if you get past the initial bump you will amass countless and countless amount of hours as I have in to this beautiful game. I reccomend this to any one even remotely interested in strategy games, or games of the slower nature. I do not recomend this to anyone who is impatient by nature.

review: Civ V was my first turn-based strategy game, and my first Civilization series game, and on both counts, I couldn't be happier. The strategy is compelling and detailed, with many options and playstyles available. The variety of bonuses and unique units available to each civilization allows for a great deal of replay value, and randomized elements in the maps and AIs contribute to a fresh start with every game. There are some downsides, however. Although one of the biggest draws to Civ V is the complex and highly variable strategy options, the AI programming leaves much to be desired, as an AI simply cannot account for the many different levels of strategy needed to achieve victory. As such, the difficulty settings feel somewhat lackluster, as they simply give the AI greater and greater early advantages, leading to a very different gameplay at high levels compared to a truly "even playing field". Combat, like with many games, is clunky and time-consuming, and although there are elements of strategy and maneuvering, it can be boiled down into essentially a numbers game of tech and manpower, rather than true strategic prowess. Multiplayer is also less than ideal, particularly in a mixed human/AI environment, as AI features are severely nerfed or nonexistent. In terms of fluff, I find the pseudo-historical theme to be a huge benefit, as I'm just enough of a history/linguistics/geography nerd to find it interesting, but not condescending or painfully inaccurate. (The "alternate history" line allows for a lot of freedom, when of course the game will not reflect a real-life history.) Ultimately, though, I've sunk many, many hours into this game and I can see myself continuing to play well into the future. Especially considering the price is quite reasonable for comparable game quality and style, I would recommend this game to anyone who likes strategy, history, or just having a good time. I particularly recommend it as a solo game - for those of us who don't care for online multiplayer, Civ V is by far the most rewarding single-player Steam title I've come across.

review: Civilization 5 is a game you can play over and over again. There are so many unique scenarios, challenges, and aspects to the game that every play through forces you to encounter something new. I love the complexity of this game, the depth of it's balance (even if the AI is quircky), and the suspense that multiplayer offers.

review: Do you have spare time? Well, if you want to keep it that way, you should NOT buy this game. The turn based nature alone makes you play it for "just a few turns" and you will keep telling yourself that. Before you know it you have been playing for a week straight and the putrid smell in your house turns out to be your dog that has died of starvation and your children have run to CPS and you are getting arrested. Thanks Civ V! 10/10 Must buy.

review: Yes people, this is absolutely the best turn-based strategy game to find, it is super detailed within every unit of every civilization itself, all the buildings and everything what comes with it,. Somehow like a boardgame, but also very different. Civilization V ( best played with Gods & Kings and the Brave New World DLC ) is just the best strategy turn-based game on the market and it's worth your money for sure! You start out with a settler ( to create a capital city ) and a warrior, and it's up to you how you are going to expand your empire and how you are going to victory on the map. You can play with really alot of civilizations, from Europe to America to Asia. It's so cultural and big it contains houndreds of hours of gameplay without getting bored ( atleast, if you are into long turn-based matches ) The game itself costs 30EU, the Gold upgrade costs 10EU and the newest DLC: Brave New World ( requires the main game to be installed ) costs currently 30EU. But don't worry, it's worth your money for real.

review: Caution should be taken, Civilization V has an appetite for your time! For me, it took many attempts to understand some aspects of gameplay. As you begin to correct your strategies it becomes rewarding rather than tedious. I recommend this game because adding new DLC and the constant addition of Steam Workshop mods saves Civilization V from becoming stale.

review: Civilization is a fantastic series, and V finally adds something the series always needed: hexes. With Gods and Kings it has included many refinements that makes this game the most challenging and difficult of the incarnations of this game. Update: The Brave New World incarnation changes faith and culture once more. Cultural victories are still the most common kind in my games, since I tend to forgo warfare for technological advances. I miss the cultural conversion of enemy cities that was part of Civ IV, but that was a conceit that does not generally fit reality.

review: Very good. I think the decision to tone it down from IV was well-minded, but I think they over-simplified it. It felt kind of scummy to have to get GK and BNW to get features that would be a one stop shop in IV. Graphics are good. I like the Civilopedia and the historical accuracy. I reccomend getting BNW instead of GK, because BNW adds the equivalent of 2 expansion packs for the price of one. Unless you really want the Maya or the Celts. Still good game. Like the scenarios and pitboss. Don't think that games with expansion packs you don't have should be shown. It saves a lot of time. BUT IF YOU LIKE CHANGING HISTORY AND DOING TROLLS TO AI THAT DON'T KNOW THAT YOU'RE TROLLING THEM, GET THIS GAME.

review: Civ V is my favorite Civ so far (maybe not counting Civ II, but at this point, my recollections are mostly nostalgia). I may have put more hours into Civ IV, but that was because of Fall From Heaven, an excellent mod. Civ V introduced so many wondeful changes including hex based maps, 1 unit per hex to stop idiotic unit stacking (though I think they should have let civilian units stack on each other), and a revamped system for defining your civilization through policies. The Gods and Kings added more of everything, which is what I wanted it to do.

review: I was deep in prayer when an angel entered my mind space. She was mixed-ethnicity and looked a little bit like a woman that worked at the local Panda Express (lol @ all of you who think that angels are white. God doesn't descriminate against any groups. Read the bible.) "You shall be the pillar of a new civilization.", the angel said. Then she told me her name was Lucy. Lucy Furr. I didn't know what that meant at the time, but COINCIDENTALLY, 6 YEARS LATER, I see that this game is on sale for 75% off. So, I bought it. Now I'm just waiting for a heavenly message to come through this blessed WIndows 8 :)

review: This is an exceptionally great turn based strategy game. I haven't played many other games like this but it has encouraged me to. I actually hadn't played the other 4 games in the Civilization series and I found getting into the game a bit tricky but with the help of some mates and the wiki I managed to love the game. I ended up creating a relatively awesome empire only to be crushed by a backstabbing 'friend'. So if you're wondering wether to buy this game or not I would recommend you do and buy the DLC Brave New World, it adds so much and makes it so much better. Buy it, get into the game and start up with your friends.

I like the depth and customizability of this game, and the Workshop support is a godsend. Really fun game to play with friends, I can't imagine the online being that much fun, but let's be honest, people only ever play this with their friends. I love this game and I love how complex and strategic the battles are. The only tedius thing about the game is tending to all of your 150 units every single turn... aside from that, the game is practically flawless. I HIGHLY recommend this game! 10/10

Worth every dime, and so are the expansions. Well done game, solid running too, this is not a buggy attempt but a well thought out design by some very talented devs and a mastermind of the genre behind it, Sid Meier.

review: This game is a must-buy for fans of the Civilization franchise, and I highly recommend picking it up if you even think you might be interested in this kind of strategy game. I've only played the Gold edition, which comes with the base game plus the Gods + Kings expansion. At the very least, I suggest getting this expansion; after playing this game with religion, I can't go back. I don't have the other expansion (Brave New World), so I can't comment on it. Vererans will know how the game works; you can choose how you want to play and how you want to win. The interface is very well laid out, the music is perfect, and the graphics look great. The opponent AI can sometimes be a little aggressive and will refuse to make trades that are clearly in their favor, but other than that the gameplay is fantastic. Overall, I believe that Civilization V is worth every cent of your purchase!

The a.i. will hate you but who gives a , not this guy. So after your done with you little nuclear holocaust, why not start another game. This time you can win a diplomatic victory which will never work out, or you could win as a cultural victory which is boring as , same as the time victory.

review: Civilization V is based around international diplomacy. It is a turn-based strategy game that allows you to make alliances or enemies; peace or war. You can play as various empires, from England to Rome, America to Egypt. Each nation has a couple special things, such as a special building and a special unit. You can expand your empire by building cities and buying "tiles". You can go to war with nations to capture their territory, or you can be neutral and never go to war. You can start the game just after the invention of agriculture, and from there you research new technologies, starting with things like "animal husbandry" and ending with things like "nanotechnology". Each technology unlocks new things to build and use; for example, researching "mining" allows you to build mines, while researching "industrialization" allows you to build factories. There are various difficulties to choose from, so no matter your skill level, you should enjoy the game. The win conditions are various "victory types"; for example, you can take over everyone else through military and win a domination victory, or you can launch a rocket to Alpha Centauri, winning through a science victory. There are other ways to win as well. Building "wonders", major buildings from history that each give unique bonuses and advantages, allows you to dominate the score board. There are many wonders that could be built, such as the Great Library, Stonehenge, the Great Wall, the Statue of Liberty, and the Hubble Space Telescope. There are two major expansion packs that you can buy, Gods & Kings (allows you to found your own religion and spread it around the world, among other things) and Brave New World (allows you to build trade routes and get involved in international diplomacy through the World Congress/United Nations). Other more minor DLC are available as well, such as Polynesia and Korea. Civilization V also has mod support, and mods are quite easy to make using the included Civilization V SDK tool. Using this, you can make new civilizations, buildings, technologies; the possibilities are almost endless. You can also download other people's mods through the Steam Workshop. My rating of it: 10/10 + Enourmous fun, with a bit of history education hidden throughout. + Permits endless mods and mod possibilities. + Unbelievable amount of replay value. - Can be hard on the computer in the later parts of the game.

review: I've been playing Civilization games for many years and still have the original boxes too! I was very skeptical about moving from Civ VI to Civ V given the bad reviews out there at the time of purchase. After 3/4 years and all the expansions, i've found it to be a great addition. The AI still needs improvements and the multiplayer is horrendous but the game itself is super. I highly recommend the game and if you were to play it with other humans, then i'd say choose friends and via LAN!

review: Even if you don't have a life, Civilization V will take it away from you. Countless hours will be spent defending your empire, building it up, and dealing with the bi-polar leaders you are up against. Ridiculously fun. Buy it, but be warned: it will suck you in.
game-hours: 165.4
review: With hindsight I can tell you that even at full price, the full Civ V package (including DLC's) is well worth the price. This is one of the most complex, interesting and engaging games that I've ever played. You have a massive list of Civ's to play from, which all have unique playstyles suited to them so you can play an infinite amount of games (each of which can easily last 10 hours) with AI controlled opponents, or your friends online. Not only do the variety of Civ's make the game so deep but also the map choices that you're given. You can choose your favourite map type (of which there are Continents, Islands and Pangea to name a few) which are all randomly generated, or pick the random map type for a surprise. If you somehow get bored of that there are also a number of scenarios that you can play in, as well as the ability to crank up the difficulty to insane levels, or piss easy ones if you just enjoy stomping on everyone. I can guarantee that if you think that you'll enjoy this game that you will, I thought about it for a year and finally got it in the winter sale and can only sing it praises. But if you're REALLY unsure about whether you want it and you don't want to drop the money on it, then there is a demo available to get you hooked so I recommend trying that out before buying the game. I highly recommend this game at a 9/10, it will absolutely ruin your life. I should currently be doing work but Just... One... More... Turn...

review: This game is amazing! You may have seen Sid meier's Civization beyond earth. I still recommend this game rather than that because there as been more work on it than the new one. If you buy this game you will want to buy all of the exspansions for it. The exspansions exspand the game so much, the base game is not near as fun as all of the exspansions combined. I really would reccomend this game. I play with my uncle all of the time and we kill each otheror work together, and not even talking about all of the fun of smack talk! This game is amazing to play and even better playing with freinds and family. If you buy this game make sure to get someone you know to play with you. Also make sure to practice so much that you crush whoever you play with in an istant, this game lets you achive complete and utter power. Buy this game.

review: Amazing Grand Strategy game with massive replayability. Every match plays out differently,and there is no ultimate strategy that works every time. Your strategies will develop over the course of the (long) matches,depending on many different factors,including the behaviour and expansion of the other Civilizations and the traits of both yours and the other Civs, the resources you have available to you, the layout of the world, the advancements in Science... Everything that happens in a match will make you think, reconsider and plan. One very important thing to note is the AI. Without the first expansion, Gods and Kings, the AI is lackluster and often reacts in odd or illogical ways. Both the Dlcs also add a lot of further tactical depth to the game,so if you plan on buying the game,I would definetely recommend that you grab at least Gods and Kings too. The Civilization and Scenario Dlcs can be skipped, but Gods and Kings is almost a requirement as it "fixes"/improves the AI significantly and also adds several new elements into the game. A brave new world adds even more tactical depth and decisionmaking that will shape how the rest of a match plays out, and improves trading,economy,the culture system/victory and diplomacy,and also changes the way a lot of the basic Civilizations work.

review: For a game that I would think was going to be sorta boring I was wrong. This game provides the fun that I enjoy greatly. I will also add when you start playing this game, you'll lose track of time for real. Although the game mechanics could get better because the same thing happens everytime where you research a thing and then build this and that but its enjoyable. For this game a 8 out of 10 is deserved. Guess I'll start rating games now that I've said that.

review: There are two types of people in this world - those who dislike Civ and those who buy the game and lose the next 16 hours of their life clicking on the 'next turn' button. As a 4x game Civ does it all: Economics, diplomacy, strategy, empire macro-management, city micro-management, religious disputes, etc. And it does all of it in an immersive, attractive environment that progresses with the state of your civilization. The only real cons are that public multiplayer games take forever without a good method for pausing/saving/resuming but this can be remedied by joining a Civ steam group or just playing with friends. At the very least, give the Brave New World Demo a try and find out how expendable your sleep is.

review: This game has taken a lot of my time; probably not even close to as much as other people who play this. It is a very accessable game but also can be complexed.

review: A few years back, I seem to remember seeing one of the older Civilization games at Target. I picked it up, took it home, played for a couple hours and then hated it. Apparently that version of me was an idiot. I don't know what it was last summer, a couple months before Brave New World came out. But I saw this game and for some reason decided to get the demo. I played the demo. And then I played it again. And again. It was around the sixth time that I realized I should probably buy the game. Fast forward a year later and this is still one of my favorite Steam purchases. I don't know what to say that hasn't already been said about the game. If you're into strategy games then this is quite the blast. There's a lot of fun even in simply experiementing with each civilization's perks against AI and other players. Admittedly, the multiplayer seems to propped up on fragile legs (at least in my experience), but we're usually determined enough to plod through these issues for any given game. The Workshop community is fantastic. There's a lot of cool stuff out there that changes quite the variety of different aspects, from simple UI adjustments or infomration access changes to entirely new game modes. The work that goes into these is really impressive. If you're up in the air, download the demo and give it a go. But this game gets my stamp of approval.

review: A lot of my friends, myself included, played previous installations of Civ and fell in love. Civ 5 is the latest installation and, while having a rough start, has slowly progressed into a fun game. I will admit, the change in style was very difficult to get over. I played many hours of Civ 4 and when I started Civ 5 it was a mixed bag. I was so happy at the updated graphics. The game looks gorgeous but it came at the cost of some reworking in the play style. After getting used to the play style, it doesn't mean as much, but it is something to consider for prospective buyers. That also being said, another thing to consider is the hardware aspect. This game is a memory hog and for some reason, really hits hard on non-SSD hard drives. I had to put in extra 120mm fans on my case to keep the heat down. The longer you play a game, the slower the game runs. If you have a high end gaming system, you'll be fine. Otherwise, be prepared to start your game in mid-low settings in graphics in order to accommodate for late game slowness.

I would encourage buying all the DLC while you're at it, but having additional maps and civilizations to play with isn't that much of a game changer.

review: On it's own, Sid Meier's Civilization V is hard to recommend. It's missing quite a lot of really nice features and the AI works poorly. However, with the Brave New World expansion, or even with Gods and Kings (both of which can be acquired in the Complete Edition), I whole-heartedly recommend this game to anyone who is even slightly interested in turn-based 4X games. Gameplay: Civilization V is a very easy game to learn. It doesn't have complex mechanics that are difficult to understand, nor does it have detailed diplomacy with hundreds of possible options. It is incredibly easy to get into. However, don't be fooled into thinking that the game has no depth. There are a many strategies that can be used to achieve the various victories. For example, you may be trying to get your technology further ahead of everyone else, either to peacefully achieve the science victory, or to crush your enemies with a more advanced military. There are still many other options available, such are culture, which gives you buffs in areas of your choice, religion, which you can spread to enemy cities to recieve bonuses, NPC city states with quests that you can befriend, ally with or destroy, getting high amounts of gold and buying the favour of other players. And that's not all. Every single civilization has a different passive bonus as well as 2 special units or buildings. This allows for more varied play styles aswell as more specialised games. Japan, for example, has a special bonus which make it's units fight as though they were at full strength even when hurt. This means that they excel in combat. A player playing Japan may wish to go down the route of conqueror. However they also acquire culture from fishing boats. This means that players will actively search for good spots near the coast to settle cities where as with a different civilization they may have prefered to stay inland. This provides plenty of replayability. With a total of 43 civilizations, there is more than enough choice for you to find your prefered playstyle. Graphics: The graphics of Sid Meier's Civilization V will not blow you away. That said, it still looks good and there is a lot of detail put in. Special buildings and wonders that you construct are actually visible in your cities (though not always well placed, eg. the pyramids being half submerged in sea water). The animation and combat looks nice, however for multiplayer I recommend turning the animations off as it both wastes time and can sometimes cause lag if your internet speed isn't great. Performance: With graphics on low, this game will run on most computers, even really old, barely functioning laptops. Again, if your PC is less than stellar I recommend turning off combat and movement animations as they are not important and not having them doesn't take away from the overall experience, Multiplayer is where this game both shines and suffers. It's quite difficult to get a multiplayer game with many players working properly without lag. However, if you are able to get it working, you're going to have a great time. EDIT: A patch has fixed most multiplayer issues. While I have not tested with more than 4 people, I can confirm that the game runs smoother with 4 people after the patch with 2 people before. Mods: This game has plenty of mods available. Mods that add new civilizations, new resources, new units, visual overhauls, new maps etc. However, while some of them mods may be great, they can only be played in single player. There is no option to use mods in multiplayer. Overall, Sid Meier's Civilization V is a fantastic game. Once you start playing you will not want to stop. Even when it's time to save and quit, there will only be one thing on your mind: Just... One... More... Turn.

review: I mean, it's Civilization. If you've played one before, you know the general gist of things. I will say that I enjoy the move to hextiles over the squares previously seen, and I actually like some of the more controversial changes, such as not being able to stack an infinite number of units into a single tile. Since I tend to play more for non-militaristic victories, the changes in Civ V have, for the most part, not been things I have issues with. If you're into conquest as your main mode of play, maybe not for you. But if you mostly play a balanced game or go for a non-violent path, then I think you'll enjoy the upgrade. Make sure you pick it up with the two expansion packs, as it adds an enjoyable depth with trade, religion and culture without adding too much complexity.

review: Civilization continues to deliver one of the primier strategy game experiences. There is little negative to say about the fifth installment of the civilization series, which prides itself on its immense amount of features and challenging gameplay. It's game mechanics are incredibly in depth, balanced, and well researched. The game is only made better by its fantastic, and well worth the cost, dlc which adds new scenarios, world leaders, and features such as religion. The experience is even better when playing with friends and foes in a multiplayer match. The only cons to this game may be the learning curve, as there is definitely a lot to take in. Another gripe with the game is the amount of time it consumes. An average game may last more than 10 hours, and with the amount of different civilizations, scenarios, and features to play and master this may seem a bit daunting. Friends that are familiar and play this game call it a "One way time machine." This meaning you sit down and start, and then snap back to reality 8 hours later without much sense of the amount of time that flew by. Would I recommend it? Yes. A thousand times yes. It my personal favorite strategy game of all time, and is well worth the cost. 10 / 10. Note: If you aren't enthused with it as a single player match I would highly recommend getting some friends together and trying it as fast paced as possible playing against eachother.

review: Ah Sid Meier's! We've had so much together, in peace, in 'understanding' from Alpha Centruri/Alien Crossfire and more apon hours and hours of gameplay I can't possibily know how many but this review is for the 5th installtion of Sid Meier's Civilization, as you should know. Personally I have problems with this game from multiplayer and single player campaign. I have many things I enjoy in this game but at the same time it gives me emotions that I can't describe, its not a good feeling or a bad one. Its the small things that naw at me. Like the choice of 'Civilizations' which aren't really interesting, others may argue that this game is perfect. It is in somethings because they have had time to tweek it from SM's Civ 1 (and all other SM's games between back then and now), but this is not diffinate world-embodyment of human culture. I mean sure, if you are looking at this review and your thinking, "Should I buy this game and will I have fun with it as a gamer?" You might or might not be disappointed depending on what you think a fun game is. Is it nuking a civilization that will randomly make war with you because your close to their border by their country? Or will they spy on you because your a ally to them and have been friends with them from the beginning of the game? I think not. I will say this though, if you are one that likes to use your mind in games you will love this game. Not for civilizations mostly but for the way how it all plays out. If you lose or win but if you have poured a good 20+ hours in one game that isn't that awesome, if you lose. But my final scores are: Gameplay: 4/5 From Civilizations to choose from: 2/5 AI's  meter/AI's BSM: 5/5 (Based on highest diffcultly) Playabillity: Average Steam Community active? Yes, very. Altogether I give this game a 7/10 because I do enjoy this game just please to god make this game more realitic among cultures of the world. {Recommended}

review: Really enjoy the game. Since you can no longer stack military units as in past Civ games you have to really think on strategy with positioning units. I've spent nearly 500 hours on the game and with what's available with the scenarios and DLC I see myself enjoying this game for many more hours to come.

review: I'm pretty sure this is my most played game on Steam, with, as of right now, roughly 177 hours or so of gametime. That tells you something right there, as that's a lot of time to put into playing a game. In truth, this is one of my favorite strategy games, and one I have played for years now, since I first bought it on my birthday a few years ago. The fun of building a civilization and dominating all of my opponents keeps me coming back again and again. With the addition of the Steam Workshop a while back, the game got even better, and now I only play with mods. 9/10

review: Mechanicly solid - Simplified/Streamlined gameplay - One More Turn Every playthough is its own adventure - granted your willing to set your own goals. Civ has always been about more than just a videogame recreation of history; its always left the player with a sense of achievement; more-so then just the players own, but rather, the grandeur of what our race has managed in such a short time. Its the sense of optimism and hope that stems from those achievements that is so special and makes any version of Civ worth at least a try.

On top of the already solid vanilla experience, the steam workshop truly makes this game shine brighter than it's predecessors. Don't buy this if you have no time on your hands, because you'll be itching to spend a whole weekend on it!

review: Well to start, Civ is an amazing game even if you don't have friends to play with! The AI isn't a pushover and can be quite challenging based on your difficulty level. But playing with friends is where all the fun is at! You can build up your own empires and then take down your own friends in so many different, and strategic ways! I should warn you, the game requires a LOT of time, as each game runs for a few hours or more. Also, it is very complicated at first so don't get overwhelmed! And finally, this is a very strategic game! IT requires a lot of straetgies to take down opponents and win. But other than that, HAVE FUN!

review: If you come from previous Civilization games you won't get dissapointed by CIV5. It might not beat CIV4, but it sure is a step beyond in the franchise worth playing and play one turn more. PD: DLC's are a scam, not because they don't add good content, but the price/content ratio is a joke.

review: This has got to be one the most immersive games I've played. I've spent another 100+ hours outside of Steam, playing Civ 5, trying out a lot of civilisations and such, but I still come back for more. Civ 5, like it's predecessors (Civ's 1 through 4), is a turn-based strategy game where anything can happen. You can create and customise each and every town, from any of the available civilisations. With a variety of maps and playing fields, you will never have the same area twice, or the same set of enemies/allies/idiots you want to nuke, unless you set them of course. The 5 winning types bring a whole new look into how each civ has worked in the past, such as Spain, with Queen Isabella, who is great with Natural Wonders, or Japan, who likes to reck military with the religious view of Bushido. Then there's Gandhi, nobody likes Gandhi. Seriously, get out of my games. 10/10 would bang again.

Civilization V is extremely addicting and it will leave you staring at your screen for hours while you try to convince yourself that you'll only play for "one more turn." Seriously, get this game.

review: As a huge fan of games like Age of Empires, I figured that Civ V wouldn't be much different. I hadn't played any of the other Civ games when I jumped into Civ V, and boy did I love it. The game play is lots of fun and there is good level of strategy involved, though the difficulty is easy to control when starting the game. There are so many options and variety that it's almost impossibly for me to get bored. Most fun is the ability to play with friends. Nothing says friendship like attacking with the full force of your military! :D

review: Tremendous game, especially with the expansions. I've been a Civ fan since the original. I was initially a Civ V skeptic due to what I'd heard about the new combat model. After spending several games with it, I have to admit it's a real improvement. Armies matter more because they are relatively rare compared to past Civ games--they're resources you need to steward carefully, as they are expensive to build and you can't stack them. The core Civ mechanics are intact. Graphics and sound are superb. Absolutely a worthy iteration to the series that should make long-time fans happy. If you're new to the series, this is a great jumping-on point. The controls are explained as you go and not hard to learn. Each turn, you're told what's available for you to do or worry about, so you don't miss any critical cues. Even so, the game provides a substantial challenge with different difficulty levels and a good online experience.

review: Civilization 5 is an amazing strategy game with no equal. The game can be played at a leisurely pace and comfortable difficulty all the way up to a mind melting marathon pace and the extremely challenging deity difficulty. Not only are the single player games fun, challenging, and well crafted, but the online multiplayer adds a new dimension to the game with added challenges and excitement. Lastly the scenarios allow you to reenact some of historys greatest moments. 10/10.

review: Wanted to see how France would do... In the middle of Africa?! Want to reach space? Want to create a cultural influence which makes other civilizations culture look insignificant? Or maybe your faith in the powers that be will lead you to glory? Want to do all of this and more? Go ahead, these things aren't only the greatest parts of Civilization 5, as you lead your small minute civilization to greatness. Or failure, if you are destroyed by the strongest who can stand the test of time. But never mind that, can you? The main strength of this game is the wide amount of flexibility allowed for every leader, but still keeping their image and real life legacies intact. So what if the Russia didn't actually go down the "Freedom" path, or America didn't choose "Piety" over "Rationalism?" It all adds to the way the game is smooth and easy going, whilst making sure none of the leaders are changed in any way to their real life counterparts. Overall, this game is a strong interpretation of the real world. Many games, such as the Democracy franchise, simulate the political aspects of *Modern Life*, but no game can better Civilzation V on its simulation of the development of mankind.

It is the video game equivalent of heroin: it will suck away hours of your life at a time, leaving you in a stupor afterwards, thinking only about when you can boot it up next and finally knock off that a-hole Suleiman for good.

review: A very simplistic/deep strategy game. It's interface is extremely easy to use, but it offers enough choice to keep things interesting. It is also very well polished. All the game's leaders have their own "cutscene" whenever you talk to them in the the game, and they're well animated and bursting with personality. Everything works in the game too - I haven't found a single glitch or bug since I started playing. My only problem with the game is the lack of diplomatic options. Although the game has a decent selection, it isn't as full as you'd expect it to be. For example, you can't threaten to attack other nations unless they give you a certain resource etc. There is also a slight problem with the game's AI in a diplomatic sense, as to avoid the problem of the AI just letting you walk all over them, they've been made to be very picky over what deals they accept. This leads to some unusual situations, like a leader refusing to end a war with you unless you pay them some gold, despite them only having one city left with no troops while your massive army is waiting outside the city walls - waiting to invade them. These are minor problems in a fantastic game though. If you like the strategy games, you'll love this.

review: If I had to tell anyone who wanted to know why they should play Civ 5, this is why. A lot of people, including me, find the game really fun, addictive and even interesting in some respects, with all of the historical content. Metacritic even gave the game a 90/100 avarage score rating for goodness sake and it's consistently one of the most top played games on Steam. Yes, some people might consider the multiplay not as good as the single player, but even then, it still has it's moments and as you are playing with people, the challenge is possibaly quite high. Finally, as AngryJoe said in his review for Civ 5, the game is more focused towards the non and casual gameing market and was made for people like me, who hadn't played a single Civ title before, as it is supposed to be more simple for non and casual gamers to play. However, this doesn't mean that the game is easy, as the game is still very challenging and with all the mods and DLC which come with Civ 5, this game is sure to make you exited on your next playthrough! If I had to rate this game out of 10, I would give it a 8/10 for the standalone game and a 9-10/10 with the Brave New World and Gods and Kings expantion packs/DLC! As of yet, this has been the most played game I've played on Steam, having played it for around 224 hours, according to Steam, and is one of, if not, my most favorite games of all time!

review: One of my favorite series of all time, this game is what strategy games should look up to, it covers humanity's progress from the stone age up until their first starship to another galaxy (and Mechs!). the scope here is unparalleled. there is an argument that this version is worse than 4, and that might be true, however, there are aspects here that have improved the game overall, the AI for one, the diplomacy is much more balanced, the Hex grid adds a superior layer of strategy to the previous square one, and the fact that you cannot stack your units anymore eliminated that dreaded attack with all units tactic. I would also recommend playing this with the Brave New World expansion, which adds several elements to the game (especially social and trade) and to a lesser extent the Gods and Kings expansion that adds religion and add to both the new civs and wonders which also add a new layer of strategy. this is perhaps one of the best strategy games of all time and is highly recommended

The histoical information in the civilopedia is great for light reading, and the thought put into the units was wonderful. I mean, how many people knew about turtle ships and galeasses before playing this game. Also the sense of reality in the diplomatic relationships between civs is relativly realistic. It is a challenging game, but not impossible. I like the five ways to achive victory as well. Overall 10/10 stars and I can't wait to see how their latest game Civiliation, Beyond Earth turns out!

review: An immense amount of replayability. Any strategy fan will love this game and history buffs will most likely be interested. The only thing that may deter people is the learning curve-- which there is a mild one. I haven't played any previous Civilization games and it took maybe an hour at most outside of the tutorial to understand the deepest levels of the game. That is not to say it is simple by any measure, however. The tutorial walks you through the game and there is even a setting to change your familiarity with the game and even new expansions while you are playing outside of the tutorial in a normal game. This mechanic will be sure to easily introduce you to new game systems through a typical playthrough. I purchased this and most DLC and expansions at full price and it is completely worth it. Any discount on this game and the rest of the content is definitely a must-buy. Amazingly addicting gameplay and a unique and enthralling storyline that is written with every new game that is played.

review: The vanilla Civ V is definitely still a great game, but really only shines with the big DLC (BNW and G&K). The DLCs give Civ V the replay-ability you look for in a Civ game. So, if you can snag the whole bundle in a Steam Sale there's probably one of the best purchaes on Steam you could make.

review: I was the leader of a peaceful, prosperous empire. We had a small military dedicated to only fighting off barbarians and we tried to stay on good terms with all, helping those who needed help with a small piece of our treasuries. Then one day our Egyptian allies declared war on us. We fought bravely and despite heavy losses we managed to fend them off.Meanwhile, our American neighbors were growing more and more dangerous. Rumors were circulating that George Washington was planning to "introduce democracy" to our vast supply of natural resources and building a city in the middle of one of our main roads. War was inevitable, and we sent an artist to "culture bomb" the border with them alongside our greatest soldiers. The Americans immediately responded, sending in soldiers armed with advanced weapons that my science advisor calls "firearms". My men fought bravely and managed to raze the troublesome city, but they were no match for the minutemen. They destroyed our greatest armies and layed siege to our capital Moscow. Then the egyptians declared war...again. This is when we realized that the Egyptians were an obvious threat to world peace. Attacking allies? What ever happened to declarations of friendship? This time the Egyptians were prepared and they cut through our defenses like a knife through butter, seizing one of our colonies. We requested assistance from another close ally, the English. All we got was a letter saying "No. Absolutely not". The egyptians were unstoppable, taking all of our colonies until reaching the ocean. The concept of having to send an army by sea was incomprehensible to Egyptians, and they stopped. (never officially making a peace treaty. I write this because I fear my days as the leader of the Russian Empire are numbered. My men have managed to fight off the Americans so far, but for every minutemen squad we kill 5 take its place Our "allies" have refused to help us despite all we have done for them in the past. We have attempted to conduct diplomacy with Washington but he refuses to make peace. My people grow restless. If the Americans don't overthrow me they will.

review: Definitely not a game you should start up when you have something important scheduled. You know, like... sleeping or eating. The "just one more turn" syndrome will keep ordinary things like these well out of your mind. Try the marathon mode if you dare... The multiplayer mode used to be bit wonky but it pretty stable after the last patches. Definitely get both expansions for the best experience (the Complete Edition is usually up for 10 bucks during the Steam sales).

review: An excellent strategy series got even better with V's hex based maps that allow for some fun military tactics. This is the best civilization yet, as you no longer have to put together unrealistic stacks of doom all on one tile to take an enemy city. There is no one right way to play the game and after almost 500 hours I still find ways to sequence differently and change my playstyle. You can be an aggressive military powerhouse, a prosperous economic nation, a cultured nation, or even a religious one. With many routes to victory, you won't get tired of doing the same thing over and over. The base game has lots of unique leader bonuses, unique civilization units and buildings to explore, and the expansions add even more. I'd strongly recommend getting both expansions to the game as they add so much that is indispensible to the main experience. It's a game that you'll lose track of time, and 1 am will suddenly become 3 am when you promised yourself to quit after one more turn twenty turns ago.

review: I have been a huge Sid Meier's fan ever since Civ 2 and I love the Civilization Series, you can really get bored of ir and you can make your own Nations and Armies and attack others, control currency, build education, resources and much more. Very well made game. The only thing that grinds my gears when it comes it Sid Meiers is that the DLC cost so much money. The Gods and Kings DLC is $29.99 which is the cost of the whole Civilization V game itself.

review: Hello I am a fan of games such as Civ Games and Age Of Empires etc etc... and I can say for sure this is a good game. I have played it for about 100+ hours, not much for some people but for me it is. At first I experienced some problems with the multiplayer but I think they fixed the problems that could ruin the experience. Buy the vanilla Civ V and then buy the Brave New World if u don't mind not getting some civilizations but if u have the money just buy the Gold Edition. Well that's it, that's one of my first reviews, plz don't kill me. And sorry if I misspelled something, I am Portuguese... Thank You.

review: What do you get when you combine modern international world elements, Sid Meir, and a game? You get Civilization! One of the best strategy games I have ever played! You start as a nomadic tribe of any country of your choosing. (This means you can rule the world as the ancient Mayans in 2100 by the way. :P) But soon, you settle and make a city, using the nearby resources. While gathering these resources, you can make a scout to look around the land, or a warrior to protect yourself from barbarians. As the game progresses, so does the time and the civilizations. You go from a small tribe, to a cozy hamlet, to a thriving town, to a bustling city! your military go from sword and shield, to longswords and armor, to cannons and musket, to tanks and modern weapons, to mechanized troops and nuclear bombs. While this short review may not cover a large portion of the game, I would still recommend it to anyone who enjoys long sessions of strategizing and planning.

review: I'm a long time lover of strategy games, but I'm new to the Civ franchise. I picked up the complete edition so my first experience was the whole package at once. The game was easy to pick up, and aesthetically pleasing. From the opening cut scene I felt I was watching a documentary. It does a great job of making the history of humanity feel more epic. I was staggered by the number and variety of civilizations to pick and use. Recently I moved up in difficulty to the level which the general public would consider "normal" (the in game definition of normal is rather easy in favor of the human players). I find a great challenge and really enjoy building a narrative out of every random mission. The modding world is amazing! From convenience mods to full conversion mods and everything in between, there is something for everybody. If you find yourself burning out and wishing for a little spark to keep you interested of months of playing: definitely check out the workshop content. Flaws? Well, once you are learned in the game the difficulty needs to be ramped up quite a bit just to give the AI a chance. And harder AI difficulty doesn't make them "smarter", it just gives them an early lead. So a high level game is more of an uphill battle rather than a game against a more ruthless opponent. I recommend this game, and to get the complete package as the expansions to contribute to the whole experience. I am happy I finally began enjoying the franchise.

You will learn to hate the world congress if you do not own it. And no matter what you do on the higher dificulties like imortal and diety, you will struggle. But you will go out with a bang. Or you play lower level and are equal to everyone. Or basic and destroy everyone

review: Civilization V is one of the best turn-based strategy games I have ever played. It has endless replay potential, as every map is randomly generated (except the Earth map) and no game turns out the same way. Each nation has their own play style and advantages that can be used to reign down fire upon your enemies or line your pockets with gold. You can customize your policies to better accomodate your play style, say if you want to dominate the world with an iron fist, be the most technologically advanced society, be an economic superpower, and many more. My roommate and I enjoy estabishing an allegiance together and we create two superpowers to rival the oppressive force of the nation led by the bloodthirsty, ruthless warmongerer, Ghandi. He will not think twice about pressing the launch button on his ICBMs that are aimed toward your cities. Keep that in mind if you decide to spare him. It is entirely worth the money if you decide to get it. I highly recommend getting the complete edition, which contains all the DLC and map packs. They add so much to the game that it creates an incredible amount of opportunities and improvements that make it that much better.

review: This game is incredibly addicting for many reasons. It offers many of the features found in a masterfully designed strategy game, or just any game in general. The difficulty, the multiple ways to win, and the informative tutorial and instruction with little to no hand-holding, and of course legitimate multiplayer. First, in difficulty there are FIVE difficulty levels (I may be wrong but there are at least 5). For the three that I have played (Lowest, Middle, and Highest) I can confirm that they all offer unique experiences and don't just tweak simple stats like increasing enemy speed or strength, it actually changes the artificial intelligence of the game to make the CPU opponents smarter instead of harder. Next, the informative tutorial is litterally an entire dictionary's worth of instruction for each individual thing, brought to you at appropriate times at a player defined rate. It doesn't force you to do anything, it just provides useful insight on gameplay to teach new players how to play and teach experienced players new tricks. Also, there are many ways to win offering the player to journey of on his or her own path. I believe there are 5 or more equally difficult ways to achieve difficulty, offering tons of replayability trying to achieve each goal at least once, and then trying to achieve those goals again at a higher difficulty and so on. Finally, it offers LEGITAMITE, NOT THROWN IN FOR MARKETING(*cough* Assassin's Creed *cough*) multiplayer. Let me tell you, it is so much fun to team up and battle against your friends! Its almost a game in its own. Instead of going into detail, who doesn't want to create your own civilization from a pack of settlers with a buddy or two or ten? Enough said. In conclusion BUY THIS GAME! Seriously you won't regret it the only hidden cost is hours of your time.

review: Civ V is a crack cocaine simulator. I purchased Civ V through the Gods and Kings expansion during some Steam sale last year. I decided that it was finally time to give it a whirl. 30 hours later I am a pale, emaciated version of the man I once was. Civ V follows the classic turn-based strategic gameplay associated with board games like risk. You take actions then your opponent(s) do, repeat until winning conditions are met. This one takes place on one of several large topographic maps, where you get to take on the persona of some famous world leader from history starting at about 4000BC then lead your civilization through history to modern times. You compete with a number of other civilizations and many small city-states for resources. There are a number of win conditions, not just wiping out all the civs; you can win through science, diplomacy, cultural influence, or just by getting the highest combined score by the time you reach the year 2050, or 500 turns. The game starts out rather simple, with a settler and warrior unit on a small piece of the map. You found a city with your settler and go from there. What begins is an incredibly complex and rewarding journey as you advance through the ages and your empire begins to develop a life of its own. To manage the complexity the game privides tool tips, advisors, information panels and wikis. You are given short and long term goals to accomplish. Every turn, there is usually some new or interesting development. As you meet new civilizations, they will change the dynamic of the game by influencing other players or city-states for resources and support. It truly feels like a world stage. There honestly are not a lot of negatives I can think of for Civ V. The late game in Gods and Kings does feel a bit grindy... however I understand that has been addressed in "Brave New World" which I plan to purchase shortly. If you are considering this title, definitely get the complete edition when it goes on sale. 10/10

review: Great game that can have you playing for hours upon hours without realizing how long you've been playing. Every time you play its a different situation and you have to be able to adapt to your surroundings. Each time you play you'll have a different start and you need to know when to expand or when to build an army. The Vanilla version of the game can get pretty boring pretty fast - its all that I own atm. The multiplayer mode is what makes this game even better because you can play a game with friends and you can continue whenever you want. Each civilization has its own special units/special buildings/ or special ability. Its up to you as the player to utilize your civs strong points and use them to reach one of the possible victories. From the time ive played its hard to get a diplomatic victory on Vanilla. Ive heard good things about Brave New World but no need to buy it since Civ Beyond Earth is coming out. The game can be addicting but the Vanilla gets boring after a while unless you play online. All in all 9/10 Would Recommend.

review: Sid Meier's Civilization V is the latest entry in the long-running Civilization franchise; as such, it continues its tradition of turn-based strategy through building a civilization and competing among other civilizations to achieve one of several conditions for victory. Starting with one or more settlers (depending on which era you choose to start in), the basic tasks are to manage your cities, which are the main hubs of your civilization, and to progress in technology, culture, etc. Diplomacy with other civilizations and city-states is beneficial for your civilization, military units must be maintained to prevent or start a war against another civilization, and wonders can be built to give your empire a unique edge. There's so much flexibility and gameplay in this game that I can't cover everything that it has to offer; it's better to play it to acquire a good understanding of it, and the tutorials and first game help guide you in doing so. Despite how deep this game is, I found it to be surprisingly accessible the first time I played it. I can't speak for the multiplayer as much since I stick to the turn-based hotseat multiplayer mode, but it works fairly well from my experience. The Gods & Kings and Brave New World expansions enhance the early and late game features respectively (the latter also changes the Cultural Victory and how most of your gold is earned), and are definitely worth having. There are also numerous mods available in the Steam Workshop and on the CivFanatics forum that are worth checking out, ranging from maps to civilizations to full-fledged mods that overhaul the entire game. Sid Meier's Civilization V is one of the finest turn-based strategy games I've ever played, and it's well worth putting the time and effort into it; just remember to take breaks every now and then!

review: If you are new to Civ like I was at first this game can seem a little overwhelming due to the vast amount of content offered. However after a few hours of gameplay you can expect to be navigating the overlays and maps like a pro. This game is non-stop fun and super addictive, I often find myself playing for hours and hours even after I say to myself that im going to play only one more turn and save. Highly recommend this game to anyone who is interested in turn based strategy games. Game also has steam workshop which adds to replay value.

review: Before I continue, The Vanillia game is little more then a demo for the real game. This game is only worth playing with all the major expansion packs, "Gods and Kings" + "Brave New World". Unless you can get all 3, dont bother. This is because religion, espionage, trade routes, a world congress, tourism, great works, and 18 new Civs are added with theses expansions. Without these two expansions there is no economy, religion, nothing to do but grind tech and build military units, which is boring. The Vanillia game is little more then a demo for the real game. Having beaten this game on all it's difficulties I can for sure say, Civ 5 has put me through my paces. WIth the full game there are limitless hours of civ/world/difficulty combos that can be further tweaked with advanced setup. The game doesnt really cheat hard until the last difficulty, which is better than most games because there are a total of 8 difficulties with 5, 6, and 7 being hard but not impossible. If you play this game on windows then the game is worth double its money because civ5 has one of the best modding communities on the steam workshop. Thousands of mods to change the mechanics of the game along with thousands of new civs with just as good if not better quality of the vanilla ones. This game is a staple in the strategy community and is the best civ yet: you manage economy as well as city building and commanding armies. Pretty much the same as civ4 with better graphics and a revamped community through steam workshop. If you like strategy then give this game a try.

review: Phenomenal, honestly. If you're a fan of 4x, poltics, management or strategy games this is truly a staple. Customization, replayability and incredibly addicting gameplay keep people playing this for hundreds and thousands of hours. The game has one major flaw, and that's if you get the base game with no expansions, packs or DLC then it can feel empy, which is a flaw. Though, at this point with all the bundle sales if you can get anything along with it it feels fleshed out and is probably one of the best games on the market for your money considering how many hours of gameplay it gives.

review: Civilization V. This game is truly amazing and deserving of the title PC Game of the year. The base game in itself is a massive title with loads of replay value. The additions to the series are truly noticable and they all play out perfect. The policy trees are something can be very helpful if taken advantage of properly. The use and importance of city-states is something that wasn't seen before and they only get better in the Brave New World expansion. The introduction of Relgion is Gods and Kings is also a great mechanic for working with City-States and other Civs. Combat is something that was really impressed me. Its in depth with many factors practically in every single tile and with the abilities that you gain leveling up your units or the unqiue ablites/units that come with a certain Civ. Speaking of the Civilizations.....the choices of the Leaders you have is plentiful to say the least. It has something for everybody. A must purchase title for any gamer who enjoys RTS, Strategy, and Turn-Based. Really just if you like video games buy this one. If you want a rating....5/5, 9.8/10, two Thumbs up, 99/100, and just damn amazing guys.

review: What can I say about this game? If you've ever played previous iterations of this game (I started with Civilization II), then you're probably already addicted and own it. For newcomers, I think Firaxis have done an amazing job simplifying the UI and providing useful prompts for new mechanics as they appear, so this is a great version to start with. Even with the simplifications, all the depth you'd expect from this game is still there and you can expose it easily (the city management screen for example). With the Gods & Kings and Brave New World DLC, Firaxis have made what I think is by far the most entertaining Civilization yet! So, to summarise: buy this game if you have any love for strategy and a w streak. Just be prepared to lose entire days to it.

review: This is a game you can easily lose a day too. 4x games always look incredibly boring too watch but once you start playing one you just can't stop. Gods and Kings and Brave New World are pretty much required too get as the base game was a little too basic. The five different victroy types make finding new strategy's all the more fun.

review: At first Civ V was pretty rocky. There were a lot of problems with the initial release in terms of game balance and fun. However, I remembered full well the release of the original Civ III and Civ IV games, and the same was true for their vanilla versions. Both were made immensely more-playable by their subsequent expansions. The same is true for Civ V. With patches and expansions, it has grown into an addictive gaming experience worthy of the Civilization franchise. Almost all of the new game mechanics are winners, from hexagonal tiles to social policies to the culture system... Almost, I say. The big, huge, massive flaw of this game is irrepairable, and that is the 1 Unit per Tile restriction. While I've no problem with implementing some sort of restrictions to limit Stacks of Doom and massive unit spam, the 1UPT system is ultimately the wrong way to do it. Turning 1000-mile stretches of the map into tactical battlefields might be fun for the Panzer General crowd, but it slows the game down and leads to unpleasant unit shuffling. It also doesn't make much sense that Bronze Age archers can fling arrows over hundreds of miles of terrain. If you want a tactical battle system in Civ, then adopt the Imperialism mechanic of switching to turn-based battles on localized battlefield maps instead of having them on the main map. Forcing players to move countless units around the map just makes multi-player tedious as you wait for your opponents to move and move and move... But honestly, even with 1UPT, Civ V is excellent. It has grown to supplant Civ IV as my strategy game of choice these days, which is saying something.

game-hours: 38.3
review: In the end, I got enough enjoyment out of this game to recommend it, though it still feels off and game-y - it really punishes you for doing things the wrong way, and I never really feel like I can attack anybody until civilizations have guns, when most of the appeal for me is playing as ancient empires like the Romans. But anyway, it's still worth playing.

review: Civilization V might just be the most addictive videogame I have ever played. The allure of building a civilization from nothing to a global superpower is one that nobody can resist. The game's political and militaristic intrigue is more absorbing than anything else you'll find on Steam, and for a game that doesn't even have a predetermined story that is saying a lot. Its expansion packs are more than just glorified DLC; they actually add heaps of extra depth and possibilities to every session. This game will chow down on your free time like Atilla chows down Ancient era cities. Civ V will ruin your life, but you will not give a single .

review: The best game ever! Well....... i have played this game for 60hrs now so i think it's time for me to do a rewiew. I only have one word for this game and that word is AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The game is adictive and fun becaus you make your own story like dayz, you do not have a specific goal exceppt make your civilization soo good and big as possibal. For you that don't know a  about this game read this: You start the game in the ancient time with some few settlers and warriors, then you found your capital city on a good place and start build things and units in your town. When you research new technology you will be able to build new stuff and when all of the technology in that era is researcht you will enter a new era. On you way to a great empire you will meet other nations and city states that you may choose to be friend with or wage war agienst. This is where the hard part start and when you start to make choices that madder, and it's here the endless replayability is becaus you maybe whant to have world domination or be a friendly guy that help empires with food and other stuff. Well that's the basic and i cant wright everything but i promise you that this game is one of the best games ever made becaus off the free choices and the power you feal when you controll a great empire or win a big world war. And one more thing! If you think this game is nice i strongly recommend the total war series becaus it has some simular stuff to civ 5 but here you get a game that is focesed on war and it's a combination of turn based stratigy and rts where you will get a close view of the battlefield with your troops. (rts stands for real time stratigy if you dident know)

review: Great game! Especially after some time and many game updates it feels very well rounded and cleverly designed. Of course, the gameplay is mostly not new but there are a lot of new aspects and improvements to justify buying this one even if you already own the already brilliant Civ IV; especially the new strategic aspects from the non-ability to stack units and hexagonal fields was a welcome change. The only thing I don't like is a late period in every game session when everything seems to kind of drag along, but I guess that's only because of the way I play (slowly expand and tend to my cities and later build an army and conquer everything ^^ That's the part that's fun but drags along and gets old fast...) I have to admit, I haven't even ever played Civ in multiplayer, so I can't say anything about that... 8,5/10 PS: I find the two addons pretty expensive but to be honest, they don't add anything I find essential to enjoy the game. Nice stuff, but not necessary at all (for those who are thinking about buying the game but fear they won't have much fun without also buying all the expensive extra stuff).

review: I feel naught but gluttony when I descend into the depths of this game. Before me stands a vast planet, ripe for the fruits of conquest. My conquest. Thousands of years pass and my empire is never satiated. Despite the marvels of the world laying to waste in the empire's glorious capital, the citizens of this utopia cry and beg for more. The great Pyramids and ancient wonders go unattended as people demand for new marvels. Food is never of want, yet they demand for more. Rivers run with gold yet they demand it to be filled with the blood of my enemies. I plead for my empire to embrace the peace which I've fought milennia for. Watching a small band of settlers build a vast nation expanding multiple continents only to succumb to their bloodlust sickens me. I digress. Every click of the mouse casts years ahead in this virtual heroin pit, yet hours fly by as I slowly watch myself lose interest in the plights of real life. Yes I should relieve myself in a bathroom, or shower, or attend to the various pleas of my family to pick up the phone and let them know I still draw breath. I cannot abandon my love though. I press forward and embrace my citizens as they were my own kin. I watch in horror as opposing civilizations, who have lived side by side, as allys, trade partners, research collaborators, and friends turn to their own demands and launch vast assaults on my beloved people. The only affirmation this game offers is the demonic plague which will steal your humanity, and cast your selfish demons upon you.

review: This game... just look at the hours I have put into it and I still havn't touched all the civilizations, playsyles, or even the map settings. single player, multiplayer, mods, dlc, this game does everything everyone says it does. One small flaw I will note is the AI is very hipocrytically unforgiving. Attack a warmongering race and eliminate their capitol and it triggers a domino effect that gets the whole world declairing war on you. Attacked a city state at the start of the game and conqured it, reached turn 300 still basically begging for forgivness from other civs. Reguardless of that the game plays flawwlessly *for me* is absolutlely beautiful and will keep you comming back for years to come. Even when you put it down, you'll want to pick it up again in a month or two "just to see what this scenerio would imply to the world" another 50 hrs and 7 games later.

review: I'm going to start this review by saying note this is a great game. It's mechanics are great you overall should probably buy it but i also have to write this about a warning. This game is very fun and when you play you feel as if you should continue playing and not stop playing. So what i'm trying to say is this game is extremely addictive, you will spend hours on end wasting your time on this video game, no breaks you dont stop until you finished playing that civilization, luckily i was able to get out eventually but if you can get addicted and dangerously addicted to games easily i don't recommend this game to you. But if we delve into the game mechanics it's pretty good, the game is a bit to laggy but very great idea once you go through the tutorial thats easy to follow you will get the hang of everything and can easily lead your civilization to becoming the greatest kindom ever. The price for what it offers is definitley good but not amazing. Overall i'm going to give this game an 8/10 so you should buy this game, but beware my friends, beware.

review: Great game. I have never played an RTS before, but couldn't resist civ 5. There are so many countries, ways to win, etc. I enjoy the fact that I can play against 24 countries in a world sized maps. I can play the political game or I can become a warmonger and take the world by force. Easy for people who have never played RTS and yet still has enough content to please long time RTSers as well.

review: A damn good board game as it is, civilization 5 was a best example of "how to do it right", with of addons and add-ons, it became a overcomplicated turn-based strategy. For some its for best, for some - not so. And because u cant delete once bought content, game itself became something different then something what u loved so much once. So, buy urself a game and dont think of all other bulls**t like dlc, and u'l get urself a best of civilization!

review: I have been playing this series since Civ 1 back in on my Amiga 5oo days in the early 90s and if you are into world/civ building strategy titles in any way, shape or form, games just won't come better than this masterpiece, It is immensely fun, totally addictive and returns great value for your money. Worth noting is that I have exclusively played vanilla (with the exceptance of purchased official DLC) single player vs AI for Civ 5 (i.e. no MP at all) , but judging by previous experiences from earlier titles in the series, I dare guess that MP is even more fun and challenging. Add to this the plethora of user created mods via steamworks and you have an almost endless source of digitalized entertainment!! :-) This comes highly recommended as a game with the almost perfect mix of theme, ambience, game mechanics and outright addictive fun.

review: Bought this through humble bundle and enjoyed it so much i added the extra ~5$ to get the full tier. This is my first experience with a civ game and i have passed on them before because i thought it was to complex. But starting from the lowest difficulty and work your way up seems to have worked this far. The only negative i can think about, except the AI's evil trading, is that it magically turns "one more turn" to 3AM in the morning.

review: What can you say about one of the best series of true strategy games. As with every version of Civilization there are small changes which makes an old player a little annoyed. But once you get used to the changes and get into the enhancements you know why you purchase every one of Sid Meier's branded games since the first Civ :) Amazing game play, single player, multiplayer. Many different variations never the same game twice, several difficult levels to challenge players of all skills levels. Defnitely one for the more intellectual gamers out there.

review: Civ 5 is one of those games that people who like the idea of owning their own empire will enjoy. You can wage war with other nations and be happy with fruits of your conquests, even though many risks were taken. With DLC, you can watch as your religion spreads across the world. Also, for diplomats, you can negotiate land, resources, and forge alliances. I would recommend this game for people who have a lot of patience and time on their hands, because this game is addicting as hell.

review: Easy to play, difficult to master, the game I just cant stop going back to for...just....one...more...turn! Having played all of the Civilization games since my best mate introduced me to the orginal when we started high school through to being married with 2 kids I have definitely grown up with Civ and it has grown up with me over the past 20 odd years. I have spent 1000s of hours in the Civ games over the years and have found each to be different to the game before it and all enjoyable (although I much preferred Alpha Centauri to Civ 2). All of the Civ games are pretty easy to get in and play with a simple interface and varying difficulty options allowing anyone to play, develop strategies and build their empire, but underneath this is a game that is extremely challenging to master. With the Steam Achievements helping to give differing objectives to work toward while playing the game I have found my gameplay more focused in this than previous Civ games, yet I still start random games just to play and keep enjoying the differing maps and starting locations. Generally I have been against DLC for games as it often feels that the vanilla releases are getting less content than in previous years but with Civ I had already spent 200 hours in game before the outlay on the first expansion and have since bought the DLCs and expansions "Gods & Kings" and "Brave New World" and have passed 500 very enjoyable hours. The feature that has impressed me most with this Civ release has been the scenarios which have been both challenging and enjoyable to complete. Most PC gamers would know the names Sid Meier and Civilization and many would already have these names on their "must buy" lists but Civ 5 is more than just a game of the year, it is a game to go back to time and time again...just...one...more...turn

review: Civilization V is a great turn based strategy game. The music is phenomenal, no matter how long I listen to it (and Ive listened to it for hundreds of hours, literally), and the atmosphere is amazing. 2K games has supported this game for years now, releasing content and expansion packs ontop of an already amazing game. (I especially love 2K games for adding another unit in one of the expansion packs called the XCOM squad, directly from their other game XCOM: Enemy Unknown (also a great game!) As further incentive the steam workshop allows you to conveniently download custom mods to further your enjoyability of this great game. If you think turn based games arent for you, and that you prefer RTS's or dont even enjoy strategy games at all, I beg you to pick this up! I didnt even find strategy games all that great until I picked this up, and now they are a reoccurring theme in my steam library. Play this game and you might be hooked for life, like me:)

review: When I was young I couldn't really get into turn based strategy because it felt like it took forever to do anything fun. As the Civ series has progressed, they've made it not only easier for newbies to get into, they've also made the pacing very flexible, allowing you to play at whatever speed you prefer (still turn-based, of course). This game is a brilliant way to spend a few hours/days/weeks. Be warned, when you start a game, you will experience the time travel effect!

review: 10 / 10 I have to say, watching reviews, gameplay videos and trailers, heck even watching a friend of mine play it.. I didn't think it was that good. Especially being a veteran of Total War: Shogun 2, I figured the battles were way too basic and would drag the whole game down. Well.. I was wrong.. This is one of those games that has a ton of customization options to fit any type of play, short, long, easy, hard. It's a game that you literally will keep saying "one more turn". So very addicting, and even more so if you play with friends. For a game with 6 or 12 players online, and 6 player offline hotseat (co-op fully supported) on a single machine.. this game is one of the best games I've ever played, and I've played games since Atari 2600. I highly recommend this to any strategy or micromanage gamer. The feature set is so strong, and this game just completely sucks you in. My only regret was not getting it a year sooner when it was on sale for the same price.

review: This game is amazing. Complex at first, the game has a good tutorial that explains the main concepts. The game has lots of layers and multiple ways to win, either through, science, culture, and diplomacy, or war and domination. This enables you to not always crush everyone, but to be diplomatic or be more cultural/scientific. Your social policies can give you edges in certain areas of your Civilization, and often one thing is connected to another. More science research means better army which leads to more diplomatic power and so on. Only negatives are that sometimes the worker automation does not work and that one game can take days to finish. Multiple characters and DLC enable endless replayability without the game becoming boring. Overall, a great game.

review: I suppose I should write a review for the game I've put the most hours into. I am writing this after the release of both expansions. For the people with Civ IV vs V debates, I can understand why people disliked Civ V over IV at first. The Civ series has gradually improved itself to Civ IV, and then Civ V is a total overhaul of the game. A hex grid board instead of squares, one military unit per tile (no more stacks of doom), and a simplification of the UI. All of these things are a blessing, with the exception of the AI doesn't really know how to control it's military properly (it has been noticablely improved though). Also, Civ V (vanilla) didn't have religion or espionage, so why move on to Civ V? (imo) Civ V is better than IV after Gods & Kings, and definitely better after Brave New World. Thanks to the one unit per hex system, Civ V feels more like a wargame than the ones before it. And I like the change for how religion is used in V better than IV, which was really just a research rush for the tech that unlocked that religion. The best part about the BNW expansion is that the peaceful victories have become just as fun throughout the legnth of the game as conquest. The cultural victory used to just be to get your culture buildings up quick, beeline radio and sit there and hit end turn until you win. Now, you can go to war and steal great works of art from a rival civ, send in archaeologists to take artifacts out of their lands, and send in great musicians to tourism bomb them in the hopes of influencing their citizens to your culture. This game is endlessly replayable. Even if you play on a preset map, like Earth, the actions taken by other civs is always unpredicable. Basically what it comes down to is, I love this game. I would recommend it to anybody, but I guess if you're the impatient type, then you might not like it. My arguement to that would be, every turn in this game has something important happen (except maybe the first few), and that is why my hours are over 500 (at the time of this writing). It is addicting to watch your mud hut village with spearmen grow into an empire of gleaming metropolises that is capable of launching nukes. Even when you finish the game it gives you the option for "one.. more.. turn.."

review: I could easily spend hours at a time on this game. Oh wait I have! I love the depth this game goes into with regards to the various features and ways you can win. No other game I have played before has five different ways of winning, and even then, each of these five ways require a completely different strategy - so imagine the scenario where you're palying and going for one victory with other players (AI or not) all going for different victories - it's insane and creates a diverse game which changes every time you play. For example; going for a cultural victory would mean that it would be sensible to have a low number of cities and a small area of land that you own, but if there's a player going for a domination victory, they'll have a massive empire and could crush you in a couple of turns if they want to! It could be seen as a massive rock/paper/scissors scenario, however, when the game can be played in any way you wish, there is no clear superior option in most cases - a cultural empire could defend against a militaristic one, for example. Anyway enough babbling, if you haven't bought it yet, I recomment it!

review: Having played every game in the Civ series since Civ2, it was only a matter of time before I got Civ V. My first impression were not positive at all; the user-interface felt over-sized too tablet-oriented, the lack of things like tax-allocation sliders worried me, and I was generally worried that the game had been dumbed down in order to appeal to a larger audience. After playing for 30-odd hours, I can definitely say that this is NOT the case. The game took about 5hrs of playing to feel like a Civ game, but now I'm enjoying it at least as much as I was CivIV. Not being able to stack your military units is initially frustrating, but adds a level of strategy that I am now appreciating. As archery units can now fire over several squares but get killed-off quickly in melee, you need to put pikemen up in front of them. Flanking an enemy through the fog-of-war is now much more rewarding as the tile positions of units are more important. Seige weapons are now -needed- to capture cities and, all in all, wars feel much more strategic than they did in previous civs. I only have 2 complaints about this game: 1) The user-interface has many flaws. 2) Diplomacy isn't anywhere near as good as previous civs. For the USER INTERFACE, several things will frustrate you - the borders of your cities are not marked at all; you have to open up the city view and see which tiles are being worked to see how far you can go. While I like the fact that your city borders can expand both through culture and through buying tiles, I dislike the fact that UI elements often prevent you from clicking the tiles you want and aren't as intuitive as they should be. Statistics and other menus are often layered several clicks deep and without tooltips of any variety. When in diplomacy with another civ on THEIR turn (not yours), the 'wait for your turn' cursor replaces your pointer, making it hard to see what you're actually clicking on. It feels like an amateurish overlay on top of a well-made engine. For the DIPLOMACY, you aren't given the information you need to make informed decisions - open border agreements are for 30 turns but you are never told so, friendship treaties last for 90 turns but you are never told that, or how long you have left of your treaty. Diplomacy modifiers vary between incredibly specific to absurdly vague, and you will find yourself penalised for attacking city-states that no other civilisation knows exists, or for over-expanding when no civilisation has even seen the new city you've placed on the other side of the map. I will definitely recommend this game - it is a good successor to Civ IV, and I think that a lot of my gripes are things that have been fixed in the 'Brave New World' expansion (which I will be buying when it drops to a reasonable price). Compared to Civ IV; it is a more interesting game from a militaristic point of view, but less interesting from a city-building point of view (at least until the interace gets sorted out), and the graphical upgrade is also immense (and will definitely get your laptop HOT). All things considered, it is worth the buy; you will definitely enjoy the hours that are sunk into it. TL:DR - Graphically upgraded Civ IV with a better engine and gameplay, but worse UI and Diplomacy. Enjoyable despite its flaws. Recommended.

review: This really is an addicting strategy game, and one of the best I've ever played. It has an interesting gameplay system and a fun multiplayer section. While it may be an old game by now, it still has the useful replayable feature. Pros: - Addicting, and the urge to keep playing in order to win is always there. - Different playstyles as different people, according to how you want to play. - Mods section which allows you to customize your game using the Steam Workshop. Cons: - AI which can be really irksome, especially in the multiplayer section. Leave them for 5 minutes and all your money's gone. - A tutorial system would be really handy, as for some new players it can be hard to get used to. Overall I would give this game a 9/10, as while it can be fun to play, there are still some features that need some work.

review: As a single player venture Civ 5 is a challenging game that does an alright job of teching you how to play. Supplemental information is essential to achieve advanced methods of play and a deeper understanding of this very complex game. As a multi-player experience it's a mixed bag. If you have friends ready to go it's not so very bad. The game periodically has to re-synch, leading to long, unavoidable delays, and sometimes the game will bug out after the game has been running for some time. Recent updates seem to have helped iron out these problems, leading to a lot of fun if you play with friends. Online multi-player is a whole other matter. Slow, clunky, unresponsive, and prone to silly bugs and errors all keep you from getting into a game in a timely manner. The lack of any sort of filtering system makes finding a game that suits your tastes an incredibly long and tedious process. And once you get into a game people have an awful tendency to quit if too many things go wrong, leaving you playing with the AI and essentially in an singple player game. If the awful interface, bugs, and terrible multi-player support aren't deal breakers this is a solid, potentially endlessly fun game. Those who like to play with others, however, beware!

review: Civilization 5 is a great entry in the series, and a good one for beginners to start with, since it has the design(-flaws) of Civilization: Revolution. Not as good as Civilization 3 or 4, but it's prettier and works better online than both of them, so it gets the job done. The expansionpacks cure what the vanilla-version lacked, so make sure to get those right away, otherwise you won't enjoy the game, and even if you DO, you miss out on a lot of content. TLDR; The game is bland if played vanilla, with Expansion + DLC the game is great.

review: As a Civilization veteran (having played through III and IV extensively), I thought that Civilization V stayed true to the rest of the series while making excellent improvements and additions. The game is a polished, tested, and free of any discernible bugs. The UI is more intuitive than that of Civilization III and the overlay options allow you to view the map area in terms of whichever factors you see fit. The concept of non-stacking units is also surprisingly good. Gone are the painful late-game turns of managing a bloated military, Civilization V encourages a more diverse style of play, wherein pursuing cultural, diplomatic, militaristic, scientific, or time victory is a choice that does markedly affect your style of play more so than in prequels. This is largely due to the city-state mechanic as well as the social policy mechanic. A complaint I had with the previous titles in the series was the tendency for domination victory to be the most effective strategy by far. In this game however, I feel the developers have done an excellent job in making every victory type to be worthwhile, unique, and effective in their own rights. Thanks to the many improvements made to the series in this game, and the adherance of the developers to the root mechanics of Civ, I think this is a great game for Civ fans and probably the best ever for new players.

review: I highly recommend this game if you really like to kill time, literally. Just so you know, this is a real time strategy, similar with Age of Empires, but this one is in turn-based system which I think have made this game much interesting to play. And the AI is hard enough to beat if you didn't set up your strategy well. The best thing that makes this game one of my favorites is Civilization V is not all about war, war and war. You can try nuke, nuke and nuke for fun. (note: this is "a game" which could kill your real life.)

review: Civilization V, the fifth installment in the amazing Civilization series, is undoubtably one of the most user-friendly, easy-to-play strategy games on the market. Players that are new to Civilization will find this game enjoyable the second they start to play, as the game has a very small learning curve and is easy to grasp. If you're an older player, you'll find the game harder to get into than previous installments, and the base game is lacking many of the things that made previous Civilization games enjoyable (religion, behind-the-scenes politics, advanced diplomacy (vassal states, etc.), Leonard Nemoy, and a large number of civilizations). However, with "Gods & Kings" and (especially) "Brave New World", the game becomes what it should have been: advanced, full of new ideas, and addicting as hell. "G&K" re-adds religion and "BNW" adds in some nice diplomatic options and advanced trading abilities. All in all, Civilization V is great for new Civilization players, and perfectly fine for old players (and great for old players if they have the two main add-ons). Either way, you'll find hours of daytime vanish into thin air.

Fly into space, or be elected world leader. Infinite replay value. The expansion packs and civilization DLCs (Korea, Polynesia, Babylon, Denmark) add a lot to the game, and made my playthroughs a lot more fun. Brave New World, the second expansion, really fleshed out cultural victories. Mods add a lot of content to the game, including maps, civilizations, and scenarios. Anyways, this is a great game, and I personally cannot wait for Civilization: Beyond Earth next fall. 9.5/10

review: This is a game you may not play too often, but when you start a game, be prepared for the next 5-50 hours to be solely focussed on wiping Gandi off the face of the planet with nuclear weaponary. Your visions of being a peaceful civilisation are shattered by your own self greed for world domination, your small tribe of simple warriors have evolved into super death machines that march from London to Tokyo (perhaps because Japan settled too close to you and the city is only 2 turns walk away). DESTROY, CONQUER AND REBUILD! *ahem* A few downsides to this game is that you may never return to an old campign, each session generally feels like its time to begin anew. Also, no one watching over your shoulder will understand how fun/addictive this game is, You just need to play it to understand.

review: Another remake of Civ. still the best non-space 4X. Sound, Soundtrack & Visuals are all great (although i prefer the Lenard Nimoy voice-over mod). Advisors are back better than ever (now with good tutorials if you need that). Now that units stacking has significantly changed how wars/combat playout (and with this change they kinda ruined the great generals/admirals). I like the new Civ-o-pedia. Culture & Social Policies are a welcome addition. You must use G+K or BNW expansions, preferably both, for the game to really come alive through all ages. Not sure that religon is all that influential in terms of the game outcomes. If you won't get CIV5 with expansions or DLC all on sale, and you aren't modding (steam workshop), then don't bother and get CIV4. Get it when CIV5 is on sale with the expansions, don't bother with DLC until you have played through at least once (unless the DLC comes as extras such as in the Gold pack).

Many or few, every game is different with a huge selection of map types and playable factions. I have played multiple run's of this game and still it is my favorite Civ from Sid so far. I'm sure i'll have many more hours in this game as the acheivment list is 200+. Multiplayer has a little to be desired as the matching can sometime take awhile and games tend to get overpowered one way or another rather early on. Finding solid players that can last a match is uncommon. With all being said the game is definetly playing.

review: This fifth installment really brings my previous Civ gaming experiences to the next level. :) As a history and a book lover, Civilization 5 brings me to the days of old when nations are still small, wars are constant, where seeds technological development are still being planted and watered for growth, wonders are being constructed, etc. This game gives users the best perspective of seeing how the nations of the world evolve and continues to evolve until now. Nice gameplay, superb detail and graphics, plus the accuracy of AI leader personalities (based on history) really gives you that great feeling leading your chosen civilization to glory. The different systems in the game, the religion and espionage (in Gods and Kings) adds depth to gameplay. It gives the player multiple ways to achieve victory for a civ. I just love this game so much.

Civ 5 is the best strategy game I have played with it's depth and fun gameplay every game is different. with multiple victory choices your not limited to one way of playing. Each civilization has differnt perks making it interesting to play new civs every game.The expansion of Brave New World focuses on improving the way to win culturisticly and diplomaticly from fully adopting 5 policy trees to out culturing everyone else with tourism and from building a wonder voting on who should be world leader. another big thing Brave New world adds in is world congress where you vote on matters every so often. The addition of the great writer and great musician makes culture count even more. BNW also adds in new civs like Venice, Poland and Morocco. Civ 5 is a great game and recommend it everyone.

review: [Quick Infomation]: I'm completely new to the Civilization V series, but this title is one you should consider picking up! The game is about you taking control of a civilization. For example China. You can choose to start in the ancient age all up til the information age. You can also choose to spawn in the real world or a random map, or just build a map! [Gameplay]: The gameplay is turnbased. You do what ever you want to do in a turn. Press "Next Turn" and the AI (or if Multiplayer a human) does what ever they want. You can choose different kinds of game speeds. Quick, Standard, Epic & Marathon. The difference between the game speeds is how long Research, Production & Grow takes. But movement of units ISN'T slowed. The maps is made of Hexs. It opens up for lots of tactical opportunities. [Gameplay Time]: If you start from the ancient era, and with quick speed. You can easily expect a few hours. Unless you rush your enemies. A marathon can take multiple days. But over the course of multiple days you can get tired with your Civilization. So I do not recommend playing at this speed. I normally take Epic to have a acceptable science speed. and so I have time to explore in a good time. But Marathon is just to boring since there isn't much to do while you wait for the cities to finish production. In the course of 2 weeks I've already played around 100 hours. Only a few games can keep my attention so strong and I'm still playing! [Community]: The game features mod support. The mods are in the Main Menu. Just click on the and connect to steam workshop and there are already many mods for you to use even more time on the game! [Multiplayer]: The multiplayer is not tagged on. It has a great multiplayer. It is pretty much just like Singleplayer but just with humans! But the turns takes some time late game. You can actually turn something called "Pitboss" on. This will do so that every time it's your turn in Multiplayer it can either e-mail you or send you a steam invite. While you do other stuff! But I like the Single player more since there isn't that waiting time. But one quite annoying thing that can't really be fixed is that there will allways be a good one in a game. If you are the good one, it will really decrease the other players morale... If they have a bad time they will proberly quit or just be kind of sad/mad at you (friends) So this game is best at it's Single player. [Final Score]: 9/10

There are new buildings, soldiers and diplomatic possibilities. When you've played it for some hours you know how it works and you can use the many different tools to become the biggest civilization ever.

review: Civilization is a turn-based strategy game that is easy to learn, yet hard to master. It is quite entertaining and even a bit educational. However, the games take quite a long time to progress through. Therefore, I only recommend this title to those who have a bit of free-time on their hands and enjoy the game Risk. It should also be considered that both the DLC's for this game ("Gods and Kings" and 'Brave New World") are essential for downloading most of the content found in the Steam Workshop. Both of these DLC's cost as much as the original title at $29.99 a piece or you can purchase the "Sid Meier's Civilization V Complete Edition" which includes both DLC's as well as various other small tid bits of extra content at a much more reasonable price. I personally have had A TON of fun playing Civilization V and although turned off by the high prices of the game's DLC compared to the quantity of content contained in the content (this statement is particularly aimed at "Brave New World"), I still have recommended it to all of my friends. Plainly, this game has infinite replayability and is very entertaining for those who enjoy turned based strategy.

review: I highly recommend this game. The graphics are awesome and the gameplay is so open that you can run any civ how you want (although some strategies are more effective than others with certain factions). The game allows for so much variation between individual games and you will never play the same match twice because of random starting points and different civs that you face.

review: Literally the best gaming experience for those with any appreciation for history. This game gives you the ability to rewrite the history of a new world, possesing an industrious nation state/classical empire of your choice. You have the ability to persue a victory in cultural supremacy, scientific achievement, diplomatic popularity, raw conquest, or a tally of points at the end of the year 2050 AD. Every civilizations' unique abilities, units, buildings, or tile improvements correlate accurately to history, and the way that civilization gained power in our world usually ends up it's strong suit in the alternate multiverse created with each game of civilization 5. 10/10 by far worth anyone's time.

review: Speaking from the perspective of someone who's never played the earlier Civilization games here. The stories about Civ 5 being a great time sink are incredibly true, but I find myself somewhat hard pressed to start up a new game after sinking a lot of time into my first game. Just don't expect to be able to please everybody, and don't expect to be able to do all there is to do in a single campaign, and you should do just fine.

review: Civilization has been one of my favourite games since 1994. I've spent hundreds of hours with Civilization 1, which for me was much better than sequels, I never quite liked the way 2, 3 or 4 were made. But 5 is different, and for me it's a worthy successor of Civ1. With God&Kings and A Brave New World expansions, it's tons of fun to play.

review: Civ has got to be one of the best strategy games I've ever tried. Turn-based and played on a hexagonal field, a bit like a board game, but the special rules in Civ make you think twice before doing anything. One part of the game that I love is how you get to control every little aspect of your Civ; from research and military, to social policies (Communism!) and construction. Another great thing is that there is a BIG selection of different Civs, each with their own unique units and/or buildings and traits, from across time to choose from; such as 18th century America, 1st century Rome, 9th century Denmark, and many more, with another chunk being added with the Gods and Kings expac, such as 17th century Sweden. Also has a f*cking great soundtrack. My conclusion: if you are into other turn-based strategy games, such as Total War, but want en exciting twist, try Civilization 5.

review: Amazing Grand Strategy game with massive replayability. Every match plays out differently,and there is no ultimate strategy that works every time. Your strategies will develop over the course of the (long) matches,depending on many different factors,including the behaviour and expansion of the other Civilizations and the traits of both yours and the other Civs, the resources you have available to you, the layout of the world, the advancements in Science... Everything that happens in a match will make you think, reconsider and plan. One very important thing to note is the AI. Without the first expansion, Gods and Kings, the AI is lackluster and often reacts in odd or illogical ways. Both the Dlcs also add a lot of further tactical depth to the game,so if you plan on buying the game,I would definetely recommend that you grab at least Gods and Kings too. The Civilization and Scenario Dlcs can be skipped, but Gods and Kings is almost a requirement as it "fixes"/improves the AI significantly and also adds several new elements into the game. A brave new world adds even more tactical depth and decisionmaking that will shape how the rest of a match plays out, and improves trading,economy,the culture system/victory and diplomacy,and also changes the way a lot of the basic Civilizations work.

review: Perhaps the best RTS I've ever played and I've played a heck of a lot of 'em. There is no end to the playability that is presented in Civ V. The game is beautiful, as well as challenging and will provide many, many, many hours of gameplay. There are an almost absurd number of factions to choose from, all of them with their own specialties that utilize different playstyles as well as multiple ways to win games, granting almost endless replayability. Perhaps one game, you'd play as Japan and establish an autocratic government, who will win by global domination. Perhaps another time you'll take a shot as America and create democracy, winning the game by becoming the democratic world leader. But if you're feeling really kooky; why not play as the Spartans, establish a scientific society and master space flight? Regardless of how crazy you want it, you can probably do it. It's all up to you. Ever since Alpha Centauri for the ye olde PC, I have always enjoyed a good Sid Meier's game, because there are no other games like these that are as intriquate, difficult, interesting or fun. This game just WORKS, where so many others end up being clunky and poorly designed. If you're into RTS games, want to experience something incredible and you have the patience to endure games that can last multiple hours, pick this up, you won't regret it at all. I won't, however, suggest this to people with a short attention span and/or a lack of patience. You won't enjoy it.

review: A very addictive game. Countless hours of (re)playability. The Gods & Kings, as well as Brave New World, expansion packs add so much good stuff, it is strange that some people don't have this game yet. As you can see from the amount of hours played, you will not be disappointed when you buy it. Only gripe is that if you play with friends against the CPU in multiplayer, the AI is very stale. Furthermore Mods are not enabled for multiplayer, although they are for single player though (and Irecommend the European and World maps made by the community with true placement). Buy it and prepare for hours and hours of fun gameplay!

review: This is my favorite Civilization yet. It's beautiful, fluid, and still retains the "just one more turn" addictiveness the series is known for. The music is outstanding as well, with themes written for each country that shift and change as you progress through the game. The new tactical warfare really makes a difference too; gone are the stacks of doom from previous games. It's a meat and potatoes tactical addition that really sets this iteration apart from previous games IMO. It's a must-own for fans of the series or turn-based strategy in general.

review: You assume the role of one of many great european/asian leaders to your ultimate goal. There is one goal only and that is to eradicate minorities with different means of said 'eradicating'. You may pursue four different paths. You can dominate the sandpeople with your highly advanced weapons. You mayshow them that european/asian culture is supreme. You can trick these fellows into letting you lead the world, trough diplomacy. Or the most logical, trough science. They only live in huts, right? Buy this game if you enjoy bashing minorites, making fun of religion (create your own by using existing religious symbols and then rename it, hilarity ensures) and use nukes. 11/10 like Age of Empires with guns

This is a really good alternative to shooters if youre willing to think and plan, connive and weasel.

review: Civilization V is one of those few games that is enjoyable whether you're playing alone, with friends, with people you don't know or even passing it around with people at your house, it's just a fun game. The amount of different scenarios that can happen is infinite, and as you progress you have this feeling of being a world leader, which is very satisfying and is something I have never seen delivered successfully in a game. You can be what you want, whether it be a nuclear war-lord, or a peace-seeking nation the game is always fun. You can choose to start at the beginning of Civilization, and a huge selection of different iconic eras such as the Medieval, Renessance, Ancient, etc. or you can even start in modern times, or in the future to come. Every game you play lays down new options of how you want to go about doing things, keeping it fresh and fun. A great investment.

It's hands down the most realistic simulation game since Fez II so it was basically real life.

review: Really great game! One of the very best turn-based strategy games. The only problem I myself have is that the AI is attacking me out of no-where and its not possible to make a no-aggression packt. (it'd be great, tho.) However, really enjoyable game with lots of thinking. (Normal Civ V - no DLC's or addons.)

review: When Superstorm told me to get Civ V, I didn't think it was an invitaion to become and all-powerful god. This strategy game provides the experience of becoming an influential, powerful leader from history. You can declare war, trade, conquer, and make powerful allies. One con is that it's really upsetting to lose a game after you've worked really hard, so if you're new to Civ V prepare for the worst. overall, this game was exciting, interesting, thrilling, and has amazing graphics. 9/10.

review: I enjoy playing this game because I like the idea of being able to develop technologies and advance through the eras. I also enjoy attacking enemy units but find it annoying when I usually lose the battles even with the advantage. Overall, I think that it is a pretty good turn based strategy game.

review: Do you enjoy not bathing, having cancer, or fighting over the city of "Buttfart" for hours with your friends? If you answered yes to any of these questions or if you really enjoy crying yourself to sleep in a hot sweat of frustration and disapointment, then this game is for you! This game is great, it has caused me to permanently damage my mouse AND my self esteem during the countless temper tantrums that this game promoted! I was meant to be the supreme leader of a great nation but instead I sat and watched the glorious cities of Buttfart, Fatnut, and Dickblood get defiled by the Japanese. Sid Meier is a sick man and so was Ghandi.

review: Civ V is an incredibly addicting game, with solid diplomatic and military fighting dynamics, along with excellent visuals and simple menus. Be warned, though, that the AIs seem to be the largest s when it comes to asking for gold and when making dead. I'M LOOKING AT YOU, CHINA! Anyways, it's a great game if you enjoy strategy.

review: Addictive. Watch your afternoon turn into the evening while trying to survive the world stage! The DLC is a must as it completely revolutionizes the game. Sad about the Mac version not having mod support unless you get tricky with the files, but even then it causes instability. Still glad to have it on both devices.

review: It is just so satisfying seeing your city go from a small cottage to a city complete with walls, farms, mines, skyscrapers, and opponents and other disgraces challenging your empire. BTW Sparta has been changed to Rainierville so now on it will be "THIS IS RAINIERVILLE!" ;P Amaze other emipres with your technology, military power, resources, and yur D. Ummm take the last part out. Completely diminish your neighboring empires or betray them. Your military is up for seiges and nailbiting battles for supremacy. Once you take over an empire its hard to stop and i find myself making war plans on who to attack first. When your armies surround a city and you know your enemy is all but done for its hard not to smile. Rewrite history making the Zulu Empire bigger and stop the spreading of the British. Team up with Native American factions and stop the Seven Years War from ever existing. One last thing. The soundtrack has me occasionally jumping out of my seat and dancing BEWARE. Final Verdict: 8/10

review: Single player is fun, I have been playing it a lot the past week and even though I feel like I still don't get everything I don't have to in order for it to be fun. After getting a really good deal for the game and all existing DLC, I feel like I haven't even scratched the surface in things I can do. Only major complaint I have is that players online suck. Not as players, though they will mostly pick "overpowered civs" to try to compensate for something... No... as people they do. They will quit the first time something doesn't go their way (lose units to barbarians cause they are being dumb, lose out on a world wonder they were building, etc) to the point where you are playing against all AI before you can even build up an army to face the other civs. That takes all the fun out of trying to play online.

review: Lots of land to explore, lots of different civilizations to play and ways to improve your growing kingdom. This game does take a bit of time to play, but it is rewarding for all the hours you put into it. This was the first Civilization game I played and it taught me some things in history that I didn't know. With all the content put into this game (Now including DLC Brave New World and Mods) this game should keep you busy for quite a while.

review: The biggest problem with Civ. 5, is that the game is borderline bland and boring without any of the incredible DLC. Though with all of those(which if you buy on a Steam sale wont be to pricy)put together, you get a beautifully crafted turn-based trategy game that demands hundreds of hours to be put into and always lets the player find something new when they play it. It also very easily teaches the player to play, with difficulty levels going from very beginner to experienced master Civilization 5 is a wonder of a game that demands attention.

review: Very amazing game.Online could use some work and i feel like you have to buy the dlc to get into a online game sometimes but its really fun when your in one.One of the best Strategy games i have ever played.Its not like Total war though,their is a strategy to military units and how you use them and place them but its not complex or anything.Its mostly about growing your civilization and becoming number 1 through military,diplomicy,science,or cultural.Each civilization has its own "perks" and had advantages.For example,japan military units fight at full strength even when damged or russia gains double the amount of strategic resources when harvested. Its also very cool to see time go by and how your civlization changes especially in the modern age.When you get really far in the game you even get to nucular weapons which is when it gets really crazy and the space age etc. If you get gods and kings,which i highly recemend also,it adds religion and the modern age is split it to more ages and last allot longer which is a good thing.You also have vast game options for what you want your game like,you can decide if theirs barbs,how many city states,what type of map you want to play on (Around 25 or so map types.Example:pangea,continents,small continents,islands,europe, etc.)you can set at the pace of the game to make it go faster like building and learning stuff faster,you can set turn timers for online games,set the age of planet,amount of resources on map,and allot more crazy stuff like sea level and more! Anyone who is a fan of strategy games,this is a MUST buy.Though its not perfect,military i feel like could have more strategy but theirs enough to make it competive and to where you can beat a civilization with a much stronger military if you have good unit placement and where you maek them attack etc.Without gods and kings some civilizations are a little overpowerd like france and ai can be s sometimes which is why i play online.Overall this game is great and one of the best strategy games i have ever played,better than total war in my opinion.

review: If you like long drawn-out strategy games and building things, then this is the perfect game for you. The biggest difference of Civ V with its predecessors is immersion. When playing Civ V, it's very easy to become emotionally attached to your civilization. Be ware, however, that Civ V is long and drawn out, even on quick mode. A full-scale game can often last weeks and even months, and it's difficult to keep your body alive while partcipating in a game of Civ V.

review: What can I say about Civilization V... I am not a big fan of the strategy genre, yet this game has that charm, which makes me play it, makes me interested on how my civilization will live on. The game is really slow-paced, yet the time really flies playing it. Graphics are pretty good, considering it's a strategy game. This game pretty much never gets repetitive, everytime you can start differently, and win differently. Only thing I dislike- 1 leader for entire civilization in ages. It kinda doesn't make sense to me, because the same leader living thousands of years... It's weird. Because of that, I'd rate this game a solid 9.5/10, I highly suggest you buy it.

While this is true, man gains nothing from this other than an erection, dirty tissues and a hard to explain smell on his . Purchasing this game is not only a visual pleasure for your brain. It helps you understand that 10 hours in a chair can really mean something. Your wife or significant other may leave you due to the new smell that has appeared.

review: One of my favorite games ever. Civ V features such great variety that you can play for 600 hours (like I have) and it still feels fresh. The game is well rounded and each of the victory options is obtainable in an enjoyable fashion. Each Civ for the most part feels different, and most are tailored to a specific victory type. The AI is strong and on higher difficulties very capable of beating you, however its through boosts not skill.

It has enormous depth, gold edition, including science, economy, happiness, combat and so on. The game is fun singleplayer, but online with others, preferablly 3 or more, it becomes one of the best of all time. Nothing is more satisfying than leading your people to a glorious victory, by conquering others in the process or researching the most of the world.

review: As someone who was never big on turn-based strategy games before I played this, I can honestly say this is probably the best strategy games i have EVER played, the mechanics synergise so well together, and whether working together or against each other, you can have an amazing amount of fun with your friends on this. Buy it for the love of of all that is good and pure.

review: Remember the good ol' days of playing Age of Empires for hours on end, and still barely scratching the surface? Well now imagine that you do the same thing but you haven't even seen the surface yet. Civ V is one of the best, and in-depth, strategy games I've played. It's a classic example of "Oh I'll just play for an hour or so" and the next thing you know the sun is rising and you've been up all night declaring war and toppling empires. Highly addictive, enormous fun, and multiplayer is brilliant, even locally. This game is worth whatever the price tag says.

review: Civilization V is where you come to pour tons and tons of important hours of you life into an amzing game. It's worth it I promise. This is basically a electronic boardgame about the revolution of civilizations. You can play as any world leaders or your own character, and develop through time goes. Each turn equals to a year. And this game is very interesting, you can either be a warmonger and claim all the land or be friends with everyone and be very kind and work deep into politics. Declare war and trade all day and build until you fly into space itself. Civ V is a good game. So just buy it already. 9/10

review: Spectacularly fun, ridiculously addicting - you should just get the "Brave New World" expansion to start out with; the original and 1st expansion (Gods and Kings) still left the game a bit crippled with frustratingly random AI behavior, but the gameplay feels very solid and complete now. HUGE time sink :D

review: This game is the best game ever made! Chose what sort of game style you want to have, diplomatic, trade or use brute force, to gain control over the world. This game i came back to many times. It comes many new games, to to try out. But if you buy this game you have a game that you always will come back too. If you are new to this sort of games, just play it on a easy difficulty, and you be just fine. This game gets new DLC all the time, and its community, build new maps, challanges for you to try out. Its always something new to come back too. Build an army of warriors, or convert the world to you're religion to get the upper hand. Its the best game here on steam.

review: THE best strategy games/series... One of the best games. Will keep you entertained for hundreds of hours. Puts the best of military strategy together with things like cultural and technological strategy and adds diplomacy (a little lacking but game play makes up for it) to create one of, if not the, best games I have ever played. The internal improvements, such as wonders and buildings, and choosing how to shape your civilization towards a certain victory condition even adds to the strategy. Throw in the GOTY edition, along with G&K and BNW and you have a highly developed and emerged strategy game that will give you thousands of hours of entertainment. Each civilization gives you a completely different experience and there are hundreds upon hundreds of combinations you can try. The DLC may get a little pricey, and the AI has some issues, but it is still, by far, one of my favorite games.

Endless hours of fun, and I had put a decent amount of time into the game before I ventured into learning micromanagement of cities. That opened up a whole new facet to the game that showed how versatile and fun it can be. The only downside to the game is the AI crunch time in between turns and the lag with multiplayer.

I know a lot of the hardcore players mourn the loss of the unit stack, but I prefer the one unit per tile style, even if the implementation has a few issues. With so many difficulty options, I recommend this to just about anyone. Start on the easy difficulty and work your way up. I'm still missing a win on the absolute top difficulty, but I'll get it eventually!

review: Civilization series were always the most addicting, difficult and rewarding games ever. Civilization 5, alone or with Gods and Kings & Brave New World is the most time consuming devil that posses your time and will never give it back. Although your only way to resist is to click NEXT TURN and bring glory to your civilization. Most complex game with many victory types, strategies, difficulty levels (from easiest for even strategy noobies to most experienced generales who were raised with RTS by their sides), units, resources, everything... This game has everything that us - 'nerds' love. And you can read a book in one time while playing on Huge map around Atomic Era :D

With plenty of modding capabilities, the possibilities for this game are endless. This game overs a great variety even without mods too! Will you be a kind and benevolent leader, or a merciless tyrant? Will you be a religious fanatic, or a rational heretic? Will you pull the World into Nuclear Conflict, or make World Peace? Will you stomp upon those weaker than you, or will you make allies and fight the neverending war machine? WIll you build a nation, that will stand the test of time?

review: The best strategy game ever created! It is extremely fun and interesting, you will find yourself playing it for hours! The possibilities are endless in Civ 5. It is beginner-friendly as there is a bunch of hints and information that the game provides you as you play. Setting up a game is easy, there are also many options you can tweak to make your world what you want it to be. The DLC for this game is awesome and it adds even more variety to this game. Steam Workshop also adds mods to this game that you can download and have even more fun exploring Civ 5. Make your civilization grow from the ancient era to the future! You will find yourself addicted and going to the next turn and then the next turn. Multiplayer with your friends is very fun and you can team up! Overall, this game is worth it and I recommend Civ 5 to everyone!

A huge selection of Civilizations to choose from, all with their own perks and specials. Game mechanics make sense to the idea of the game - To lead a Civilization throughout history. Better yet, like many steam games, the workshop for this game is great. Makes it just that much more replayable.

review: This game when it came out back in 2010 I went out immediately to buy it from Gamestop because I wanted a hard copy, since it's release they have added great DLC and we can expect more in the future. One of my favorite turn based strategies. Just like I would recommend before making any purchasing of a game watch a video on YouTube and get an idea if you would like to play what you're seeing in the video. I would recommend this game to really anyone it's just a great time wether you're just playing singleplayer or multiplayer.

review: Civilization series has always been pretty much my favourite game series of all. If asked what my definite favourite one in the series would be, I'd say Civilization V. The fourth one was a big departure from the original Civ mechanics, and while V retains many features from IV, it sort of goes a step back towards its roots, which I appreciate. Basic formula of the game is the same as always, but V refines it to near perfection. Turns are fast to play, armies aren't ridiculously big, there are many actually viable ways toward victory etc. Two biggest changes here are the fact that the game is played in hexes now and that military units cannot stack in the same hex anymore, making maneuvering of armies a bit more tricky, but much more intriguing. Add to that ranged units that can shoot farther, but cannot capture cities, generals that give bonuses to nearby units, air units and leveling of units and you have yourself a delicious tactical conundrum on your hands.

review: If you buy Sid Meier's Dice roller V, you'll often find yourself saying,"Wow, what a great game of dice rolling." If you love dice and want to put a skin on your dice then this is the game for you. A plethora of different situations to roll dice in and an impressive number of civs and units to roll dice as. I'll give this handfull of dice an 8/10. -eel

review: This is the latest incarnation of the Civilization series. Pick your ruler, build your cities, expand your borders and prepare for war. The game can be long and involved (about 30 hours to complete on the largest maps), but provides a lot of variety due to the different leaders available and the many ways one can use to win the game (culture, war, a vote in the UN, or via science).

And when the time comes, you could fight with all the opposing empires once you have built your army. It was surprising how each country had different looking military, this game is unique and fun! Definitely recommend worth your $30, go check it out it's awesome and epic and is the best strategy game i've ever come across in my life. Not even exaggerating, this game is so beautiful and just EPIC GO FOR IT

It is a little simpler to manage your empire, city-states are a great addition, and the new combat system requires a bit more skill (no more unit stacking). If you have played the older versions, you'll love 5... and if you haven't, I would probably recommend started with 5 over 4 :)

review: Civ 5 is a game that is as deep or shallow as you want to make it. At it most basic, you build your city up and attempt to be the worlds number 1 super power through military, culture/religion or science. This is really easy to get into and eventually youll be managing cities individually, and assigning special people how you see fit, knowing which techs are absoulte needs (writing, civil service) useful monuments (Great Library). The game has two expansions (Brave New World / Gods and Kings) they enchance the game greatly polishing off to make it the best 4x stragtey game on the market. This isnt to say civ5 isnt without its faults. Harder difficulties arent really more difficult, the AI just starts out more technologicly advanced and thats not really a greater challenge. As you pretty much have to rush certain techs and wonders to have a chance. I persoanlly dislike city states, they never really develop into anyhting intresting other than "side quests" to sell resouces too and save from barbies, sure you can win the game by befriending them, but most likely you just want to conquer them. My problem with the victory conditions are its possible to win while trying to get all 3. Its not uncommon to be working on a culture / science victory while going for military and the science happens first. But these are mostly minor details as completeing full games takes a long time depending on your time setting and youll always be saying "one more turn."

review: Want a strategy game that's not too compex? I'd say Civ V fits the mold. You essentially face off against AI or human players to become the best real world nation/empire in a made up, earthlike planet. Scenarios such as the Mongols developing cultural superiority, Swedes conquering the world, and the Mayans sending the first man to the moon can happen, all of which resulting in victory for that civilization. Compared to other strategy games, Civ V may not have as much depth as other strategy games (including Civ IV), and there are many features that could be added or improved upon, but that's not to say that it's a mindless game. You need to manage your cities and armies and your empire overall well if you wish to win. I've spent hours upon hours playing this game and it still sparks my interests. If you do buy Civ V, I'd suggest buying the gold edition on sale. The game itself plus all of the DLC that goes with it is expensive, but I've seen the gold edition, which has all but one piece of the game's DLC, go on sale for about $12. If you see that deal and you like strategy games that aren't too complex, then take it.

review: The next installation in Sid Meier's Civilization series of games, Civilization V is a wonderful turn-based strategy game in which players can forge the history of an earth-like world as they rule it. Augustus Caesar may declare war on George Washington, Catherine the Great may find that her cities are being bombed by Mahatma Gandhi. Initially met with some criticism over how it plays in comparison to its numerical predecessor, Civilization IV, Civ V is still an excellent game that is improved immensely by its DLC. Please note that anyone buying DLC may be better off buying ONLY Brave New World rather than Brave New World AND Gods and Kings, as Brave New World adds everything added in Gods and Kings save for a few Civilizations. If you enjoy Turn Based Strategy games with a focus on decisive victories through conquest, culture, diplomacy, or science, you certainly can not go wrong with Civilization V.

review: I don't really like turn based games, but this game is differnent and I love the way there are progression trees for both policies and tech, thus maximizing possibilites for each player in the game. The multiple victory conditions are also good as they variate how people play the game so it is not repetitive and not everyone has the same goals. There are plenty of Civilizations to choose from ranging from England to even civilizations like the Zulu. Unfortunatly I find multiplayer can be a bit poor because the games can last a long time and people like to quit, I find this makes it best to play with your friends as you can save game and continue with them later.

review: This is one of my all time favorite games. However, (please observe this warning) this game is like crack. if you have something you have to do in the next couple hours like sleep, work, take care of a child, really anything that requires you to have some track of what time it is DO NOT START A GAME! Personal example and reason I'm in the dog house: Came home after work around 10pm kissed the wife ate dinner decide to play a little civ v around 1030pm. Wife went to bed I started playing. Lost track of time and became extremely engrossed in the game, the progression of my civilization, which technology I should research next, Ghandi just nuked me so now I must exact revenge, Ghandi is gone now who is next on my list. Next thing I know my wife comes in the room and says "ARE YOU REALLY STILL PLAYING! THE KID WILL BE AWAKE IN 2 HOURS AND YOU HAVE TO GO TO WORK IN 6 HOURS! WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH YOU!" My first reaction was there is no way I've been playing for 7 hours! I checked the time and sure enough it had gotten way out of hand. Just remember to keep a clock somewhere nearby and within view if you are planning on playing this game!

review: Civilization V is a great game but with out the DLCs is a unfinished game that may disappointfans coming from civ IV. But of course with the DLC it turned this unfinished game into a spectacular experiance that any Civilization fan should have. It has a dumbed down UI from Civ IV but thats what all the games are doing so you gotta deal with it. The main point is you have to get the DLC to see the full potential of this game or else you may be left unsatisified with the gameplay. Pros: -Good gameplay on single and multi -Easy to UI for new players -Great DlCs that are worth the $30.00 -Constant replayebility -Great community content on workshop and easy to use map editor Cons: -Dumb and random AI behaviour -Multiplayer session lag and disconnect oftan making it sometimes unplayable -To easy to play in even the hardest modes - Not enough stratigic resources 8.5/10 "Get this game Civilization fans!!!"

review: I've been playing Civ since Microprose's first game. Boy, since the second one, Civ V is the most inovative yet loyal to original game general dinamics. Purists will initially dislike the abundance (or mere existence) of City-States, but once you start playing you'll see they contribute enormously to the game balance and a more dynamic early game stage. If wou like Turn Base Strategy games, Civilization V is mandatory.

review: 53 Hours in to the game and I am still loving it... Civilization V is my first game in the Civilization series and now that I got it I don't Understand why I never played the others. You start the game off with one group of settlers and a warrior to protect them, from there you start building your civilization. It's not like other strategy games where you literally build every single building, the map is devided into Hexagonal tiles with different resources, all you have to do is build your settlement and from there on expand to the surrounding tiles, as you play you unlock new buildings to upgrade your settlements, you can found new settlements as freely as you like but you always run risk of attack so make sure you have the proper amount of troops to protect those new found bottom feeding settlements of yours. There are 5 ways to win the game: Domination victory, Science victory, Cultural victory, Diplomatic victory or a Score Victory. But this means there are 5 ways for you to get beaten as well so you will need to not only keep an eye on your own civilization but your enemy's aswell, and know exactly when it's time to attack or ally up. If you get tired of the standard game check out the scenarios, that is where the real fun begins, with scenario's that actually happened like the Boers vs the Zulu's in Africa, the Mayan's who feared the end of the world and all the troubles they faced like the french invading them with weapons they have never even seen before in their lives, the scenario's have it all. And if that's not enough, Civilization V supports the steam workshop so there are endless mods for you to choose from to spice your game up even more. The game is very easy to learn with the help of your advisers who even though they can be pretty annoying sometimes, make sure you know what you are doing and what the Consequences will be if you take a certain action. They will take good care of you. My Rating 9/10 - (-1 the game sometimes feels like it's taking forever to finish, but there are settings to change the game speed which will sort this out for you, but I found that on Standard settings the game takes forever and on quick settings you can't help but feel extremely rushed. It would have been nice to have something in between. ) BUY THIS GAME!!! IT'S AMAZING

review: This game is one of the best I've ever played. It's a deep simulation game that is good to play in both single player and multiplayer. I'd definately recommend this to any strategy fan that has somehow missed this. (I think that this with BNW is better than Civ IV, but Civ IV is good too.)

review: I love it. It's an easy-to-use turn-based strategy game that changes each time you play. Each update is an attempt to balance civilizations, which is good. It also has a lot of distance between each new iteration; Civilization IV was years and years ago, so it's not like they're pumping out low-quality products for a quick buck. My complaints are that this new game put features of the old game into DLC, like religion. It's also completely eliminated corporations (though a new take on it comes along in Brave New World). Overall, it's a good game, but get the bundle at a discount.

If you had a depressing child hood being a russian orphan who ended up dreaming about world domination in the form of shoving your  into all kinds of things that may or may not involve pointy objects and diplomacy. You will love this game.

You decide how your empire grows, will it make war or diplomatic influence. Fight with barbarians and other countries, explore the world, gain resources so your name will be carved in stone for eternity. Strategic balance of battles, smart AI, lot of leaders to choose. At the end you want to make "Jest... One... More... Turn..."

review: A very,very fun strategy game. You can start out from the ancient era and gradually move up to the mysteries of the future era. This game will surely get you addicited, not to mention it's multiplayer however one thing that puts me abit down on the multiplayer is the no animation effect and sometimes the netcode but it's not unplayable. In terms of graphics, it has been extremly improved since Civilization IV, I'd say a decent rig should be able to run this game maxed mid-range gpu to high-end.

review: "Ok, now I just need to get my religion enhanced and then I'll have enough money to wage war. Wait. Why are all those Jaguars on the borders? DAMMIT MONTEZUMA, YOU MIGHT NOT THINK IT'S BACKSTABBING, BUT YOU JUST CAN'T BE FRIENDS WITH ME AND THEN ATTACK. Dammit, China hates me, and Ghandi never wants to go to war. MEN! GET TO THAT DESERT AND STOP THE AZTECS! THEY MAY HAVE NUMBERS, BUT WE HAVE IRON!" I got this game for free when I got XCOM, and I wasn't sure I'd like it. Turns out I had the wrong idea of it, and thought it was an RTS. It's not. It's a TBS board-game of sorts. Also, there is no other game where the Aztecs, the Celts, Ancient Egypt, modern India, and George Washington (who kinda looks and sounds like Bill Clinton, go figure) can both live on the same continent at the same time and actually get along until ING MONTEZUMA GOES APESHIT, THE CRAZY . It's fun. And it will eat your life. But dammit, it's fun. :D

review: Probably one of the most intricate and long going series I have had the pleasure to enjoy. From the start, the game may seem dull as a turn based strategy game, but in reality, as the game progresses, it shows that it has so much more to offer than another "Rock Paper Scissors" strategy game. With elements such as international politics, a growing economy and a range of technological pursuits, the true value of this game lies in its replayability and potential gameplay styles. With that said, it can be a slow paced game, which isn't for everyone, though I have hardly had more fun with my friends over a few drinks. A fully reccomended game for anyone who likes strategy games, and more so if you enjoy watching the asension and decline of humanity through its many civilisations. -Keon

review: Sonic Adventure is the final digital installment of the Sonic The Hedghog series for the Sega Dreamcast. Despite foiling Robotnick countless times, Sonic is in way over his head this time as a mysterious demon beast threatens humanity. He must team up with some old favorites and some new unlikely heroes to save his wild world from total devastation. Before you getting excited you might wanna pump the brakes. This game is kind of a dud sad to say. The best part is when you fish with one of the Cadillac Cats. Otherwise you got a janky platformer due to Sonic Team's inability to translate Sonic buttery smooth style to the 3rd dimension. Worst of all, the whole game takes place in some outdoor mall with real humans. If you stay next to one long enough they will give you a piece of kibble and a pat on the head. There weren't many worse ways to end the 90s than to play this game while listening to Jimmie's Chicken Shack. I didn't know no better. Me know better now. Not the adventure I was looking for. Thanks Sonic, you nitwit.

review: You start a game. "I'll play for about an hour, then go do something else." Then you start you empire, you research mining, horseback riding, all that good stuff. You found another city or two, and make allies with Russia and Germany. You notice an hour has passed, but you're just about to finish building the Pyramids. "I'll just play another turn or two." The moment you finish the Pyramids, Russia denounces you for finishing them right before she did. "Maybe I'll play for a few more turns, just to see how this plays out." And before you know it, it's 3 AM, you haven't eaten in 12 hours, and nothing you wanted to do today gets done. TY SID MEIER. BUMP.

review: 10/10 Civ V is, hands down, one of the best PC games I've ever played. I've never experienced vanilla Civ V, but I've put in a lot of time into Gods and Kings, which was pretty fun (a little slow at times with not as much micromanaging), and Brave New World, which gave the game, to me, a lot more playability (added quite a few new features which I enjoy thoroughly), especially due to the amount of gold it allows to be accumulated. I definitely recommend getting both of the DLC for this game, as each adds a little more that brings it closer to perfection. My only complaint is that it can still get pretty slow, but it's hardly a deterrent from loving this game. Add a bit more micromanaging, and it's golden.

review: Well made game with a mostly intuitive interface and great game mechanics. Some minor glitches that can be resolved with mods and it just feels so satisfying taking over another civilization and claiming the continent to yourself! Also the interaction between leaders adds an interesting perspective and convinces you that these are real civilizations you are blowing up with your giant death robots.

review: At first I was not wholly impressed with this installment in the famed Civilization V franchise. I thought the new hexagonal tiles and inability to stack units really restricted the game dynamic... but as it turns out, these changes, as well as graphical updates, are what makes Civilization V even better than its predecessors. In Civilization IV, you could stack units on top of units on top of units. Often combat strength was dictated by the amount of time and resources you put into building so many units. Now you can only have one unit per tile, and you can't even have units walk over each other. This makes the game much more strategy based, and this works especially well in multiplayer. The hexagonal tiles also make for much less blocky world generation and more countour. Overall, I love with this installment of Civilization. I would much rather play Civ V than Civ IV, which is good because Civ IV doesn't work on my computer anymore.

Multiplayer gameplay is amazing, especially with expansion packs enabled, however, make sure you (and your partner/s) have a stable internet connection, as the game may have a tendancy to drop mid-way through. There are many Mods available for this game and I adivse you all to check them out. I am an avid fan of Sid Meier and cannot wat to see what they come out with next. Definately recommended.

Difficulty levels go from 1(tutorial level difficulty here) to 9(I barely won a single game at 5), so anyone can find their sweet spot. If you do not have any interest in history I can almsot guarentee that this game will change that. So many quotes by famous people in history, many leaders and civs to choose from, units go from men with stones tied to stick to the kind of warfare we have now (with a single unit that goes beyond), multiple ways to win...there is a ludicrious amount of content in this game. If you are ANY sort of fan of history or strategy games or simply just good games, you will get a lot of enjoyment out of this.

review: I'm going to get right to the point right now. Civilization V, with Gods and Kings and Brave New World, might just be one of the best PC games I've ever played. The potential for in-game experiences are limitless, and the amount of customization is greatly welcomed, which goes from individual unit names to complete civilization mods. In addition to that are the scenarios, which also have multiple ways to win, as you rewrite history, or complete it again. Gameplay wise, the AI has gotten much better with the DLC. On the vanilla verson of this game, there is room for improvement in quite a few aspects (which, for the most part as far as I know, have been fixed with the DLCs). While this may not be a big problem for players new to the Civ series, for those who have been into Civilization for a while may be disapointed with the basic version of this game. However, if you are willing to get the DLC, the game is absolutely spectacular. In other words: New players should have no issues with the game, but some more experienced players might be upset with the vanilla version. With the DLC, this game is one of the best out there, but the vanilla Civ V, along with Gods & Kings and Brave New World is $90 in all, so if you want the best experience (IMO), I would slowly get the DLCs until you are all caught up, or you are satisfied. As for fun value, I would say this is the best purchase on Steam that I have made. 500 hours well spent, and hopefully many more. The game is as challenging as you want it to be, but regardless, you WILL find yourself going for just....one....more....turn. You might lose a bit of your social life, and find that you just used up 8 hours when you thought it was only 2-3 hours. But damn it, at least it was fun. Overall, with out a doubt, I would recommend it.

review: One of the all time best turn-based strategy games, everything that made IV great plus much needed improvements to graphics and game mechanics.

review: I can deffinitly recommend this game to all strategy game lovers, If anyone ever played any of the earlier civilization games, you should not expect it to be too much like the older ones. Yet even though stuff has been changed or even taken away, that is more than outweighed by new additions, extremely well done graphics, the new soundtracks, and the new combat system.

If you ever wanted to Nuke Ghandi, backstab Boudicca, and setup trade agreements with Geroge Washington all in the same turn, this is your game. If you ever wanted to invade Rome with a mix of spearman and tanks, well you're stupid, but buy this game. If you haven't bought this game, buy this game.

review: The king of round-based strategy games Suited for beginners and experts this game offers hundreds of hours of empire-building, diplomacy and war. Brave New World is strongly recommended, as it adds a lot of fun features. Civ5 also supports mods, but only in singleplayer. 9/10

review: This game really drove the Sid Meier experiance home. Sometimes whille playing I really did feel like I was becoming Sid Meier. It's hands down the most realistic simulation game since Fez II so it was basically real life. At some points of game play I literally thought my name was Sid Meier, so that means the graphics in the game look so real that it makes you feel like you're in real life...for real. Thats why I give this game: 8 cans of Mountain Dew / 3 Family sized bags of Doritos. Graphics:Real Life Gameplay:1 Commentary:63 Directors Cut:9.9999999 Story: Dank/10 Verdict:Yea

review: Still one of the top turn based strategy games of all time. Every revision has it's own merits; and though some woudl argue as to whether they have improved with each iteration, I certainly tink they have. It still has the same adicting "one more turn" aspect of all civilization games. You will spend hours and hours playing a single game.

The only problem I myself have is that the AI is attacking me out of no-where and its not possible to make a no-aggression packt. (it'd be great, tho.) However, really enjoyable game with lots of thinking. (Normal Civ V - no DLC's or addons.)

review: When Superstorm told me to get Civ V, I didn't think it was an invitaion to become and all-powerful god. This strategy game provides the experience of becoming an influential, powerful leader from history. You can declare war, trade, conquer, and make powerful allies. One con is that it's really upsetting to lose a game after you've worked really hard, so if you're new to Civ V prepare for the worst. overall, this game was exciting, interesting, thrilling, and has amazing graphics. 9/10.

review: Do you enjoy not bathing, having cancer, or fighting over the city of "Buttfart" for hours with your friends? If you answered yes to any of these questions or if you really enjoy crying yourself to sleep in a hot sweat of frustration and disapointment, then this game is for you! This game is great, it has caused me to permanently damage my mouse AND my self esteem during the countless temper tantrums that this game promoted! I was meant to be the supreme leader of a great nation but instead I sat and watched the glorious cities of Buttfart, Fatnut, and Dickblood get defiled by the Japanese. Sid Meier is a sick man and so was Ghandi.

review: Civilization V may not be the best game in the series, but to say it isn't a truly great game would be a clear falsehood. Although lacking some of complexity and difficulty of its predecessors, Civilization V is a triumph for modern strategy games and city builders alike. Starting from the most ancient eras of human time, on a randomly generated map with few user inputs, you, portrayed as one of the greatest leaders of history, and your people, will traverse through time, technological innovation and cultural expansion. Working with or competing with you are your neighboring Civilizations and, newly added to the series, 'City-States' these mini-states can be made to serve you, or your competitors in a variety of ways. The combat system of Civ games has been entirely revamped in this edition, no more stacks of doom, and much less of the, how did that medieval archer shoot down my jet fighter? Instead each unit occupies its own hex, and the battle outcomes are not only more predictable, but much more realistic. This is made even better in the Gods and Kings expansion, which revamps and balances the combat system even more so. The single player game is one of absolute self-indulgence and glee, you will trollop your foes on the lesser difficulties and construct massive and intimidatingly successful cities to crush your AI foes in whatever manner you see fit, be it through diplomacy, culture, technology or perhaps just flat out war. The game does indeed grow in challenge as you increase your difficulty, but unfortunately due to the complexity of the game, the developers were forced to sort of 'Band-Aid' the higher difficulty settings, in that rather than facing more devious opponents with advanced strategies, you have simply been handicapped, while your AI rivals have been given gifts of free technology and increased resources. There are also a variety of special scenarios (some downloadable) which place you in a specific time period or conflict; these can be quite a puzzle on the higher difficulties. The real challenge in the game for those who dare to venture is in the online and LAN multiplayer. Playing against real people adds a whole new level of difficulty, but also opportunity, competition can be fierce in some games. Luckily because of the nature of the game and the desire to play with real people instead of computers, it shouldn't be difficult to find a group of non-war like players for those still wanting to build their skills before truly experiencing PvP style play. Players drop frequently because of time constraints and games are rarely finished, which is why it is lucky that there are special modes such as 'quick speed' to allow more rapid progress. With so much variety in selection of leaders, maps, strategies, settings and more, it is easy to see how players like me could clock hundreds of hours. Expansions: Downloadable Civilizations: Almost always worth it, if only so that you may battle against them or be better able to join more games. It just adds more to the amazing international melting pot of war and conflict. Personally I find many of the DLC Civ's the most fun to play as. Extra Scenarios: These I maybe could do without, but if you love history, or are just starting out in Civ, they could be a great way to explore the game, in addition they offer special civs with unique abilities and powers not possible in regular play. Gods and Kings: Although I won't get into it too much, you're crazy if you don't get this expansion; it fixes so many issues, and adds so much to the game, namely religion. Real Civ 5 starts with this expansion. Brave new World: Firaxis has done it again, even more civilizations, more bug fixes and more customization and realism. I absolutely love this new expansion! It is the reason I am playing again, trade routes, advanced diplomacy, the world congress and more. This polishes off the game and gives it the 5 stars it deserves. Ratings: My rating for the game is at its current state, not taking into account previous issues or ones that may occur in the future, I figure my review has been written for people who are considering purchasing the game, and so I have let go of any ill will caused by issues that are now resolved. Singleplayer: 5 Multiplayer: 5 Gameplay: 5 Replayability: 5 100% Reccomend to anyone who enjoys strategy games, city builders, history buffs or political science buffs.

review: (Reviewed with Gods+Kings expansion) This game has sucked over 40 hours of my life in the last 2 weeks. It brings the "just one more turn" addiction that I felt with Civ 2 and Alpha Centauri, as well as updated gameplay and strategy. At first I didn't like the dumbed down tech tree, but it's grown on me. I have few complaints about the game--The automated city manager is adequate, alliances with the AI seem hardly useful (you hit endgame and they will backstab you. Or maybe that's just Korea's MO. in. EVERY. GAME), and it appears you can game the new combat system something fierce (I field at most 3-7 units to defend my empire, regardless of empire size). I have to admit I really enjoy the fact that CiV has finally gone hexagonal.

review: Civilization V is a solid game. Not too much more to say. It's fun to play Vanilla, with many different ways of achieving victory (Culture, Science, and Domination, for example) and no two games turn out quite the same. Then when you include mods into the equation, and you get even more playtime and fun. I recently played a match as the kingdom of Rohan on an 80x80 hex map of MIddle Earth, and man was that fun. There are also mods that add enhanced functionality, unique units, GUI tweaks, and a whole slew of other changes that serve to spice up the experience. Definitely a solid pick up. However, I'd definitely advise getting Gods and Kings with it at the very least. The Gods and Kings expansion adds a lot of content to the game that was sorely needed, and they have added even more content to it with the newest expansion Brave New World.

This game never gets old and is always fun to play.

review: Sid Meier's latest entry in the award winning Civilization series is fantastic. It allows you to rule a country however you would like, be it peacefully allying yourself with others or steamrolling them with the feet of your armies. The two expansions, although steeply priced, is a must for the full experience and i reccomend the dlc strongly. If you love 4X games and have a lot of money in gifted steam cards, than i highly reccomend considering Civilization V. However, if you couldnt put a lot of time into one saved game (a standard game could be awhile,) then you might want to look at less time intensive titles. 10/10

review: [Quick Infomation]: I'm completely new to the Civilization V series, but this title is one you should consider picking up! The game is about you taking control of a civilization. For example China. You can choose to start in the ancient age all up til the information age. You can also choose to spawn in the real world or a random map, or just build a map! [Gameplay]: The gameplay is turnbased. You do what ever you want to do in a turn. Press "Next Turn" and the AI (or if Multiplayer a human) does what ever they want. You can choose different kinds of game speeds. Quick, Standard, Epic & Marathon. The difference between the game speeds is how long Research, Production & Grow takes. But movement of units ISN'T slowed. The maps is made of Hexs. It opens up for lots of tactical opportunities. [Gameplay Time]: If you start from the ancient era, and with quick speed. You can easily expect a few hours. Unless you rush your enemies. A marathon can take multiple days. But over the course of multiple days you can get tired with your Civilization. So I do not recommend playing at this speed. I normally take Epic to have a acceptable science speed. and so I have time to explore in a good time. But Marathon is just to boring since there isn't much to do while you wait for the cities to finish production. In the course of 2 weeks I've already played around 100 hours. Only a few games can keep my attention so strong and I'm still playing! [Community]: The game features mod support. The mods are in the Main Menu. Just click on the and connect to steam workshop and there are already many mods for you to use even more time on the game! [Multiplayer]: The multiplayer is not tagged on. It has a great multiplayer. It is pretty much just like Singleplayer but just with humans! But the turns takes some time late game. You can actually turn something called "Pitboss" on. This will do so that every time it's your turn in Multiplayer it can either e-mail you or send you a steam invite. While you do other stuff! But I like the Single player more since there isn't that waiting time. But one quite annoying thing that can't really be fixed is that there will allways be a good one in a game. If you are the good one, it will really decrease the other players morale... If they have a bad time they will proberly quit or just be kind of sad/mad at you (friends) So this game is best at it's Single player. [Final Score]: 9/10

review: If you're looking for a stratagy game, you came to the right place. Civ's easy-to-learn hard-to-master controls and mechanics make it one of my favorite stratagy games. I honestly did not expect to enjoy this game as much as I have. The AI is clever and unexpected, the gameplay is fun, especially in single player, and multiplayer is... mostly stable. The game does sometimes randomly disconnect you from games, however it's not too difficult to just reconnect. Also, in multiplayer turns can go on for quite a while, especially considering some players have more to do than others, so sometimes you end up sitting around doing nothing, however this is a problem with most/all turn based games. All problems aside, it's a great stratagy game.

review: This is an addictive turn-based strategy game that will keep you at your computer for hours at at time! I always find myself saying "I'll play just one more turn, then I'll get off" then I find myself playing 15-20 more turns before I finally pull myself away. This is because there's always something interesting happening during every turn and you feel the need to take advantage of it. This game also has low specifications, so you don't need a super fast computer to play it. Fun, immersive, historical, and captivating - definitely worth the price!

An excellent game! 10/10

You will get addicted to it and want to finish the game before you do anything else. Even when you finish your first match you might want to play again. Theres no problem with that either as there different ai difficulties , randomly genrated maps and varing civs with there own special perks.Once youve mastered all of that you can try to mod the game , this game has many creative and smart players that made there own custom maps , civs or scenarios. If you have a friend thats plays the game you could play with them. If you are a stratagy game fan or just like the feeling of creating YOUR own empire and nation then this is a can not miss.

review: Very, Very fun game. Now, if you dont like AOE and Risk type games, you wont like this, if you do, you will love this. You just have to remember, its like Risk, with turns. Thats about all. Its like AOE because you have to get resources, ect,ect,ect. Its not like either of those in the ways of creating a city, attacking, trading and research. well, its kinda, a tiny tiny bit, like AOE with the research. Its like AOE with the "cant see anything" to start with...or at least, tell you get a satalite :) then its like you typed "marco" "polo" Its like Risk cuase you it takes turn, kinda like drafting, but not, its like AOE cuase you see your troops, but you have sections you can move, a amount you can move, and other things. All in all, I loved the game, Would buy it again if that meant playing it and winning...again :) Thanks!

review: this game is very realistic. The japanese first started in north america where they were at constant odds with their neigbours russia and songhai. They managed to conquer them all and set across the seas where they setteled in modern day europe where they also met geroge washington and the arabs. The arabs were very strong and conquering everyone including america so then japan libertaed america from their arab opperssors but the americans decided to invade japan with it's longswords men but they were no match against the japanese giant death robots

review: A wonderful game that inspires you to create an empire to match your personality, stratagey and Aspirations into a nation that will either live a peaceful existence and achive glory through culture, diplomacy or tourism. Or you can make the world burn and conquer the millions either way a great way to spend your day. (I prefer the nuclear fire off war). 9/10

review: Civilization V, a great improvement over Civ IV, easily the best civilization to date. Newbie freindly, great game mechanics, great graphics. One of the best improvements over the last few Civs is the implementasions of the tiles, it makes the game much more tactical and interesting. No more can we make the "Stacks of death", or just steam roll our enemies without any problems. Even though i haven't played the Civs prior to Civ IV, i still think it's the best Civ to date.

review: "RECOMMEND" 'Don't critisize until you've played it' Good overhead strategy game which involves planning and thinking ahead of the game. Graphics are fairly good for a game of this genre. There are a few bugs (mainly on multiplayer) none too noticable.. I can't go in full depth personally since I don't have a great amount of hours playing. Have Fun.

review: In the end, I got enough enjoyment out of this game to recommend it, though it still feels off and game-y - it really punishes you for doing things the wrong way, and I never really feel like I can attack anybody until civilizations have guns, when most of the appeal for me is playing as ancient empires like the Romans. But anyway, it's still worth playing.

review: Great game that can have you playing for hours upon hours without realizing how long you've been playing. Every time you play its a different situation and you have to be able to adapt to your surroundings. Each time you play you'll have a different start and you need to know when to expand or when to build an army. The Vanilla version of the game can get pretty boring pretty fast - its all that I own atm. The multiplayer mode is what makes this game even better because you can play a game with friends and you can continue whenever you want. Each civilization has its own special units/special buildings/ or special ability. Its up to you as the player to utilize your civs strong points and use them to reach one of the possible victories. From the time ive played its hard to get a diplomatic victory on Vanilla. Ive heard good things about Brave New World but no need to buy it since Civ Beyond Earth is coming out. The game can be addicting but the Vanilla gets boring after a while unless you play online. All in all 9/10 Would Recommend.

review: An excellent strategy series got even better with V's hex based maps that allow for some fun military tactics. This is the best civilization yet, as you no longer have to put together unrealistic stacks of doom all on one tile to take an enemy city. There is no one right way to play the game and after almost 500 hours I still find ways to sequence differently and change my playstyle. You can be an aggressive military powerhouse, a prosperous economic nation, a cultured nation, or even a religious one. With many routes to victory, you won't get tired of doing the same thing over and over. The base game has lots of unique leader bonuses, unique civilization units and buildings to explore, and the expansions add even more. I'd strongly recommend getting both expansions to the game as they add so much that is indispensible to the main experience. It's a game that you'll lose track of time, and 1 am will suddenly become 3 am when you promised yourself to quit after one more turn twenty turns ago.

review: I have been a huge Sid Meier's fan ever since Civ 2 and I love the Civilization Series, you can really get bored of ir and you can make your own Nations and Armies and attack others, control currency, build education, resources and much more. Very well made game. The only thing that grinds my gears when it comes it Sid Meiers is that the DLC cost so much money. The Gods and Kings DLC is $29.99 which is the cost of the whole Civilization V game itself.

You can play with friends, random people or just by yourself. There are 8 different difficulties so you can choose whether you want it to be easy or hard. There is a "campgain" so to speak that you can do. They don't follow off eachother but they're fun. So to conclude if you like strategy games I HIGHLY recommend getting Civ, lots of fun!

review: Civilization V is one of the best strategy games i have played in a long time. I played Civilization Revolution on the Xbox-360, so when I bought this game, I was not expecting what i recieved. I love the gameplay. The civilizations are well balanced, because one you learn how to manipulate a certain civilization, you can dominate any civilization after. All the DLC's are worth paying for. They add more funcions that caused the gameplay to change drasticaly. Brave New World added trade routes and that alone can change the outcome of the game. You can have a city in the middle of the desert, but have all your other cities sending it food and production, making this city able to grow and eventually be stable on its own. LOVE the game and if anyone wants to play with me, add me! If you have any questions about the game, ask away. 10/10 in all aspects

review: If you like creating an entire civilization from the ground up, this is the game for you! Just buy all the DLC/ get the gold ediion so you can enjoy every piece of it. Hopefully Fireaxis does CIV VI right and makes the game great on release, but super awesome on all expansions after that.

review: This is a really incredible game. If you like Age of Empires or Command and Conquer, chances are you'll probably love this game. It's got it's own unique twist to the RTS that makes it feel a lot like a table top game compared to other RTS titles. Also, the way the game is set up, it is easy to get into the action and become familiar with the controls and 'rules', if you will. Civilization V also has a bit more in-depth approach to other players in the world. There seems to be more interaction as compared to Age of Empires. Throw in the expansions, and you've got even more depth added to the original content (which is already immense). From founding your first town to dropping nukes on enemy civs, and from building your society how you'd like it to reading interesting quotes from history's most influential people, this game is one that I keep coming back to time and time again. The only downfall? Some games can take a day or two to play through. You can adjust the length of games, but lengthy games on giant maps are half the fun! I already have a lot of time under my belt with this game, and I plan on putting in a lot more. I would recommend it to anyone who likes a real time strategy games.

review: Where should I start? This game is absolutely amazing! It has so many things you can do. Such as re-enact historical events, see what it would be like if different civilizations began in a different part of the world, or play against your friends in an intense race to see how can dominate the world. Not only can you achieve domination victories, but your nation can also excel and thrive with science, cultural, and faith victories. No matter what civilization you are, you can build any world wonder you desire! As long as you're in the correct time period and meet the requirements of course. All in all this game is great fun, providing hours and hours of fun (and that will only be one game). TL:DR You can build giant death robots towards the end. 10/10.

I can't say much for the single player as I've barely touched it, but as a multiplayer game, if you have a solid 12 hours to spend with a few friends it's a truly incredible experience of bonds formed and broken within the space of a mouse click. Though plagued with a few problems, such as games larger than small running very slowly to begin with, and annoying restarts, it still lends itself to being one of the deepest, exciting and tactical games I've ever played. The DLC massively adds to it too.

As I say to my friends "It's like chess but more advanced!" and that is what it is, as nobody makes peace with the person you are playing chess with for money etc. It's also amazing due to all the mods that're VERY easy to download to the game, that's where I usually find realistic mods, like true start locations for real world, global warming etc. and then I play as Denmark and go full Viking all around the World! It's an amazing game that one can use too many hours on.

Sid Meier knows stategy and when there are (at times) over 90,000 people STILL playing Civ V to this day, you see the proof how well this stategy game is made. Stategy games have always been my "take a break" from the shooter games. Civ V is the best of that break. If there is one strategy game to buy, Civ V is it! Is it your time to jump in to history and have the control?

review: Civilization...my first Civ Game was Civilization II for the PS1 (running on PS2...:D). Back then, everything was quite good and I enjoyed every minute of it. Then my friend told me one day that Civ V is buyable for 10. I bought it because I knew Civ II. Until today I don't regret buying this game. Why? Well, you will see... But let me start from the beginning: Civilization V is a game you can't compare to other games. You have to experience it for yourself, otherwise you can't really say something against it. Basically: You choose your leader and civ,You have settlers and a warrior. You build your city, you make your civilization the strongest, meet other civs, you make war, you can make peace, you even got several types of winning this game! Beat everyone, be the most curtural civ, be the mega-scientist, and so on. Let's talk about the "others". It it clear, that Oda Nobunaga isn't like Ghandi or like Bismarck. Everyone got his own abilities and own special units/building. Japan have bushido, which makes 1 samurai strong like a whole f****** troop of samurai! After you meet the "others", the game starts getting interesting. You can declare them war, trade with them, start getting BFF or asking them if they could fight with you against someone you don't like. But watch out: Even a BFF can backstab you. (ODA NOBUNAGA, Y U DID THIS TO ME? WE WERE BEST FRIENDS!) The cities are interesting too. You got 5 (with the DLCs 6) things you have to look at: Food, production, gold, culture, believe and science. Food makes your city grow (faster), production shows how fast you recruite/build something, culture is good for social stuff, believe and science...yeah :D You can even tell your people what to focus on and which field has to be harvested! (my slogan: What is a city with much food against a city with much productivity? nothing, because the productive city makes units like a factory :D) Oh, and this games has a f****** big variation of mods. I have about 10-20 mods useing right now and it doesn't stop getting bigger (That's what she said, hahahahahahahha...haha...ha...). Anyway, you can have a custom civ or map or even changnig some things in game! It's like getting free mini-DLCs. on mass. The game even got some FUNNY bugs. They don't get on your nerves, but they make you smile or laugh. You will see it when a brigde is in your farmhouse and you start thinking how your people get across the river. Or there's a sightseeing tour thorugh your Pyramid because your Great Wall of China was built through it. Or even your houses fly on water. Like I said, pretty funny, look for them ;D Well...what else can I say? If you look at the hous I played this game, you see that I have VERY much fun with this game. Alone: VERY GOOD. With a friend: MEGA-F******-SUPER-DUPER-ULTRA-BABOONISTIC-GOOD. Are 30 worth it? yes, but try getting it cheaper. Are the DLCs worth it? Of course, they make the game much better, but really try getting them ceaper, they're a little bit too expensive. Oh, and set a timer. Once you started you can't just stop playing. I started once with my friend at 3 pm. we stopped 6 am in the morning and were fast enough to get in bed before parents got us ;D And watch Ghandi. He is the pure definition of betrayal. Seriously. If you p*** him off he will throw nukes at you. He will. Oh and how he will. I didn't experience it, but enough friends told me not to p*** him off. I saw videos. I watch out. I don't lie. I give this game a 10/10. This usually means that a game is perfect, but I can't say something with 9, because it sounds like it is worse, which it isn't. It got some things that bother me, but they're not worth it to be mentioned. I wish you a good time and buy this game. It's baboonastic aweseome.

review: Civilization V is easy to get into, but takes time to fully master. It's an addicting combination of empire management and hex-based unit combat. The basic premise is that you lead a civilization from its nomadic origins through the ages. You'll found cities, build grand armies, and interact with other civilizations over epic games that can span tens of hours. The game's greatest strength lies in the emergent narratives that you, the player, will form as you lead your empire to greatness. You will love, curse, and despise your fellow players/AI. In some ways, Civilization is indescribable. This is one of the gaming experiences you must try at least once in your life. I recommend also picking up the expansions Gods & Kings and Brave New World for the most complete experience. P.S: Make sure you set aside a few hours for this game, because you won't want to play anything else for a while.

review: Playing to lose or barely survive as a weak civilization in the high difficulty settings is actually quite interesting. With scenarios, real world positioning mods, and AI enhancement mods, survival through defense and diplomacy against dominant civilizations creates a different gameplay from trying to win. Too bad multiplayer isn't quite feasible due to constant screen jumping to allied battle...

This is my first experience with a civ game and i have passed on them before because i thought it was to complex.

The only negative i can think about, except the AI's evil trading, is that it magically turns "one more turn" to 3AM in the morning.

Speaking as a person who has every DLC, it provides hundreds of hours of intertainment that i still find enjoyable with my friends even after my 300+ hours playing. The AI difficulty scale is wide enough so that someone who has never played a civ game before can win on the lowest difficulty, yet if they want to win on the next they need some better management skills, to the utterly brutal that still can act as a worthy opponent each time. Also if you are playing at the right difficulty level, if you lose, its mostly your fault. Maybe you didnt expand enough, or maybe you expanded too much, but generaly you can see where you went wrong or what the AI did right so you can learn from it. Overall, this has been one of my most enjoyable games i have played to date and have loved every second of it. This gets an easy 10/10

review: I have played civ v over 3000 hours since its release. I find the initial discovery of each map to be the first of many pleasures from this game. The ability to form your civilization to any victory condition and the progression towards that end are wonderful. The only lacking part is that the ai warfare is sometimes simplistic and therefore slightly less of a challenge than you would like at times. Still overall an excellent game.

review: Civilization V is possibly the greatest strategy game of all time, and certainly the best I've ever played. I've played this game for over 450 hours now, and there is still plenty that I haven't seen yet. Each time you play, you learn new tactics, skills and strategies to help aid you in one of the many ways to win the game. I would definitely recommend Civilization V Complete Edition, as the DLC's greatly enchance the way you play game. If there was one game I would recommend to buy on steam, it would be this one.

review: Wasn't too hot on this game when it came out compared to Civ4 but the Gods and Kings and Brave New World Expansions bring it over the top. While the combat grid system is a breath of fresh air to the series, i'm still not too keen on how slow units seem to be generated; it's definitely more of an alt-victory tilted game, which suits me just fine. The variety and subtlety in gameplay definitely gets the "just one more turn.." seal of approval from me!

I once started playing at 8am thinking "eh, I'll play a little bit." and next thing I know it was 2pm and I was slaughtering the Japanese mercilessly. This game will cause you to get fired, fail your classes, get a divorce, and nuke Ghandi all at the same time.

review: I don't think it's possible to write a review that justifies how awesome it is to play through Civ 5 while simultaniously appreciating the subtley that went into creating the various scenarios making victory possible from so many angles. I look back at my previous sentence and shudder, because it's really a testiment to how complex the game is. That being said, there are two types of people in this world: People that understand Civ 5 and enjoy it. People that do not. I don't have time for people that do not, so it's my job to convince you why you *should* love Civ 5, or at least take the time to understand and appreciate it. One final note is that I rarely play multiplayer against other players and have only done various scenarios including my friends and I vs. several difficult or increasingly difficult A.I. so that may affect my viewpoint slightly. A strategy turn-based game at heart, Civ 5 might seem like it moves slowly, but make no mistake that there is always something to be doing. It's like a good board game. Yes, that's it. Planning your next moves and expansions, watching your opponents carefully move their armies about, chatting with your ally, planning your research, checking the various windows and utilities available to you to spy on your opponents, etc. Civ 5 is like playing chess, but ten times more complex. Some critics may have critiqued the changes made to "stacking" units, or the change to hexes from squares as a bad thing, and originally I agreed with them, until I played through more and more. The changes made to unit stacking not only make more sense from a realistic perspective, but they also force the player to put more thought into strategy, rather than adopting a simplistic approach of just "get tanks ASAP and mow down your opponents" approach that some of us had in Civ 4. The expansions to the game only serve to expand and adjust your strategy significantly, by inviting you to try your hand at espionage and religion -- they aren't essential parts of the game, but instead feel like true add-ons, by helping you manage your culture and civilization through alternate means. Sort of like talents, or bonus skill points (to reference other games). One of my favorite things about Civ 5 and one of the main reasons I almost always keep it on my hard drive is replayability. The skirmish mode is meant to set up your culture against other cultures and the various victory types make for an interesting blend of randomness ensuring that no two games will play the same. Here's what I mean (in a nutshell): If you set yourself up as a random Civ with a random ally against 3-5 other Civs, you might be given a hand that puts you in the middle of a desert as Germany. In your mind, you may immediately want a military victory pushing around barbarians and threatening puny enemy civs, but as you play through your game you realize that your positioning and proximity to the desert has forced you to adjust your tactics and you suddenly find yourself building wonders and persuing science instead. Before long, you abandon your initial military ideals and adopt those of rationalism. You expand your cities, wary of your neighbors. You invest in your ally. Next thing you know, you've got a spaceship factory and you've almost completed the final components to launch yourself to a science victory. No matter what you start off thinking -- if you make Civ 5 be random to you, you can get a lot of replayability out of the game. If you see it on sale, I highly recommend it to anyone that might have enjoyed sitting down to play a board game or a game of chess. Come for the challenge of learning something new. Stay for the fun of it, and have fun ripping that Civ5 heroin out of your veins...just...one...more..turn.

review: Do not play if you've promised yourself "...just 20 minutes" for that will pass in a blink of an eye. Civ 5 maybe the most recent, the most expansive and potentially most daunting of the classic Civilization series - reinforced with a 234-page manual that comes with it. With those factors in mind, it's easy to imagine strategy new-comers, running away from Civ 5 in droves. But give it another look. Please! Civ 5 is the culmination of over 20 years of series development. Each game has been better than the last (which is a feat in itself) - and welcomes both seasoned veterans and newbies alike. The devs have beavered away on features that worked and ditched those that players felt weak. However, the single, most impressive attribute about Civ 5 is the ability to play the game how YOU want to play it. Want to be a peace-loving, pacifist society? You can be. Want to be a total powermongering and ruthless despot? Again, your choice. I wish I had more space to promote this! Buy it! :) 9/10

review: It's boring, historically an inaccurate mess, not immersive and slow paced as all hell. Also one of the greatest damn strategy games I've played and know it to be the best I'll play for long. Until Civ VI that is. Supports a ton of playstyles and even losing a game would not bother, as it's incredibly fun to just... build and develop your empire. Also watch out, starting it once means all of your games will dust in your steam library for the next one to four weeks.

review: This one is a bit difficult to "review" / give my opinions on it because of the issues I've had with the game so far. Also, I'd like to point out that my only experience with the game is through multiplayer with friends hosting it, so I might get a few things wrong. I tried the basic game and the gold edition, both have major issues relating to lag and graphics when set to lower than high. I have a system that mroe than meets the recommended system requirements and yet I get massive amounts of lag when I play on a huge map and am 3/4 of the way into the research / level. I tried lowering the graphics settings a little bit to see if that would help, but that only seems to make the game unplayable with it's glitchy visual appearance. Obviously if I play the game alone, I'll be able to better identify where the issue is and why I'm getting the massive lags, but I'm not too interested in playing the game alone, especially when I have friends to play the game with. Me and my friends meet the recommended system requirements for this game and our internet connections are more than adequate for a game like this (I have Fiber Optic and my friends have high speed cable), so this issue should not be happening at all. The Faith (religion) addition to the game felt a bit pointless as I played the most religious player in that level, converting everyone around me over without even trying and yet it didn't seem to give me any real advantage over anyone else, in fact, I lost horribly in that game even though I was able to keep up in research and expansion (an AI decided to taunt me till I lost patience and threw everything I had at one of it's cities which did nothing at all to it because the AI had slightly higher research than me). Conquering a city in the early ages with rangers and pikemen seems to be impossible because there's no way to create millitary fast enough to jump onto a city before that city becomes too high in defenses forcing you to wait till after you have stronger units. The game always feels like a race in technology and Wonders only, the battles feel somewhat discouraged because I don't think you can actually win by conquering a large portion of the map (and even if you could, it's very unlikely that it could happen since focusing on war leaves you poor, technology deprived, city expansions slowed down, etc), instead, ppl win far easier through research or culture (aka by technicality). The only time it's a good idea to go to war with someone is if that person is really weak compared to you and you can take him out without wasting too many rounds, because the longer you focus on battles, the less likely you are to win. Based on my limited online experience, I'd say it's a bit better than the other Civ games, but the glitches and limited playstyle hold it back a lot.

review: Civivilization 5 continues to improve upon this amazing franchise in small and wonderful ways. The addition of the policy trees is one of my favorite because it allows more control over the way your empire grows and gives your civ more personality than it could have in previous games. Diplomacy, combat and the tech trees have all seen improvements as well as a significant upgrade in graphics quality. The two large expansions for this game, Gods & Kings and Brave New World also add a huge amounts of complexity and depth to the game that was lacking in the former titles.

review: I've barely played this game so what do I know but.....it pretty much fits the bill for whatever style and whatever level you like to play. If you're meticulous about creating the perfect city(s) in the perfect spot(s) then this works extremely well. If you like to mad-rush and conquer, this is your game. If you want to manipulate the world around you without ever firing a shot, that can be done, too. Builder, pacifist, warmongerer, merchant, diplomat, or any combination thereof, they are all available here. As I read in a previous review, Civ V, when it first came out, disappointed me. The Civ IV iterations were definitely more immersive and, honestly, flat-out better. But with the expansions into Gods & Kings and Brave New World, Civ V has surpassed that great game and now is the jewel of the series. They all have their worth but, if you spend any time at all learning the depth of this game, you will be rewarded with many hours of time you'll never get back and you won't regret it. But, like I said, I've hardly played this game at all so, what do I know?

review: Sid Meier's Civilzation V is one of the best stratagy games I have ever seen. And I am not the only one who thinks that. Mulitple players and IGN said the same thing. Civ V is a turned based game where you try to conquer your entire map. But if that seems too hard you can either; be the first to space, have 5 diplomacies, research everything or have the most points when 2050 comes around. You play one of many famous conquers in history and try to build a civilization that will stand the test of time. If you don't want to do this alone, you dont have to! You can make helpful city-state (random civilization) become your ally and they will reward you by sending you gifts of gold, resources or even army units. If that is not what you thought I meant by "not alone" don't worry, you can play with other people and take down or befriend their civilzation. -fiddlesticks 9/10 review

review: Alright, this game has received more hatred than any other version of Civ. Ever. And, given the Civ III "purist" campaign for the last installment, that's saying something. As usual, though, most of the reviews given are comparing the game to civ IV. With all of its expansions. And Rhy's modding. So, just to add my two cents: The game is a whole different animal from IV, with new unit rules, (no stacking), embarking immediately available for all land units, and HEXES. (WHAAT???). That's right, the game uses hexes rather than the traditional squares for the grid. These all take a while to get used to for players of the earlier versions, but are all in all, very fun. The workshop content here is incredible, I highly recommend jumping into that immediately, (for experienced players) and trying out the new customization tools. With BNW and Gods and Kings added, the game really shines. PROS: -New look, same civ feel at heart -Love the civs available. (venice particularly.) -Cities given defense of their own, even without troops stationed in them. -Music is so-so, but doesn't detract from the game in any way. -Multiplayer, as usual. -Workshop content is awesome. CONS: -Most glaringly, the AI is incredibly easy. I reached Modern Era as Venice against five prince AIs a full 20 turns before any of them. This is my one real con for the game, but I bought for the multiplayer anyway, so... Not that bad. -Wish that the maps generated more evenly, with regard to resources. I took over half of a large map early in the game, only to find that alll the coal was on the other side. :\ Honestly, this is an incredible game with a bad AI. If an enemy with an army twice the size of yours allows you to take a city from him with nearly no fight, something's wrong. If said enemy then begs on his hands and knees for peace immediately afterwards, something's very wrong. If his peace treaty offers literally everything he owns, save his capital city... I have no words for it. I give this game a 8 out of 10, however, despite this issue. I play for the multiplayer, so the AI doesn't effect me that much. It is still an issue, though, so the die-hard fans may want to reconsider this purchase if you're expecting a high-risk single player duel. If you want a fun experience for multiplayer, though, or are learning the game, I can't recommend it enough. As more has come out for V online, it has grown greatly, as did IV. And III. And II. Best of luck, all!

review: It's a bit like chess. It's very easy to learn what everything does and how you can use each building and unit, but doing anything actually meaningful with all those things over the course of an entire match will take you a lot of practice and learning. A single match can easily last around 10 hours, and alliances you've made (or broken) in the beginning of a game can have surprising effects on the end-game, although the AI sometimes makes this work a bit weird.

review: I love this game. If you are into history and always ask yourself the question *What if?* This game gives you the perfect answer. You remake history with whatever civilization you choose. I have spend hundreds upon hundreds of hours into this game and do not regret any of it. Some people may not have a lot of fun with the game because of the setup given, for example: Polynesians who have advantages at exploring the sea spawning in the middle of a huge countinent. They have to form their empire to make sure they are successful in the end and come out on top. Making a religion and being rich might be your key to success in some games, while it may hinder it in others.

review: Siv V.. a very good game indeed but needing some improvents including some new characters like stalin and hitler.. because when i get home after a hard day of work I like to recreate the genocides that happened in the 1930-40's.. it brings a tear to my heart of happiness when I see it being done. This game is great for almost everyone that likes to think (1% of the U.S population). 1 Final problem with the game is that when you are allys with a city-state or ruler, not once can you ask friendly troops if they want to have sex with other troops, very prejudice against homosexuals I see. Anyway, would recommend to most folks. 69/69

review: This is the kind of game your friend says "Yea.. It's pretty good I guess," This is the kind of game you have low expectations on. Then it becomes the kind of game you have 200 hours on within 1.5 weeks. It becomes the kind of game where your family life is ruined, because it's so good. This is the game where your hatred for Ghandi is more powerful then the love you once shared with your children. This is the game where your desire to conquer and destroy Germany, drives your wife into the arms of your over weight brother John. Then, after the Babylonian-War-Machine has launched enough Nuclear Missiles to turn the Earth into a barren wasteland devoid of all life, what do you do? You start a new game and despite being evicted from your own home due to the inability to pay your bills, you find yourself bashing in the skull of the repo-man attempting to take your precious Civ-Machine. Although you know that the police will most likely find you, you take your Civ-Machine and go south to Mexico where you play all night and day in an alley way using several modified car batteries to power The Mighty Civ-Machine. This is the type of game where you think that, no matter what happened, it was worth it. You finally look around you as your dying of what you thought was a simple cold and you see what youve become. What youve become is something unworthy of being called human You are now a God. 10/10 would play again.

The battles are fun and paced well, the economic system is well crafted, the diplomatic sysem is interested and keeps you on your toes as you try and figure out what each opposing ruler is planning, and the city building is quite unique. If you like strategy games or justwant a low-stress, relaxing, and fun game to play, then buy SidMeier's Civ V. You won't regret it.

review: Though I've never really enjoyed strategy games, Sid Meier's Civilization V has definately been an enjoyable game to play.

Overall, this is one of the best games I've played so far. If you have the money, get it.

review: I bought this game about a year and a half ago. I had read many reviews saying that this was a terrible game and that buying this would be a mistake. I originally heeded these and bought Civ 4 instead. One day I was at Target and saw it on the shelf and decided to try it out and see how it was. I am so glad I decided to buy it. I have 90+ hours and it is still fun. The one unit per tile is nice because it eliminates the person who would group 50 units on one tile and totally demolish you. The original damage system was good, and with the 2 expansion packs it is even better. I remember that in Civ 4 I frequently saw archers take down helicopters and it angered me. It now has a damage system of 1-100 so with each archer giving 1 damage it would now take 100 archers to take down one helicopter. The original game is very good, and the 2 currently available expansion packs make it even better. Gods and Kings adds religion, more Countries, more units, etc. Brave New World improves religion adds tade routes, adds civs, units, etc. The game is worth $30, but commonly goes on sale for $7.50 so you should just wait for a sale. I would give this a 9/10.

review: A must have for anyone who likes turn based strategy games. The game itself is fun and simple. It's a bit overwhelming at first, but when you get down to it and play a couple of turns, do a bit of reading on the units and structures, it'll all make sense. It is, however, a lengthy game. It could take hours or days to finish a single game. This is practically this game's only major flaw.

review: Just one more turn... Completely losing track of time is a pretty strong indication of whether a game is good in my book, and Civilization 5 may be the best by that metric. As a newbie to the Civ series, managing a society through the ages had sounded a bit daunting, but thankfully the game is very intuitive for series beginners. The visuals, narration, and music are all pitch-perfect, evoking a grand ambience fit for a game about world conquest. Individual games can take hours, but it never feels tedious or repetitive. Computer opponents seem to have plenty of personality, and multiplayer with friends is a blast. I realize turn-based strategy games may not be for everyone, but it would be difficult for me to find someone I wouldn't recommend this game to.

game-hours: 159.1
review: Let me get one thing out of the way here at the start of the review, if you dont have time to put hours into a game then Civilization V may not be for you. Heck if you enjoy having a life outside of a game then this might not be for you. I say this because once you sink your teeth into Civilization V its easy to loose track of time and become completely engrossed in your quest to build your civilization. So let me first give you my background in playing Civilization games which is a short one I played the last two games (Civ IV and Civ Revolution) and enjoyed both of them quite a bit. When I started looking at some of the early previews of Civilization V I have to admit I wasnt sure I was ready to put the time and strategy into the world of Civilization. However from the opening load screen and the first few minutes of my first game I was instantly brought back to remembering why this is such an impressive franchise. For newcomers to Civilization, Civilization V may be one of the best games to get into. The game has an incredible tutorial and also will help you in your first games with helpful hints throughout. Either way if you have not played a Civilization game before this game seems well suited to hold your hand and then let you on your way. One thing that I found especially useful for me was the advisors in the game who basically give you tips on areas you should focus on in your civilization. You dont have to take their advice but often times they will all agree on one topic and that usually should be a solid indication that you want to address that area. One barrier of entry that Firaxis broke down in Civilization V was the menus throughout the game. Where in previous games you were often left wondering what to do next, this is by far the user-friendliest experience I have experienced in any Civilization game. Even as some one who has played Civilization games in the past I was very impressed with how approachable things were in this game, everything just felt far more intuitive then in past games. What stood out to me most about Civilization V was not only how accessible it was but how great of a strategy experience it manages to be. There is no denying that you can spend a whole day on just one game of Civilization. In fact unless you really have the stamina to play all day most games will span over the course of a couple of 5+ hour sittings. Civilization V (like Civ games before it) has this way of engrossing you into the story even if there isnt an already established plot. You create your own plot, your own direction, and your own goals. Sure the game does give you hints on how to get the desired outcome but the strategy is so dead on that you have the ability to go your own way to your desired outcome. A lot of the talk around Civilization V before the games release was on the new hexagon setup which to be honest is a change for the game but nothing that really changes the way you play the game. This is a turn based strategy game through and through and to be honest it is one of the best strategy games I personally have ever played. Graphics Without a doubt Civilization V has a much stronger visual presence then what we had in past Civilization games. The graphics have never been a big part of the Civilization experience however that all changed in this game. Visually this is a stunning game, it has a great mechanic to switch from strategy views to just a global view. If you prefer to look at the game as more of a grid you can do that, if you want to look at the game as a living world you can do that as well. This is by far the best looking Civilization game out there and it once again lessens the blow of how expansive of a strategy game it really is. Fun Factor For newcomers to the series there is of course going to be a learning curve no matter how good the tutorial is. However for seasoned veterans to the series you will be able to jump right in and take advantage of one of the most enjoyable games of strategy I have ever played. What is even more exciting about Civilization V is that you not only can play offline but can play online with friends. There is also going to be an ever-growing population of mods to the game that will continue to increase replay-ability. Lets face it though I have not played two games of Civilization that ever felt even remotely similar each game feels like a brand new experience. Overall Civilization V is one of the best strategy games I have ever played. There are some issues but those are so minor in comparison to all the great things Firaxis has done to not only make this accessible to new players but even returning players as well. I can say with great confidence that you will not get a better game of strategy right now then what Civilization V has to offer, it is just that good.

review: What can I say about the best turn based strategy series? Multi-touch support rocks, hex tiles are great. It's as great as previous versions, offering huge Civiliopedia to teach you actual history, stealing your precious life with never ending "one more turns". Your average strategy game ends in 1 hour, while Civilization might not end in months. Not everyone can play this game, can you build an empire to stand the test of time?

The games do take a long time though, especially playing with others, be prepared to sit down for 6 hours and play. Or you can do pitboss games and the game also alows you to safe it and pick it up later.

review: Needless to say if you want a turn based strategy game believe me when I tell you, THIS IS IT! However it's hard for me to recommend this to someone who is planning to buying just the vanilla (no DLC included) edition. Of the 255 hours on this game I've spent at least 50 of those on the vanilla and back then I felt as though the game had less game play than the previous game in the franchise, CIV 4. So if you're getting this game I highly recommend you get the gold edition, you get the core game, the Gods and Kings DLC and a bunch of scenario packs (never used) and civilizations which I have found to be very viable in game, such as Korea. My other biggest complaint is that the AI do sometimes cheat. Now based on your definition of what "Difficult" AI means, you might be fine with this. My personal definition of a difficult AI is one who is given the same basic resources as an AI on an easier difficulty, but is much better at deciding on what to do and how to use those resources. Civ 5 believes that a more difficult AI has more resources than the easier AI and the player. Despite this I still believe Civ 5 is the based turn based strategy due to the sheer amount of strategies you can use to explore, expand, and conquer.

I have not played the other Civilization games, so I am not comparing this game to others like it, but I would definitely reccomend this game for you to purchase. It is well worth your money.

For newcomers, it's easy to understand and grasp the basics, but under the surface there is a lot of room for planning, decisions to make and strategies to use. After you've learned the basics you'll learn the other aspects of the game mostly by trial and error. You'll find out that making a lot of cities needs to be balanced with happiness, and that it isn't a very good idea to settle on nothing but tundra. This game isn't so much about being able to do a lot of actions in as little time as possible, or very quick reflexes. Planning and strategic measures are much more effective than producing buildings on impulse. Diplomacy is a big factor, when you start a match you don't necessarily think of ways to destroy your enemy. There are multiple ways to victory, sometimes it's better to befriend your opponent to make deals that make your civilization stronger, or assist eachother in times of need. Not to say warfare isn't an option. Taking down a city (or a civilization) requires a lot of strategy and planning, you'll have to keep in mind cities can be tough to take down if they have a lot of defensive structures or defensive units within borders, and you can't simply walk over most cities with just a few cheap units. It's easier to be defensive than to be the attacker. These and many more mechanics make Civ 5 as interesting and entertaining as it is. You'll find yourself keep wanting to press next turn, seeing what effect your moves made, if your scout will get away or get trampled by those units on the other side of the forest, et cetera. The diplomacy gives a lot of options for mindgames, betrayal and friendship. Surprising your ally who is about to take a cultural victory by launching an invasion assisted by a nuclear missile can be completely game-changing if executed well. I highly recommend this game to anyone remotely interested in this game, it's timeless.

review: Today I went to Starbucks with my genderqueer non-binary friend. I had a bagel, green tea with honey and a late to go and xi had a salad and a water because xi is watching xir weight. We were sitting eating and talking quiet happily when suddenly we heard a little child speaking to his/her brother/sister (my apologies for not knowing these kids real gender identities; their father called them boys but you can never be too sure, considering the white cissexist  that was about to come out of this fathers mouth, I wouldnt be surprised if they were girls). Kid B (the younger one) says to kid A, youre a lesbian! and quick as a flash the father lies, Boy cannot be lesbian, drink your lemonade! WTF JFC! I WAS APPALLED! This is horrible! I almost jumped over the table and across the chairs and punch that  in the face! I mean SO MANY THINGS WRONG with what he said to the poor child. Boys CAN be lesbians if they identify as lesbians. I have a number of cis male lesbian friends. He was blatantly erasing their entire lived experiences with such an ignorant lie! I couldnt believe what we were hearing (xi was in the brink of tears). The kid was 4 years old. How does that father KNOW that his child wont grow up to identify as a lesbian! s like this is why I firmly believe cis s are scum! This is why I believe in Tumblr Feminism!!  THE CIS HETERO PATRIARCHY AND  CULTURE!! I should not that during all this time, the mother was sited next to this man. She kept quiet all the time, no doubt she was abuse by the bruise marks on her face. I know most people in Tumblr DONT believe in the patriarchy,  culture, or equal rights to non-cisgender people. However if you do as I do, and you seek justice as I seek it, then I ask to please reblog! In this game, you can make your Civilization identify as whatever xi wants to.

review: Great game, best empire building sim I've played in a long time, and the DLC adds an amazing amount depth to the game making all those boring turns where you had to wait more interesting by giving you spies to control, a religion to build, famous works of art to create and collect and dozens of new buildings, multiple changes to cultural unlocks and culture trees a complete re-work of the culture system, and several new units that fill gaps that never should have existed. (No more 300 years of archers followed by 500 years of crossbowman fights.)

review: In my opinion, this is one of the best strategy games around. The base game is pretty bland, however the two expansion packs are what make Civilization V as good as it is. The expansions add new civilizations and great game mechanics like trade routes via boats and caravans, tourism, religion. These can all Impact the game in such a fantastic way and add a little more complexity to the gameplay. I believe that Civ V i best played with friends. We love to pick random Civilization's and set the AI to random personalities. This makes the game pretty muchh different every time we play it. Gandhi may not be a  this time around, Washington might not just continue to expand all over your borders. It is good fun, especially when co-operating with one another about trading, swapping resources and even war. If you have the slightest interest in Strategy games, this is for you. I do recommend both expansion packs, though.

review: The great life destroyer that keeps improving with every xpac. The game is a true successor to a legacy that started over 20 years ago. Dont be fooled by the date this came out, its still a game with next to no equals in terms of the turn based strategy genre. The learning curve might look steep at first glance but I assure you that mastering the basics game will come faster than you think. For the over 1500 hours of gaming I have recorded in the game I am still someone who barely did any scenarios. To keep the game fun, dont forget to crank up the difficulty as the challenge that is brought by the highest difficulty levels will bring out the true test of your abilities.

review: The God King of 4x games. This takes everything great from Civ 2, 3, and 4 and puts them together fix nearly every complaint I've had about the series.

review: From a historian's perspective, Civ V might not seem like the most realistic strategy game. But what those bookworms don't realise is that Sid Meier uses only the most trustworthy sources in manipulating the personalities and responses of each and every organization. Do you have a measily bit of coin in your treasury? You bet everyone's gonna want some of that. Build too close to Ghandi? You'll be sure too find a bag of dog poo on your doorstep the next morning. Except the door step is your capital city. And the bag of poo is the full onslaught of advanced weaponry because for some reason the game started you off in the tundra which crippled you technologically for the better half of the first 1000 years. The community is a collection of caring and knowledgable individuals, players and NPC alike, who will constantly remind you how bad you are at this game by rendering you useless as they blockade your miserable island city while making it obvious just how many bombers can fit on a carrier. Games will turn into fiestas where you can play the role as pinata and the other civilizations take turn whacking at you with their phallus shaped instruments, because if there's one metaphor that matches this game, it's getting beaten in the noggin with a giant weiner. If you want to know the literal meaning of Montezuma's revenge, or as I call it, "I was just trying to build a second city," then you should certainly buy this game. Overall 4/5 stars.

Eventually I renamed my town's name to Tyrezeshiddick cuz it was getting preeeetty boring unreality TazZzyLoosePoundite. I give this game a solid 6/10. It's hard to get a good review out of me. The only games that I have given above a 7/10 are Arma, Day-Zed, Terraria, Zombies: Survival Stories, UFC: Fight Round 26 and Sid Meier's 2. So survive our night guys.

review: Just one more turn... Completely losing track of time is a pretty strong indication of whether a game is good in my book, and Civilization 5 may be the best by that metric. As a newbie to the Civ series, managing a society through the ages had sounded a bit daunting, but thankfully the game is very intuitive for series beginners. The visuals, narration, and music are all pitch-perfect, evoking a grand ambience fit for a game about world conquest. Individual games can take hours, but it never feels tedious or repetitive. Computer opponents seem to have plenty of personality, and multiplayer with friends is a blast. I realize turn-based strategy games may not be for everyone, but it would be difficult for me to find someone I wouldn't recommend this game to.

review: Let me get one thing out of the way here at the start of the review, if you dont have time to put hours into a game then Civilization V may not be for you. Heck if you enjoy having a life outside of a game then this might not be for you. I say this because once you sink your teeth into Civilization V its easy to loose track of time and become completely engrossed in your quest to build your civilization. So let me first give you my background in playing Civilization games which is a short one I played the last two games (Civ IV and Civ Revolution) and enjoyed both of them quite a bit. When I started looking at some of the early previews of Civilization V I have to admit I wasnt sure I was ready to put the time and strategy into the world of Civilization. However from the opening load screen and the first few minutes of my first game I was instantly brought back to remembering why this is such an impressive franchise. For newcomers to Civilization, Civilization V may be one of the best games to get into. The game has an incredible tutorial and also will help you in your first games with helpful hints throughout. Either way if you have not played a Civilization game before this game seems well suited to hold your hand and then let you on your way. One thing that I found especially useful for me was the advisors in the game who basically give you tips on areas you should focus on in your civilization. You dont have to take their advice but often times they will all agree on one topic and that usually should be a solid indication that you want to address that area. One barrier of entry that Firaxis broke down in Civilization V was the menus throughout the game. Where in previous games you were often left wondering what to do next, this is by far the user-friendliest experience I have experienced in any Civilization game. Even as some one who has played Civilization games in the past I was very impressed with how approachable things were in this game, everything just felt far more intuitive then in past games. What stood out to me most about Civilization V was not only how accessible it was but how great of a strategy experience it manages to be. There is no denying that you can spend a whole day on just one game of Civilization. In fact unless you really have the stamina to play all day most games will span over the course of a couple of 5+ hour sittings. Civilization V (like Civ games before it) has this way of engrossing you into the story even if there isnt an already established plot. You create your own plot, your own direction, and your own goals. Sure the game does give you hints on how to get the desired outcome but the strategy is so dead on that you have the ability to go your own way to your desired outcome. A lot of the talk around Civilization V before the games release was on the new hexagon setup which to be honest is a change for the game but nothing that really changes the way you play the game. This is a turn based strategy game through and through and to be honest it is one of the best strategy games I personally have ever played. Graphics Without a doubt Civilization V has a much stronger visual presence then what we had in past Civilization games. The graphics have never been a big part of the Civilization experience however that all changed in this game. Visually this is a stunning game, it has a great mechanic to switch from strategy views to just a global view. If you prefer to look at the game as more of a grid you can do that, if you want to look at the game as a living world you can do that as well. This is by far the best looking Civilization game out there and it once again lessens the blow of how expansive of a strategy game it really is. Fun Factor For newcomers to the series there is of course going to be a learning curve no matter how good the tutorial is. However for seasoned veterans to the series you will be able to jump right in and take advantage of one of the most enjoyable games of strategy I have ever played. What is even more exciting about Civilization V is that you not only can play offline but can play online with friends. There is also going to be an ever-growing population of mods to the game that will continue to increase replay-ability. Lets face it though I have not played two games of Civilization that ever felt even remotely similar each game feels like a brand new experience. Overall Civilization V is one of the best strategy games I have ever played. There are some issues but those are so minor in comparison to all the great things Firaxis has done to not only make this accessible to new players but even returning players as well. I can say with great confidence that you will not get a better game of strategy right now then what Civilization V has to offer, it is just that good.

review: This game is great. I've never played the previous Civ games, so this game was quite intimidating. There is so much data presented, it is hard to figure out which is important and which isn't. It will take you some time to learn how to have fun with this game, as the pacing seems glacially slow when you don't know what you are doing. By the time you've beaten a few games, you'll be having a great time playing. I love playing each new scenario and learning mechanics I didn't understand before. It makes me excited to play the next game to try out a new strategy! Touch Support on this game is really great too.

review: Civilization V is a beautiful game, capturing the struggles of a leader trying to create a dominant empire to rise above the others. Somehow, it manages to be both simple and complex. It is mostly realistic and offers some humorous irony and increased difficulty in the form of Ghandi. However, it's DLC are way overpriced for the amount of content they actually offer and it gets boring after the first few playthroughs. Overall, it is an amazing game that will keep you invested for hours on end, keeping you on your toes until the last turn. [9.5/10]

review: Just to give this review some perspective, I've been playing the various iterations of Civ for a very, very long time. I remember playing the original like it was yesterday. Beavis and Butthead on the TV, Nirvana on the radio, and me on my Packard Bell. I spent hours in my mom's basement, wasting away from rickets while the normal kids were soaking up the sunlight, going out on dates, playing sports, and leading generally normal, productive lives. Civ 1 really messed up my life...but in a completely awesome way. I mean, I couldn't get enough. Doubly so with Civ 2. The things you could do with that game. It had...personality. I remember little stuff, like the different architectural styles, that gave the game such an immersive quality. I remember how every time I played, the world had its own story, and how things would seem to take on a life of their own. The endless war with the Mongols, my alliance with the Germans, butting heads with Caesar. I learned more about history there than I ever did in school. It was fantastic. I didn't even play to win most of the time. I was a fifteen year-old kid in a sandbox. I got older, and Civ grew with me. I spend endless hours on 3 and 4, balancing game commitments and my real life. When Civ 5 was announced, I didn't hesitate. I bought it immediately. In short, it didn't take me long before I realized that this new Civ was nothing like the Civ of old. I've never played Revolutions, but I've heard there is a lot of overlap. I don't know. What I do know is that this game is boring. Really, really boring. Never have I clicked the "next turn" button like I have here. Maybe it's because it takes forever to build anything...so long, in fact, that it's easier just to hoard gold and buy things. Maybe it's because expansion and/or conquest isn't really encouraged. The seemingly massive happiness hit just makes it unreasonable. So I sit there, just watching the world slowly go by. And how slow it is...the loading screen between turns has become my nemesis. I've turned the "superb" graphics down to their lowest setting, just to speed things up, and to keep things from jumping from one side of the world to the other every time I scroll my mouse. Just to be clear, I have a computer that can run all the latest shooters, yet cannot run a turn-based strategy game aimed at a mass audience. The AI is dumb and unfinished. If my dog had fingers, he could win on prince at least. I don't consider myself the smartest strategist, but I have never lost a war in Civ 5. Ever. I started on warlord, then prince, then king. Onward and upward I went, until I quickly realized that the AI wasn't getting smarter. It was just cheating. This was acceptable 15 years ago, not now. Why is Gandhi determined to kill me? After 2000 years of good relations, he wants to kill me. Not a biggie, mind you, because all he does is park archers next to my swordsmen, where I can promptly slaughter them. After I defeat his army (without taking any cities), he offers me all of his resources, all of his gold, and all of his cities (except for his capital, of course). He just gives up. I take him up on his offer, because I am obviously smarter than him. But that means my happiness tanks, my production stops, and my steady income stream is now in the red. Whatever. I still have 3 swordsmen and 2 archers. I can conquer the world with that. Screw culture. Did I mention the music? Man, it's boring. No more period specific soundtrack, tribal or classical. Just the turn-based equivalent of elevator music. I'm sure the graphics are the bees-knees, but with me playing on the lowest graphics setting, I will never know. City-states, which were made out to be a big deal, are not. They ask for stuff, you give it to them (or not). They give you stuff (or not). That is the extent of the city-state strategy. Boring. Actually, the city-state thing reminds me of a problem I have that extends beyond the poor quality of this game. Professional reviews. Why did every professional game review outlet give Civ 5 high marks. 9/10. A+. Really? Every review I've seen has been the same. "It has hexes!" "It has city-states!" "One unit per tile!" "Ranged combat!" "Beautiful graphics!" I even saw reviews gushing over how cool the opening sequence was (you know, the one you can't skip). For one, I am tired of seeing the old man in the hut every time I load up. I find it oddly fishy that no "professional" reviewer has brought up the bugginess; the fact that you need an internet connection; the fact that you need Steam; the fact that the AI stinks; etc, etc, etc. Just hexes and city-states. Either they were told to write a good review by the "powers that be," or they spent a total of 3 hours playing before writing their reviews. Either way, I will never trust a professional review source ever again. I gave this game 2 stars, because I believe it still has the potential to be good. After a few expansions, some mods, a Rhys and Fall, a Fall From Heaven. Yeah, it could be good. I've played around 60 hours, and still see a spark of genius here. But it will take an awful lot of work. Right now, it's like watching paint dry.

review: Civilization V is the sequel to the immensely popular and reigning champion of the Civilization franchise: Civilization IV. With the Beyond the Sword expansion that game was almost perfect, so the fifth game had some serious shoes to fill. The biggest and most controversial change in Civilization V is the change to a hex based system rather than squares. They also removed the ability to stack units, so one unit per hex is the limit. This completely changed combat, mostly for the better. The game was plagued by serious, almost breaking, issues at the start. The AI had problems figuring out how to work the hex combat system and was mostly completely dumbfounded in battle. The removal of the religion system and the addition of some features claiming to make the game more accessible to newcomers lead to the accusations of a dumbed down game that didn't hold a candle to the mighty Civ IV. Most of the issues were addressed in the Gods and Kings expansion which also added religion back into the game and expanded upon it well beyond what Civ IV did. The latest expansion, Brave New World, finally made the game all it could be and now it is accepted that the game is on par with or even beyond Civ IV. If you wish to pick this game up, then you should absolutely pick up Brave New World as well, as the game is no good without it. Brave New World also includes all the changes from Gods and Kings, so you don't need both expansions. The only thing you get from Gods and Kings is a couple of extra Civilizations to play and that can safely be skipped. Even with all the improvements, it has been said that the Civilization series plays more like a board game than a grand strategy game. We agree. For people who want something a bit heavier on the strategy side, we recommend Europa Universalis IV

review: Wow, i don't know where to start. If you have ever played any of the CIV games before, then you are in for a treat. I've loved this series since i was a little kid and it only got better with the years, CIV 5 is amazing in every single aspect and a must play for anyone that enjoys strategy. If you've never played a CIV game before then youre in for a treat. This game is incredible and i can asure you will probably ask when did all those hours flew by playing this game, i just can't stop playing it. 100% recommended, must play.

review: Very complex and time consuming game that is quite in depth in many ways... Took alot for a first timer like myself to learn the ropes, but once i did this game become a lot more fun. I would only recommend this game to RPG/strategy ethusiasts as i still find it to be quite a hard game even on the easier difficulty settings. This game is also what is called a "turn based" game, which at first i found a bit boring. Once i adapted to the games style though, the whole turn based system becomes very relevant and added another level of strategy to it all. Overall, the game is well thought out and very in depth making it simply put "epic".
game-hours: 55.4
review: A very good turn-based strategy game. You will start by choosing you civilization, each one of them comes with different civ bonus, unique unit and unique building/improvement or second unique unit. By choosing different research options, expanding your borders, making you city grow, recruiting an army and balancing between different aspects to keep you civilization secure and happy, you will lead your civilizations through many eras to victory. The AI in the game could be better, while it may help you in the beginning and even will seem to be your ally, they can start hating you because you have too big or too small army, they will yell at your warmongering even if you are fighting again a common foe, they will settle their cities near you and expect you to move since it`s "their territory". While you should start playing with AI to learn about the game, it`s strongly recommended to play with other people since game can become boring an predictable after some time. You should also buy complete edition of the game since G&K and BNW dlcs change gameplay a lot in a better way - you will be able to participate in world congress, create trade routes, found religions and much more.

review: Another remake of Civ. still the best non-space 4X. Sound, Soundtrack & Visuals are all great (although i prefer the Lenard Nimoy voice-over mod). Advisors are back better than ever (now with good tutorials if you need that). Now that units stacking has significantly changed how wars/combat playout (and with this change they kinda ruined the great generals/admirals). I like the new Civ-o-pedia. Culture & Social Policies are a welcome addition. You must use G+K or BNW expansions, preferably both, for the game to really come alive through all ages. Not sure that religon is all that influential in terms of the game outcomes. If you won't get CIV5 with expansions or DLC all on sale, and you aren't modding (steam workshop), then don't bother and get CIV4. Get it when CIV5 is on sale with the expansions, don't bother with DLC until you have played through at least once (unless the DLC comes as extras such as in the Gold pack).

review: A great game for anyone that wants to burn a few hours. Its a game of wit's and brute strength, Forging allies and waging war all to gain a foothold over your rival's. Many or few, every game is different with a huge selection of map types and playable factions. I have played multiple run's of this game and still it is my favorite Civ from Sid so far. I'm sure i'll have many more hours in this game as the acheivment list is 200+. Multiplayer has a little to be desired as the matching can sometime take awhile and games tend to get overpowered one way or another rather early on. Finding solid players that can last a match is uncommon. With all being said the game is definetly playing.

review: So, everyone pretty much has at least one game that they go back to, over and over, when other games have lost their novelty, or have been completed, or all the achievements earned. For me thus far, this is that game. I could play a game on the DS, or go back to the XBOX, but this is my favorite go-to after the kiddo is in bed. Better yet, it is easily explainable and fun to play with friends and family. Worth it to have in your library (especially if it's on sale).

review: Base game is solid. The expansion turns it into a brilliant and balanced game. Only issue I have with it, is that it is so good that it makes you want to play it with friends. And the multiplayer is the most unstable thing I ever experienced in a game. And you play it anyway, cursing Sid Meier every step of the way. Because it is good enough to make you wade through the suffering of constant disconnects.

review: With almost 1000 hours logged into this game, I can still say there are Civilization's I have not played as, and strategies I have not dabbled with. Civilization 5 is simply one of the best games I have ever played. Because this game satisfies on so many levels, it's hard to write a concise review with enough detail. All I'll say is that if you're thinking of getting the game... do it! Pay for the entire package with all the DLC's, and prepare to enter "the time machine that only goes forward." You will lose so many hours of your life to this game, but you will enjoy every single one of them.

review: Civilization 5 is a very addicting game and the game itself is just briliant but the fact that there could have been more countrys to play as and that it seems like you cannot do stuff that a leader of a country would seemingly do, i think the choices that you have should be so deep that you should be able to give speeches to the people of the country or use chemical weapons against your own people, yes bombing your own cities and stuff like that is kind of evil but why not, if the people are starting a resistanes you can just send in a tank and tell them no, it should be that if you are a communism and a democrocy should hate you not be best friends with you, also the company that made this game made cheap expanions that civ 4 already had the features that the expansions added, it seems kind of money grubbing. but if you are just an insane person that wants to take over the world this is the perfect game for you. you can either take over the world or you can be taken over by russia or you can be the biggest civilization and still lose the game because another one did the space race before you,

Its not just how much time the developers have put into making this game as good as possible, its also how much the community has helped the game thrive and become more of a player friendly experience. Although if you want to buy it, I strongly recommend getting BNW and GK (Brave New world and Gods and Kings) as they improve the game mechanics greatly. The community as a whole makes this game worth while, Mods improve the game greatly even in places where you thought there could be no improvement. 11/10 Strongly recommend it.

review: I've been a fan of the Civilization series since Civ III, and I'm always eagerly anticipating the release of the next update/expansion pack or version. The hexagon in Civ V and the dropping of stacking took some getting used to, but it definitely revitalized the series. The reworking of the culture victory has been a bit of a letdown though, but then again, I never attempt cultural victories. Overall, great game and worth every penny.

review: Civilization V is in my opinion the best 2K game published, not only is it a amazing strategy game it incorporates so many aspects which are lost in so many other games. I have to date played 789 hours on this game and whilst I have not played in a while that is purely due to scaling down my gaming time. I cannot recommend this enough, I mean who doesn't want to nuke some random civ whilst they are in medieval era and your in future era?? It's fantastic in every way. Pros: AI is awesome (few if any glitches) Steam workshop Wide variety of civilizations Many different maps Not focused solely on combat AND EVERYTHING ELSE ABOUT THE GAME Except: You aren't playing it right now like you should be! 10/10

review: The latest Instalment in the Civilization series number Five sees the biggest changes in the established format. The game is based on an entirely new game engine with hexagonal tiles instead of the square tiles of earlier games. The combat system has been overhauled, removing stacking of military units and enabling cities to defend themselves by firing directly on nearby enemies. Computer controlled City-States are a new feature which allows you to befriend and trade with, if the neighbouring A.I. is not offering trade due to them panicking over your troop build up on yours and their border. The DLC - God's and Kings adds Religion and Espionage features that were already in Civilization IV, but strangely left out of the base Civ V game. Coming from previous Civilizations takes a little getting used to but overall this is a solid outing. 8 and half out of 10 kiwifruit.

review: OMG YES Strategy fan? You will LOVE this game. OK, it's a different take than the fast paced Age of Empires or the bazing fast Starcraft, but even though the combat is not challenging, you do need to think your movements through before executing, or you'll find yourself in a pesky situation. It's fun that it's history-oriented, but it's kinda irrelevant in my opinion. You just have to know what kind of buffs you get from each civ and pick your victory route. The AI tends to not be quite friendly but that keeps things interesting if you can't find people to play with (and let's face it, the games are loooong, so it's rather hard to coordinate with other humans :P). Great game!

review: Not only one of the best 4X or Strategy games I've played, but it tops the charts as one of the most enjoyable times I've had playing a video game. The multiplayer can get a little glitchy sometimes, but is worth it nonetheless. I've gotten in some heated political arguments with my friends while immersed in Civ 5, which were some of the most unique experiences I've had on a PC game. The single player AI is also very unique, as each country has their own personalities. All around a great game.

review: The game that keeps on giving. Civilization has come a long way from the first release in 1991 (which I still occasionally play) to the 5th edition (plus addons). The idea of building your own empire throughout history is still captivating. One of the best features of the game is that the player can decide on what victory conditions to pick: discovery, culture, ... and yes, military style as well. Although in my eyes secondary for a good game, the graphics add to my overall opinion of two thumbs up. The only item I definitely miss is a thick manual to read (like in the good old days) while the game is downloading and installing. PS: Don't trust Ghandi. :-)

review: The civ 5 base game isnt a complete game.... u need the complete game with the 2 big expansion gods and kings and brave new world and now u got a rly amazing game. The best turn strategic game, when u start to play it u cant stop. U think u need another 5 min at 2 am for complete something but at 5 am u are already in game. This big game (all this series anyway is amazing) is a risk for your true life :). For my thing anyway dont go look for multiplayer wth a lot players, because the game come be rly slowly. Play it with 1 your big friend vs pc and u have a rly big fun

review: I strongly recommend this game for avid strategists. Your objective is to nurture a civilisation and become victorious over all others. There are numerous victory possibilities thanks to a large range of ingame concepts from tourism to science. Each civilisation has its unique units/buildings as well as an ability through their leader. Moreover, the dedicated mod workshop enhances the game further still, bestowing upon it astronomical replay value. Give it a try, you won't regret it !

review: This review is for those who are completely new to Civilizations. The sun rises. You emerge from your cave with a new mindset, a goal to achieve, something no one has ever experienced before. Expansion. You build a new home to you and others when the time comes. And yet this hunger still remains. You explore the vast surroundings and find many new resources, unkown to you. You experiement and realise, this clay can be used for pottery! Fast forward 300 years, your once small town has now expanded into 3 cities, all of which are feared and respected by the surrounding neighbors. Yet they require more. Shall you attack and conquer the weak? Or befriend and parter up with the strong? These are the choices you make in civilizations. Choose wisely.

review: This game provides a very different form of entertainment than most other simulator games. Sid Meier has captured the perfect combination of war, science, culture, and economy. You can win by taking over the world, reaching Alpha Centauri, sending a space shuttle into space via the Apollo Program, or by building the United Nations. The only word that I can possibly sum this game up with would be "Wow".

However I was later so mad that I nearly obliterated my computer as this fuc**** game shuts down whenever im about 1 hour in to a game in multiplayer, "civilization V has stopped responding" oh and if it was just that easy to task manager abort it, I wouldn't write this review, because, no it wont allow itself to be shut down, no no, it rather bug my task manager again. Anyhow, let off from multiplayer this game is fantastic! 8/10 would play again!
game-hours: 2056.3
review: This game is an extremely fun game to play, yet others have said that the game gets boring because of it's slow paced turn based strategy style it's based on, that is exactly what makes this game so amazing because once you click end turn you won't know what's going to happen and it carries the message the game preaches which is to change the course of history and to make you strive to win using your head. I won't lie though, this game did kind of take me a while to get used to, primarily because I would always lose in many scenarios because of my lacking knowledge on the timetable aspect of this game, however if you play for at least 24, 48, or 72 hours and have watchedd other people play it you can definitly get the hang of this game. It just requires alot of thinking and time. It's like chess or a puzzle, it takes time and effot, but as the famous saying goes, practice makes perfect. Cheers!

review: An excellent update to the classic series. The gameplay is streamlined but not simplified, and the hex-based map makes exploration easier and less time-consuming. The AI is a bit lacking, but Civ has always worked best in multiplayer. It also feels like this game lacks some of the character that Civ IV had. The soundtrack isn't as good and it's missing those classic Leonard Nimoy tech intros. All in all, a great game, but I'd stick to IV for single player.

Watch as you and your friends scramble to build the best cultural buildings in all of history only to be beaten out by the AI players. Enjoy the rage between all of you as you try to move through borders and pledge war on eachother. Witness the expanding nations slowly taking over the map as you are raided by raging barbarians.

If you didn't buy all the DLC from the get-go, enjoy forking out a bunch of cash to be able to enjoy the full game, or have fun in singleplayer since almost all multiplayer matches require DLC. edit: I managed to get two of the expansion packs and it makes the game more deep and enjoyable, but I still think those who are suckered into buying any other version that the complete edition are going to be disappointed at the money they have to spend to fully enjoy the game. Still a great game.

review: Sid Meier's latest entry in the award winning Civilization series is fantastic. It allows you to rule a country however you would like, be it peacefully allying yourself with others or steamrolling them with the feet of your armies. The two expansions, although steeply priced, is a must for the full experience and i reccomend the dlc strongly. If you love 4X games and have a lot of money in gifted steam cards, than i highly reccomend considering Civilization V. However, if you couldnt put a lot of time into one saved game (a standard game could be awhile,) then you might want to look at less time intensive titles. 10/10

review: This is my go to game for burning a morning away. With so many variables in how you play and how AI/other players can play, the game has so much replayability. The graphics are well done and the music is beautiful. Gameplay is easy to pick up. There really is no "right" or "wrong" way to play, only ways that work for you or don't. So many different ways you could take this. Warfare, diplomacy, keep to yourself and pray, etc. A great game in a long line of amazing games in the series.

review: Since everyone else is placing their reviews, and having around 30-50 hours of gametime, I figured I'd put my word in and close the time gap. This game is AMAZING, you will NOT regret getting it. It's not a waste of time, nor is it a waste of money. This game will have you playing it over and over repeatedly. Replay value? Definately a lot. In fact, if you were to buy this game right now, and you've liked the gameplay videos and screenshots, I'm positive you'd like to play the game for yourself. Go ahead and buy it if it's your cup of tea! It's very fun, and you'll enjoy yourself. :)

review: DO you have lots of friends that love eachother! well this game is perfect for you! it has a few side effects though... 1. watch your friendships crumble to pieces in a matter of minutes! 2.Discover that paranoid side of you that you never thought you had. 3. Greed (that is all) SO ENJOY HATING YOUR FRIENDS! If you dont have friends well...try single player and GET NUKED BY GHANDI! HAVE FUN!

review: I hope you have a lot of hours of sleep to spare. Civilization V is a very complex turn-based strategy game. For newcomers, it's easy to understand and grasp the basics, but under the surface there is a lot of room for planning, decisions to make and strategies to use. After you've learned the basics you'll learn the other aspects of the game mostly by trial and error. You'll find out that making a lot of cities needs to be balanced with happiness, and that it isn't a very good idea to settle on nothing but tundra. This game isn't so much about being able to do a lot of actions in as little time as possible, or very quick reflexes. Planning and strategic measures are much more effective than producing buildings on impulse. Diplomacy is a big factor, when you start a match you don't necessarily think of ways to destroy your enemy. There are multiple ways to victory, sometimes it's better to befriend your opponent to make deals that make your civilization stronger, or assist eachother in times of need. Not to say warfare isn't an option. Taking down a city (or a civilization) requires a lot of strategy and planning, you'll have to keep in mind cities can be tough to take down if they have a lot of defensive structures or defensive units within borders, and you can't simply walk over most cities with just a few cheap units. It's easier to be defensive than to be the attacker. These and many more mechanics make Civ 5 as interesting and entertaining as it is. You'll find yourself keep wanting to press next turn, seeing what effect your moves made, if your scout will get away or get trampled by those units on the other side of the forest, et cetera. The diplomacy gives a lot of options for mindgames, betrayal and friendship. Surprising your ally who is about to take a cultural victory by launching an invasion assisted by a nuclear missile can be completely game-changing if executed well. I highly recommend this game to anyone remotely interested in this game, it's timeless.

review: THe game is really good. I have spent about a good bit of time playing. Its not a total waste of money. The game feels more like a simulator than strategy. All the CPUS can have different personalitys and actually have a think more. Even on Easy the CPUS are making good descisions. The game also lets you choose a historical figure such as Alexander the Great, Washington, Ramses, Elizabeth, and Augustus Caesar. Multiplaye is pretty good to. With a special chat syste, you not really need any voice speaking. All the mechanics make the game intresting and fun. I would say Sid did a good job on this game. My Rating is 9/10 (THis game is one of the best I have seen)

review: There's no such thing as a 'quick game' in Civilization V. And the thought of 'just one more turn, then I'll...' will creep up and gobble up your time. It's immersive, looks good and there's so many options that you'll be a bit overwhelmed if you've never played a Civ before. Playing the board game isn't a really good reference, I might add. Luckily, I had help with learning the game and once you have, it's just great fun. Keep a clock nearby, though. It won't be long before you think it's just past 11 and it really is 2 AM.

review: I've been playing Sid Meier's Civilization games since the first one came out in the early 1990's. The series has given me hours of entertainment and more than a few nights of missed sleep. Civilization V was a bit shaky at launch, but the developers seem to have worked out the bugs, and it is now an excellent game.

review: Start with nothing and build a global empire, use diplomacy, trade, economic sanctions and brute force to expand over your foes. Re-enact real life histrorical events such as; Ghandi being a  and nuking your cities in 1700 AD. Queen Elizabeth lecturing you on your expansionist policies. and much much more... Fun game to play, but it's such a time sync it's unreal, start a game at midday on a saturday, and you won't have finished it by the next week. Fun & lengthy gameplay, 8/10 would recommend.

review: This game is addictive for any RTS or world-builder fan. The addition of the Gods & Kings DLC though truly makes this a must-have. The Gods & Kings DLC completely rebalances and overhauls the game in too many ways to list, starting with the wonders, the buildings, the units, the combat system, diplomacy, navel warefare, and adds religion and espionage elements to the game for the truly detail-oriented RTS gamers that enjoy maximizing their strategies. There are few things left to critique with the G&K expansion now added, other than perhaps the sheer length of time a "standard" turn game will require! The only major issue consumers need to be aware the map pack DLC is for single player only, which is unfortunately as multiplayer would greatly benefit from the revised, fixed, or tweaked stock maps it includes.

review: This game is by far the biggest time suck I have ever installed. I've been playing Civ since the first one came out on my dad's Pentium and have probably logged more hours at it than at any job I've ever held. Not that I haven't worked full time, just that when Civilization takes over, sometimes is 24 hours a day for a whole weekend. Not a game for the feint of heart or those with many commitments and tight schedules.

review: One of the best incarnations of the Civ series. I know a lot of the hardcore players mourn the loss of the unit stack, but I prefer the one unit per tile style, even if the implementation has a few issues. With so many difficulty options, I recommend this to just about anyone. Start on the easy difficulty and work your way up. I'm still missing a win on the absolute top difficulty, but I'll get it eventually!

It is far less advance then the fourth and that can be a disappointment for some old timers like me. But if u give it time you will see that the new battle-system makes this a much more enjoyable combative experience than any in the series. A must buy for everyone, experience players will awe, after some time. New players will find this much more enjoyable then the fourth.

review: I was just strolling around during the Industrial Era as the Germans and I see some Indian Troops. I befriend them not knowing what horror I unleashed upon my 3 city empire. He comes two turns later and offers me open borders, and I accept, assuming he is really chill dude. I send out two of my heavily promoted riflemen that defend my main cities when all of a sudden Ghandi sends his troops straight at all of cities except Berlin. I thought that he just sent them to protect me assuming that he may have believe to be an attack from the Japanese that I was at war with, even though the fighting stopped for a while. Next turn I get a declaration of war from Ghandi. Feeling very betrayed, I sent my cannons towards his modern infantry with all of my might. After this, I see a horrible sight... from all of his cities (about 5 or 6) he sent nukes at all of my cities and right infront of my riflemen, cutting them off from saving us from what happened next. Seven Modern Infantry come rolling in at my final doorstep. In an attempt to stop them, I spend my whole treasurey on troops to defend, only to be attacked head on by Ghandi. My whole lifes work, down the drain. NEVER TRUST GHANDI! By the way, great game!
