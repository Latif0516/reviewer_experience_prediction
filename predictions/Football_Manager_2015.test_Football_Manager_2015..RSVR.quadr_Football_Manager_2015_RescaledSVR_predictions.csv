The transfer market is nice but the scouting is terrible and you never get a players full report unless you scout him for months which doesn't help if you're in a bind toward the end of the transfer window.

This is a company that has been excellent in the past at implementing user ideas. In the past few season such bugs as far too many injuries (they argue there are fewer than real life, blah, blah) and goal keepers who just let the ball in after catching it have been glaring issues, just to name two examples but I could go on like this for hours with things they just choose to ignore or tell us are not issues at all. The new user interface is just trash, especially the tactics screen and this does not seem to be getting addressed despite cries from the user base, once again.

ObjectId('5554f294c134cf3ebe2f5046'),"--- Below is my original review, but I have changed it from recommended to not recommended, because even after patching, the game and match-engine is unrealistic; how could the programmers not realise this? I regret buying it and have gone back to FM14.--- This game is definitely not as bad as some of the reviews say, though it does have it's problems. I'd definitely recommend this to fans of the series. Let's go through the pros and cons: Pros: - I like the new UI, I think it's improved on previous titles, with things like scouting/transfers in more logical places - It runs smoother: you no longer have that weird 10 second pause when changing tactics in a match; instead it takes less than 2 seconds. This means you can make lots more changes in the match withou being annoyed by the pause every single time. - I haven't seen the oft mentioned issues with getting lots of injuries; its stayed around the same as previous titles on that front for me. -Player interaction and media interaction are considerably improved Cons: - Weirdly takes longer to save than FM14. Over a minute and a half for me. - The games ARE too high scoring, and this needs to be patched for realism purposes. I just had 5 games that were 6-3, 6-3, 5-3, 0-0 (lol) and 6-3 again... a bit silly... - Goalkeepers are pretty bad, hence the high scores. - It feels like it's harder to play a possession game, but that might be just because I'm Leicester. It's a fun game; I'm definitely glad I bought it. Good for fans of the series; if patched it could be brilliant.

ObjectId('5554f294c134cf3ebe2f5047'),I've bought every Football manager game after the big split and a fair few champ man ones before that. Have to say I'm slightly disappointed by this years offering. Very little of interest has been added. Sure more conversations to be had but the quickly boil down to the same six or seven answers your're always giving. The management style is fun but quickly seems pointless and gaining the licenses if little more that a tick box exercise. The engine does look better and although far from perfect the board interaction is more detailed but with the bugs still there. What has to be the most annoying part for me though is the amount of time the game wants you to do basic HR work. From the exciting world or contact negotiations to micro managing every action your apparently half witted staff carry out is long winded. It's made even more annoying by the fact your backroom staff rarely follow you and often the first few weeks at a new club (admittedly usually lower league for me) is spent waiting to get a assistant manager before being able to do anything at your new club. All in all it's more of the same and the updates are enough to keep me interested.I hope that more effort is but into making the game more fun for those of us who like played 10/20 seasons into the future. More interesting press conferences with much more answer variety and maybe the ability to negotiate not just a move for you but your whole backroom staff. It's a begrudging yes vote from me but hopefully with improvements in the future.,10,1

You can buy/sell as you please as well as hire/fire staff as you please and you ride the highs and lows of football management. If you've played the older versions of this game this game is a slight improvement upon them. This version has added extra features and improvements which most are very much in the background. Truth be told the same issues with the preivous versions still exist in this version to a certain extent, such as the AI (at times in rare cases) is very frustrating and downright poor. AI issues have been adressed in the latest update, but much like many other games the orignal version was released unfinished/unpolished. Much like the FIFA franchise this game slightly improves elements such as graphics and adding one or two features which in my opinon is unacceptable there is alot of potentail and the creators should look to improve much more (Such as the match engine and overall media/player interaction). To be more positive the game is fun, challengeing and does feel like an improvement the match engine is getting better and the accuracy of transfers between clubs is better, however the next version must have significant improvement in order to prevent the franchise from becoming stale. For football fans who enjoy the small details involed with football and would ratrher be at the helm of a club rather than a player this game is for you.

Tactics have been spot on, I also tested a few tactics from the Workshop and I was surprised at how good some of them were - but it didn't make an instant difference.

It's overall a great and addicting game and my favourite yet if i'm honest. However, the match engine, although improved, is quite poor and freak goalkeeper mistakes don't seem all that freak anymore as they occur quite a few times each season. However i'm pretty sure the match engine isn't much to go by (the commentary sometimes says completely different things to what the match engine shows - e.g player shoots really wide but the commenary claims it was almost in) this isn't much of a problem in all honesty and if you had commentary on only you wouldn't ever notice. The new menu layout is really good in my opinion and finding what I want to do is now much easier and quicker making me actually pay more attention to tactics, training and scouting (which I have often ignored to a large extent in previous games) Overall I'd say this game is great and the series is still going strong.

ObjectId('5554f294c134cf3ebe2f508e'),"wont be buying football manager 16 as this game is on another level such as price you have to pay for players it can be up 2000% there value, wingers run and gradually slow down then are tackled and if a ball goes over the line it is a goal but according to football manager thats not a goal and what is it with clubs not having the badge plus cup logos and kits all ready included if i pay 30 pound for a game i want the game to have the club logos and cup logos and real names many many thing needed to be improved the acutual 3d game when watched is nothing like football a child could tell that 5/10 need serious improvement to match the price p.s sicki baba",2,1

ObjectId('5554f294c134cf3ebe2f5090'),Not the best verion of FM but certainly not the worst. Yes there are bugs and irritations but still playable.,5,4
ObjectId('5554f294c134cf3ebe2f5091'),"Love the series, but this is only adding to the manner in which FM's match engines are getting worse and worse. In my onw opinion, the series has been in huge decline since 2012; and this is absolutely no exception. Own goals here, own goals there. 5 goals here, 10 goals there. Goalkeepers? Ha. Until SI fix the match engine - something that I'm doubting will actually happen after the way that the FM14 engine was awful throughout - don't purchase this. Find 2012 online somewhere and play the last game in the series that I can say was a really enjoyable game.",2,3

It's just boring to play and sh*t, I thought playing with my friends would make it a bit more fun..... yet again how wrong was I, having to wait all the fu*king time just for some c*nt to press continue. The gameplay is w*nk, poor graphics and not even real names of the clubs are used. If you want to buy this game as something fun to play then don't it's sh*t.",1,1

ObjectId('5554f294c134cf3ebe2f5094'),"Very disappointed with this years game. Lots of screens have been changed and they are now harder to navigate and make the changes you need that before - seems like a bad change to me. A few of my grievances: The squad selection screen, you now can't left click on a substitute to chose who to swap them with You can't create custom views for the opposition instructions screen - WHY?!? Who thought that was a good idea? I'm also not really a fan of the new match engine but I can't put my finger on what I don't like. Is it too bright, choppy (even with graphics levels set low). *sigh* On the whole, I wish I hadn't bought it.",10,4
ObjectId('5554f294c134cf3ebe2f5095'),"Quite different from the earlier versions and will take some time to adapt. Some new fixes, but all in all it feels more or less just like an updated version of FM14 with transfers etc. Would still recommand, unless you have higher expectations to the game.",3,2

ObjectId('5554f294c134cf3ebe2f5097'),bought original game and got a crash dumps error. No topic have solved the problem in the forums. No help from anywhere. Don't even buy game. t is waste of money!!  am so regretfull. Shame on you fm producers and steam employee,3,1
ObjectId('5554f294c134cf3ebe2f5098'),"So frustating. I don't know what's wrong. I feel like i lost my ability to play this game. I am noob all over again. (been playing since 2001). - My team keep shooting didn't score. The enemy 1 bullet to the heart! And of course i lost the game. - My wing back keep dribbling until byline won't cross, and if he do the crosses hit enemy foot and goes corner kick. frustating. - My goalie is dumb, enemies goalie is all NEUER! unbeatable. I need. or we all need MAJOR FIXES. please. :(",2,1
ObjectId('5554f294c134cf3ebe2f5099'),"Although the most challenging of the series so far, more because of the new adaption to the layout and the scouting methods. For me its a big improvement on user interface but the harsh amount of injuries it makes progression a longer task where you have to put mild detail into the smaller things instead of throwing it to your below par AM. I suggest it if you put a good amount of time into the later games but for a newbie 13/14 would be a safer choice in the way of enjoyment of the game and winning things.",1,3
ObjectId('5554f294c134cf3ebe2f509a'),"I have owned and loved every football manager game, but have to say that this new game is very hard to get into, and the menus in particular the finding players is all near impossible. Bought it 2 days ago, have gone back to my old game on FM2014. 2/10, not a happy customer!!!",7,2
ObjectId('5554f294c134cf3ebe2f509b'),"I dont know why there is so much negative reviews out there, the game is great and the new scouting is much more realistic now. I've played this version since the beta (12 november) and I've only encountered 3 crashes overall so don't worry too much about that. New interface feels great, just need to get used to it. Regarding the ME, there seem to be a lot of goal from crosses making a tactic with wingers like 4-5-1 maybe too rewarding. I've already played +100hours in several top and bottom div and I haven't noticed much irrealistics things happening, you still get a few dumb keeperes/dc mistakes but  happens IRL as well so np. The databases are up to date EXCEPT for the french leagues because sadly french scouts are lazy. But there's already a patch out there for Ligue 1 and 2 so no worries. Overall pretty solid new opus (I have 700+ hours on most FM since FM2010), people need to stop crying when City, Chelsea, the PSG etc... are buying wonderkids for 20+Millions because that's what's happening IRL duh.",3,1
