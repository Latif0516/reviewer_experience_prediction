"lots of glitches bugs and crashes. my computer is very able to run the game with a powerful quad core and gtx graphics card it isnt my hardware that is the problem. the game can just run like a potato sometimes. and the online part of the game is terrible unless you like getting spawn killed by people who spent real money to buy the weapons they kill you with 5/10",55.8
"amd users download beta 15.4 drivers!!!! game run awfully before like basically unplayable. now the game is a improvement (max settings some stuttering occasionly) however still not very optimised.... rockstar please sort your **** out. other than that well its gta v.... so have fun!",19.0
"extremely good looking, great performance, time waster game. a few annoying bugs that may be from hardware customizations, fyi",27.4
"first person view ftw. i really like the features. make me feel that im playing a bit of payday style.",53.1
"great game, origonally thought this was going to run terribly on my pc, but this runs smooth as hell, great game play, and even for a pc edition, good contols",5.4
"uninstall simulator - 5 days no fix - exited unexpectedly",26.9
"this stupid game sais in the lucncher loading like an half-hour nad my friends it donesnt do this",12.7
"go to the highest mountain! look at the view! jump from there and then land facing down! best game ever! especially with friends 10/10",8.1
"at this time, multi-player is a complete unplayable mess for me, i have more time spent looking at loading-screens than having fun. -going to your desktop and returning to game doesnt work -after a time the loading screen is stuck at a multiplayer lobby (note that the screen is moving in panoramic mode so my computer isnt freezed due to hardware limits) -connecting a xbox-pad and keyboard at the same time can cause unintended inputs really disapointed at this moment, i hoped for an exelent port upon release after 2 brief delays. note: i will edit this review, up until a fixed patch is released",20.0
"very good game but i can not recommend it because the game crashes while playing the mission blitz play so you can not complete the game.",40.6
"best pc launch since i can remember. game runs smooth as butter with no problems on very high! (running a single 680 gtx atm)",62.1
"jerking while your friend is in the shower is the best feature of the game",35.8
"i will write a substantial review once i finish watching daredevil on netflix while periodically trying to actually get into the game since it wont even get past the play gta window. daredevil: one of the best shows on at the moment. 10/10",23.8
"found the strip club pretty early on. got caught up in private dances because of all the  cash the preorder gave me. ended up getting a girl named infernus to max pleasure, and she offered to take me back to her place. went to pick her up around back, she ran into my car and fell over as i pulled up, and the screen told me infernus is scared. and she walked away. so i got out of the car and went after her. ended up cocking her in the back of the head and getting 17 bucks. so i go back in the strip club, and find her dancing again. take her into the back for another private dance. max out her pleasure again, she offers to take me back to her place. dont let her run into my car this time. she gets in and i drive super carefully all the way to her crib. get there, get out of the car, we walk inside and... sun goes down and up, next day, im outside her place. i dont know what i was expecting. 10/10, would punch her in the back of the head again for 17 dollars.",50.8
"wow. just wow. playing on a gaming laptop with 8 gigs of ram, 980m card and i7 processer. this game runs smooth as butter. maxed everything with 45-60 fps. my hats off to rock star. this goes to show that delays are a good things. it clearly shows with gtav. this isnt a port, this is a master piece. if youve never played gtav then this is a perfect time to do so, if you have and youre on the fence because of worries about performace issues and such, then let me be the one to calm your beating heart. if you have the rig to play other high profile games then this one will not dissapoint.",16.3
"i have never experienced a more horrible game upon release. even after waiting two years after the original console release, rockstar still cant get it right. i have been waiting for over 10 minutes for the story line to start (still waiting) just to see if those horrible graphics glitches (clipping) have been solved. admittedly, i do not have a state of the art system anymore, but still one that is well within the boundaries of the demanded specs. i know the game can run fluently on my system with pretty high settings: i experienced it in one session. the rest is just one awful experience. i am going to wait two more weeks for patches to fix these problems. if not, i will demand my money back.",7.5
"this game is amazing. the graphics are beutiful and the game mechanics run smoothly. defintely well worth what i paid for it. i recomend this game to anyone who anyone who enjoys robbery games such as payday 2.",24.0
"roads dissapearing, game temp freezing... well i dont have a good gaming pc. if youre reading this and question your pcs capabilities, i advise you to immediately forget about buying this game (unless youre sure you can run this) have a good day, enjoy reading the other reviews.",2.1
"hands down the best gta game of all time. even on my old l702x i can run this game pretty smoothly on normal settings!",25.6
"slept only 5 hours(taking naps in between) after its release, its mind blowing. for a game that was released in 2013, it doesnt feel like its old. the real mvp? my girlfriend. even tho she despises gaming, but for this she let me play for extended hours ^_^",81.0
"really well optimized, compared to gta iv, the graphics are amazing, even in the lowest settings, the shadows are unbeliavable, tottaly soft and without pixels. the only bad thing is the lot of problems that came on the launch day. lots of people trying to download, install, open, but without success. i had to deactivate my nvidia gt 630m and use the intel hd graphics 4000 to launch the game, then activate the offboard gpu to run it, because the launcher crashes at every try. worth the money and the wait, but me and tons of people are still waiting for those compatibility fixes. 8/10",19.0
"if youve played grand theft auto v on consoles, then you wont be disappointed. if you havent, youre in luck because this is indeed the definitive version. in my opinion, rockstar have done a wonderful job developing the game for pc. it was well worth the wait. the amount of graphical options means you can tweak the game to how you like it, especially if youre limited by hardware. the addition of the rockstar editor is just he icing on the cake. you may not be pleased with the price point due to when the game was released, but think of it as a brand new game being released in 2015 (because its that good).",31.3
"incredible game, even works on fairly low-end pcs and to everyone who cant even start the game, you need to go into devices and printers and deactivate your graphics card and then launch gta, and enable the graphics card as soon as gta is about to begin.",27.7
"total disregard with the players. spent 24 hours after launch and yet rockstar even made a statement. not recommend for you who are reading this analysis can purchase the game and can not play it . and just remember : i bought the pre sale ....",13.0
"now r* should go reskin san andreas and make it work this well on pc bring the graphics up to date and i would pay full price for that again. gta v is making me happy, i had low expectations after the last decades worth of r* failure. i was not going to buy the game. but i am glad i did. it works really well, plays very smoothly i have had no issues at all. only reason i stopped playing was to pop in my own music. now i am off to play again until i die in my chair from not eating or moving. good bye.",50.8
"cant get into the game yet, i dont even get trough loading screen, it just keeps on say loading, like forever. i mean wtf!!!!!  rocksteady, plz fix your !! ???????????????????????????????????",24.6
"now that they patched it so it launches its nice graphics are  with a gtx5770 though and a penom ii but that thats not their fault.",19.7
"shelled out 60 dollars for this game and it wont even play no matter what i do and heaven forbid there be a live person to talk to. i am now out 60 bucks for a game i cant even play.",2.1
"you dont need me to tell you how good this game is, but i can say that the pc version is the best version of the game with its extensive array of settings. fully bindable keys ,ability to have own radio station of your favourite songs and ofcourse the ability to transfer old characters from previous versions 10/10 buy this if you can run it",30.3
"the quality is good, this was worth the wait. the only problem is that i have no idea what to do online",17.8
"im sorry but i really have been waiting to play the pc but it keeps on crshing and now i dont want it may i have a refund",1.6
"i know how a few words dont make a review, but if you really need to know why to buy this game, you really shouldnt.",55.5
"cant even play the ing game. 10/10 - ign but srs i keep getting an error called err_gen_input_2",44.4
"not sure why i spent $60 on a 2 year old game, but thats a different story. pros: there was a lot of time spent on the game and that shows with the detail in the landscape. fun missions. interesting characters. lots of replayability. cons: there is nothing smooth about this game. nothing functions as it should. same old gta physics. you cannot customize expensive cars without purchasing them. you cannot steal a nice car and claim it as your own, despite the title of the game being grand theft auto. the community is awful. you cant do anything without a rude player killing you or harrassing you.",20.2
"smooth like plane into towers 911/10 nah, but for real, really good ing port. runs smooth as butter.",38.2
"i cannot recommend this game for anyone, as after the release date being pushed back, the game still does not work at launch. or 72 hours after launch. so now i am supposed to re download this game on my desktop that i never use anymore, instead of playing it on my much ****ing nicer laptop. thanks rockstar.",12.7
"i have been waiting for this game forever! and i cant even play for 10 minutes without it randomly crashing its unplayable!",51.6
"hit me hit me hit me hit me hit me hit me hit me hit me hit me hit me hit me hit me hit me with those laser beams. pewpewpewpewpewpewpewpewpewpewpewpewpewpewpewpewpewpew .... pewpewpew its gtav for pc. why the hell havent you bought this game yet?",37.4
"only in this country do they let blind people drive! 10/10",94.5
"the game is perfect. you should buy it because i like it! trevor/10",87.9
"to keep it really short and simple, it was definitely worth the wait for the pc version of gta v. it runs like a dream and looks just as nice as ir runs. pcmr ftw!",18.2
"piece of crap. does not download properly, does not sign into social club at all. i have wasted two complete nights trying to get it work and when it finally did, the game crashed. thanks for the great support and the ripoff. actually sorry, i am getting my refund right now",12.2
"very nice game, played it on ps3 and still the same feeling. runs very smoothly, but the only bad thing is: the high cpu usage. i can change everything, but my cpu is always on 100%, still on low settings. and this causes no texture loading while driving, which is very bad.",74.9
"game is broken at lanch online keeps crashing major lag issues, single player grapthic issues dont buy untill they fix",69.9
"i thought the cat was dead. i stepped on him.... now hes dead. dead cat / dead cat",15.9
"gta v is absolutely awsome, and covers all my expectation of the game. the game runs smoothly, the setting is beautiful, and has easy controls.",15.2
"pretty well optimized. even my potato computer with a deacent graphics card taped to the side of it can run it at a steady 60 fps",11.1
"a lot of bug herecant connect with windows live when i sign in, cant play online offlane bothcostumor service so bad",12.8
"gta v and there bugs! i downloaded cracked version much more faster!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",21.0
"it`s gta... enough said pros: it`s gta cons: it`s gta",79.9
"this game was worth the wait and worth the purchase. i highly recommend it. i have no major problems and can play it just fine. my pc specs- windows 7 home premium 64 bit amd athlon(tm) ii x3 450 processor (3 cpus), ~3.2ghz memory: 8192mb ram nvidia geforce gtx 660 dedicated memory: 2048 mb",58.7
"good game. do reccomend this game. crazy lag after 10 - 20 minutes into the game and must restart the game after. hope theres a fix/patch for this issue.",23.6
"amazing game! couple glitches but it is still the first week. i bet it will be patched",11.7
"well... its not even a question. buy it. the only reason you wouldnt have that game, is because of your low  specs!",60.1
"if you havent bought this game yet, youre an idiot.",71.7
"nice work rockstar and take my money . 10/10 should buy this game !",43.1
"one of the greates games ever made. played it for the first time today. 10/10!",16.7
"it is not working it is stuck on the social club screen please fix",3.4
"its great cause my modest rig can run this at 1080p 60 fps, the game is very well optmized",41.4
"1080p, 60fps. id like to thank all console players for beta-testing gta v! 10/10",48.0
"perpare for the steam reviews to be full of my game runs at 60 fps ultra settings 4k thx 4 beta testing consul fegs comments instead of actual helpful reviews.",18.0
"game is amazing. graphics are insane. im running a amd fx-8320 (8core), 8gb ram, gts 450 sc, with a 36in 1080p monitor and i play in very high and i still get around 65fps. theres still many bugs but its playable and the bugs do not affect you there just funny bugs. (people belly flop when u shoot them in water) <--theres a bug.",68.5
"very overrated. takes too long to have any fun online, and when you get to it enemies can take too many hits and players take too little. near constant sound of sirens. the quickest ive ever been bored in an open world game.",18.0
"this game is a legend, and with modding we the master race will make it even better. buy it.",60.7
"this is the perfect game. let me explain why: - it performs really well from a technical point of view, even on older machines. - the story is enriched with high quality non repetitive action missions with excellent acting and very amusing dialogue. - the characters are fascinating, with unique interesting personalities which makes them very likeable and you can easily relate with them and root for. - the gameplay is highly responsive, the driving mechanics are very satisfying and diverse with different cars. - has great replayability and an immense, detailed interesting open world to explore. in short, it has everything you ever want in a videogame and if you dont agree with this sentence, you might want to re-evaluate your videogame standards.",12.2
"a lot of issues that should be expected at launch, but so far i am really enjoying this game.",17.4
"amazing port ! my pc just meet the minimum system requirements but still running at 60fps at medium settings",24.6
"i dont have friends to play with.. 10/10 would buy again",8.7
"complete joke cant use activation code supplied through steam for the game cant get support but it tells me i have played game when i dont even know how to get it to accept code bloody joke dont buy it",1.3
"its a good game. pc controls are surprisingly not . good old hooker killing fun. 10/10",6.3
"bex65 crash over and over, would love to play a game i have waited this long for while trying to shut up all my friends playing it on console so it was fresh still. please fix so i may right a real review.",78.3
"grand theft autos next installment of the series, or atleast the port for it, is superb. i was one of the people who could not for the life of me wait for this game, yet would be unsure if it would be a good port. after playing 6 hours straight i have to say, even after beating the game twice, it feels like a whole new game. this is the ultimate version, i highly reccomend it, it runs great and looks amazing. 10/10 would wait again (pls no dont let me wait) ps: totally worth the having all the dlcs at launch, we aint gotta wait for hiest #pc masterace",19.3
"the king of open world ( for now) with the modding community making stuff and more content coming there is always some thing to do online single player is awesome online is way better comparaed to consoles 4k support / 60fps support / dx12 when out as always its best on pc ... steam even better ^_^ this game will proform as good as your pc will let it",38.8
"i havent had any problems but my friend keeps crashing so just a warning to all.",42.1
"its everything i expected it to be, and its amazing.",39.8
"rockstar managed to make this a great port, so its a no-brainer whether to get it or nah. 11/10",60.7
"the launcher crashes instantly, meaning that almost 3 days after launch i still cant play. it also has nothing to do with the windows username problem",1.0
"absolutly steller launch. ultra settings with no lag at all. online servers all worked out perfectly. no bugs as of yet. better launch on pc than any big studio game in quite a while.",38.0
"10/10 i finally found a game that made my wildest desire to come true... kicking a ing cat in the face and then stomp his little head till i get tired.",27.9
"this game ruined my life, and here goes back again.",19.8
"you know whats funny? i have 7 mins of gameplay and i havent even played the ing game. the game never ing launches.  you rockstar you money hungry es. burn in a fire.",13.6
"honked the trollololol theme whilst driving on the walk pavement whilst avoiding everyone walking there guy pulls me out of the car chalenging me to a fist fight i kill him with my bare hands i get four stars for doing so and the police did not yet anything but you ! 10/10 would troll again",48.6
"*edit* turns out installing service pack 1 for windows 7 fixes the issue. (admittedly the system requirements do state that). as far as the pc port goes, this is very good. it runs better than gta iv does on my system and looks utterly georgeous. im running at 1080p 60fps on a mixture of high and medium with a gtx 760, which is very impressive.",39.1
"quite the many issus with this game. a lot of crashes due to frame rate drop and graphix errors. very buggy.",22.7
"epic game sick resolution with the gtx 780 i love it !",59.9
"some bugs, of course. but fantastic game. (owned game for about 4 days and have 43 hours logged... plus full time student so yeah... its good.)",43.5
"finally the complete version. online seems to be running good so far. if u want gta 5 get this all the mods and the extra video creator should make for good times",13.5
"i remember it saying that i would get a extra 350k for pre-ordering gta before march 31...... didnt happed ... but i still got the 1 mil for online and 500k or the story mode. i have a decent computer ( not a monster but a good one ) and it runs very smooth on my settings. it look beautiful btw. there are also bugs like when you rob a grocery store and the door wont open leaving you stranded in there, also when i am driving close to a bridge i see a giant grey triangle right inside of it which confuses me because i can see everythibg around it quite nicely but its just that damn bridge. what would i rate it ?? based on day one errors ( that have been fixed within 24 hours ) and bugs and minor glitches....... a solid 8. this is a must buy if you have not played the consloe versions or if you have some extra cash to throw around. notice: gta online works now fyi just incase you dont know or if you heard it is broken.",8.7
"well after playing for about 2 days i am done with it ... i tried to play the game and was taking my car to my lockup and got sticky bombed ok thas cool dude wants to start a war i am down.... so i gear up and hop in a ride and drill him going full speed he gets up teleports behind me and guns me down so i respawn and empty an entire clip into his head and he runs over and butt smacks me to death .... then gets in my personal veichle (set to me only) and drives off my 3 tone pos because its all i can afford because apparently the only hiest anyone is doing is prison break and i cant compelete any of those with an antique pistol i am all for l2p noob but seriously teleporting? taking a full smg clip to the head and not taking any damage from an infernus driven at full speed up your a** so in summary full of chaters and not really all that fun if you want it for a 1 player game its nice its gta and who doesnt love gta but as far as online goes until they get serious about the hackers dont even bother",40.5
"for once, this is the first pc port i have ever bought for $60 to say that it was well worth the full price. game runs smoothly and i havent run into any major glitches so far on launch day. however, if you have a crappy pc, dont expect it to run well whatsoever. ive noticed this with some reviewers complaining that the game had limited video settings and bad lag just because their video card didnt have enough vram or their processor wasnt good enough to handle the load. aside from the windows user account name bug, the game is great. tl;dr: game is shiny and smooth, 5/5 would delay again.",31.8
"first play of gta online, spawned in the middle of nowhere. got on first-person felt like skyrim and was shocked in awe by the scenery!! 11/10",27.1
"best pc game available 10/10 would wait 6 years again",20.5
"dont buy this game yet. wait untill the summer sales or so, maybe those uncapable guys at rockstar will be able to make their game playable for everybody. we waited since november for it, they changed its release date three god damn times. i payed 60 euros for a game i cant even play, which is quite much for me, i dont know about you. at a later point, i will edit this review, and i hope that i will be able to change it into something more positive. (sorry if my english gave you cancer, im not a native english speaker///feel free to add me, i always like to play with new people, mostly co-op games^^) ps: the above is based on the freedom of speech, and is my personal opinion!",42.5
"why isnt this game working? this is ing . it crashes for me before it even loads. you had one job rockstar.",1.2
"minecraft is my favourite game ever. i dont know what else to say but, gta 5 pc is also my favourite game ever.",43.0
"love the gme 10/10 but the game is demanding on your graphics card so i would make sure you have a good one to fully enjoy this game !",12.3
"ps3 & xbox360 thanks for alpha testing. xbox one & ps4 thanks for beta testing.",22.5
"damn good. just needs a patch/nvidia drivers to sand down the performance a little. the performance is not necessarily horrible but it aint perfect/very good either. decent. the modern age classic game... this game is hude. huge map, environment. beautiful stellar graphics. best performance on the pc. so much to do and you can sink hours into the game!! ive only scraped the surface with 5-6 hours of playtime.",23.9
"this game 10/10 is better then the console version. the aiming, the community, the experience, just about everything. definately recommend this game to everyone/anyone wanting a fun online and first person shooter experience.",19.3
"my gta 5 is bugged i cant play it , im sad that i cant play it , i have payed 60 for this ing game and cant even play it gg, .... its only loading someone help me please , i need help please",40.4
"ive purchased this game day one, twice in my life, sof ar. its that good",40.1
"ive never felt more alive than when im punching hookers i once masturbated to in the vanilla unicorn",15.8
"played 16 hours of it in the first day it came out. so yeah, i recommend it.",55.3
"first day had a few hickups as you would expect. but really came together and is rockin. love this game",39.3
"i dont have this game on console, so this is the first time playing. and needless to say, it is amazing!!!!!",58.8
"story isnt great, neither the characters. the supposed irony and social comentary isnt there, dont believe people who says that. its a silly story, with lame supporting cast and bland main cast - excluding trevor, he grows on you. so far, the worst gta story and characters wise. but the best gta technically. its a beautiful game in every aspect and an exemplary port. rockstar did its homework this time: the game is an extraordinary port, really well optimized and ridiculously pretty graphics. even the physics improved in the porting process. gta v on pc is the ultimate experience for this game, believe me. san andreas state is the strongest character youll ever need for this game, followed by the beautifully accomplished vehicles of all sorts and amazing weather effects. oh, and theres the somewhat smooth online experience. if your pc falls between the minimum and recommended specs, just buy it. you wont regret.",42.7
"basically the ultimate edition of gta v runs extremely well, looks fantastic. buy it...you wont regret it :)",7.2
"this game is a very solid pc port. it runs fantastically, the graphics options are lush and plentiful, and i especially like the way that you can seamlessly switch between keyboard/mouse and gamepad (you can even use both simultaneously). gameplay wise-- its the best gta yet. be it doing crazy  online with friends, to the amazing singleplayer campaign, youll certainly put in hours upon hours of gameplay in. definitely recommend to any/all friends.",31.2
"got shot by cops after running across the road... my character is black... and they hit me with the car. 10/10 would run again",28.6
"i finally got the game working after many efforts and it works great! if it is stuck on social loading, update windows!! worked for me",32.6
"wont load launcher at all. now that i got the launcher to load through the website version after having to completely uninstall my firewall it keeps asking for activation key... even though i entered it into the website instead of the launcher... apparently a big mistake.. still cant play the game edit: i got the game to work finally not sure what did it, moving rockstars downloader files over to the steam one, editting the registry values to the latest version value, etc. still not going to give gta 5 a better rating because the game isnt remotely good (i already played singleplayer on console) because the online isnt that amazingly fun at all.",45.8
"wait years for this to come out on pc. spend $70 pre-ordering, spend hours preloading. all for what? jack f**king sh*t. once you click play, the social club launcher or whatever the f it is pops up and says loading (good so far amirite?) 5 seconds into loading, it stops working and closes. there and probably thousands, if not more with this problem and the only thing rockstar comes up with is telling people (myself included) that our pc account names will prevent us from playing. well ive always had an a-z account name. so it sure as sh*t isnt that. i would recommend this game if you could still get your pre order money back. sadly, you cant. hype simulator 2015",48.5
"this game is the best pc game ive played by far its got everything guns hookers cars planes trains bikes the lot i cant put it down ive played all the gta games even played the 2 d one years ago the gta games have come so far im getting a solid 60 fps 1080p on very high settings initially i couldnt get the game up and runing im playing on my msi gt60 dominator core i7 4810mq haswell 12 gig of ram paired with a gtx 870m the 3 gig variant fhd matie screen 60 herz linked up to a ben q monitor 1080p so who ever has this gaming lappy and cant get gta 5 up and runing the fix i used was to open up device manager go to display adapters disible the gtx nvidia card the run gta from steam directly as soon as the game starts to open give about 3 seconds before turning the nvidia card back on you have to be quick but not to quick or it wont work it worked for me its a fix in the meantime hopefully rock star north should get a patch out for this problem i tried for ages to get working the launcher kept crashing but as i said the workaround i found is a short term saloution so hope this helps . if any one has a question on this send me a message .",18.0
"i finished gta v on ps3 upon release. i think i purchased gta 6 for pc..damn that game is just amazing, flawless running at 1080p on my alienware laptop using just a {n-vidia 770 gtx m} all settings to very high. gj rockstar",90.5
"just a fun game. from plot, to multiplayer with friends. runs extemely smoothly, very well optimized",37.0
"for some reson i cant start up my gta v game can someone help me?",29.8
"it keeps saying gta 5 game launcher stopped working so i hope they fix it within the next week",57.3
"this game is incredibly realistic. i banged five hookers in one night without condoms and got seven stds and two of them are now pregnant. 10/10 will bang again.",25.6
"pls buy and do heists with me. much luv, ty p.s. dis game is da b0mb, 10/10",55.4
"pc> console, is all i can say. after almost 2 years we can say it was worth the wait.",39.1
"my god this s fun. im sad there is no bowling with my cousin. but there is golf. 11/10 would golf and run over people in the cart again. im running on normal, some standard settings. i dont dip below 40 or 50. specs: i7-4700mq gt 755m 8gb ram 240gb intel 530 ssd 1tb sshd",24.8

"launcher for social club crashes every time, or your money back guaranteed! thanks rockstar! :)",1.0
"thought rockstar would implement 12k for the time it took. still 4k/4k, would burn comp again.",39.3
"in this video game, you can sit down on your couch, watch tv and smoke a cheech-and-chong-sized joint. 10/10 would do things in a video game that i already do in real life.",26.1
"60 hrs into gta v and all i can say is  yeah!!!! this game is game of the year 2015 hands down, graphics are sweet, it runs smooth, a few minor bugs at launch but nothing gamebreaking perhaps the smoothest launch of any aaa game i have ever played.. huge thumbs up.. thanks r*.",87.2
"i remember that i accidently dropped my xbox 360 with the gta v disc in it. the disc broke and i couldnt play anymore. so i waited for pc. when i finnaly knew that it will came to april the 14th i was so excited. just the hype from the xbox 360 release. i really like this game, the graphics are amazing. it couldnt be better. i will continue to play this game and continue to enjoy it.",34.1
"awesome game, way better than the console versions.",32.9
"absolutely amazing! easily the best title in my steam library. though it would be perfect if rockstar fixed the launcher issue for mobile gpus and add an in-game display scaling / downsampling option for those with integrated intel gpu - as of current the scaling doesnt work properly on native resolution.",26.4
"i held out for this game over console because i knew i would get a better experience on pc. i do own xbox 1 and ps4 but sometimes pc is the only way its supposed to be played :). games starts strong with excellent graphics :) only played less than a hour but so far so good . gtx 970 i7 2600k max settings :)",1.7

"worst online gaming experince i have ever had, does not work, its slow the loading screens are un godly and the player base are full of trolls and s, the single player i got stuck as franklin not able to do anything, and that was my breaking point. gta5 is a waste of money do not buy it, stick to your other games",92.9
"r* did amazing job with the pc version. it actually runs better than gta iv! the game looks and plays great. i only wish they would patch first person walking with a keyboard and made fov slider go a little wider. other than that, goty for sure!",36.7

"after the patch, the game ran like it should. because of that, i cant get off. thanks rockstar for destroying another social life.",18.3

"edit: i can open it now. cant even open it. 11/10",28.0
"until they fix the ongoing problem of still a large amount of players that cant even get past the social club this gets a thumbs down. as expected gtav was released to pc with a boat load of bugs just how it was released on ps3 and 360 for the first time. social club support is as horrid as steam support because no one answers your question. i really want to play this damn game but now i have to waittill they fix this game.",7.9
"this is the first review for me and im sad to say its a bad one. the game looks amazing and seems like it would be fun as hell if i could play it. every time i join a free roam server i get a flood of messages saying that everyone disconnected. its really me disconnecting because of some bug. i opened a support ticket with rockstar and they have not replied. doing some research into this i have found that many people across all platforms are experiencing this. rockstar made a guide to fix the problem which said to forward some ports and disable your firewall among others things. well i tried it, and it did nothing. i really hope they fix this but i doubt they will. because this has been going on for years. i think they are just not worried about the few that are getting this bug because the majority are not. just goes to show how much of a  company they are. do not buy this game until they come out with a patch. or risk wasting 60 ing dollars.",15.6
"due to consistent crashes, issues that break the game, horrid rockstar support, and the fact that your entire garage and character can just disappear and rockstar wont say a thing, i would highly reccommend not buying this game until they publically fix these issues.",64.1
"i dont get all these negative reviews mabey they havent optiomised the game yet in their settings because the game runs smooth az no problems 10/10 would pre purchase again",61.4
"its gtav ... on pc ... whit 60 fps ... 11/10 woud play again",26.6
"lets keep it short and simple. singleplayer is great. the story is interesting. there are three different characters with very distinctive personalities that you can control. their have their own missions as well as missions where they work togheter. theres also a lot of things you can do in this game, it feels like its a mix of sim city, payday and need for speed. now, the multiplayer... its great except for the long loading times. you rank up and unlock stuff you can buy, like weapons, attachments, car mods... you can buy your own house, store your cars in the garage. you can play heists with your friends or randoms, you can get killed while you are wandering around los santos. its weird at the beggining, you will feel lost, but once you understand how the multiplayer works, it becomes an addiction. so... the game is totally worth your money. normal price for an aaa title and it gives your hours and hours of fun. not like these ubisoft overpriced and overhyped games that last 20 hours or so.",71.3

"im told i have to choose between male and female for my online character and only males for singleplayer why am i forced to play as only cis scum? ing disgusting and  game overall really good game",57.8
"at the moment not the online part but i transfered my 360 guy and hes level 181 and im bit higher than most so pvp aint fun but it means more missions and helping others with the hardware i have. singleplayer is to die for!!! just breath taking and unbelivable.",20.3
"so ive had a good chance to play the game now. and i am really impressed on how its turned out. graphically, its insane. its really really stunning. driving along the coast at sunset with your own music on the radio. cant complain really. i think it has been worth the wait. glad its here. will be totting up some more hours of online fun. cant wait to see any new additions to the game, such as mods and any new content. for me, it scores a grand 9/10 with every game ever released. theres always room for a little more! :)",90.3
"its basically a corporate conglomeration of sub-transient particles that reconsider their constituents in a particular manner",24.7

"10/10 spent 2 hours unpacking my luggage. soon i will be done so i can exlopre los santos!",28.6
"rockstar has re-learned how to make pc games. better late than never i guess. im on a 3 year old pc (i5-2550, gtx 560ti) and i was worried about being able to run the game at all. its currently running at 60fps on 1920x1080. not maxed obviously but the game still looks pretty darn good. way better than the ps3 version i played over a year ago.",19.2
"its a-ok. wasnt too happy when i found that my product key was already in use so i had to buy it again. love you too, rockstar games.",0.3
"this is an excellent game. the driving is fluid, gunplay is smooth, and graphics are beautiful. ive been playing on my gtx 970, and for people who have this card, i can tell you that there is a solid 60 fps.",21.9
"how amazing does this game look in 4k. i must admit that i played through on the ps4 first. i highly recommend. going to play this one through in first person.",6.3
"day 2: still no fix in sight. game will still not launch and rockstar  all over me once again. none of the fixes work plz healp ;( updated: finally after day 3 it will launch and it is amazing :d",13.8
"i love it!!! i am getting all dlc when they come out.",9.1
"i preordered this game played the  out of it the day it came out and the next and i have 18 hours on the game in 2 days 10/10 would smack an old lady in the face with a baseball bat again. :))))",63.2
"no idea how this is getting so many good reviews. this game freezes randomly which then requires a pc reboot every 10 minutes, with no fix in sight, this is a widespread problem with a large portion of the player base, just read their forums before buying this - wish i did. btw - my pc is also close to top of the line right now, with no issues with any other game since building it 6 months ago.",1.2
"from the minute i started playing i have not been disappointed. this game, as far as my experience goes, has been full of nothing but elation. this game is nothing but amazing right now. i have experienced no issues so far (do note, i only played up to the first reposession mission and no side questing, your experience may vary) and framerates have been very smooth. the graphics, or should i say the game, is amazing for what i have in terms of hardware (gtx 770 2gb, i7 3770k, 16gb ram) and i recommend it wholeheartedly at this point and time.",60.5
"i skipped all the console versions of this game, but what i can say that the engine is an improvement compared to gta iv, and runs pretty good on my machine. i cant play the game on the best settings but i dont mind, most settings are on normal or high, did need to disable msaa/fxaa, but at least i can play in 1920x1080 with 60 fps most of the time. from what i have seen i love the storyline with the different characters and the online mode gives you enough hours of playtime. whatever mode you play in, you will eventually run into awesome moments. at this moment i play the game with keyboard and mouse when on foot or in verhicles and a xbox 360 controller when flying, because the default numlock controls used for flying are horrible. one other downside is that my saitek x52 or any other joystick aint supported by the game, only xbox 360 controllers are supported. i would like to see this feature in the future or hope that i will get some xbox 360 controller emulator working in combination with my joystick.",43.7
"hands down, the best game ever created. 11/10 welldone rockstar.",54.9

"ive tried all the fixes, even reinstalled still clicking play launches social club and stays at loading the entire time. no word from rockstar at all about this problem or any of the other one tons of the community is having. seems like rockstar is more concerned with partying now that the pc version is released instead of fixing any of the day 1 gamebreaking bugs tons of us are having. thanks rockstar. update: well finally over a day after i installed iit, a few hours after reinstalling(didnt need to) i finally found the fix to my problem, installing service pack 1 for windows 7. i looked and looked and didnt find this solution anywhere, and im sure this solution fixes the problem for others. its too bad rockstar isnt trying to get this information out to anyone anywhere. further review of actualy gameplay coming",85.7

"waited 2 years for a game. gets on and gets shot by a policeman in the first mission. 10/10 would fail again. now proper review : runs amazingly even on my lowish end pc but it is a big step up from gta iv and no roman calls :d . the multiple characters is a boosting pro. but the driving is a bit too over controling, and helicopter controls are impossible. also, for such a popular and high standing company wouldnt you think rockstar would have singplayer cloud saves. as i recently upgraded my pc and my singleplayer is complelty gone. rating : 9.3/10",73.3

"i beta tested this on ps3 and then ps4 so you didnt have to. the graphics on this are better than irl so i dont go outside anymore. what even is life anyway? also, what got me thinking is that i heard somewhere that jelly fish are something like 97% water right. so what purpose does that serve? its doing nothing, give it another 3% and just make it water instead. add me on social club - itslloydm8. or steam here. im looking to just have some casual fun on #gtaonline (no water sports though) and my safe word is spaghetti. later bros.",17.3
"game releases. play online. online actually works. cars spawning in eachother. explosions. npcs running in fear from said explosions. cops shooting innocent civilians running away from cars spawning into eachothers explosions. guy shoots and kills me with a sniper while cops continue to shoot civilians. 11/10 would move to los santos again.",34.4
"and second change that negative review to a positive one.",36.5

"i have encountered more than one game breaking bug that has existed for years on console versions of this game. despite many open tickets from countless users, rockstar has yet to post a single working solution to the problem on either consoles or pcs. this is unacceptable; theyve had plenty of time to address this. im powerless to hold them accountable. the only thing i can do is post a bad review, so here it is.",56.3
"absolutely amazing. everything is fun from the missions and heists that you do to the fun mini-games that you can play like tennis, darts, parachuting, and racing. what makes this gta stand out most is its brand online gaming mode which enables players to play a wide variety of different game modes and earn levels and money. its an incredibly polished game and a huge leap from gta iv which was also an excellent game. if youre a fan of gta, you must get this. this is the culminating point of fun and the best sand-box game ever developed thus far.",50.9

"after working for a few hours the game now crashes constantly.",55.7
"social club is the biggest crap i have ever seen. im sorry rockstar but if your going to put a game on steam, dont force us to use something that no one wants. however if you must oppress us in this way, please use something that works.... it let me play once and gta v is a beautiful game yet the next time i had to sign in again, it refused. claiming that either my steam was linked to a different account or locking me out due to too many unsuccessful (heavy sarcasm) log in attempts. i have tried numerous times to log in, change passwords, switch accounts, anything to just play your game, unfortunatly to no avail. i have realized that at this rate it will never work, so thank you for nothing. gta v is a great game but social club ruins it entirely.",36.2

"it is just the best game i have ever played in my entired life! very well made! if the first person mode had the rear view mirrors with quality view at least for the driver i would call it 100%",27.4
"this game is good graphically, very good visuals even for an older pc like my own. for that reason i will give it a thumbs up. the story is very diversified, lots of different situations arise with generally unique results. however, this series suffers from one drawback, considering i tend to enjoy having choices now; there is a distinct lack of choice in how the story goes. this, in my opinion, lowers the re-playability value of the game. while being a great game visually, not having the amount of room that one had back in gtasa is disappointing, not to mention missing some sort of choice making. but i will admit, thats another publishers tendency and not r*s.",2.4

"ok, first, i have to say: why dont you already have this game? and secondly, if you do own the game and are just reading the reviews for chuckles, hello! the silly review (since this game deserves it): upon playing the first time, i was pulled over by a police officer in the small truck-stop town of paleto bay, while driving a rusty tractor down the interstate. probably for going too slow on my journey back to los santos and holding many a semi truck back. then, while waiting for the officer to come around to me, i see his car and him scooting by, being rammed by a small pickup. the pickup was then blown up by a sniper team in a helicopter, for assaulting an officer. continued to los santos on my tractor without further interruption. the serious review: uhhh... later. ive, uhm, still gotta finish the game. pc forever!",64.7

"i never played gta v on console but i have to say this game so far is 10/10 the game runs super smooth on all settings. obviously with better hardware you will get better performance in this game, but dont expect to be able to max all of the adcanced settings unless you are sitting on 2 x titan xs. story is really really fun the charachters are all very different from one another and have there own unique characteristics. map is really big, los santos is also really diverse so the ares are all unique and dont get boring with overused textures, vehicles, npcs. the driving in this game is really fun. there are plenty of fast exotic cars and bikes for you to rip through the city or kick it hard on the off road on a dirtbike or raised pickup. the game itself has a lot of personality. the npcs that walk around the city will all react to you and you will even be able to respond to some which results in some pretty good dialogue . ill add in a bit about gta online once i have experienced it all",26.7
"truly amazing. excellent port, i can almost max it out( in 1080). graphics are solid, and gameplay is amazing. controls are top notch, havent had any issues. the game is obviously the same, but pc has better damage, and a first person mode, among the much better graphics. the first person is a huge part of the game. every car interior is different, the lights on the dash function, small dings when you open the door, everything is detailed. the guns you hold in your hand have been redone, looking amazing from a first person perspective. definetely worth the buy, a pc game done right. #pcmasterrace",36.5
"does not function - does not function - i repeat! does not function thats right - you waited about two years for gta 5 - the game that sold more copys then the titanic - does that mean rockstar (after several delays mind you) the game does not launch, and there are hundreds of thousands of people who cant play due to several different errors. yup rockstar likes your money, not you.",24.1

"this game is incredible! not only is it optimized for pc, but the graphics and pretty much everything have made the pc version a definitive version. however, there are a few quirks for this game, at least for me. also, keep in mind most of these problems are specific to online. first is that the stocks for bawsaq in story mode seem to be broken (not moving) for now, but i believe it will be fixed in a new update soon. the second is that transferred characters have a few problems on them, notably the lipstick problem. however, it can be fixed through a simple trip to the barber shop, but even then, it is an inconvenience. those are pretty much the only problems. overall, this game was worth the wait and delays, considering how polilshed it is. i do, however, believe that we will be seeing new features, as well as performance optimizations from rockstar in the next few weeks.",56.0
"although i reccomend this game, i reccomend you get it later, after some optimization updates have been released. im getting fps drops on lowest quality just driving. i dont think rockstar could have made a worse port to pc. it could be that its just hot in my room. i dont know, but seriously rockstar. come on. you had 2 years to make a pc version, and you ed it up with your  optimization. all this aside, gta v is a great ing game. note: ive fixed my issue, but people are still having problems with the port. second note: people on gta online dont know how to do the prison break.",35.0
"by all accounts a good, well optimized game. the ui, controls are fantastic. the graphic options and graphical quality is exceptional, especially for the performance i get on low-end hardware. they really put a lot of work into optimizing this and tweaking the engine to perfection. far more than any company has anything else released in years. that is, if it runs at all. theyre dragging their feet about fixing the myriad of issues which plague many players. at this time i do not recommend buying it with a 50% chance that itll just crash repeatedly, either during the intial launch of the launcher itself, or during gameplay.",52.9
"amazing game, rockstar obviously wanted to do the best delivery of a game they could and even if they didnt, that was achieved anyway but im sure they were. amazing graphics, better than any console graphics, 60fps makes it so much better and feel like youre actually there at times when youre in the amazing... 1st person mode! which you get on ps4 and xbox one anyway but still it looks way better on the pc. director mode makes it way better aswell because you can play as so many different characters and costumed characters which is alot of fun when bored in the game. definitely recommended (if you have a graphics card of atleast radeon hd 7770) but it might look alright on a lower one, but yeah definitely recommended!",16.4
"i would love to offer a review of this game, if it would even start. maybe if rockstar got up off their beanbag chairs filled with 100 dollar bills and weed and realized nobody wants to deal with social club, it could be launched using steams perfectly fine overlay, and this whole  issue with social club blanking out would be resolved. but, then again we have to rememebr its not as if they actually give a  about any of their customers. review staying negative until i can actually play, which im guessing wont happen until wednesday of next week, if i know rockstar.",16.5
"if youre on the fence about paying full price for this, let me give you some advice: do it! i dont have much money to spend on games, but this has got the be the least amount of regret ive ever felt after dropping $60 on a game. gta v for pc is amazing. honestly, its the best game ive played in years. if youve got the hardware for it, this is the game for pc in 2015. im looking forward to playing this for years online and seeing what the modders come up with in the future.",25.0

"yes, there are launch issues yes, there are settings issues yes, there are bugs and a lot of crashes its the pc launch day of gta v give it a week and rockstar will completely fix everything best gta to date, no doubt, graphics look amazing even on lowest settings and everything runs perfectly for me there go my gcses",30.8

"rockstar finally learned how to optmize a game for pc. gamewise, i have no complains, as this game runs perfectly on my mid-end system. i also would like to point the attention they gave to detail in this. i.e.: for the first time in all of gtas, the steering wheel does actually move. that may not sound much, but it is truly a big thing. things i didnt like were the rearview mirrors on cars being nothing more than a low-quality mirror and the online having nothing new. i hope this will change in time. either way, good job on the and its enhancement, rockstar. definetely worth my money.",48.1

"10/10 amazing graphics, the ammount of attention rockstar put into every minor detail is mind blowing. i would highly reccomend this game running on a i7 4770k and a gtx 980 g1, and it runs so smoothly. i spent the first hour walking around and looking for flaws in programing and in the game world itself i.e glitchy walls,, misanimations. havent found anything yet. the game world is so alive! i rode the subway, walked around a realistic baseball field, and while i was exploring some rooftops(the parkour reminds me of mirrors edge which is a good thing) i heard get on the ground! so i went to investigate and see cops starting to arrest a guy before he pulled a gun and a firefight ensued. they killed him and the cops moved so lifelike. love it! great job rockstar!",22.3

"from what i experienced in the short time i was actually able to get this game to run(probably around a half hour total), i would rate this game 9/10. unfortunately this launch was a huge disappointment as 95% of the time the game refuses to even run, and the few times it did, crashes resulted randomly or even as a result of clicking on a different window and then clicking back on the game screen. i have opened a ticket with rockstar support and tried all of the fixes they and other people have recommended but nothing has worked. funny how they delayed the release again and again to ensure that the game is as polished as possible, and to make certain that both heists and the gta online experience are ready to roll out on day one for pc. well guess what rockstar? the game doesnt even run for a lot of us. im sure eventually this problem will be fixed on your end and then ill be able to forgive you but until then, i just want to warn anyone whos thinking about spending their hard earned money on this game that there is a significant chance the game wont even run, and so i would recommend waiting until rockstar has fixed this issue.",1.8

"played alot of this on ps4... even better on pc. great optimization. that was pretty much the only worry on pc. millions of reviews have been out... the port is solid. able to remain above 40 fps always at 1440p maxed out with just a single 290. much better than anticipated. even shows you how much vram is going to be used as you adjust settings. great looking game.",12.4
"have no words for this. something this big and beautiful is newer seen before in video games.",44.6
"this review might change later, but for the time being... i cant recommend this game. i bought it after debating for a bit, but decided to jump in and enjoy it. it crashed a few times and was offered the self-refund option. i tried it again and i was able to bind and play a bit of the game.... then it crashed again... i wish i had taken the inital self-refund. if you read this, my recommendation is to wait, i bought it to enjoy it, and now i just feel like im stuck with it as opposed to enjoy it.",28.9
"more than 12 hrs after launch and it isnt working for moest people is abit of a joke. but when i got it working its an awesome game so i guess i would give it a like 8/10",31.2
"the frickin best game on my steam library, ps3 library and ps4 library... free dlcs ;3 rockstar tricked me into buying 3 of the same games tho ._.",27.6
"as soon as i got in game i set everything to lowest details to simulate the feeling of going from ps3 to pc when i changed the graphics to high. to my dismay the game looked better on all low graphics than the ps3 and i was robbed of my experience. worse than that i was given 1.5 million dollars and my old character from the console version and the ability to earn and claw my way to the top was brutally stripped from me. the first person mode is so emersive that flying makes me sick, the ability to record is taking up space on my hard drive, and dont even get me started on my infuriating and uncanny ability to aim with precision now that i can use mouse and keyboard. its made the game far to convenient. 10/10 would waste 2 years of my life and drain my daughters college fund again.",64.3
"spine stomped a body builder to death and the rest fled like french people good game",46.3
"very entertaining, been awhile since i didnt get bored of a game. this one certainly isnt!!",10.7
"delayed for bug fixes right? well aside from players not being able to get into the game alot of the loading screen bugs are still there. i will say the game play and looks are very fun. and i do enjoy playing the game, you might as well. but, 2 years of bug fixing leaves no excuse why there is still the same bugs as when i played it on consoles 2 years ago. wait for it to be fixed or for the next sale. edit: so after i got a few more hours into the game ill give u a few more problems online loading screens are a long wait (even with a fast connection) cannot use steam friends to invite players. forced to use rockstar social club which isnt ideal.  job on trying to connect and play with friends (having to add them on rs,sc then invite, then once the job is complete invite them again)",44.0

"rockstar seems to be taking a page from nintendo with this port. the idea that you should only play an hour or so (with breaks inbetween) is strictly enforced by rockstar, as the game will forcibly shut itself down at regular intervals. thank you for looking out for the health of your consumers, rockstar. <3",61.1
"its like a better version of gta iii and that one was really fun.",72.1
"the best game rockstar has ever released, if not - the best game among all games. the amount of detail gta v has is beyond words, from graphics to audio to environment words alone cannot explain, you have to experience it to believe it. 10/10 from me, ill also bow down and take my hat off to rockstar.",86.7
"its an amazing game, and there is no questioning that, rockstar has managed to both build up and cut off bits of the old crappy gtaiv and got into this game an amount of vehicles that would put to shame games that focus only on cars, they have an amazingly detailed world to the point where i dont think we will be able to meet again untill the next gta game, it doesnt matter how hard you look for things that miss in this game, from the amazingly live feeling city, to people randomly picking the phone out of their pockets, to getting it back in their pockets and getting a cig out, to dropping the cig and stepping on it, and the cig will stay on the ground and even to big trucks having time tables for the delivery they were supposed to make before you shot the driver in the face and stole his truck you monster. anyway, this game is amazing and you should totally get it, if you bought one of its 4 other releases i would reccomend waiting for it to get to $40 before buying.",47.1

"ok if you have the gta launcher issue go on device managers, display adapters and disable your video card then it should run then enable the next time you start the game. now for the review its worth every penny. the gameplay is smooth, the game is great looking, havent tried online but ive heard very positive stuff about it and the game is just simply very very fun. if your pc can run this is a must buy",84.7

"this game is amazing! ignore the bitter people who are upset and clearly have mental issues. i have to admit that the game did take forever to come out, but its so worth the wait! the graphics the story and the multiplyer is well worth over $60 in my book. you could honestly play this game forever and there will alway be things to do....what other games can do that? (i still play all the old gtas still to this day...thats should say something.) loved the game! it going on my personal favs it lives up to the other gta games. one to keep on the shelf forever! thanks rockstar for making this beast game! pros: - unlimated game play. - easy acces. - great story. -awesome online. -free dlc updates. -sound track is new $ fun. - graphics realstic. - unlimited fun lol. cons: -delay of relase date. -little kids online. graphics - 10/10 story - 8/10 online 8/10 sound - 10/10 coustmer support - 10/10 **tips for the people who give this game a down vote or a bad review. your personal problems should not effect your review. either go buy a consle or buy a better pc that can run the game.**",91.4

"i cant get enough of this game. i originally bought it on ps3 and didnt hesitate to buy it for pc. do yourself a favor and get it! the singleplayer and the online modes are both unique and truly great experiences. prepare to be immersed in the most feature rich and detailed gta world ever created. everything from the characters, to the setting, and the atmosphere is absolutely breathtaking. 9/10 definitely buy.",56.6
"single player: same as always with way better graphics(loading screens for multi and single player take 10 years) multiplayer: was great for the first 20 hours or so, i get on friday morning and it kicks me from the first few servers i join i think its my internet so i get on later. same thing for the last 4 days no mater what internet i am on. the servers are complete  and everyone is having problems playing on them, for a aaa game its servers are complete .",33.3

"i must now edit my reveiw, the problem was fixed for me about after the 6th time i reinstalled and now im loving this game",35.9
"you know i was really excited to finally play this game, even though the release date had been pushed back and pushed back i was really happy to preload it and play. i thought to myself, oh they must just be taking extra time to make sure it all works out! that is great! i am really glad someone cares about us pc gamers! but of course why ever have something good and just work when you release it when you can get someone to pay $60 for something that you know they wont refund because they of course want to actually play the game and just hope maybe someday that they might be able to play. it is really frustrating to me to buy into the hype when it is so obvious that we are just not cared about by big gaming corporations. if you make it work i will of course be happier but it doesnt change the fact that it shouldnt be an issue in the first place.",7.4
"im so glad i brought this game its just as fantastic as i remembered gta to always be everything works and functions perfectly and the optimisation is fantastic!",3.5

"i was not going to buy this game. i really had my doubts. i installed and went right into online mode, knowing i would not get in. you can say, i expected to have wasted my money (i know, this is the last time i pay, pray, and play; hoping the game is as it states). boy was i wrong. this game is pretty damn grape. played a couple hours and not one issue. not one single issue. online is fun and customizing is addictive. having a blast so far. now to make some friends to play with...",6.3

"almost 24 hours in and still no fix for most people. im sure its a great game to play just like it was on xbox 360, but alas i waited almost two years for a proper pc release and this is what we get? sixty bucks to wait for someone to fix a ing launcher bug. it hasnt even gotten past the splash screen for some desktop users. yes ive read of all the temporary  fixes but for what? we shouldnt have to fiddle around and ghetto rig files just to get this game to work that rockstar has been developing for five years. hats off to your  up. im pissed until you guys fix this game. i wouldnt recommend buying this because more than likely youll have some sort of error causing your game to be unplayable. cheers to those enjoying the game.",41.3

"gta as normal, just better. not tons of miles better but good enough to be better than iv. massive open-world, tons of missions, lots of side-bits you can do, the little unofficial personal rampages you can do in this series that make it worth the fun. its hard to escape police unless youre low-level, which is how it needs to be. online play is dependent on players but plays well enough. most shocking is just how damn fast it runs on the same hardware as i played gta iv on. i was expecting massive drop in speed - its parallel or even slightly faster, despite being prettier. i have an old mobile nvidia card, so i wasnt expecting that, but i dont think you could get away with a run-of-the-mill business pc with any nvidia card - the first of the 64-bit-only games ive seen and for a reason. but with quad-cores and 8gb ram and a half-decent directx-10/11 card its more than playable at full res but its just a question of what options you have turned on. havent seen any popping-in issues but my hard drive is constantly streaming data when im playing. great game, looks great, plays great, tons of freedom, huge world and more vehicles and missions than you can shake a stick at.",28.7

"the gameplay is fine. its nothing special and nowhere near best game ever level, but its fun and works well. the plot is ok too, although not the best ive ever seen. for a port (if its a port, rockstar claims it isnt) its optimized pretty well. some people have problems and there are some bugs/glitches/bad things that will have to be fixed in the future, but nothing is really bad and worrysome. its not the best optimized game ever, but its great if you compare it to the  weve been getting in the last year. game is pretty solid. doesnt really shine out in any way, but everything works and its entertaining. its nice to see a working game get released for once again.",56.3

"the game is well optimized and it was was worth waiting for. the director mode is quite fun and is a good reason to buy the game, even if you already bought it before. you can play as characters from the story, pedestrians and even animals. (you can use your online character in single player). play as any character like the republican space ranger and you can enable cheats, making you feel like a superhero. youll be able to make some really creative movies with all the options theyve given you, an improvement over gta 4. theyve also added a custom radio station as well. this is truly the ultimate version of gta 5 and i highly recommend it.",60.5
"online mode is nothing but getting killed repeatedly by people who dont want you to enjoy online mode, or waiting in load screens for instanced missions/heists. most content is limited by level, weakening the experience as you get slaughtered by those who have unlocked high-level guns, armored cars, gunships, and tanks. story mode is linear, simplistic, and repetitive. characters lack depth, and one in particular is simply offensive. overall, vehicular and gun play is clunky, and you can tell this is ported from a console. the game looks great and it runs well, but it better after a year and a half of development on what was already a finished product.",42.0

(1) the game actually has a fairly interesting story. i find myself not skipping the cut scenes for the most part. (2) being able to switch between characters is really cool. (3) fps!! first person mode is really cool. i like being able to switch when i want (4) graphics. wow! the game looks so pretty on my 5820k/gtx980 combo. (5) smooth. the game feels so smooth at release -unlike watchdogs which is still a buggy mess. (6) the game will still provide hours of entertainment even after you finish it. conclusion. it was worth the wait. but, with all of the money they have made, they better hire some more people so that gta vi gets released on all platforms at the same time, like every other normal company does.",36.9

"very fun game, campaign is great and gta online is exceptional with friends. though gta online without friends is a bit of a chore, overall the game is outstanding. would recommend to anybody. in terms of performance, it runs fine with mostly high settings on my gtx 560ti (around 45 fps give or take).",26.1

"it didnt work and i had to disable my graphics card and reenable for it to launch, but i could care less because this is one of the best games ive ever played. best in class at everything. smooth as butter, runs better than gta iv on my computer. single player is worth it alone. gta online is worth it alone.",27.5
"ive never banked more hours in a video game ever. prior to the pc release, i had invested in both the 360 and xbox one versions and have well over 1,200 hours spread across both platforms. the only negative thus far in this release has been how hard it pushes some pcs. however, this should get fixed, and dont let those negative reviews sway you!",9.0
"well.... i cant stand all those fake postive posts. but it is the first day ill give it awhile but, so far only story mode is playable. tried transfering over my online character, i think it might of worked, but it said servers are down. so ill give it awhile. but from hear from friends there crashing everytime on their launcher. so will see. so far ill say this wins a place in the est launch day hall of fame. but lets see, hopefully online will be playable in couple hours.",25.4

"1/10. flip flops dont flop in gta :o. rockstar plz. in all seriousness this is the best version of gta yet, less than 10 seconds to load into gta o or gta sp from either or, and only about 15seconds to load into the game on first launch. 9/10 loading screens. graphic settings is amazing, you can control pretty much everything about this game. only drawback is no matter how high it is reflects still look like  in cars. textures and grass/water looks amazing 8/10 graphics. combat is so much smoother than peasent boxes, way easier to aim while driving, or just aiming in general is a hell of a lot easier 10/10. keybindings can be a bit weird but nothing too off. being able to do anything you want without having to move your hand off of wasd is pretty nice. all in all i give this version of gta v 9/10 . way way way better than peasent box versions.",57.3

"i was so excited to finally be able to play gta v (as i have no console that can play it). i run a mediumish machine (skyrim medium-low settings, league of legends medium-high settings, minecraft maximum settings) so i figured i would be able to run this game at medium-low settings and achieve 25-30 fps. this did not happen. i was running minimum settings, everything was popping in and out with extreme pixelization on everything not 5 feet from my character, 15 fps, and a 1-2 second input delay - all of this occuring even during cutscenes. i am extremely dissapointed with how incredibly unoptimized this game is. also the lack of steam workshop support is incredibly dissapointing. if i could play this game i would definitely want to mod it.",1.0

"at first i was very sceptical, especially because i have seen the flaws of this game on the xbox 360. the issue with that game on that console, was that you could glitch your money in many different ways by using 2 online players, and the pay & spray shop. you could also gate glitch, and get underneath the red parking lot building, and if you had a fast enough car, you could even make a jump towards the metro, underneath los santos. most of these glitches i have tested if they still work, and from what i have gathered and tried, its 9/10 made impossible. along with the graphical update, the first person view, and for how you can transfer your gta console character to the pc makes everything just perfect as it should. i espect many hours that i will spend inside this game, all under the form of total freedom that we all care so much about. the only thing i really dislike about gta, is that they have taken so much time, untill the pc port was finally there.. for future games, this should really be quicker, prostponing will make gamers angry, and nothing positive comes out from that. i give this game a 9/10.",66.9
"fantastic game. runs perfect using a 980 and 3570k @1440p. coming from the last gta i wasnt expecting this to be such a well made game. theyve done an awesome job, easily the best looking game, and yet its also huge! first person mode is great, and even then its got much better graphics than most corridor shooters. theres only two or three setting i cant quite max, but im running it at 2560x1440. ultra grass (which looks no different to very high as far as i can tell) and hd shadows (which is seperate from the main shadow option, has 15-20fps hit) but im running nvidia soft shadows which means the hd shadows dont do much anyway. online seems to be stable, but i havent played that much yet. very, very happy. great game, id highly recommend. dont let the last gta put you off (which is a mess still to this day) rockstar have spent a lot of time making the pc version. i also have the xboc one version, and pc blows that away.",63.8

(unplug any controllers, or else your system will crash) now for my review love the game, graphics are eye-popping, gameplay is phenominal. when exiting the game through the online (settings) option, my desktop crashed (twice). the secong time i exited my pc never recovered from that crash. im resolving the issue as im typing (system restoring). im not too upset because all of my data is backed-up. just worried that this game is unplayable currently.",27.1

"this game had a few release day hiccups, but no where near as many as some games. the hiccups included some unpacking errors and some other bugs involving rockstars social club, however these are easily fixed or you just have to wait a ad longer to play the game. my initial impressions were; the graphics are amazing, lots of customizable options (key bindings, graphical settings ect), the game runs at a butery smooth 60 fps (even on a pentum cpu and a gtx 760 ftw) at mostly high - maximum settings. however i have experienced a few bugs, which prevented my car from moving, however this is the only bug i have encountered. pros; 1) graphics 2)runs on not to good hardware very well 3)60 fps 4)key bindings and lots of customization 5)high resolution and multi monitor support (4k - 3 monitors) cons; 1)release day hiccups (not a big deal) 2)a few bugs (not many though) so all in all this game is brilliant on the pc, i love it more than ever now and it looks amazing.",9.9

"amazing game, worth the 2 year wait! the game runs amazingly smooth, even whilst livestreaming to twitch (although my obs settings have to be set to stupidly low). here are my specs: cpu: amd fx-4100 3.6ghz quad core processor gpu: xfx amd hd 7850 2gb double dissipation edition motherboard: asrock 960gm/u3s3 ram: 8gb crucial 1600mhz ram ssd: 512gb crucial mx100 ssd hdd: 1tb hitatchi 7200rpm hdd so as you can see, my specs arent worthy of computer-gasms, but they still play this game in full 1080p. the only one negative thing ive found is more of a general gta v thing, not to do with the pc version, but on gta online, it feels very unbalanced. there was one player that was killing player after player all the time, and not once he died. the unbalanced thing was more that it spawned us in front of a hospital right round the corner, where hed come and kill us again. the controls also seem a little odd but thats my opinion, ive never seen a game that has e for the horn. in short, 10/10 no matter the small (opinion-based) negatives.",30.8
"first great gta in 10 years, greatly upgraded graphics in comparisson with next gen consoles, good story, smooth gameplay, en great fps if you have the hardware for it (takes a lot of vram, around 7.5 gb in sli config (so 4 with single card)), gtx 670 oc 2 way sli has mostly around 50-60 fps (all maxed out at 1080p but no msaa), though sometimes has verry bad fps drop due to fetching data from ram (so not because the scene itself is to heavy)",52.4
"the game itself is absolutely amazing, if you have a good rig you should definitely pick it up. unfortunately for me it has a lot of stuttering (mostly in online), but i did remove some of the stuttering by removing the in-game steam overlay. i have got it to work sometimes where the framerate is 70+ on high (with an i7-2600k, gtx 770 & 8 gb ram) in singleplayer with barely any stuttering what so ever, but the game has a life of itself that i have no control of. amazing game that i sadly cant run too well. **edit 17th of april:** rockstar released a patch that fixed my game, so all the stuttering is gone and the game works just fine now. thanks rockstar! 10/10",37.9
"can no longer say 10/10 id call it more 6/10 due to the huge amount of time spent in loadscreens. massive leap forward compared to what gta iv was. this game looks amazing on max settings if your pc can take it. its all been very well polished. not sure it was worth the 2 year wait. thats still b*lls**t. online mode and heists are alot of fun. if youve been a fan of the gta series you wont be dissapointed getting this. edit: found 1 giant con finally. the game is so poorly optimized in how you join other games, matches or instances. you are constantly flung into loadscreen hell. they are incredibly long and often will begin loading into one lobby only after a minute or two it says its full so you enter a new load screen to go back to where you were. then before you can act enter another loadscreen to try and find another instance etc etc etc. loadscreeen hell. it happens often that you will spend an average of 2 or 3 minutes suffering through loadscreens. sometimes longer.",91.1

"i ask that anyone interested in buying this game steer clear of it, at least for the moment anyway, the bugs and glitches make playing this admittedly incredible game an experience that has to be soldiered through and not an experience to be enjoyed. in the time i have spent playing this game it has crashed for no reason around ten times now, and the in-game world has continuous dissapearing textures and buildings. at least for the moment stay away from this buggy mess. game score: 10/10 ability to play the game score: -10000/10 please rockstar fix this game, or steam give me a refund.",5.8
"it has some problems but it is nice. some weeks later the problems are solved. 8/10.",38.6

"runs really smooth and graphics look very nice! (running on a gtx970) if youve been waiting for the pc release its definitely worth it. if you played it for the console, graphics will be night and day :). graphics: 9/10 compatibility: 9/10 multiplayer: 9/10 editor: 10/10 (make your own movies!) chop: 10/10 (chop does what chop does best :) ) other notes: you can max out most of settings then lower down the shadows and still maintain about 60-70fps which is pretty good :)",14.8
"excellent graphics, attention to small details, awesome gameplay, all running optimized as smooth as butter! was worried about gta 4 killing off this great series, but gta v is here now to seriously revive it. still needs a rockstar social account to signup and play, but apart from that slight setup annoyance, well worth it.",4.3
"this game is ing awesome, but its glitchy and the players are s/trolls. its also already got hackers in it, mostly just people getting infinite money and rp which i really dont give a  about, however i found out some are doing much more when my tank was instantly blownup from an smg shot (im scared what the future holds if this is already here). the glitched are pretty bad too, i have had issues with everything from crahing and getting achievements i didnt do (i have the lvl 100 achiev and im lvl 71..) all the way to being white screened for eternity during heists and being forced to restart. even with all this ery, im still having fun, the game is still a ing blast and ill continue to play it i reccomend this game but please understand the games current state before you purchase.",40.9
"there are a few problems to be ironed out. id prefer to be able to save at any point in the game but waddya gonna do? graphics are better than just acceptable, they are excellent! im getting 60fps using both of my gtx650ti sli. it sees all 4096mb of vram and the game is using about 3gb total. the cards are running about 80-85c and both fans are howling. i just realize ive been playing this game for about 9 hours today. not sorry i spent the money!",29.1
"this is awesome!!! games run properly, very well optimized, port done right, and do you know? i love this gameeeee it has small bug, stuttering, but it doesnt make sense, i hope rockstar will be fix this as fast as they can, i love you rockstar :d 100/10",34.7

"i do not think i can say much about this game that hasnt already been said. its brilliant. the exploration, the size, the look, this is the definitive version of this game. and as more and more mods are made, there is going to even more more amazing and fun things to do in the game. the story i find to be not as good as rockstars other works (this is a far cry from red dead redemption) but is story really the main reason we play gta? and gta online adds an amazing amount of replayability and fun.",17.1
"as much as i love this game, its not worth 59.99usd$ or 69.99cdn$. there are tons of pros, and only 1 con, sadly that con is a big con for those who dont have as much money as others. luckily i had some birthday money so i was fine for the price, but i quickly found myself disapointed with the outcome. if youre not as wealthy as some, wait for it to be on sale or for the price to drop.",32.9

"just gonna throw this out there you gotta have a pretty beefy comp to run this. but enough about that lets talk about the game. everyone knows its great so that enoguh said. if you played this on the prev gen consoles then i would stay say buy it cause playing it in third person makes it feel like a good game. 10/10 would mass murder again",34.6

(im so bad of english, thanks)",11.7
"this by far the best pc game i have played in a long time i wasnt 100% sure i could run this game at a decent fps because gta 4 was bad for fps on my old hd7750 but i got to say i get better frame rate with this then a game thats older my hat is off to rockstar for that. this is a must have game and it was worth the wait if you are considering getting it then you should just do it also go for if you arent its still a must have and i rarely say that",23.7
"love this game, it was my first gta after many years, last one i played was san andreas, and its mind blowing. best open world game to date.",35.7
"way too much racist talk...every other word in the game dialog is the dreaded n word and its really off putting when trying to play it. if there was an option to remove this then id support it! until a mod comes out that enables this option, then the game is on the back burner!",5.0

"sorry i was busy downvoting the zero ratings on metacritic. btw, freaking 99/100 on metacritic, so yeah. so far, incredible. amazing. this runs smoother (and of course looks way better) than gta 4 on my machine. now that is optimization the depth in this environment is something i have never seen in any game ever. have been playing gta since the first one in the 1990s this has been worth the wait.",8.7

"well, i am actually very hyped for this game but when it first released there is a lot of crashes and settings that i need to deal with. im using lenovo y510p, for laptop users there is a lot of trouble going through to play this game. a lot of contant crashes god knows where it came from but after everything i am still giving the positive review for all the awesome gameplay i had. i did had bad moments starting the game but after playing it, every minute of it is worth while. ps: i dont recommend laptop users to purchase first, wait till they fix this thing.",50.4
"really big improvements over the console version i love it the ultimate gta game!!!",24.9
"after launch and when it was done unpacking it was difficult to get started, but once i got it working i couldnt stop thinking, holy **** this is great. i would recommend to anyone with a decent desktop, even my budget pc can run at a smooth 30-40 fps.",46.4
"coming back to los santos for the third time and im still loving it. the pc version is the definite version, with its supreme graphic options, better performance and easier matchmaking. the controls work well for keyboard and mouse, but i can switch to my controller instantly if i feel like it. im loving it. had a couple of errors on launch day, but now its working fine for me.",47.1
"this game is a piece of , freezes all the time and literally never opens in fullscreen even though i change my mothering settings for this piece of  every god damn time i start it. also the loading screens take longer than on the xbox 360, get with it rockstar learn to make games.",60.1
"absolutely fantastic work by rockstar. completely justifies the 2 year wait for pc. optimization is amazingly well done (fps doesnt ever drop under 50 on high/very high set up + aa 16+msa etc on a i5 2nd gen & gtx 760 2gb ram). port is also very smooth, aiming is great and fluid and so is driving. do i need to say more?",52.3

"so good that i forgot to wank. so i went to the strip club...",60.6
"i have been mostly hyped for gta 5 on pc this year. gta 5 is a really fun game, its fun to customize my online character that is from ps3. this is an amazing feature. i have some problems with small lag spikes (the reason is that my graphics card and my ram is not high enough to run gta higher than high. i have no problems launching the game (it takes me some seconds to get in game), i also see that many people have problems with launching the game or the game crashes on start-up. you either need to update drivers, update directx, and get microsoft visual c++ 2008 sp1. anyways. gta 5 on pc is amazing and really fun to play through, last time i played it was on my ps3.",16.2
"i know, i know, this was just released today. however, i was hoping that, with the release date being delayed twice, that gta v for pc would run well. but, of course, it didnt with the objects loading alittle too late, lag on a card thats much newer than rockstar gamess pc requirements card (xfx radeon r7 260x 2gb), and that i had to restart my pc when i stopped playing. however, i still recommend this, because i know that these problems will be fixed in a given time. but if you arent itching to play, id wait until a few bug fix updates roll out. if it helps, ive got an amd athlon x4 860k (stock-clocked), xfx radeon r7 260x 2 gb (also stock-clocked), and 8 gb of g.skill ripjaws 1600 mhz ram running windows 8.1.",25.2

"we all know how great gtav is. the little details rockstar added really make this game for me. also my pc was slightly better then the min specs(my graphics card being the min spec, gtx660) and with a little messing around im basically running it on max, i droped shadow quality to normal and it works fine for me. there are a few frame drops evry now and then, but over all it works fine. great game and it looks beautiful. 10/10 would bang.",35.8

"moving on from the console versions of gta v, even after months of delaying and waiting, this game proves to still amaze all gamers. obviously, the graphics is the biggest upgrade, but the delation for the release of the game turned out well for its great optimization to the pc port. its amazing how relatable gameplay is with consoles just by using a controller. feels like theres no difference except (better) performance, graphics, and details in the game (like its music). i already owned a 360, ps4, and xbox one version of gta v, but it was well worth $60 to buy the pc version. you get what you paid for, and even more. this pc port is what every game developer should aim for. how optimized it is at launch compared to other games that releases a dead-bugged game that makes it almost impossible to play. its safe to say that all gta players will be missing out on a new experience if they dont purchase this game. 10/10",33.4

"while the graphics still need to be optimized and there are plenty of things that could be fixed at the moment, the pc release blew me out of the water. the graphics in this game are astounding, and everything is much better than on the consoles. the heists are great and really tie the game together. i honestly feel as if i have been playing a beta on the consoles, and this is the final release of the game. like i said though, there are many things that could be fixed. (*points* talking to you rockster!) with some minor tweaks, this game could be epic. i look forward to the expansion of the gta v mod community, because ever since gta iv, they have been waiting to mod a game of this magnitude. things that would make this game perfect! *manual transmission option *fuel system *working mirrors on cars (rearview and sidemirrors)",52.4

"i played this game for 100s of hours on the xbox 360, and let me say this is the ultimate version. the game added tons of new content (songs, cars, clothing, weapons, im pretty sure even new dialouge), it looks great, and it is a really good port (i know some people are having problems getting it working but once you do it runs well) which is even more impressive considering its a rockstar game, who isnt a company known for great ports.",11.4

"this game is amazing, the graphics are outstanding and very realistic. the game has a lot of play value and online is not that buggy or glichy! i highly recommend the game. 10/10 p.s rockstar please make modable",29.1
"first of all, the pc port was well worth the wait. the developers thought of everything; from showing how much vram is in use, to including a whole separate game mode (rockstar editor). performance is great and the graphics are stunning. overall, its just a fantastic pc port. ive been holding off gtav on the consoles because i wanted to experience this game completely fresh on the best possible platform and holy moly am i glad i did. after about 6 hours, its abundantly clear how marvelous this game is and i get to experience it at its maximum quality for the first time, w/o any spoilers or nothing. the gameplay is solid, the aesthetics are beautiful, and man, the story is phenomenal. i mean, im no real world gangster/etc kind of guy. hell, i really dislike the theme entirely and tend to avoid other games or media of the sort, but the writing in this game is just so top notch, so well thought-out, i found myself being invested in the characters and their stories. (havent touched the online yet so cant comment on that) ive barely scratched the surface of this game, but i believe ive played enough to highly recommend this game.",43.3
"it was a tad buggy at release, but theyve since patched that. connection issues? a vpn can clear those right up. gta5 is one of my top games of all time, but running this on pc full 1080p 60+ fps makes it a truly remarkable experience worth the wait (and loading times). i couldnt recommend this game more for someone who enjoys racers, shooters, massive online rpgs, or any combination. a++ rockstar youve done it again.",42.2
"this game is one of the best games i have ever played. the level of immersion in the story is very high as the dialogue makes it feel like an exaggerated stereotype of america. the graphics are very good, and even a mid-level pc can run this game on high/normal without any problems. buy this game now.",40.4

"game of the year? probably once again..:) btw i recommend to update drivers on your graphic card to avoid fps drops",29.7
"tons of content in this game. you could spend hours of time exploring the detailed los santos or you could invest in the fully functional mini games. you could even (once again) spend hours just watching (very funny) tv stations. the campaign is excellent with only a few bad missions. i played this back on the ps3 and recall it taking me more than 40 hours just to do the main missions. a very cynical parody/exaggeration of modern life and culture. taking the game literally you will easily get offended, but the game essentially channels the style of a tarantino film. if you have played the game before then you know it is worth replaying. never played? this game comes with my full recommendation.",27.4
"amazing at 4k and 2k resolutions. a steady 60 fps all the time online or off, its a master piece, rockstar has done it again. so worth the wait! 11/10..........as great as it looks and plays when the game isnt crashing or freezing up your whole pc when you alt + tab out or just about do anything,etc... purple textures every where! please put out a patch already to address all the crashing and freezing issues me and my 6 friends are all having. we all have way more than enough windows 7 gpu,ram,cpuetc.. power to play this at ultra and 60 fps 1440/1600p except 60 fps at 4k. fix asap!",23.1
"i ask that anyone interested in buying this game steer clear of it, at least for the moment anyway, the bugs and glitches make playing this admittedly incredible game an experience that has to be soldiered through and not an experience to be enjoyed. in the time i have spent playing this game it has crashed for no reason around ten times now, and the in-game world has continuous dissapearing textures and buildings. at least for the moment stay away from this buggy mess. game score: 10/10 ability to play the game score: -10000/10 please rockstar fix this game, or steam give me a refund.",5.8
"well, there is much to say about this game. iill quickly go over the cons and pros of it. the, there is actually something important we need to discuss. pros: -pretty good graphics -okay story -dicersity in gameplay -replay value cons: -repetitive online -microtransactions now, what i want to discuss is the ethic of this company. firstly, dont take me as someone anfry about the delays for pc. i played this game on the old gen. listen up, this game was supposed to be released in spring 2013 and was delayed until september 2013. then, the online was delayed for two weeks and did not work for the first few days. heists were also promised in the reveal trailer. but, they were delayed until just now. rockstart kept making promises of the release of those heist. those heists were released almost 2 years after the initial release of this game. i leave you on these facts to judge if they are trustworthy.",30.3

"i know there are a lot of people struggling with some bugs and i fully acknowledge how frustrating it must be having waiting so long after the console release, then preorder, then preload, and then crashes. you have my condolences. when i loaded the game, there were a number of nagging issues.. such as the benchmark utility being worthless since it starts the game while running the benchmark. i have no clue how they could have missed this. moving on, i played last night after finding the appropriate graphical settings. the game is beautiful. when you are considerate to your settings, the framerates are silk. i sat downtown and just watched things, i havent done that in a game since skyrim. its something to see... this is one of those games that will sell a ton of hardware. this and witcher 3 have made it an exciting quarter for pc gamers. paying $59 for a game i played on ps3 was a hard pill to swallow, but it was worth it.",28.9

"fantastic game with loads of opportunity and replayability. best game of past few years for me.",40.3
"amazing game if you had waited out on playing gta v from the console versions, very well optimized, amazing story, and fun multiplayer (this can vary due to the diffrences in people online, but for the most part they have been plesant :d). for me the story was not new, however the graphical updates made me want to replay the story and the online. overall i suggest you buy this game.",41.4
"word of warning. if you are transferring a character from an xbox 360 or ps3 account, make sure to log into gta v online on the console before transferring your character on pc! otherwise you will not transfer all your vehicles. i lost 10 custom cars and had to submit a ticket. this only works if you do it before the character transfer. in case anyone is wondering, you can transfer your character and still get your preorder money, so dont stress about it. other than that, this game is amazing, 10/10 lapdances!",32.3
"the greatest port in the history of ports. really fun game, solid story telling, and really great online.",25.8
"its the ultimate version. runs well on a decent but not bleeding edge pc, as well as my friends low end pc. beyond that, its gta v and its playable, i dont think i need to go much more length than that. all that said, it does have some issues that i assume will be patched. for instance, the ai during missions are generated by the host in online, which is usually fine except when that person has a piece of garbage pc. in that instance the game will drop your framerate to the hosts framerate when you get up close, which is horrifying. beyond that its everything we wanted and probably one of the best looking games ive ever seen. it is well worth the cost, and i wholly recommend it.",45.2

"if you have a relatively modern pc (meaning build date of at least 2008, which is usually really pushing it) then youll run this no problem. the installation/launch errors are few and far between and if youre capable of reading and troubleshooting then its no issue. the game runs terrificly with 100+ fps (i prefer limiting it to 60) on my computer with a gtx 960, i5-4670k 3.4ghz, and 8gb of ram. 100x better than the console version, thanks for the beta test peasants.",15.4

"runs fantastic. massive improvement over gta iv in terms of graphics and performance. i have 2 gtx970s in sli with a 4770k, i just stuck all the graphics and advanced graphics settings to the absolute max and it runs. i get 45 - 120fps depending where i am and only limited due to refresh rate. the wait isnt that bad either in my opinion, i had gtav on xbox360 which was ruined just down to the fact it was like watching a slideshow. taking a break for a year from the game and all the new content r* added makes it feel all new. welcome home gtav to the best gaming platform of all time. xd side note: anyone moaning they cant launch the game, first go here",44.1

(300mbps down / 20 up) dont waste your time on consoles, heres the real version of the game. thanks for beta testing console users. your move console.",20.4

"game is not launching what can i say more! i havent seen anything like this in my life before! in last 3 days i sent e-mails to both steam and rockstar and non of them have sent me a solution massage yet. f*** the solution, i want to know if they are searching for a solution or not, i want them to just let me know about the process. this is f***ing an inpolite behaviour! this f***ing game is a trash right now do not buy it if you dont want to be cancer. this is a terrible failure for both steam and esspecially rockstar games. from now on, i am not going to buy any rockstar games product before reading commends to see if the game is fully working or not. this bad recomendation will stay here untill they fix the game. thanks for steam and rockstar to ruining my week. f*** you all!",2.4
"i was so pissed when r* released the game for console and we still didnt know if it was coming to pc, or when. i have waited so long to play this game. i told myself i wouldnt pay full price because they made us pc gamers wait so long, but i ended up doing just that and you know what? it is worth every penny. what i like about it! (1) the game actually has a fairly interesting story. i find myself not skipping the cut scenes for the most part. (2) being able to switch between characters is really cool. (3) fps!! first person mode is really cool. i like being able to switch when i want (4) graphics. wow! the game looks so pretty on my 5820k/gtx980 combo. (5) smooth. the game feels so smooth at release -unlike watchdogs which is still a buggy mess. (6) the game will still provide hours of entertainment even after you finish it. conclusion. it was worth the wait. but, with all of the money they have made, they better hire some more people so that gta vi gets released on all platforms at the same time, like every other normal company does.",36.9

"my friend gifted it to me . and im so thankful to him and rockstar for making this dream come true. been waiting for this game since 2011. been through all the delays patiently. but after finally getting this game, id say 10/10 would wait again for a game like this pros: -hours of fun -range of graphical options/settings -amazing optimization -lots of fun activities (golf, swimming, tennis, strip clubs) -great story missions & characters in story mode. -really fun to hang out or play with friends in gta online. cons: -r.i.p social life.",58.9

"man, this game really is great. its absolutely beautiful, the story is compelling, and its bigger than ever! the only problem is that..its not optimized for pc, oddly enough. it has issues using the full power of some peoples gpu, including mine. despite being able to run the game at 40-50 fps on medium high settings, you get wierd dips, stutters, and micro sound-cut outs at times, or, your fps will randomly drop to 20 and stay there for a minute, even when youre just standing still! when they release a better version ofthe game, it will have my full support. right now, im just not feelin it.",42.1

"hadnt played this game on console at all due to wanting to wait for the pc version and it was definitely worth it! this game has been loads of fun. all the aspects of it, from single player to the multiplayer (which in my opinion is the piniacle of this gta experience) is spot on! so many different things to do to keep you and your friends busy for hours on end! and the heists are just great fun! i recommend this to everyone out there if youve liked any of the gta games of the past.",47.0

"love the game, i like the first person mode. the one thing is that it freezes at times but im giving it a chance to get the bugs out. keep up with the fun game rockstar love them to death.",15.3
"this game is so good in graphics and gameplay that it can hardly (normal gameplay) or compleatly not (online) run on my computer on the lowest graphics 10/10 would watch my computer explode again",5.5
"this game is fun, challenging, and exiting. the online and singleplayer are well built and i enjoyed playing.",46.3
"i bought gta v for my 360 when it first came out and played it often. the disc hardly left the drive as i continued to enjoy the game all the way up to the pc release. i can honestly say its a whole new game on pc. the graphics are stunning! there are lots of new things and im still getting used to the first person view, which im starting to prefer on foot. now mods are starting to come out and im really going to enjoy breaking outside of the barriers imposed of what rockstar intended in this game. my advice for anyone looking at this and thinking i already played it on my console, is to try it on pc. its not what you played before, and you wont look back. sure the story is much the same, but the mechanics and sheer beauty of gta v pc raises the bar to a whole new, very high level for the gaming industry.",24.0
"what the... you still do not have this game yet? what a pity!",35.6

"rockstar failed us again! just like gta iv! there are so many issues with this game. from textures not loading correctly, low fps count, settings dont save after changing them, etc. the list goes on and on and we are stuck here with a game that we all wanted to play on day one of release. thanks rockstar for keeping your promise we have worked hard on this release.",31.4
"an old man named r* f*cked me for over 4 month, and the lolipop he gave me has laxative in it. its been 2 days and im still sh*tting blood out off my @ss. i think i should appologize to r* because i got an amd graphics card on my gaming laptop. im so sorry that i used amd card, i am the minority, lol. i heard nvidia user also experience the same problem, but luckly they can still play. i understand r* is just too good to test their game on laptop graphics cards like amd and nvidia even though they asked for another 2 month. i counted at least 8 kinds of problem that can happen to you when you simply try to start the game. i dont know if its because their genius team never thought about run the game on laptop or they just dont want to fix the problems. just what kind of machine do r* use to test game before they have the courage to release it, now i see why they need to delay the release date. i think r* still need a few century to release this game on pc. its not their fault, its just players not patient enough and pushed them too hard :d god i wish i can play gat5 when i am still alive.",85.0
"please fix the extreme latency issues in gta online. i know its not my connection, as its orninarily stellar. other than that, this game is magnificent. rickstar has fixed the bugs and isssues that plagues gta v upon release and made it worthy of a must-have game list.",28.0

"obviously everybody (by now) should know that gta v for alot of people is either crashing or not starting. my gta v started perfect didnt crash at all but, when i joined online it put me in a lobby with noone at all i didnt get any missions and noone could join me and i couldnt join anyone so i ended up getting a refund. then (being a fan of mortal kombat) gladly bought mortal kombat a game i would rather play alone in. gta v is not a bad game i enjoyed it on the xbox had a level 80 character nice cars apartments but it wasnt ready for pc after how many years of working on it? also after how many set backs?. i just cant understand why none of the testers for gta v got any of these problems and the worst thing is (all i have seen)the devs know all about it and gave us acouple fixes (wich didnt work alot of the time) and a refund tool wich ended coming in handy.",38.5
"fantastic and well worth the wait, runs better on my computer than gta iv did, far better optimization. i do however feel for the folks affected by user account name issues, im surprised they didnt bump into that in 1.5 years of testing. hopefully they fix that eventually but this still gets the thumbs up from me.",45.2
"this game is just perfect. the graphics are amazing, and with astounding performance. my pc shouldnt be able to run max settings under and circumstances yet somehow i can and keep a very stable 60+ framerate. this game is detailed beyond belief, the developers put in every single detail, no matter how small they are and it adds the nicest touch to the game, making it that much better. the first person mode was done brilliantly. they went to the largest extent possible, adding in great animations and a variety of options. the options for first person go beyond the extent of some other fps games, adding in things like head bob control, and an fov slider, which many of the modern military shooters today simply dont have. get this game, its worth well above $60. the build quality on everything in this game is just amazing. the developers obviously put a lot of hard work into the game, and you should support them.",35.2
"i wasnt going to buy this game but i got a bit curious about the firstperson mode. anyways after playing a bit and doing some heists i find it pretty funny. although not as much solo mission content in the multiplayer part overall ill give it 8/10 due to the upgraded graphics and the 1st person mode. woulda been a 9 if it didnt crash occationally",38.3
"great open-world game ! excellent optimization for pc !",79.6
"so imagine gta v on 360/ps3 was like the meal youve waited for all your life that tasted a little raw, but it was a good meal, yknow? then, youve got the ps4/one version that is the same meal cooked ever so slightly better, yet youre still hungry. this version is like, the real deal. the main entre. the dish youve been truly hungry for your whole life. and it may have taken a little longer for it to be done but you craved it even more. in the end, this is the most delicious meal of your life. you get everything and more, especially for those who can crank up to 11 (4k resolution, baby) even if youve bought this game before and thought youve done it all, dont overlook this well optimized glorious experience that will make your return to los santos ever so sweeter.",25.2

"the game runs fine for me. overall the game is a solid story you should get if you want to see how it plays out. you are given the option to skip quests if you fail them too many times. the only bad thing about this game some systems wont run it or some systems run it at very low settings. people have been vocal about that part. as well as it links your socail club account(online) with whatever email you used to pay for the game. keep that in mind. i like it so far. i would pay for it again. overall good game. should research if you can run it and other stuff to be safe.",61.1

"great game. with a 27 screen, resolution 2560*1440, on my xeon 3.5 ghz and with a gtx770 4 gb it performs phantastic",0.3
"huh,grand theft auto v on pc. in all seriousness,i always expected this would happen,but for it to be this good? nah. i wanted to write a joke review,i really did want to,but this game deserves more. having never played the console version,this was a real novelty for me,but no one can hold it against it for that because of some new things. those new things are: 60 frames-per-second 4k resolution and the rockstar editor. in 60fps this game feels really fluid,much more than in any of the consoles,but you already couldve guessed that from the trailers r* posted. i dont have a 4k rig,but i visited a friend that has one and it looks apsolutely stunning.no joke,even though its all caps ;). and i havent got around to playing with the editoer,but when the right time comes,ill do that. all in all,some will prefer to buy this on sale,but in my honest opinion anyone who can afford this game at $60 it is a very good investment.",51.7
"my laptop has 3840*2160 resolution. but i cant seem to be able to run the game in that resolution. and the game screen occupy only a portion of the screen. and the game crash if i change the resolution to 3840. please somebody help me. i cant even run the game in fullscreen mode! my gameplay experience had been disappointing because of this.",14.3

"reeally slick gameplay and so far no issues for me. i would recommend this game as it is amazingly well optimized and looks like some of the best graphics so far in a game. really chuffed with it, its even better than i thought it would be. great value",12.6

"good game, great story and a decent multiplayer. there are plentiful bugs in online (long load times, heists failing to start/end, crashes, social club unable to launch the game, etc.) and there seems to be a problem with performance issues for the 970, 980, and titan x (in blaine county you gain around 30 fps when other cards shine thru, this is unacceptable). if you own these cards, dont buy it or wait till a patch fixes this, if you dont, go ahead and buy it.",49.9
"this is a great port! rockstar has learned from their mistakes and delivers a pc port which holds up to the promisses. even though i am not that deep into the game yet, i can highly recommend it to anyone who likes the gta series or open world games in general.",20.7
"awsome game if you dont have it yet what are you waiting for?",49.5
"been waiting for this for a long time but i have to say that this time it disappointed me. despite the numerous beautiful 4k screen shots of gta v thats been released earlier, you might have gotten hyped for this game like me, but after several developemnt delays, the result is that the graphics are not even up to par with watch dogs, which has been downgraded a lot. since ive played ps4 version for awhile, it is easy for me to say that the console version looks much better. maybe i need a better graphics card or cards and a 1440p 144hz monitor rather than a single gtx 770 gpu and a cheap 1080p 60hz monitor build to fully immerse myself in this game, but this time, i only wish steam has refund policies because i cant see myself spending hours on this game getting distracted by those jagged lines and mozaic-like textures.",4.3

"excellent port! after gta iv, i was concerned this port would be rubbish as well. so far, gameplay has been buttery smooth with no hiccups. i get 60 fps with little to no drops at high settings at 2560x1080. loading times to get into game are loooong, but with an ssd that time would probably be decreased. i havent had any issues at all logging onto gta online at all. my specs for reference: i5-4690k @ 4.4ghz, 2x gtx 770s @ 1200 mhz, 16gb ram, windows 8.1 pro, and game is running off of wd black 7200 rpm hdd.",19.2

"played on ps3, and it was great. i couldnt wait to get my hands on this on pc and just play the way its meant to be. but... rough launch issues are killing the hype and happiness: 1) launcher crashes unless i disable my nvidia card from the device manager first. 2) game content takes too long to load, causing missing textures, models, animations, sounds. 3) can get 60fps on lowest graphics on this old laptop, but cpu usage is sawtooth and it fluctuates between 17fps and 60fps in about 2 seconds, and it keeps repeating this pattern, making the game more or less unplayable. 4) got a 16gb ssd, one of those first ones. game files are not grouped in a folder > i cant symlink the files > slow loading times. game aspects: great! technical aspects: not so much. do i recommend? if you have an ssd big enough to keep the entirety of the game, and a relatively good computer: yes. rockstar, please patch the game, i want to get my moneys worth.",60.8
"you dont need me to tell you how good this game is, but i can say that the pc version is the best version of the game with its extensive array of settings. fully bindable keys ,ability to have own radio station of your favourite songs and ofcourse the ability to transfer old characters from previous versions 10/10 buy this if you can run it",30.3

"i very much recommend the game the only problems i have been experiancing is the the graphics card issue with nvidia..... and or amd? soon as they fix this graphics card problem the game will be a breeze and the matchmaking speculation thing is stupid how you get put into that makes no sense but it happens on some deathmatches or even races i give the game a 10/10. wait a week or two for them to fix the servers and graphics issues if you dont want to expericane it i just cant wait so i need to disable than renable it to play it,, sucks i really hope this gets fixed soon",43.1
"complete disappointment. cant even start the game to begin with. crashes like everyone else complaining in the forums. im running on amd gpu. but due to the nature of the ing manufacturer, it needs slightly custom drivers. only official ones that could run stably was 14.4. gta v requires you to have 15.4beta, and installing that causes the whole system to blackscreen forever. no games has need me to do this thus far, not even newer ones. really really disappointed with rockstar.",0.2
"the game works perfectly for me, with 2 minor crashes in the first hour when i was messing with graphic options. the game is greatly optimised as expected, and may even become better optimimised when woth dx12! i can recommend it at least, its a great and fun game!",13.6
"i played gta v/online on console and aside from a rocky start with updates and bugs and connectivity issues, the game played great. i loved the easter eggs, i enjoyed the off-line story mode. and the online mode was great, even as a vanilla game with no dlc or updates the game had so much to do: racing, darts, tennis?, golf, parachuting, base jumping, deep sea diving, the list goes on. i felt the graphics for this game were about par as far as gta games go, they slowly keep pace with the times, the graphics werent mind blowing, but they were very decent. as far as support goes, rockstar is currently reviewing a ticket i submitted regarding a few bugs, and things seem to be moving in a positive direction. do not rate games on their glitches and bugs, rate the game. and i give this game a very good rating. now if the bugs and glitches are not fixed, my rating will unfortunately change, as i am rating this game under the assumption that those bugs will be fixed sooner rather than later.",19.1

"man, this game really is great. its absolutely beautiful, the story is compelling, and its bigger than ever! the only problem is that..its not optimized for pc, oddly enough. it has issues using the full power of some peoples gpu, including mine. despite being able to run the game at 40-50 fps on medium high settings, you get wierd dips, stutters, and micro sound-cut outs at times, or, your fps will randomly drop to 20 and stay there for a minute, even when youre just standing still! when they release a better version ofthe game, it will have my full support. right now, im just not feelin it.",47.0
"loading screen simulator 2015 (for online, that is) seriously though, ever since my mom first banned gta from my brothers and mine game collection, its been a favorite of mine. gta 5 is the ultimate gta. everything annoying in the old games is gone, and just the right amount of realism is there. story mode is great and takes years to beat, and online mode is basically a second, more personal customized story mode. i just wish it hadnt taken so long to come out.. but hey, perfect things need a lot of polish ^-^",57.3
"crashes at startup... and while i am sure this is going to be an awesome game, it sucks to be part of the beta+ rollout while paying the full retail price. till a patch is issued, i will live vicariously through the many others on here who are in gta v heaven :)",31.2

"i never expected to enjoy gta v after how dispointing it was in 2013 when it released on xbox 360 and ps3. the biggest problems with those versions was the abysmal framerate and that the game took away actual gameplay with auto-aim. im very pleased by the above average pc port that rockstar gave to this title. this game is far more comparable to the ps4 / xbone versions as the graphics have been increased, with the addition of first person mode. the better graphics and framerate really show that this is the definitive edition of the game that for some reason took way longer than it should have.",21.0

"a huge applause to rockstars customer service at lauch of gta v by giving everyone the opportunity to refund the game, whether they had several hours of game time or not, all because of a bug (which was not even a big deal to manually fix). first time to see a company offer refunds at day of launch. 10/10 would purchase from rockstar again.",4.8

"couldnt wait for this to come on and now that its out i can say it is worth it. running the game on maxed settings is bliss and the controls for the mouse and keyboard are league better than using a controller. even though i have played gta 5 across 2 generations of consoles and clocked over 200 hours on it i can say without a doubt that the pc is the true version. rockstar have made an amazing port to the pc. went straight into online with no problems and a full game straight away. cant wait to play it more and with friends when they have downloaded it.",18.4

"multiplayer is completely broken as always, graphics are iffy as skin textures are phenomonal, but everything else is muddy and low resolution and the chromatic aberration ruins it all. theres also a double-fu, one being the barely functional secondary drm social club and the fact that they dished out dlc from a 500 ce for free, and then level locked them.  me for buying your overpriced special swag hat edition, right?",50.0
"first of all, i love the gta series and after seeing people play, it looks amazing, if i could play it. there are so many people unable to open and play the game, that you start thinking have rockstar even tested if the game could start? my windows user account only have letter a-z a-z and 0-9, so i dont have that problem. i click play, it loads for a few seconds, then stops, and nothing else happens. bugs like that should be tested for and fixed before release. have been wasteing hours, trying to fix it, nothing works. so untill i get to try the game, it gets a thumb down from me.",22.7

"great job rockstar, you managed to completely disappoint me. the endless delays were meant to be to polish the game right? well done. the game is so much polished that i cannot even get past the ing launcher. i have tried so many fixes that people have released, from disabling the graphics to reinstalling the game. i was in midst of formatting the pc completely, then realised that no game should be this hard to play, and worth formatting my entire system. so good job, rockstar, i am not going to be thrilled about your next step, if there will be one. even if the patch will be released, and game becomes stable or whatsoever, that will not change my attitude towards your company. you just dont deliver, plain and simple. yeah the game might be good or not, that will depend on my experience, if i manage to get one.",38.1
"ah, the legend returns to the mastah race! but more seriously, this game has finally arrived on pc with its fenomenal graphics (some dull textures here and there though) and stunning visuals with 4k support in all its glory! what i love: just about everything what could be better: mouse movement feels like it has a delay the gpu usage could have been better as i see some fps drop even if the gpu usage is at 70-80 ish. there is also a frequent happening of cars popping up from the ground, wheels on idle cars stuck half way in the ground.",57.6
"for anyone with an nvidia graphics card having problems launching the game: go to device manager and disable the nvidia adapter, and then start the game. you should be able to go through social club without any problems now. now enable the graphics card before the game starts up (gotta be quick!) this should fix the problem.",24.8

"launch was a bit of a mess, but what do you expect? its the biggest/most popular game on the market. preload speeds were fine, decrypting took about an hour which is expected, and i ended up getting my character transfer from 360 to work perfectly. normally i wouldnt write a review but this game deserves to be at least at very positive. it works fine now. yeah there will be some bugs, but the overall optimization is fine. switching from controller to mouse is flawless. this is a port done right. they definitely put the time into this game. dont listen to any of the negative reviews ing because they couldnt play it the second it came out. ps: also dont listen to anyone saying you have to be online to start the game up. i read those reviews, thought no way, enabled airplane mode, and watched as it launched in offline mode perfectly fine.",33.3

"14 hours in, im enjoying the game. main characters are strangely likable and interesting. gameplay is more or less like iv, but smoother in some respects and missions where you can switch between characters become a lot of fun. the special abilities do seem just a tad overpowered at times though. port seems good. im not running it quite maxed out and have the occasional frame rate hiccough in certain circumstances, but it isnt anywhere near bad enough to say its not a good port. if anything, it could do with the settings menu being less annoying to navigate. the intro movies could also do with being skippable after first launch, they get very annoying when playing with settings that require a reboot. i have experienced a consistant bug with the benchmark going crazy and failing a mission halfway through (it seems to start a new story mode at the same time or something) (pc gamer had the same issue), which made setting up a bit more of a hassle than it needed to be.",74.5

(caps lock was the characters special ability button which was super annoying to reach) but in terms of how it runs on pc, i havent seen many glitches which is a really nice comparison to their 2008 release of gta iv.",17.4

"gta 5 as an exercise in world building and story is amazing, the world feels alive, deep and most importantly fun. the 3 main characters are varied enough to keep things from becoming stale, and being able to specialize them, through semi rpg elements and purchases is a nice touch. as far as gameplay related bugs go i encountered just one in 12 hours (unable to progress through mission). however the game makes us of often auto saves and allows quick saving so this was not a massive issue due to being able to load previous save. in terms of a the quality of the pc port i have several woes, firstly installing on a samsung ssd caused memory issues and made the game unplayable, secondly crossfire scaling is not as good as i hoped. despite this a great set of graphical options offered allowing intricate customization. overall very happy with the game",24.6
"i have owned this game since it came out for the ps3 and xbox 360 in september of 2013 and then bought it again for the ps4 and xbox one the next year, but out of all the the previous versions of grand theft auto both prequels and previous versions of the game, this one was the topper. relatively stable, more features, 60 fps and just an overall better expierence. if you have a decent machine to run this on, i suggest getting this title not only for the expierence but for the upcoming mods and updates. now there are some issues right now with the title like your installation issues with windows user account, some bugs in game as well as online stability and as far as i know right now to run this game at a full 60 fps with everything on ultra and everything turned up and on, you need something way stronger then a nvidia gtx 660 2gb / amd hd 7870 2gb. im running a asus nvidia gtx 980 4gb and the game uses 3 gb plus of video memory and i dip from 60 fps every now and then and thats with updated drivers. but i still very much recommend the pc version of gta v with the overall improvements plus, and like i said if you have a decent machine its worth a buy.",23.5

"after the intital pain from installation- buy it. thats the review if you like art in any form you have an excuse to buy this game",70.3
"the best installation and port to the pc by rockstar games since max payne 3. they have learned from their mistakes and given us something that works great right after launch. the game is highly optimized than its counterparts and offers a lot of choices in terms of graphics settings which will keep the average pc gamer busy. for new players, it is extremely important to go through all the graphics settings as a misconfigured option could ruin the whole experience. otherwise, the game runs very smoothly and the online feature has no flaws. the only downsides in my opinion is the requirement of linking your social club account before you can play, and of course the massive 60gb filesize. but we live in 2015, games are bound to get larger, and hard drives will also get larger as standard. other than that, you are guaranteed to have the time of your life.",23.4

"the game is the same from all consoles. but the 60fps is what you are looking for. still the mods will be great. i have a pretty good computer. but when im trying to get 60fps its pretty hard. - 780 gtx - i-7 processor - 12 gb ram im getting 60fps on the outside of the map but it dips down to 45fps in the city.",30.2

"gta v is finally released on pc, with much improvement from the previous gta iv release. it runs smooth 40-60fps even on my old hd6850. the same reaction when max payne 3 was released, why is this running smoothly on my old graphic card? rockstar has done a really good job on this. but still, 4 months of delay is pretty painful to wait.",45.9

"brilliant graphics, gameplay, storyline, and multiplayer. also incredibly well optimized for pc. there are a few issues with the game (namely stutters, buildings not rendering sometimes) but they dont seem to happen to everyone. and for the first version of the game its understandable. other than those issues, absolutely awesome game and enjoying it a lot! been doing multiplayer mostly, and its a lot of fun. cheers for another awesome game r*",36.9
"first it wont launch into the launcher. so i disable my nvidia video card (!) and it does. then the game crashes on the first screen. i assume thats the menu screen. i play many alpha/early launch games that cost a fraction of this, and rarely have issues. i think there should be a big disclaimer before puchasing that says, game in pre-alpha",13.8

"havent seen since a long time such a large game beeing released so smooth in multiplayer. except the namebug. the game is fun and the community isnt that toxic atm and you can have fun with your friends. the best part, all dlc are included and they are not splitting up the community. great game, grate release! setting high standards for other major releases! would buy it again!",39.1

"great game with an amazing singleplayer storyline which is long and fun to play. there are many side missions and things you can do if you ever get bored of the main missions. you can fly planes, drive boats or just go around doing whatever you want. the multiplayer is so fun and there are so many challenges and different missions/heists that you can do with your friends or anyone you want. there is so much to unlock and so many different vehicles to customize. you can buy houses, vehicles, planes, boats and so much more. the heists which were only introduced recently are fun, challenging and great to do with friends. i would recommend this game to anyone especially if you have played the previous gtas this game brings together aspects from every game which you will notice. the map features things like grove street and mt chiliad from sa and other gta games. overall this game is very fun and great to play with friends or alone and i would recommend it to anyone.",77.3

"characters lacking charisma, repetitive missions and some repulsive scenes. ive played gta since the third one, never found myself getting bored until gta v. 3/4 of the game is trevor whining about what michael did, getting ready for a heist or solving the dumb troubles your family gets into. except for a couple of missions there was no adrenaline; there are some scenes where i feel rockstar crossed a line as well. there was gore when it clearly could have been avoided, gta doesnt need that. i insist, you guys crossed a line with this game, an akward one.",25.6

"at first i had rated this game poor due to constant crashes and lock ups with it. i had thought it was the game itself, but after some trouble shooting i found the root cause was an outdated bios on my motherboard. seems gta v is the first game to push the cpu hard enough to expose the issue with the older bios. after the bios update the game has yet to crash or lockup. if you have an asus maximus vi motherboard with a bios older than rev 1603 installed and have lockups / crashes. install rev 1603, it will fix the lockup and crash issues. this is by far the best gta game yet and the pc version was worth waiting for. the graphics are insane. being able to jump between mouse and keyboard and 360 controller is awesome. drive a car on the controller, get to a roof top, then jump to mouse and keyboard and use a sniper rifle. my pc can run this on max settings and rarely see fps drop under 52 fps: i7-4790k 16 gb geforce 980gtx 500 gb samsung 850 windows 10 pro",16.4

"the single-player story is an exhilarating series of increasingly fun missions. and if you have the muscle to run it at max settings, the visual fidelity is astonishing. driving through the city at night in a storm, neon signs reflecting in the puddles and on the rain-slicked hood of your car, it almost looks photorealistic. and it all takes place in one of the richest, densest, most skillfully constructed game worlds ever built. the sense of place these details evoke is lightyears ahead of other open-world games. and the fact you can share it with other players makes it all the more exciting. gta online is a game in itself, mixing gtas sandbox chaos with elements of mmorpg. 10/10",51.3

"i played gta 5 for the first time on my ps4 and i was amazed at the quality of the graphics and the quality of the story after finally building my gaming pc and gta 5 finally being released on pc i thought that the graphics would just improve a little. but i was totally wrong after installing gta and running it for the first time i could definitely tell the increase in graphics. i would totally recommend you to go and get this game, if you have already played it either on a 360 or the current consoles i would totally recommend getting it again if your pc can handle it of course.",9.1

"this is a very well made game; however, at the time of this review, the gta online portion sucks...it is really laggy and there are some major sync issues. i havent had any problems with the single player though. i hope they continue to patch it so that he multiplayer is not shoddy, and i think they eventually will. rockstar isnt going to give up on us. its just disappointing since it took them two years and 3 delays to release it. there is no real good excuse other than they are new to doing this online for pc. anyway, fun as hell. never had so much fun doing a burnout on a hookers face, and you can do it in 4k too!",26.8
"i highly recommend this game, in spite of some non positive aspects, such as the price in russian region. it is ridiculously expensive game. but as the positive sides, i want to point to: - high optimization - pushing the limits graphics and physics - next generation sandbox environment - advanced ai - well enough online mode - over 1kkk hours of fun and madness - i killed a cat while running from the cops also, this game helps to release stress very well :)",7.5

"having just played this game for a short time on pc, so far i can say i am very pleased with the pc version. the pc version has better graphics, no loading hiccups that plagued the console version and it has smooth performance. looking forward to beating the game on the pc version and playing on multiplayer. i definitely recommend the pc version over the console version. 10/10",22.0

"had fun with what little i was able to play the online mode. not going to recommend this game due to its poor support and time wasted by me troubleshooting unknown errors that did not lead to being able to play this game. downloaded the game, was fast 59gigs~. 1 to 1-1/2 hrs tops installed and started the game. no issues at first through the story requirement portion. once i obtained access to online play, the entire game has gone belly up. upon starting the game: 14x its not made it past the loading screens, 10x its crashed mid game, 18x its crashed randomly. ive tried everything from rechecking my drivers are current, automatically manage paging file size adjustment, dx10/dx10.1 toggling msaa, setting all gfx settings to the very lowest, r* create a second user profile with basic characters, restarts, and closing the launcher once the game is open. i run a i3 4630 3.6ghz, 8gb ram, r9 270x... which are all above the mark for running this game. i suggest steering clear overall due to r* poor release of this game.",12.8
"omfg! my highest scoring game of all time 98/100 im fortunate to be experiencing this maxed out in 4k res. it is by far, the best graphics i have ever seen in any game in my life! it doesnt end there. the gameplay is equally amazing too - it really is a stunning piece of work in every aspect! the bad points... sometimes after getting killed during a heist, or pvp i dont respawn correctly. it stays stuck on a splash screen. if i try moving i can see myself moving on the mini map.. to be fair, this has only been out a couple of days on the pc.. i am aware of some people having a lot of problems with the game though - although its not clear if their problems are with their system or the game. highly recommended from me - especially if youve got a high end 4k gaming system",64.4

"to sum it up pretty short, it was well worth the wait and was sure worth buying the game twice, first on 360 then pc. four hours in on launch night and it is running flawlessly, at well above what gtav says i should be running it at as well (memory warning in settings with 2gb gtx770). the first person view is awesome, constant 60+ frames is awesome, the extra detail combined with extended view ranges is awesome. this release is just awesome all around.",35.2

"very impressed. while i was not able to run the game at max settings, i was able to maximize the graphics to a point where they still exceed the graphics seen in the current generation consoles like the ps4. i am running an aging amd phenom ii x6 1100t (turbo core/coolnquiet disabled), 16gb of ddr3, and 2 asus gtx 760s in sli (4gb vram total)with the latest nvidia gta v approved drivers what i was impressed with the most is that the fact that this runs better than gtaiv... on the same hardware! rockstar did not screw this up, and has redeemed itself from that awful port that was gta iv. while it is disappointing to hear that many people with odd windows account names were unable to install and run the game, i feel as though a bug as that should not eclipse what a great game this turned out to be. graphics aside (but seriously... wow!) the game itself has not lost any of its luster gameplay-wise in the 2 years its been out. gta games just never get old. the game will have you hooked, its got me hooked on my third playthrough, and with mod support, expect the game to be even better than the console experience.",5.7

"this game is great! i played it on the 360 when it first came out and i have to say that getting it again on the pc was a great choice. the game has really improved from the 360 version. it looks beautiful with max setting. i get about 45 to 50fps on max settings (check out my profile for all my pc info) which is still better than the 360. first person mode is really cool and the scenery is awesome. also something that i liked is they put in even more good songs into the radio stations, los stantos rock radio is the best haha. last but not least, hiests! if you are on the fence about getting this game id say go for it even if you have played it before like me on the ps3 or 360, its so much better on the pc.",31.1
"the definitive gta:v experience which, for me, was the ultimate multi-player game of the last generation. granted, its been a bit of a wait for the pc crowd, and the online facet of the game is not without its glitches (abominable lag despite having a +100 mbps connection, jumping into a car and not being able to drive for some reason, weird vehicle damage modelling loops, just-killed enemies coming back to life due to disparity between local and server-side assets, etc.), but when you compare it to similar games in the genre, i still think its way ahead of the competition. yes, the delays should have meant a more stable launch, and i agree that the whole windows username thing, whilst not affecting me personally, is a pretty big oversight, but a quick patch or two later and it should all be rectified. then again, im one of the jerks whos been playing it on xb360 and ps4 for the last year and a half, so im probably a whole lot more forgiving than the average pc user. either way, its a 09/10 from me - now we just gotta wait for a pc remake/sequel to red dead redemption.",19.5

"simply broken and wont start. unless i disable my graphics card. well done, rockstar. best money wasting simulator 2015. edit: after finally being able to get into the game after a recent patch, now i can say..  this game! from the bottom of my heart, im more disappointed and pissed off then ever. its  and so overrated. not even being close to worth the price - especially considering all the problems. i want a refund and now. this is not a bad game. but not worth the price tag and not even close to 10/10, or even 9/10. its a 7.5/10 at most.",1.8
"the 1st person option creates a whole new game and insight on the gameplay. even though i completed this game (story-mode) multiple times on ps3, and it ended up getting borring, i can do it all over with this game. the mechanics feel smooth and the driving is amazing! i would recommen using a controller for flying - but mouse/keyboard/first-person is deffinetly the way to go! 10/10 - would by again, and again, and again..!",34.1

"amazing game, rockstar obviously wanted to do the best delivery of a game they could and even if they didnt, that was achieved anyway but im sure they were. amazing graphics, better than any console graphics, 60fps makes it so much better and feel like youre actually there at times when youre in the amazing... 1st person mode! which you get on ps4 and xbox one anyway but still it looks way better on the pc. director mode makes it way better aswell because you can play as so many different characters and costumed characters which is alot of fun when bored in the game. definitely recommended (if you have a graphics card of atleast radeon hd 7770) but it might look alright on a lower one, but yeah definitely recommended!",16.4
"cant log into my rockstar account. gg release day bugs.....10/10 would play again",32.8
"absolutely amazing. nothing bad to say about the game itself, other than the fact that when i first started playing it driving around in the cars started to drop my framerate horribly from straight up 60, down to 5 or lower which really made me mad, but a couple of restarts of the game later bam its fine. 11/9",44.9

"if you havent bought this game yet, youre an idiot.",71.7
"overall this is a great game with some flaws. they should have allowed you turn down your graphics further for with my really bad computer, it lags on the lowest of settings. there are still some graphical errors which are probably because of my low end pc. i would give it an 8/10. i would take two points away because of the general flaws in the gameplay and graphical errors.",9.2
"holy  this game runs smooth and the graphics are amazing!",53.8
"what can i even say. the only real problem i have with the game the online menu. i dont like haveing to go to story mode to then go to the online menu, to then go to solo mode, friend only, or online mode. you shouild be able to drop into a solo or friend only mode from the online menu, without having to drop into story mode. if all this seems confusing, thats because it is. just like this games menu setup.",55.9

"this could be the game that saved triple-a titles. after a couple years of disappointing releases by the big publishers, and after a poor port of the previous gta game, expectations were low. pc gamers were cynical and not feeling all that great about spending big money on a game that has already been out on consoles for years. rockstar promised a great port and to my surprise, delivered big time. the game looks awsome in both story mode and online mode. i havent had any server problems. rockstar didnt throw out bs tactics like day-one dlc or pay-to-win gimmicks. rockstar did take their time making it-too much time in some peoples opinion, but if it takes this much time to do it right, to get a game that looks and plays as well as this, rockstar rewarded our patience. they showed that it can be done, and now the pressure is on the other publishers to do the same.",64.2
"the game is great and lots of fun! however, you all should know that it freezes and crashes in online multiplayer alot. expect to look and feel like a total scrub because you will crash at the worst possible time when doing heists with a group and let everyone down, and then itll rinse and repeat and everyone will hate you and unfriend you because of it. so much fun and so much to do, but eventually youll get enraged because of all the crashes. good luck, have fun ;)",53.8

"so i just installed gta 5 to my laptop (ihave nvidia 870m), after i opened up the game the right bottom bubble said gta5.exe has been blocked from graphic hardware and the game stopped working. i opened geforce experience to look for an update or something, but the app said the driver was unknown, it couldnt find the driver. after i restarted my computer it gave a blue screen report that says video_tdr_failure (nvlddmkm.sys) and when i opened up geforce experience again it couldnt not find any hardware. i tried to install the driver again but the installation program couldnt find the hardware either. i believe the problem is the new release of gta 5. also my gpu tweak program says the laptop is currently using intel graphics. after all these happened i contacted you and you told me that you should contact with the manufacturer. and i did that too and got my geforce experience fixed. this time when i open up the game my laptop shutted itself down 3 times. then i optimized the game from geforce experience. then it gave the blue screen again and there is no hardware detected again. i can fix it again but i dont think i can play the game again to not get the same crash.",18.8

"best gta pc port ever. i get 90-120 fps with a gtx 970. this game is epic on pc. thanks rockstar.",27.1
"i loved this game on the 360, but i love it even more now. the increase in graphics and fps makes the game so much more enjoyable, and the better controls (keybaord and mouse) make the gameplay much easier to use. there is also a lot more that has been added from the version i previously played also, increased amount of songs, increased amount of vehicles. the game is just absolutely amazing. 1000000000/10 for the pc release, shame it took nearly 2 years from the original release.",59.6
"game is great. to quote some of the worlds top-men, so much to do, so much to see, so whats wrong with taking the backstreets? but if you have a laptop like me, you can screw off. because just like dying light, this game just takes a huge dump on mobile graphics cards. gl hf",22.1
"my performance is really good if i turn down a few settings, the process to transfer my account from xbox was pretty fast too.",45.1

"so here it is. the pc game to end all others. first off, this game is extremely well optimised. ( at least for my system ) i have yet to really drop below 50fps. in terms of graphical fidelity however, it really takes the cake. my god. sometimes, ive felt like i was playing real life. buy this game, tell your friends. 10/10/10 - would ragdoll down a mountain again. but seriously. buy this game. buy it. stop reading this and buy it already. -.-",27.4
"bought this game and cant play it. very very bad! it think the game itself is great, but for that day-1 desaster rockstar deserves some bad reviews.",49.4
"this is a great game! i have had the 360 version and the ps4 version now i got this one and this version is the best so far!",7.3
"honestly, i was so excited at first when the pre-order for gta v went up, i purchased it in a heartbeat. and i jumped on as soon as i could to get it. the campaign is kind of glitchy, and online is absolute . i cant even get past the tutorial without my computer crashing. how long has it been since it came out for xbox? a year and a half? i would have rather waited longer for a game that actually works than what ive gotten now. if youre thinking of buying it, wait for the fixes first.",2.0
"its great and they are fixing everything real time",22.6
"i cant understand how they can do such a huge screw up on the first day. launch is not working for windows 8 pcs. what the f**k did they test this game on beore releasing it?",9.3

"was walking down the street. met a dog. talked to the dog. parachutist was rescued. love this game.",33.5

"if you like the previous couple gta games, youll like this one. gta v is the familiar gta formula with a lot of additions. thumbs up!",21.6
"the game its self is very very good. a huge improvement to the peasents beta test. ****warning**** amd users beware it hates our guts the  dont work right!!!! just warning you. it does work but there are some frame issues. and no its not my pc trust me.......my friends that are amd users as well are also having issues.",53.6

"really well optimized!!! played it on ps3, and now on pc its awesome! running with almost everything on high or very high at 1080p with dx11, it was worth the wait and delays. hardware: i5 2500k @stock 8gb 500gb sata2 (os + games) r9 280 3gb dual-x 900w cm ucp tried running it with my old 5850 1gb toxic, and it run pretty well with everything on low at 1080p with dx10 100% recommended! ps: graphics are ic!",37.0
"had no idea how much left-wing garbage was in this game. i tolerate a hell of a lot, but i watched about 5 minutes of a fake tv show in this game and perused a couple of fake websites in the game, and the entire thing is absolute left-wing satirical trashing of the right. stephen colbert may have well been the games starring character. i cant believe i gave these ers money. aside from the leftist garbage, the game requires 125+ gigabytes of free space to complete the installation process. that is outrageous.",5.8
"game doesnt even launch. ive tried all of the fixes that are currently being said and yet nothing works. i cant recommend a game that doesnt even play.",22.1
"biggest piece of  ever! paid for it, spend 3 days downloading it as the servers used for preload are just crap and now i cant even play the ing thing. the gta v launcher crashes every time i try and run it. as i cant even play this game, rockstar needs to give me my money back.",0.9
"definately a good port, i get 50 fps at 1080p on a 760 oem and a fx-8320. also a great game.",43.8
"still cant play the game. i click play, it spins up, steam says im in game, and it just crashes. dont even get a window or anything. i bought it back in january so dont feel like refunding, just waiting out for a patch i guess? i have a desktop with amd.",28.0
"ok, i edited my review because, after the new patch everything seems to work fine. it really sucks that when the launcher was crashing and i was unable to play, everybody just assumed that my system iwas  and i didnt know anything about computers when it was rockstars problem. steam support community doesnt exist. we should help each other, not critize everyone pcs, what a bunch of 10 years old, rockstar fanboys. saying that, the game is awesome and you should buy it right now. but you already knew that.",34.9
"this game is a piece of , freezes all the time and literally never opens in fullscreen even though i change my mothering settings for this piece of  every god damn time i start it. also the loading screens take longer than on the xbox 360, get with it rockstar learn to make games.",60.1
"when i play this game a feel butterflies in my pelvic area",93.3
"review in progress: so far in my experience on xbox this game easily wins 9/10 because of how fun it is. many bugs are easy to ignore. however having any amount of lag can  up your experience when being the passenger of a car because the car, like hydraulics, humps the ground. i feel the same on pc. pc includes better giraffics and better gameplay (imo) and its not fun unless you got friends to play with. the only con is that you really need a good pc otherwise you get 30 fps max. tl:dr 9/10",72.5
"this is the best ersion of gta v. if your rig can handle it, youre in for a treat. it runs very smoothly.",14.5
"im going to give this game a negative review for now and may change it later. the online is a complete mess and needs to be completely redone. rockstar needs to go back to the mess of max paine 3 and really figure out what needs to be done to correct gta 5 online. with lag a core issue which leads to teleporting players, vehicles, 90 degree turns that should not happen, and miss leading damage to other players when pvping. the load times to are terrible especially when trying to get into online with friends. the lobby play is nice but when the matches are done you should not be thrown out of a session if your playing with only friends and have to constantly have to resend invites. flying the planes/helicopters to me need to be tweeked alittle because they are alittle clunky. ive seen to many times heists bug out at certain parts and becoming stuck in a loading screen. the only thing im going to give positive for the game is the single player. the graphix are flawless with a amazing storyline. i could spend alot of hours playing only single player because of the replayability. like i said i may give the game a positive review but once more patches come out the game should hopefully be amazing.",59.6
"got three stars for robbing a convience store and continued to be chased by a helicopter while i was on foot. 10/10 excessive force",32.6
"theres just as much realism as there is giddy fun, just as much performance and optimization as there is jaw-dropping visual fidelity, and just as many dumb jokes as there are impossibly clever bits of writing. if i went to a fancy restaurant that served video games and ordered the priciest thing on the menu, i imagine this is what theyd roll out.",38.7
"although i had to reinstall after pre loading, the game ran beautifully and had little to no problems at all. so far, i have only had problems with the resolution not saving on startup, but i was able to fix it. other than that, this game is practically perfect, and i would reccomend it to anyone who enjoyed watch dogs or just cause.",29.9
"one of the best pc ports ive seen for a game this good it was worth the wait we hade for this they made gta 5 for pc the only real way to play and i cant be more happy good job rock star 60$ well spent",36.6
"best game i ever played from feeling to story! graphics are just wow",22.3
"if you can not log into the social club account that is linked to steam you can not activate this game. rockstar support wont help you. if you have this issue and buy this game, you wont be able to play.",0.3

"a little bit of stuttering in game ,i expect this to be fixed , otherwise its the perfect game !",83.2
"played the xbox360 version and i thought that looked beautiful... this just makes that version look 16bit! even if you played it first time around, this is well worth it as its still one of the best games around and its now stunning looking.",16.1
"i paid $60 for this game. pros: everything you could ever want out of a gta game. ... and then some. cons: 000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000",10.5
"this game was really worth the wait! the graphics are insane and it runs super smoothly on my pc which isnt even the best anymore. i didnt come across any problems with installing and playing the game, therefore gj rockstar^^",40.6
"was it worth the wait? yes. is it optimized? yes. are the controls nice? somewhat. grand theft auto v is greatly optimized. i currently have a gtx 660 and an amd fx-4300 at 3.8 ghz. i can play the game at high settings 1080p at 60 fps. thats how good it is. i have yet to figure out self radio, but i will figure that out tomorrow. there were slight multiplayer issues at launch, but thats to be expected. after about an hour they were quickly solved and i had no issues afterwards. all in all, a very solid launch. much better than the 360/ps3 launch, and the ps4/xb1 launch. i played about 3 hours with my friends on multiplayer, doing impromptu races and exploring all the new graphics settings and new items. it was incredibly fun. we have yet to do heists, but i cannot wait! if you liked grand theft auto v on the previous or next gen consoles, i highly recommend the pc version, the ultimate version.",32.6
"i love the game i just love it but the only thing is the controles are a bit....clunky one time i was drivin and i was making a left turn i wanted to sto[p making a left turn and i sound stay thrat way and same with movment i was runnin and wanted to stop runnin and i just continune running when im not touching anytthing. just to give yall a heads up hope rockstar fixs it in a up date",20.9
"played roughly 200 hours when it launched on the xbox 360, loved it, and now its finally back in its definitive edition and all them console peasants be like ay bruh thas some nice graphics u got ther and we be like well you know, just some normal pc master race thing, nothing special. but yeah honestly, its impressive, and having a good pc like i do makes it even better, it runs great with everything maxed out *cough*unlike gta iv*cough* and the time we waited to have it on pc was definitely worth it. some people are having some hardware issues, but you know, its pretty normal with games on day one nowadays. im currently experiencing some horrible mouse acceleration and fps drops in the menu, but this will get fixed eventually. bottom line : if you havent played it on console yet, buy it, if you played it on the xbox 360, buy it, if you have xbone/ps4... well, theres no real reason to buy except for the slightly better graphics so unless you have a potato, go for it if you have the money and the power to run it at 60fps high/ultra.",70.6
"after the intital pain from installation- buy it. thats the review if you like art in any form you have an excuse to buy this game",70.3
"max fov is about 70, maybe 80, even with the slider. kb control scheme is poorly concieved, poorly executed - inintuitive binds (eg num 5 and 8 for aircraft pitch? ...). third party drm. graphically profficient, pretty at times, even well optimized. shaders basically the same as all previous versions with some nice extra shiny bits here and there. detailed world. for two years work this just plain isnt good enough; just for a port. it would have been nice if rockstar put some thought into the pc ux. tolerated bad ports all this year, all last year. this mediocrity studios get away with is becoming so tiresome.",8.1

"it would be awsome if i just play the damn game.. rockstar dalayed this game so long and cant even bring the working game after finally releasing it.. i deeply regret that i pre-ordered this",22.1
"crazy fun game. great to play with friends. preordering was definitely a great idea to recieve the extra headstart money wise. very detailed environment and gameplay. amazing physics in game and amazing driving. no need for forza anymore. cons- i wish there werent so many different menus. a lot of loading screens. game will not let you go fullscreen with under 1gb on video card (windowed fullscreen is able to be chosen)",44.6
"although this came out after nerly two years after the orignal release, this is hands down the best version of the game i have played. the settings are top notch, it has sli and crossfire support day one and is the best optimised game rockstar has ever relased. they say you can run this game 4k@30 fps with a 760. i play at 3440x1440 with a pair of 780ti in sli and this game runs at round 75+fps on ultra settings. only thing i have to turn down is aa. i highly reccomend this game to anyone who has played the earlier version and to those who havnt yet. 10/10",45.3

"highly optimized this game, runs so smoth at 60fps maxed out, good job rockstar games",34.1
"first of all, the pc port was well worth the wait. the developers thought of everything; from showing how much vram is in use, to including a whole separate game mode (rockstar editor). performance is great and the graphics are stunning. overall, its just a fantastic pc port. ive been holding off gtav on the consoles because i wanted to experience this game completely fresh on the best possible platform and holy moly am i glad i did. after about 6 hours, its abundantly clear how marvelous this game is and i get to experience it at its maximum quality for the first time, w/o any spoilers or nothing. the gameplay is solid, the aesthetics are beautiful, and man, the story is phenomenal. i mean, im no real world gangster/etc kind of guy. hell, i really dislike the theme entirely and tend to avoid other games or media of the sort, but the writing in this game is just so top notch, so well thought-out, i found myself being invested in the characters and their stories. (havent touched the online yet so cant comment on that) ive barely scratched the surface of this game, but i believe ive played enough to highly recommend this game.",43.3
"amazing game, would love to see some touch up with the custimation of cars though :) 9/10",24.5
"the definitive gta:v experience which, for me, was the ultimate multi-player game of the last generation. granted, its been a bit of a wait for the pc crowd, and the online facet of the game is not without its glitches (abominable lag despite having a +100 mbps connection, jumping into a car and not being able to drive for some reason, weird vehicle damage modelling loops, just-killed enemies coming back to life due to disparity between local and server-side assets, etc.), but when you compare it to similar games in the genre, i still think its way ahead of the competition. yes, the delays should have meant a more stable launch, and i agree that the whole windows username thing, whilst not affecting me personally, is a pretty big oversight, but a quick patch or two later and it should all be rectified. then again, im one of the jerks whos been playing it on xb360 and ps4 for the last year and a half, so im probably a whole lot more forgiving than the average pc user. either way, its a 09/10 from me - now we just gotta wait for a pc remake/sequel to red dead redemption.",19.5

"ok let me start by saying i have been playing pc games since cs 1.4-5 with mirc and cal leagues.. ive played alot of games. yes i seem to enjoy first person shooters the best (bf4) but also enjoy games where i can explorer and do what i want. this game does everything that all current games do.. its like 30+ games in one.. u really can do whatever. its the first step into a world like the movie gamer.. which can get interesting! as for gta, for me its like playing gta part 1 on pc from the top view, but super hd bad  graphics and lots of content. simply amazing!",16.5
"runs smoothly with a gtx 970, unfortunatelly also frequently freeze the whole system, needing a hard reboot. once fixed this will be a terrific game",14.1
"game is amazing! so much fun and have zero issues. looks and runs amazing in 1080p 60fps. sorry for those that cant play but you should reserve your negative reviews untill you actually play it. getting pissy in a negative review on steam isnt going to help your problems and you are just bashing an otherwise amazing game. this game is a must buy!!",43.0

"ok, the single playercampaing is really nice, cool characters, involving story etc. multiplayer, on the other hand is bad. matchmaking only works in this game if you have frineds, in this case you wouldnt spend hours in empty ques. because of the ques, there is literally nothing to do, yeah the races, store burglaries, stealing cars and deathmatches are all there, but guess what, you in a 2 hour gameplay you will spend 1 hour 45 minutes trying to find somebody to play with. and the loading times in multiplayer is insane. all this fuzz about heists, great times etc - i cant see, because frankly i dont have the patience for waiting instead of playing.",33.8

"if you had the grand theft auto v launcher has stopped working bug, a recent patch has fixed it. game works for me now. good pc port. if youre hoping for a decent online community though, you wont find it here. people will shoot at you randomly and run over you and call you racial slurs, but you can turn on passive mode to prevent them from doing that. the first two things anyway, theyll still call you racial slurs.",36.2

"buy this at your own risk. looks like almost all of the negative reviews are from people who cannot even play the game due to social club errors. im currently still not able to launch the game after hours trying the possible fixes. still no response on this issue from rockstar after more than 1/2 a day. i rarely pre-order and i sure do regret this one.",73.5
"runs ok with my asus radeon hd 6850 in 1080p at around 35-60 fps, though while driving it goes down to about 25-30 fps. i ordered a new gpu today and i hope it will run a lot better. 11/8 would have gay sex for this game",23.3
"same issue as many other laptop gamers. unable to launch game unless i disable my nvidia 780m. i have been re-enabling the nvidia gpu immediately after the game launches but for some unknown reason the game still runs as if its not. so multiple issues: - unable to the lauch normally with a nvidia 780m - 780m gpu is not supported for gta 5, even if it says it is - even after the 780m is enabled after game launches, game still runs off of factory intel gpu i love gta 5 (played it on xbox 360 and xbox one) and would love to be able to enjoy the game on this pc, but alas, i cant. now the nvidia 780m that i have is pretty good (runs arma 3, total war: attila, battlefield 4 just fine) and should not be having issues with gta. the issues are with this launch. i mean come on, no support for portable gamers (laptops)? no support for certain nvidia gpus? buggy and unstable gameplay for those that can run gta? gta 5 has been out for 2 years... come on rockstar. get your $hit together. awaiting the much needed patch in order to play. kinda of wishing i didnt waste $60 bucks.",8.3
"well after 14hours of problems regarding social club,errors etc. after launch i was pissed off. toke a while to fix everything on my end, if you buy it make sure if you have windows 7 service pack 1 update, if you have pirated win7 get the sp1 update from their site or 3rd party site. once everything was done, game runs smothly, online doesnt crash, truly experience worth the money!!! i give this 9.7/10",24.3

"this game is good graphically, very good visuals even for an older pc like my own. for that reason i will give it a thumbs up. the story is very diversified, lots of different situations arise with generally unique results. however, this series suffers from one drawback, considering i tend to enjoy having choices now; there is a distinct lack of choice in how the story goes. this, in my opinion, lowers the re-playability value of the game. while being a great game visually, not having the amount of room that one had back in gtasa is disappointing, not to mention missing some sort of choice making. but i will admit, thats another publishers tendency and not r*s.",2.4
"absolutely shatters the standard for open-world gaming, and is the pinnacle of the grand theft auto formula. outrageously entertaining: excellent writing, interesting characters and story, much improved gameplay mechanics, and the sheer amount, detail, and scope of fun, funny, and weird things to do make this game a blast. longtime gta fan or never played one in your life, doesnt matter - if you dont hate fun, you should buy this game. absurdly large number / 10.",23.5

"man, first person takes this game to another level. at first i thought it was poorly optimized, and have the rig to run it great. i soon learned all you have to do if you get stuttering, is alt+tab out and click icon back in. this has fixed all stuttering without lowering graphics options at all. gta v is a lot of fun, and was well worth the wait. 3 characters to control is a nice switch-up. good variation of missions. this game on pc looks way better, and runs smoother than the consoles. i would recommend this game to anyone who wants to take a hiatus from life for a bit heh heh. recommended!!",66.4

"this is an edited review. after a not so great launch it seems as though impleting some fixes has now made my game stabe. this is what i have seen so far from the single player the best gta there has ever been, the story is amazing. i am running it on a medium tier pc, an i5 2500k overclocked to 4.0ghz and a gtx660 gpu and 8gig of ram, i am able to get a constant 60fps with high to normal settings with aa and vsync on and i can only imagine after patches i will be able to push it a little further but i am quite happy with how it looks and runs on my hardware. this game is a must buy especially if you have been waiting for the pc release and have not played it on console. i have not played much online as yet but i have watched plenty of livestreams of online play and the scope of it just seems amazing with more than enough to do, it will be a game i will be playing every moment i have free time this year for sure. nothing short of an amazing game!",46.4

"gta v single player might be fun but i havent played it except to unlock online. im bored of gta online. something about the level/money grind, random ai headshots thatll instantly kill you, and the sync system that would rather sync the random civilians, weather and traffic than position data across the internet. the fact it plays more like a tactical cover shooter yet 90% of missions are out in the open with tons of nothing between you and the enemy and the fact the online is kind of annoying in how you have to spend more time setting up a game with friends than it takes to join a bunch of random s. also fps stutters which when tied to the problems of online play makes it a bigger mess.",53.4

"so hard to play online..its keep loading! please fix it!",33.9
"moving on from the console versions of gta v, even after months of delaying and waiting, this game proves to still amaze all gamers. obviously, the graphics is the biggest upgrade, but the delation for the release of the game turned out well for its great optimization to the pc port. its amazing how relatable gameplay is with consoles just by using a controller. feels like theres no difference except (better) performance, graphics, and details in the game (like its music). i already owned a 360, ps4, and xbox one version of gta v, but it was well worth $60 to buy the pc version. you get what you paid for, and even more. this pc port is what every game developer should aim for. how optimized it is at launch compared to other games that releases a dead-bugged game that makes it almost impossible to play. its safe to say that all gta players will be missing out on a new experience if they dont purchase this game. 10/10",32.7
"wow, just... wow, i have played this so much on ps4 so i expected to be bored the first day this was realised, this pc version feels completly different compared to the consoles, it almost feels like a whole new gta game, the graphics are unreal and probably the best graphics i have ever seen in a video game, so easy to run on such high quality, by far the best game av played in years... 10/10 by far. the long painfull wait was woth it!",56.4

"firstly i have been waiting for this game since console release, and swore to only play it on pc as im not a console fan. i pre-ordered the game in january with much anticipation and excitement. although the game was pushed back a couple times due to technical issues, i didnt mind as i wanted gta v to run correctly on my system, i mean who wants a broken game? secondly, as soon as i launched the game when it became live, i fell in love with it, it is all i had hoped for and im incredibly impressed with the way it has been optimized. unfortunately, nothing is ever perfect and neither is this game. day 2 after release and i can no longer continue with the game, as it crashes with every mission i begin, now as disappointing as this is, im not angry like a lot of people are, you need to allow the game a couple of weeks to allow rockstar to iron out the game breaking bugs. even though i havent played as much storyline as i had hoped at this point, i highly recommend it to any rockstar fanboy/fangirl, as it is one of the best games i have played in a very long time, visually and performance wise. well done rockstar on an amazing game!",45.7

"the graphics look like the damn ps3, some parts look nice.. but the shadows are very choppy, trees are glitching out, and i cant use my mouse, it staggers too much, im forced to use the wired xbox controller, and my graphics card fans are screaming in over load anyway.. rockstar ed up, i thought with the amount of delays the pc version had, i thought it would be better without glitches, i guess i was wrong, i think the rockstar team need to learn to create games for the pc first then work on consoles, they did better that way im playing at 60 fps 60 hz cause i cant play any lower other wise the shadows are all choppy and the cars have glitches in the textures",88.6

"a new and fresh experience with gta v with update graphics and all the other content arrived in one big bundle. no need to wait for gta online, no need to wait for hesists, all the things that were on the console is on pc as well. sure, it took a couple years for it to be released, but hey, at least they released it. optimization is pretty good from the system requirements, but with my 970 graphics card, everything on max still had some jumps on the fps. nothing too major, and nothing a couple of patches cant fix. overall, this game looks amazing, and if anybody has played on last generation console like me, you would appreciate the mesmerizing graphics.",20.3

"this game is for me, and a lot of other people, a broken and dissapointing experience that only brings frustration with customer support half- at best. sure rockstar, you got a few results for a few bugs, but allllll the other ones you are baltantly ignoring, thank you for that. wish steam would simply give me a refund for a game where i can only start up the social club before everything goes wrong, but alas, that is only a distant hope at best.",1.4

"having played a combined 75+ hours between the x360 and the pc i feel confident enough in my review. this game takes place in a obvious parody of los angeles where there are plenty of things to do and pop culture refrences to find (no spoilers for those). the main story has a total of ~40 hours and then another ~5 in side missions. the main story is very different from those of the other gta games but it is still quite interesting. the online mode is par with some other online games but it could be more fleshed out in my opinion.",32.4

"my pc met all requirements the only question mark was gpu which is integrated, it will still run and smoothe though rockstar really did a good job with this. i can tell they made full use of the delay times they had, with my integrated graphics card i shouldnt be able to run it but i can. however that will be upgraded today. was well worth the wait rockstar great job on making the pc version. ps. which is not a port it was developed with the main game side by side",84.6

"as i am writing this, some people are reporting issues with launching the game due to an issue with windows user names. unfortunately, i cannot speak for them. my experience, however, has been perfect. this game runs silky smooth on my computer, which has a i7 4770k and a gtx 980. i am running at 1080p, 60 fps and maxed out settings. i do not have a 4k monitor, so i dont know how well it runs in 4k. there is no doubt in my mind that this is the definitive version of the game. after 1 1/2 years, we finally get to see los santos the way it was meant to be seen. and thats just the graphics. my favorite thing about this port is that it doesnt even feel like a port to me. it runs like it was meant to be played on pc. the addition of the clip editor and director mode adds a whole new level of depth to the gameplay. the director mode allows you to use characters from the game. many are already unlocked, but some have to be earned through gameplay. that already sounds like so much fun, and thats before mods. which will make this game perfect.",55.1

(makes 0 sense) (minor) - graphics not what i expected on the maximum settings for pc, hopefully someone could make a hd texture mod hopefully these problems will be fixed soon, i probably will not play until next patch.

(i did have the windows account error - which was an easy fix for me.) the game is just purely stunning and the crisp sounds of engine and rifles. the story line... now that is an amazment that would keep you entertained for days and days! the gta online dlcs; some may be bad but then you have massive ones such as gta online heists which is just spectacular. this game could bring hundreds of hours of fun once you really get into it!",11.7

"ps4 version looks and runs better. it can feel nice for a bit at 60fps but frequent frame drops destroy the experience. there is also a very restrictive graphics options menu, as in you can change the options but the game will not let you play the game if it thinks you are out of memory. this can happen often as the game does not pick up on multiple graphics cards and large amounts of ram. a better port than gtaiv but its still not a high enough quality to warrant purchasing this version. only buy if you have a rig way above the reccomended settings and can afford a new hard drive because this is a resource hog and a disgusting large game to install. all in all the order for gta v goes ps4/xbone > pc >360/ ps3.",1.4

"after watching the positive pc port report video totalbiscuit made i figured gta v would be a great pick up, but unfortunately i ran into so many issues rightaway that i ended up requesting a refund which was still an option due to the other problems the game had. issues i had: - jerky/laggy mouse movement in the menu. changing vsync or mouse input didnt help. - settings didnt save after quitting the game and restarting - display calibration screen on every start - benchmark crashed to desktop after a 3 minute black screen - fps tied to sensitivity (not this crap again, sigh) i run a i7-4790k, 16 gb, r9 290x machine and from what i could see from my short experience, the actual framerate ingame is fine so performance seems ok otherwise. this is the first refund ive ever requested and im glad it was still an option. fully priced games, in this case even more, should always have an option for refunds to avoid these sorts of things. one thing steam could learn from origin. i hope they patch the game and fix all these issues because i am certain the underlying game is brilliant, but i just cant support it while theres so many problems before even getting to the actual playing part.",0.8

(fx-4100) the textures look great compared to the previous version i played on the last-generation consoles, even on the normal setting. the game has a very useful video memory gauge like the other rockstar ports which makes tweaking the options a cinch. i had no trouble transferring over my gta online character from the ps3 version, and the online so far hasnt given me any trouble in terms of connectivity. i did have some trouble with what seemed like mouse acceleration, and i was unable to find an option to disable it. but after changing from raw input to directinput it seems to be much better. all in all, id say it was worth the wait.",40.4

"so its been about 7 hours since gta was finally ready to play. a year and a half could not have prepared my eyes (and my mind) from the visual onslaught brought on by the high resolution textures of gta in the very high settings. the amount of detail that was put into every aspect of the visuals is impeccable, from the high detail of car headlights to the boob wobble when you shoot a woman in a bikini with a beretta for looking at you funny. once you adjust to the detail you realize that the game seems to be set in overdrive mode, almost seems like its being fast forwarded. thats because its at 60fps, where our eyes have been used to seeing the game run at a near constant 30fps, to see it doubled is amazing. its is truly the ultimate version, better than both console generations combined.",2.8
"the patch and amd driver update (beta) actually made the game a lot faster and more stable (it was barely playable at first). there are some technical flaws thogh. nice visuals, quite stable fps, a-lot-of-new to explore and learn. suddenly theres something more time consuming than skyrim. i didnt try gta online yet since my internet is very unstable atm; people say its chaos and the most of the time you watch load screens, not los santos. im very happy with the singpleplayer so far. maybe the game is not totally worth the full price (i usually buy games on huge sales), but its not waste either. so, im pretty happy with the buy and i look forward for new updates/fixes. specs: msi gx70 laptop (fullhd) amd a10 5750m (2.5/3.2 ghz) radeon hd8970m 2gb gddr5 16gb ddr3 1600mhz 7200 rpm hdd win7 64 settings: 1920x1080 high texture quality high shadow quality high reflections quality softest shadows v-sync: half (30 fps) fxaa the rest is low/default. 9.5/10 (not so satisfying shooting, few other things are off, otherwise very enjoyable). 2015-04-17",19.7

"- newbie to the gta series - the only gta game i ever played was the very first one that came out in 1997 on pc. i decided to buy this one due to all the hype and the much talked about graphics improvements. i have never been this satisfied paying $59.99 for a game ive barely knew anything about - much less played. the level of detail put in this game is amazing. everything from the graphics to the story line, truly impressive. this is the type of game that you dont have to worry about completing in a day. i am looking forward to playing this game for many months. there are small issues here and there that i noticed as far as bugs in the game but i anticipate they will be fixed in the near future. if you are on the fence about this game, i definitely recommend it. as a newbie to the series, i am glad i pulled the trigger on this one. funny acting, great story line, impressive graphics, tons of missions, awesome online multiplayer and it will push your high end card(s) to the limit. 9/10",57.2

"very disappointing. having not played this on another platform previously, it was entirely new to me. the plot is very very poorly written, haphazard, vague, and short. if i hadnt messed about doing unnecessary things it could easily be completed in 10 hours. compared with gta 4, the story is severely lacking. the graphics engine and port to pc however, very well done. after the debacle with the gta 4 port i was worried. but this was ported very well and even on an old machine runs well on mid graphics. the online experience isnt particularly inspiring however. feels like they tried to include a lot, and in doing so made it quite unenjoyable. i wish i could recommend this, the engine and potential are great. but the story and characters are just pathetically scripted. their actions in the parts you cannot control make no sense at all (including the npcs), and if there is a plot that youre supposed to be able to follow, it seems huge parts of it are never spoken, and just assumed happened. wait until its on offer, was not worth preordering.",56.8

"im very positive about this game, we all know whats good about it. still some points that need attention: - combat is quite bad (especially if you played a lot of shooters) it feels clunky, slow, weird hit registration, annoying movement. - first person mode is a bit of a flop. it could have been made a lot better. - interface and keymapping is bad, just like any console port. having to press enter or moving your mouse to a small corner to confirm something doesnt work smooth. it just feels slow like on a console. (played gta5 on xbox360 for about 200 hours) combat was actually better on the 360, felt way more fluent.",20.4

"yes, i would recommend this game. a couple things first. (i can only vouch for amd) the game is not optimized for pc yet. it crashes randomly, i get ballz fps drop when driving, flying, ect (i have an amd 6970 in crossfire. thats 4gb video memory) around 30-45 fps, and the graphics option and advanced graphics options dont really give that much. it needs more options and locations on how to change this. i cant even edit it manualy through the file browser in windows where its installed. i love the cut scenes and story mode but if the game isnt optimized i cant even play it! rockstar please fix this. i know its all softwear sided. many pc gamers have been waiting forever, including me, for this game to come out and the least you could do is make it run smooth.",63.4

"finally..... so im running an overclocked i5-3570k (ivy bridge) and a gtx 970 and the game runs great maxed out. i turn off vsync and refection quality lower since that seems to give me stuttering issues (probably related to ram), but everything else is pretty much as high as it can get. i float around 60-70 fps even with population density all the way up, though it does drop considerably when in a vehicle in first person. not sure what thats about, but they may have a fix for it down the line. the game itself is expectantly great, nothing different from the console versions. havent dabbled in online or heists yet, but im sure theyre just as good as they were on consoles, although im expecting a serious frames drop, but thats bound to happen in a multiplayer setting. all-in-all, if you lost your social life playing the console versions and you want the benefit of higher graphical capabilities and future modding, then dont hesitate to buy the game. its good 98% good to go. anxious to see what the modding community will do with this thing down the road.",25.3

"here is a list of reasons why this game is 11/10 1.amazing port 2.didnt crash at launch 3.didnt make me cry cause the game was broken 4.looks ing beautiful! 5.just an all around amazing ing game",49.4
"you must buy this game.very optimized,lots of fun,great time waster.",52.6
"total waste of money. wont even start. does simply nothing. its a very good simulator how to start a game and a very hard one, too. i did not menage to get past the first level...which there is start the game.",29.6
"rarely do i purchase games day 1, very very rarely do i purhcase a game 3 times all on day 1 release. i love gtav with an amounting passion that easily surpasses childhoods greatest gaming memories. a great story, that has mounting tension between mission that i have never seen matched in another game. a multiplayer of multiplayer games, with great heist missions console players waited what felt like ages for, and a online freemode that can keep any bored gamer happy for hours on end. i recommend this game blindfolded as to the new additions to the gameplay and visuals. if you have a masterful pc and a 4k monitor, all the better. do yourself a favor, and purchase this game.",32.5
"worth the 60.00 dont see why theres so many neg reviews.....alot seem to be not updated systems... either way great game. worth the money and alot of fun to be had online",67.4

"one of the best pc ports ive seen in a while. great work rockstar! :)",64.7
"tons of fun. its everything from console gta v and more! controls are great, its almost impossible to tell its a port. the game also look amazing with tons of graphical settings. driving into certain areas does make the game lag quite a bit, but this is probably something to do with my computer. other than that though this game is amazing.",19.2
"this  is full of loading screens, absolutely 0 logic at all. you enter a job, you get kicked, you waste like 3204598235901233401294531285239149123493125682359123491294 seconds of your ing life.  this game.",12.6

"to keep it really short and simple, it was definitely worth the wait for the pc version of gta v. it runs like a dream and looks just as nice as ir runs. pcmr ftw!",18.2
"as someone who has played gta5 on ps3 and clocked many hours in it so far, id have to say that the pc version was definitely worth the wait. they could have released it in a state like gta4 was when it was finally brought to pc but they decided to polish it which im grateful for. so far ive clocked 69 hours (perhaps a little too much...) and every second of it has been wonderful. the only issues (that i personally have experienced) would be a large fps stutter when ive been playing the game for longer than 2 hours, however after restarting my pc it allows me to play for another 5 (i regrettably tested this last night...) tl;dr: fun game, restart pc if stutter. i now have no life. thanks rockstar, you enabler.",79.2

"id reccomend this game because well, it is a fantastic game but right now the game runs awful after around 20-30 minutes and even faster than that if you are driving. edit: now i cant even load into the game, it just has an infinite loading screen..",28.8
"the multiplayer matchmaking is absolute garbage. be prepared to spend 80% of your time in this game either loading, finding a free roam session with people actually in it, and looking for players for your game lobby. the best part is when someone disconnects from your heist and you have to start the process all over again... what the . it can take up to 20 minutes to start a mission that only takes 5 minutes to complete. pros: + fun when it works, that 20% of the time + looks good, runs very well cons: - random disconnects from free roam modes, putting you in your own session alone - takes absolutely ing forever to find people to play with - if someone disconnects from your heist, you must start the process all over - loading screens can sometimes take up to 4 minutes (on an ssd!!) the hardest part about this game is not being able to play.",30.2
"good game but for some reason my game crahsed when i tried to save . happed only once so far . also it crashes if i use 2 gpus but works with 1 .",49.0
"a rare, but fantastic, port from rockstar. the development team have clearly learned that the pc community wont be satisfied with copypasta garbage (*cough* gta iv *cough) and, as a result, have come out with a highly optimised game that can truly be considered the difinitive version. hopefully soon, those guys on gtaforums or whoever will be able to crack and modify the game folders they can, currently, only see through openiv. the modding potential for this game is enormous... its just a shame that rockstar didnt embrace this idea as openly as, say, bethesda with skyrim and the like. if you can run it (and you porbably can), buy it. this is one of the best open world games ever created and youd be doing youself a disservice not to have it on your hard drive.",24.2
"this game was really fun on xbox and im sure its even more fun on pc and id live to play if it wasnt for the fact that i cant stay in game for more then 15 minutes. they game crashes way too much for what it is, its benn delayed and has a large team that should know what they are doing. ive looked everywhere and i cant find one solution that works or anything from rockstar saying they are working on it or even that they know that the game is crashing for so many people. i payed for a game this big it shouldnt be crashing this much. ive seen early access games made by a single person that crash less then this.",64.2
"day one issues happen with almost every game. i didnt experience any though. pc gaming takes patience guys. this is the most emersive game in the series by far. there is a lot of world building decent story and fairly exellent gameplay.",27.8

"crashes, crashes, crashes, crashes and oh; even more crashes and rockstar arent doing anything to help me out trying to fix this at all... ive sent in a support ticker - got a response about the console version... totally makes a lot of sense, right? error: launcher_err_invalid_outfile within 20 minutes of launching the game i get the following pop up crash window grand thef auto v has stopped working not the launcher!!!",16.8
"its still early on in this games life, but even at release the game plays and looks amazing even on my 760. you will need a fair amount of vram, so watch out and be prepared.",22.4

"huge disappointment. out of all the delays with heist and the polishing of gta v pc just to have some simple login error be the cause of not being able to play a game because of a character in your name is pretty pathetic. i payed 50$ for what? to get a message that says socialblade crash... its fine ill just unlink my steam account... oh wait! you cant! lol absolute trash. way to go rockstar. way to screw your loyal fans who spend their hard earned money on something they cant even play. kudos.",0.6
"really enjoying it so far. the level of detail is amazing. espcially like the ai cats.",29.9
"what makes rockstar think they are too cool to support dual graphic card switching? its 2015 and no laptop have dual graphic cards? which idiot in rockstar made this decision? we should launch a petition to fire that idiot! ive seen lot of players complaining about the crashing and received no reply at all. for me, the crashing is caused by the dual graphic card becasue i can open it using my integrated graphic card. as soon as i openned the dedicated one it died instantly!!! gg rs!!",2.9
"first person i met poured gasoline on my feet and lit me on fire. 10/10 would make friends again",54.0
"4 hours in and im absolutely enjoing it. i did however have some problems right at the beginning and i believe it was from the drivers, reason being was that i removed the beta driver made by amd for gta v optimisation and now i haent crashed since. i still get a few lag spikes where my framerate will drop to around a quarter however it is still manageable.",33.8
"game runs great! really well optimized! gta online works flawlessly, i have not had any problems with lag or bugs. the singleplayer story is the same, its interesting and intreaguing. in my 25h of game time (that 25h was all on gta online) i have come across 1 bug that has happened 3 times, the bug made it impossible for me to play a mission, it locked the camera on my characters face, restarting the mission fixed it. that bug will probably be fixed in a patch soon. one note about gta online though, in my opinion you need friends to play with, otherwise it will be boring, but thats just my opionion. what can i say, gta v on pc is awsome and you should buy it. rockstar worked hard on this game and the results are clear. 10/10",82.7
"after about 3 hours of playing i can definitely recommend this game to anyone. it has been a long wait but this game is worth the money. one of the best additions to the pc version is the director mode and the 60fps boost. director mode will be a unique tool to use once everyone gets the hang of it but it is still really cool. playing with a mouse and keyboard seems a little awkward at first but you can get used to it. i personally feel like after playing this game that this game was made for pc as it is extremely superior to every other version. so finally i give a rating of 8/8 buy dis game yo.",47.7

"ive just bought this game for almost a hundred bucks and 1. its taken me 4 hours to download to 90% before restarting and begining from 50%!!! 2. then after having the game it took another hour to load the first mission in storymode (which crashed for no reason halfway through and i had to re-load again and play the mission. 3. i finally got to avatar creator on online mode when it repeatedly crash again. the game then came up with a warning saying the game was curupt and now im re downloading it. ive wasted 2 days and 100 bucks. thx",2.2
"-the experience on pc is simply amazing, with my gtx 970 i get an average of 55-65fps in the cities at high/ultra (x2 msaa). -the mouse and keyboard works flawlessly and the gamepad too! (gamepad for driving, mouse shooting). -i have a adata 256gb ssd but my game still take an average of 45 to 60 seconds to fully load the game. -the first person fov is horrible, it gives me headaches after a while. -when you die in a heist, you screen freeze on your characters instead of going in the sky. -even on a ssd and visibility at max, objects/pedestrians and cars still pops out of no where. i recommend this game even if you already have it on console!",48.4

"to say this is a good game is like saying that the ceiling of the sistine chapel is a nice painting. you play it and wonder why all games cant be as good as this. brilliant gameplay, story ,graphics, sub games, achievements. i am 7 hours in and so far i have loved every second. has to be one of the best games i have ever played.",28.4
"guys buy this game !!! it was worth to wait for. awesome !!! 10/10",50.7
"lets start this review off by saying that im playing the game on a hp pavillion hpe pre-built computer, which is the pinnacle of outdated rigs. my geforce gtx 550 ti wasnt made for this, not at all. ive been running the game in a borderless 4:3 window with most graphics settings on normal (which is the lowest setting) to keep the game stable around 30 fps. heres the deal though; ive been having an absolutely great time playing the game regardless. the controls are great and the game looks very good, even on the lowest settings. ive already played through the story before on console, so ive been spending most of my time in gta online, which does have the occasional connection problems. problems which are likely attributed to the high load on the rockstar servers. all in all, the pc version definitely has issues. however, the pc version is definitely better than the console versions were and is one of the best (if not the best) aaa games released so far in 2015. of course, opinions may vary and the best way to find out would be playing it yourself. ps: loading screens.",24.5
"this by far is the best game on pc. yes it is demanding if you want good graphics but the sheer quality of gameplay means you wouldnt even care if the game was 8 bit it is that fun!",9.1
"i pre-ordered it 2 month ago, w8ed this far, and now it just wont run with my nvidia gpu, just the built-in one and believe me it sucks to play on intel gpu. 1/10 until fixed fixed*** 1010 worth it, great game but still alot of bugs to fix",22.5
"buy the holy heck out of this. totally worth the wait. 11/10",18.8
"finally gta v on pc after a long time. good job rockstar games.",84.8
"very very awesome game ^_^ you guys should try it ^_^ its very addictive ^_^ :)))",82.1
"first thing i did was turned model detail all the way up and went to strip club 69/69",3.8
"incompatible with laptop computers without a semi-complicated workaround that involves turning the gpu off and turning it back on before the game loads. unfinished game.",19.6
"the game crashes while trying to launch. this problem has been reported by many users now, and its been just a couple of hours since release. i will get the refund and go buy the retail version. what a disaster.",36.6
"first of all the singleplayer is impressive as hell, its a great port with no stutter in frame rate, i have a 2 year old pc so its not the best yet i still get 1080p/60, which is just excelent. but online is a different story, frame drops, friend list being different on social and steam, hard to join games, even harder playing with friends, a huge amount of lag, both server side and the game itself. and i didnt get my million dollar bonus! im sure most online issues will fix themselves over time, when a billion people arent trying to play at once, but currently the online experience is lackluster.",22.6
"useless game doesnt work. cant start it up keeps failing wishing i didnt buy the stupid thing",18.6
"dont buy at the moment, wait until they have fixed the bugs. also rockstars servers are terrible. bad support from the staff and no clear way of fixing things.",21.3
"well, great launcher crashes everytime i try to play. i give this game a solid 10/10",1.8
"very fun. incredibly gorgeous. incredibly well optimized. pushes my dual 780 tis to the limit, but the graphics maxed out at 1080p60 are amazing.",16.7
"what a sucking game it wont even start and the suloson dont work so rockstar and again you fail",5.5
"why the  did i think pre-ordering this would be a good idea? i tried getting through the social club login screen but i forgot my password. so, i reset it, confirmed the email, and typed in my username and password. *youre account is locked due to multiple failed password entries*.....",0.1
"the game launched hours early in north america (props to that) the game looks just as good as the ps4 version on a medium end pc but still cranks that 60fps out with no trouble gta online worked, had no troubles connecting. no framerate drop joining a full server either. so far, id say this is a great iteration of the game. having played the last and next gen versions, this is clearly the winner.",14.4
"love this game!!! i watched the countdown timer until it was time to play! i like mmos and fps. this game combines the 2 i imagine ill be playing this one no life style for awhile. plenty of fun things to do and you can never get bored so many differernt things to do.",28.2
"maybe i will change my review later but it is ridiculous that i have paid 60 dollars for something that will not load correctly. at this point do not buy this unless you want rockstar to give you excuses and fixes that do not work instead of a game.",27.4
"theres so many bugs if you try save game in your home game will crash and if you press menu button game will crash :(",75.7
"the game is giant, full of content, innovation, the storyline is interesting, every mission is interesting, nothing you do feels repetitive, the game easily immerses you into its world, having 3 characters, to me, feels like rockstar covered every single point of view that you usually get from gta protagonists, franklin for the times of gta: sa, michael for every other protagonist, and trevor for those crazy rampages you used to go on for no reason, just because its fun to kill people. currently, gta: online is full of annoying bugs and is barely playable, the servers put you in with people all across the world, chinese, australian, which makes playing with them impossible due to lag, and ruins the overall experience, rockstar has a lot to fix before online becomes fun, but you can still go ahead and give it a try.",55.8
"its okay. i expected much more. if you havent played it on any console before, buy it. if you have, i recommend you to not buy it. i played this on ps3 and ps4 as well, so i have some experience and knew how the game would be like. however, running at recommended specs (760 & fx-6630), i didnt find it to look any better than the ps4 version, other than the addition of 60 fps. and actually, some of the textures look worse than the ps4 version (this is at normal texture settings). definetely need a good desktop to run this at high settings, 1080p, 60 fps, and to make sure it looks better than the consoles. hopefully its just a bug on rockstars end, and might send out a patch to fix the graphics, but right now im not impressed.",18.9
"this game has totally destroyed my social life as of playing this... every time i finnish a mission, im like one more, then ill sleep. 8 missions later im keeling over my keyboard writing this review and wondering how im not dead by now. soooooo f**cking good. plays really nice on pc and looks great. this game gives me more of a reason than ever, to be a proud member of the pc master race, and i havent even played online yet! 10/10 rockstar you took your sweet  time making this but boy am i glad you guys (and gals, gender equality) did.",40.5
"looks and runs much better then gta iv. no fps lock and running smooth. so far the wait has been worth it. great game and great port.",42.7
"im glued! excellent optimization for the pc; runs 30 fps comfortably at high settings on my old processor (2.3ghz) with a gtx750ti. highly addicting gameplay!",25.9
"10/10 peformance is surprisingly good and it looks great. i have looked forward to this since the first trailer for gta 5 was released.",27.5
"if you only own a keyboard/mouse combo (or plan to only use one) gta is ready to frustate you. gta loves to throw you into the deep end without prep time, wether its driving, shooting, diving or flying. flying however is the worst, with default pc controls being an unworkable nightmare that also happens to be delivered while being shot at. from my current perspective flying in gta v is about -10 of fun and there is no excuse for it. it isnt just dedicated flying titles that do it better, like world of warplanes, but also so called rivals - where one presume rockstar paid at least cursory attention to - like the saints row entries 3 and 4. they all can boast better control schemes right out of the box and that makes the poor performance of gta on this front all the sadder. im now off to see if that gamepad i bought for emergencies is any better at not hitting the virtual ground but even it is - why the hell do i need to install an entirely new input mechanism when there a several aaa title that dont need it ? steering planes on a pc isnt some new and arcane art.",45.9
"its gta v. also a good port light on drm compared to gta iv.",62.4
"this is the third time ive bought this damn game and i am still in love with it, the 60fps alone makes this worth buying, then when you think about the mods that are coming you would be a fool not to buy this game. as for any problems with the game, ive only encountered a few bugs but no crashes or issues with rockstar service, gta online logs in faster then on the consoles from my experience.",16.0

"crashes at launcher itself. money burnt. feeling pissed. update: read some posts in the discussions page. found out that the launcher crash is related to nvidia optimus technology. have to disable my nvidia gpu before starting the launcher and thereafter enable it again. the game works now and is pretty well optimized (so no complaints there). but the fact that you have to do this stuff everytime you want to play blows. update 2: well, a 427 mb update fixed the launcher problem and now i have no problems recommending this game.",51.8

"after a long wait, us pc masterrace folk have finally recieved gta v. not only is this a huge screw you to the console players, but this is a great step for us all. long live the pc masterrace. in all seriousness gta v for the pc is great. its alot more than just a port, it plays perfectly for me and exceedes my expectations. the graphic options make the game really come that much more to life, it plays and looks amazing. if you were on the fence of this being a good port or not like i was, trust me. its a good port. see you in los santos!",27.7
"awesome game, good activity if you have free time or need to spend time with your friends.",78.8
"played 13 hours straight no breaks at launch. this is rockstars best work, a fantastic pc port, and heres hoping future rockstar games on pc will be as optimized and polished as this. this serves as a fine example of pc ports done correctly. well worth the wait.",22.0
"i have been waiting for 2 years and it was really worth it. the graphics are amazing, the game is amazingly optimized for amd and nvidia gpus after the update. my favorite game, love it!",36.4

"rockstar what the hell? why are there issues with the pc launch of this awesome game? delay after delay............................. now this is inexcusesable on your guys part. fun game but a couple game breaking gliches. wow just wow. f u guys really just f u. this is my last rockstar game i ever purchase. so much for rockstar does not release a bad game. im not bashing the game, the root of the issue is the developer. for anyone out there who wants to get the game, it is badass but be prepared to deal with a couple of really infuriating bugs and a broken laucher. rockstar the more you fight piracy the more of your customers are going to be affected by this dmr crap. the folks who pay get the big ugly stick in the behind with no lube and while the pirates laugh when they get it off the  for free. fix it mofos. good game bad developer i need a beer.",9.2
"game crashed repedidly and takes all $$ on crashes. and half the game time is spent in the horifically huge load screens> stay away from this ty game.",59.2
"the pc version is the way this game should be palyed.",53.0
"this game is so amazing it was worth the wait. the graphics are amazing im running 60fps at 1920x1080p on a gtx 970 (yes the one with the vram issue but non the less its still a great card if youre looking to buy it) and on high settings. the game is 61gb total to download, its a long wait but trust me its worth it. out of all i would rate this game a 11/10 just that amazing!",27.3
"going to start with negatives: - no more street food vendors. wtf r*? - cars either refuse to react because you are slow or overreact if are going fast. - killed a streetwalker and medics didnt show up - after watchdogs and being able to creep on streetwalkers, gtav streetwalkers are kinda dull and lifeless. wish they had more ai to them. - car handling and damage model is . pros: - the world itself is well done and decently sized. - for a game with the open world scope it looks good. - seems well optimnised and runs great. - its gta. will update after i play some more.",31.5
"ive played gta 5 from the console release, to the next gen release. now finally and most importantly, i have begun to play the pc release. the differences were subtle from console to console but to go from that to the pc, those differences are now striking. with almost every graphical option any pc gamer would hope for and a framerate to boot, what is old is new again. whether you are a new comer or an old one, this installment of 5 will no doubt impress.",73.0
"this game has the worst graphical settings of any game i have ever played. if i run this game with every setting on minimum, the game lags, has texture pop in 5 feet infront of me (if the textures pop in at all) and looks god awful. if i set all settings to max, then the game lags, has texture pop in five feet infront of me, and looks *slightly* better. the driving controls are beyond obscure, and i actually went back to to an xbox one controller and performed better than anyone else in my match. plainly, this game is horribly optimized beyond anyhting i have ever witnessed.",59.8
"superb game in history of gta best game ever for open world <3",7.0
"definitely a good game but we all know that. i havent tried the multiplayer yet because i want to finish the singleplayer first (first time playing gta v). pc version is a very good port with good optimization and good graphics at the same time. careful of the advanced graphics options those are very demanding. with those turned off, msaa x2 and everything else on maximum settings on a gigabyte gtx 970 mini im getting 55-60 fps. i had a minor scare during install because it got stuck on 99% for a while saying busy writing to disc but that was because i had pre-loaded the game and it was decrypting so dont worry if you have the same thing it will eventually install (mine took 20-30 minutes)",55.2
"the worst part about this game is that i cannot play hoxton breakout.",30.0
"one of the best launches i have experienced. the game is very well optimized, and runs extremely well. once you get past the social club stuff, its incredible.",31.7

"no i dont recommend this game. i am quite certain i would, but the game refuses to launch. am i suprised a rockstar game doesnt work on launch? no. not even slightly. every time i launch the game it opens the game launcher, seemingly required in every new game, because clearly launching from steam doesnt distinguish it is a valid game. it goes through about ten seconds of attempting to activate my copy of the game, and then proceeds to fail. the great part is, not even the launcher works. every time i click the retry button, the launcher closes. then i have to reopen the game yet again, go through the samn damn process, and watch it fail again. i am seriously one step away from refunding this game and saying  you rockstar. i loved this game on console...too bad the pc version delayed 3 times doesnt work. edit: seriously how do i get this refunded. im not having this",0.5
"absolutely loving this game. the story mode up to yet has been brilliant. online play, especially the heists are fantastic fun. so much variety and things to do. no regrets on purchasing full price rather than waiting for a sale....this game is worth every penny. many people seem to be having issues running the game. apart from the occasional lag (max settings), i have not had one crash or suffered any of the problems reported by others.",38.7
"awesome game!!!! shame it took me 24 hours to install it.",24.5

"i first play grand theft auto 5 on playstation 3, then playstation 4 and now i get to play it on the best place ever! i can not wait to drive around and take lots of screenshot! as far as the story goes, i think it is okay. honestly i never beat the story mode on console but i will this time on pc. i spent majority of the time in <u> gta online </u>. i am hype!! get it!!! did i mention you can transfer your char. from console to pc?",16.0
"welcome to los santos, where your fellow players are hostile  that will either murder you or murder your chances of completing a heist. also, the multiplayer loading times are ing ridiculous, and the chance of getting your crew of 4 together to play is lower than winning the ing lottery. however, this game is ridiculously fun, and lets you go on a rampage and kill rednecks, and you cant beat that. 10/10",54.2
"my pc can run crysis on full video settings at 60fps solid. gta v, on the lowest settings, i barely get to 10fps. its pretty much unplayable. how badly optimised is this game?",18.4
"i played on ps3 and it was good there and is great on pc but i have a gtx 970 and i drop below 30 fps in some dense foliage areas",19.8
"err_gen_zlib_2 failed zlib call,please reboot or reinstall game fix it fast! i cant play online,whenever i start first race this error appears,and it as well crashes like this in single player,fix asap! now i cant even start game,it stucks at loading screen.",24.3
"it seems a bunch of people have issues with getting this game to run. regardless of this my review will not be negative and i will try to help people out in this way: if you are a bullguard user, you might have the problem that your launcher will not start at all! this is what i did to fix this: open up bullguard and go to the general settings under settings. there will be an option there called selfprotection (allow bullguard to protect itself from termination, (or something similar) turn this off and reboot your computer, chances are great your launcher will now start normally! :d now for my actual review: have not played the game much, but i love the gta franchise and even though this game has had its fair share of problems on the pc i am still not gonna be negative about the games. the game looks great and what i have seen from other people playing and what i have played myself the game is loads of fun!! go get it!",23.5
"went online, robbed a store with a guy. got in a car, evade police, went to a nice safe spot. told him welcome to los santos. shot him in the head. took his money, got rich. 10/10 would play again.",23.3
"after launch and when it was done unpacking it was difficult to get started, but once i got it working i couldnt stop thinking, holy **** this is great. i would recommend to anyone with a decent desktop, even my budget pc can run at a smooth 30-40 fps.",46.4
"just... just buy it, trust me. this is not just a port, this is more. the game is beautiful and the hype is not fake. you must know one thing - 2gb graphics card, is enough, now let me define enough: some features (graphical ones ofc) require a lot of graphics cards memory, and for beautiful game, without huge fps drops, crashing, etc. you will need more than 2gb :) every penny that you give in this game, if worth it!",71.6
"i really love this game. but it is crashing all the time and the stupid drm is not working consistantlyin china so much for the delays. fix this rockstar and i will recomend this game.",39.0
