"got it day one could not play, one week and several patches after i still cannot play. this is the first time this happen to me.",6.9
"easily the best version of grand theft auto that has ever been made yet! pc master race!!!",20.1
"absolutly steller launch. ultra settings with no lag at all. online servers all worked out perfectly. no bugs as of yet. better launch on pc than any big studio game in quite a while.",38.0
"everyone already knows its brilliant. and its very well optimised. just get it",39.9
"wont load launcher at all. now that i got the launcher to load through the website version after having to completely uninstall my firewall it keeps asking for activation key... even though i entered it into the website instead of the launcher... apparently a big mistake.. still cant play the game edit: i got the game to work finally not sure what did it, moving rockstars downloader files over to the steam one, editting the registry values to the latest version value, etc. still not going to give gta 5 a better rating because the game isnt remotely good (i already played singleplayer on console) because the online isnt that amazingly fun at all.",45.8
"i saved up a lot of money, bought a really nice car, went indoors for a few, came out, and then a guy blew up me and my uninsured car with a sticky bomb. so yeah, great game. 10/10",30.9
"this is one of the most fun games ive played in a while!",24.6
"very long loading times, lot of crahes - no so far.",34.9
"launcher crashes on startup; 26 hours of troubleshooting solves nothing. this really shouldve been solved in the 2 year delayed release. disappointed.",0.5
"i havent got into grand theft auto since san andreas. this one is far superior to all the others, more activities, a huge map and vast story. the characters are very interesting as well as humorous. my only complaint about the game was/is getting used to the aiming.",47.1
"simple. if you havent played gtav then you should.",65.0
"im sure the game is great and all but on my system it runs like crap. i have to knock down the graphic settings quite a bit and turn my resolution to 720p just to get a smooth frame rate (even then the game will crash every so often). some of my friends are having a hard time just getting the game to launch. so far im pretty disappointed. gtx 770 intel i5- 4670k 8gb of ram (im the ram might be the problem but 8gb was the recommended amount on system requirements so i dont know whats up...) and yes nvidia drivers are up to date. i really want this game to work well but im just having too many problems.",44.2
"thank you so much. launcher stop working has been resolved! and i can play this game without turning off nvidia first! thank you so much!",18.4
"what can i do?? the game is not openig. always loading - loading. i have win 8,1",15.9
"can i run this game on ; 4g ram ddr2 + amd phenom 965 + geforce gtx 630 ? yes you can! fps type of missions run smoothly however driving type of missions may choke a little but the game in general runs fine.",66.0
"great game just got a lot of lagg issues at the moment damn cpu but great game",9.7
"i dont know what the  rockstar doing ? amd card can not play still today ! please respect people who used amd, suck.",5.3
"knock knock nig ga! ah ni gga sup? why do you like gta v ni gga? cause your bit ch as ss in there nig ga",50.3
"flawless victory. i feel bad for the people who couldnt get it started. seems to be user error to me, i went off without a hitch. my only complaint is that the resolution settings are glitchy. it takes some playing around to get it to stick with full screen.",66.9
"i bought the pre road and so i finished intalling the game and now after i made a id on the rockstart socail club when ever i click start a game it keep saying is loading the game but nothing start ........................ is this only me or is there anyone out there have same problem like me ?",8.3
"warning! do not buy this game at the moment! wait for patches! not worth getting a ing broken piece of  right now. now that ive vented ill be more detailed. this game is amazing truly is. some of the best graphics i have seen since alien isolation. the damn thunderstorms in this game alone make me cream my pants. however im getting crashes every god damn 15-20 minutes of play time. i can not see how after multiple delays this game is still not release ready. i trust rockstar that they will fix these issues in a good amount of time. but once again this game proves that 1 you should never pre-order a damn game and 2 that the launch of games nowadays means at least 1 month of patching will most likely fix things. buy the game a month from now when its actually finished. it sucks a lot because i really want to play the story which is the main reason i bought the game i love the storylines in all of the gta games and this one seems like the best so far. ill just have to wait a bit longer than i hoped to enjoy this game. release rating: ing poor as . expectation rating: classic...when its fixed.",15.1
"its great cause my modest rig can run this at 1080p 60 fps, the game is very well optmized",48.5
"list of bugs / issues for me: - cant complete first online heist because the screen gets white and i cant do anything after the preparation, if i wait some minutes it crashes. - after alt+tab the game starts to lag for the whole session stupid design choices: - very long ways when you die - imported characters from the console have a huge advantage over you which is unfair. everyone should start from scratch.",70.6
"i saw a dog humping another dog. i switched to trevor and he immediately gets chased by police. i roadkill pedestrians and the bystanders dont mind at all. i pick up random strangers in very awkward situations. and online, i shot a random person in the head, stole his money and drove away. the game stutters when you play it for a certain amount of time and it still randomly crashes. i hope they fix these lingering issues. but if youre looking for an alternate american playground that reacts to you, then welcome to los santos!",65.7
"suspect is traveling at 50 mph.... in a.. blimp... 11/10",63.3
"i bought an xbox to play gta v before gta v pc came out....  my life game is superb would recommend! 69/10",56.7
"i had this on xbox 360, and have just been waiting for the past 2 or so years for it to arrive on pc, and it was worth the wait! the graphics surpass the ps4 and xbo easily. they even designed it for weakerish rigs to be able to run it decently. i have several hours on it so far and just love what they have been doing. gets a little getting used to once youve played with a controller for quite a time! 10/10 love the game.",40.5
"game wont even launch. gj rockstar. ::update:: finally got it to work. turns out i just had to set gtavlauncher.exe to run in compatibility mode for windows 8. im still going to give this game a negative review, at least until rockstar fixes most of the problems people are having. i dont recommend buying the game until then, unless you want to spend 10+ hours trying to get the game to start.",32.9
"err_gfx_d3d_nod3d1x_4 this error.... this error makes me want to take a stick... and shove it up a woodcutter! but in all seriousness, this error wont let me play. it states that i either dont have directx 11 or my gpu is not compatible witth directx 11. this is absolutely not true. i have directx 11 and i have played so many games with it. this also means my r7 260x gpu is capable of handeling dx11. i really dont know what to do and rockstar wont even really attempt to help. i called, left threads on their forums, and nada. dont buy it untill they pull themselves together.",34.9
"ive been with gta v since it came out on xbox 360, then moved to xbox one, and finally pc. i can say from be a console beta tester that it is an amazing game. rockstar has polished this game so much, that it makes people blind. obviously there is no contest when comparing console v pc, but it definetly performed very well on all platforms. biggest improvements: load times. consoles on average take 15-30 seconds to load any sort mode or map. frames. consoles get 30fps, i want 60+ and i got it! servers. rockstar really learned how to manage the servers this time around. cons: there are no cons. gta v is perfect game. 420/10 ign",13.1
"the game is the same from all consoles. but the 60fps is what you are looking for. still the mods will be great. i have a pretty good computer. but when im trying to get 60fps its pretty hard. - 780 gtx - i-7 processor - 12 gb ram im getting 60fps on the outside of the map but it dips down to 45fps in the city.",30.2
"cant say much till now....after 3 days me and some other milion peeps still cant play that  game :|",1.4
"the best just got a whole lot better. 10/10 #masterrace.",21.0
"what can i say great game. but do not run this game with 4gb of ram...its a memory eater.",68.4
"i gave my girlfriend the controller; the first thing she did was smoke and drink copiously, and pimp women -- shes a feminist. 11/10 fun for feminists too.",6.6
"im sure the game is awesome tho its up to 130gbs now..but due to auto lockin accounts n lack of rockstar support im now sitting here 28 hours later with the worlds stupidest support tech. litterally told me to log in and out of the account im locked out of.......",34.3
"finaly. i had been waiting for it for 4 years. since the first trailer came out. the,ing,best. p.s never played it on console, or watched any letsplays. p.s.s #hachiko",39.0
"gta vs attention to detail and closeness to reality is extremely dizzying, not to mention the awesome graphics. i always end up just driving around los santos for hours.",27.2
"its literally the best game ever made. the largest physics sandbox ever created, coupled with an incredible story, deep multiplayer component and film quality performances from the actors. i cannot think of a finer game and ive been playing them for over two decades. this is the best selling piece of entertainment for a reason. it raises the bar in every capacity. optimization is phenomenal as well. get this game, take your time with it, play it slowly and enjoy the most solid and varied game mechanics weve ever seen in a single package. 10/10. nothing will take this games crown for a long, long time.",37.0
"everything was fine up until the mission where molly crashes and get sucked up into the airplane. it crashes literally everytime im on this mission. i think maybe 6 or 7 times ive had to replay this dumb . what do i do",25.8
"i love this game, even played in bottleneck laptop. thank you rockstar :)",49.5
"already played the ps3 version. the pc version has a lot more potential and additional features. the graphics are phenomenal! cant wait to finish the story once again and see what the online mode brings :)",30.3
"great game must have, verry good work exsept some wired bug when u launche it",30.3
"rip my life -- this game is: 10% luck 20% skill 15% concentrated power of will 5% pleasure 50% pain and 100% reason to purchase the game.",63.1
"having played hundreds of hours of this game, the pc version is just that much better that it feels like a whole new game entirely. 10/10",17.4
"amazing game; once you get it running. i do wish it didnt use social-club. and i wish it didnt take so much trial and error to get it installed the rockstar hot-fix didnt work. but the graphics are absolutely amazing, and this is one ofthe best ports i have seen so far, despite one or two fall through the world type things. what i did to fix the downloads is just disable short-cuts and windows start menu short-cuts and then you should be good, the thing is you just have to open it through steam.",35.2
"no no... its fine. i have wated years to join in the gta series. but after years and years. i cant ing launch the game. thats fine rockstar.",22.3
"thousands of accounts have been stolen due to improper security on rockstars end, mine included. until its fixed, theres no guarantee you wont lose a 60.00usd investment. their support is horribly slow in responding to it. if rockstar remedies the situation, ill be happy to change this review, but their response to such an event is just not sufficient. source:",11.0
"i have nothing to say about this perfect game. well optimized, great environment atmosphere. this game runs perfectly well on my gtx 880m. i dont really encounter launch issue so i dont know why thats even possible, and whats causing it. p.s.: dont be fooled by the review (by the time of the writing, its mostly positive [79%]). grab it when you have money, you wont regret it by paying the game for full price. if you encounter any issue, you can always ask the support guys whos much better than ea.",39.4
"yes. i played this on the xbox 360 on the day it came out. there was no online, so i played the single player, then i realised that the rendering of the game was just awful! then online came out, i tryed it, it didint work at all, when it did it was fun. i would give it a 8/10, but on pc it fixes everything. the online perfect, the singleplayer perfect, the rendering perfect. so in short note 0/10 ign - too much water",34.4
"a lot of bug herecant connect with windows live when i sign in, cant play online offlane bothcostumor service so bad",12.8
"the definitive gta:v experience which, for me, was the ultimate multi-player game of the last generation. granted, its been a bit of a wait for the pc crowd, and the online facet of the game is not without its glitches (abominable lag despite having a +100 mbps connection, jumping into a car and not being able to drive for some reason, weird vehicle damage modelling loops, just-killed enemies coming back to life due to disparity between local and server-side assets, etc.), but when you compare it to similar games in the genre, i still think its way ahead of the competition. yes, the delays should have meant a more stable launch, and i agree that the whole windows username thing, whilst not affecting me personally, is a pretty big oversight, but a quick patch or two later and it should all be rectified. then again, im one of the jerks whos been playing it on xb360 and ps4 for the last year and a half, so im probably a whole lot more forgiving than the average pc user. either way, its a 09/10 from me - now we just gotta wait for a pc remake/sequel to red dead redemption.",19.5
"if you can not log into the social club account that is linked to steam you can not activate this game. rockstar support wont help you. if you have this issue and buy this game, you wont be able to play.",0.3
"downloaded 70gb of game decrypted game unpacked game launched game game crashed twice because of low memory problems goes and buys another 8 gb of ram cant because canada computers closes at 7:30 pm buys tomorrow installs ram launches game graphics driver crashes launches again ??? profit! 11/10 would run out of ram again",6.5
"rockstar can suck my , absolutely no support for those who cannot play the game because of their  perma link to steam accounts... so if you bought the game on a different account not activated to steam rockstar will take outs its big willy and shuv it down your throat and make you wait 1 month to answer a ticket that will probably not help. because giving the power of unlinking your steam account to the customer is too much to handle and would give them a god complex.  you, ruined my day/week.",35.1
"from the minute i started playing i have not been disappointed. this game, as far as my experience goes, has been full of nothing but elation. this game is nothing but amazing right now. i have experienced no issues so far (do note, i only played up to the first reposession mission and no side questing, your experience may vary) and framerates have been very smooth. the graphics, or should i say the game, is amazing for what i have in terms of hardware (gtx 770 2gb, i7 3770k, 16gb ram) and i recommend it wholeheartedly at this point and time.",60.5
"first of all, let me start off by saying they never should have released a game as broken as this. i cant run it for 20 minutes without blue screening, but that doesnt change my opinion of this game. it is still one of the greatest games in the franchise, and of all time in my opinion. (vice city will always beat out the others for me). for the small time i could play it, the controls were incredibly fine tuned and responsive, and the controller support is phenomenal. the game is very well optimized, especially if you have the newly released amd/nvidia drivers. the level of detail is wonderful to have, and was nice to see coming from the ps3 version. even though its currently a broken piece of , i will still reccomend it.",13.2
"great game, the campaign is typical gta style if you are firmiliar with the other titles published in the genre, steal some drugs, do some heists yada yada... the online is where it picks up speed pretty heavily with many interactive missions, tasks, and even things such as golfing and tennis against other players! many hours of fun are easily capable of being put into this game!",31.0
"rockstar came into my room and touched my no no square. 10/10 would get molested by rockstar again. p.s. thanks for taking forever to remake a game and stealing our money.",32.8
"excellent game. i originally thought that the pc version is going to have some graphical issues but in the 2-3 hous ive played it so far i can say that it completely eclipses gta iv in every way.",55.8
"i wish they had included the option to sync my saves through steam to other computers.",53.5
"in america apparently the game doesnt work in europe everything works (except the singleplayer that sometimes crashes)",36.5
"10/10 best crashing and losing connection simulator",72.9
"great game, spent 2 days downloading and redownloading from bugs then when theres no bugs it doesnt load. 10/10",16.1
"thankfully, i was able to resolve the problem of being blocked. if any of you face the problem, reset your password on the social club website, and log into gta v. anyway, this game is a creative triumph. highly reccomended, and would download and unpack again... xd. finally, after 1 and a half years, my review is complete(also 3 delays). 11/10",22.7
"hands down, the best game ever created. 11/10 welldone rockstar.",54.9
"one of the best games of the decade. really fun with a great port. amazing story and singleplayer mode with a multiplayer mode that is not as good as single player but still really fun and has a lot of depth and things to do. great port but a lot of people have problems with it. (there are solutions for most of them). r* really did a great job with the port and i was really scared this game wouldnt run on my crap pc. glad it does! worth a purchase at full price.",28.9
"hey rockstar, thank you for all the hard work. im actually having fun playing a pc game again. woooo! seriously tho, great game, runs smooth. only had a couple of crashes, otherwise great.",24.4
"id never experienced such slow downloading speeds since everybody was downloading ios 8.... (and im on a 100mb connection). guess servers got pretty busy. game is awesome, i played the x360 version and have seen the ps4 from a friend, this certainly deserves a bow. looks stunning (playing it at very high settings). 60fps its a thrill. worth the wait!",40.3
"where is my pre order money ? :( i have the code but its already used and i dont get the pre-order money in game? i bought gta v yesterday 14th",46.7
"wow, trevors hands are the most disgusting thing to look at while driving in first-person. 10/10.",26.3
"what is with it always entering windowed mode and going to the lowest resolution.....",28.9
"oh boy,gta v on the pc the textures,the fps everything so perfect but the best thing about this game is that its actually fun driving around los santos mountains with your friends on an pick up truck driving around the city while your friends shoot out of the windows killing some noobs flying a plane across the map with your crew and jumping out to skydive robbing a bank to get some money to spend on hookers the list goes on and on baby",41.1
"no. i meet all of the requirements for this game, and when i try to play it takes forever to load, it lags extremely at the absolute lowest settings, giving me about 2-5 fps, and when you try to drive it just lags. my friend gets the same problems. you could also look at other reviews if you dont believe me. i wouldnt recommend getting this game until rockstar makes it more playable.",3.8
"im sure the game is fun, but besides the blatant oversight on not allowing windows usernames with non-alphanumeric characters (how is that a thing you can screw up?!) they also blatantly lie about system requirements. i am above the minimum requirements, have no hardware problems at all, and i can not play gta online. it straight up hitches/freezes constantly. i get 60 fps all the time, except for the freezes, too. its extremely obnoxious and beyond what i would consider unplayable. im sure its a good game, but being unable to play it, i couldnt possibly recommend this game. disgusting. when i reached out to rockstar support, i recieved no response. a week has passed with no reply, and i know i am not the only person experiencing this issue. if they cant deliver what they promise, i do not believe this is a game company worth supporting.",12.5
"it doesnt even start up ... i got all the drivers up to date and it doesnt want to work , i have a geforce gtx 760 m i7 intel",63.2
"thats it this is the best game ever cue the song and dance -jontron",29.5
"i cant seen to get my social club account to log in i have the correct user name and password",16.0
"people say the online part of the game is boring considering the story mode. let me say you this, after completing the prologue, i thought i wanted to check the online mode a bit and maybe create a charater just for fun. now i cant leave online mode! its great. even the worse part of the game is incredibly fun and addictive. man, this is going to be a long ride... regarding to the performance; i know that the game kind of buggy on some systems but i have faith in rockstar that they will fix it eventually (maybe not in a fast way, though). its running on my system beautifully. even i dont have a high-end rig and playing with ok graphic settings, its a nice game to look at. i can probably continue this for pages so im just gonna leave it like this...you get the idea anyways...",53.7
"worth every cent of those cs skins ive sold for it! :)) i really really love this game, basically you can do anything, even going to the  ladys  :)) like in real life, you just need money! online is awesome also! i can play counter strike if i want ... or i can race and feel like playing nfs ! :) what else do you want from a game ? + a cool story line .... definetly would buy it again and again! 100/10 :d thanks rockstar! best game this year :)",36.0
"now with most the bugs fixed, this game is superb. the game drops down to 20 fps time to time but other than that, the performance is great.",57.0
"excellent graphics, attention to small details, awesome gameplay, all running optimized as smooth as butter! was worried about gta 4 killing off this great series, but gta v is here now to seriously revive it. still needs a rockstar social account to signup and play, but apart from that slight setup annoyance, well worth it.",4.3
"i am having a good time with this game. i think its much better optimized for pc than gta iv. i am having some framedrops but i am damn happy to be in los santos. my hardware is a gtx 570 ,a phenom ii x4 965 be 3,4ghz and 8gb ram. its not the newest but still manage to get between 30-60fps at middle/high options. the story is nice, loads of sideactivitys, a lot of stuff to do and i am looking forward to gta online. but first i will play the story ofc. what i also like is that there is actually a graphic difference between the console versions and the pc. if you have a good pc you can make gta v really damn beautiful. will update the review soon... death to all pirates!",77.0
"if youre reading this youre already going to buy the game, so just do it :d",23.3
"fantastic port. also i think the fact that the online servers were working perfectly on day one is also a phenomenal job on rockstars part. anything else you need to know about the game, you can read anywhere else. all i know is that youll be playing the definitive version of this game if you play it on here.",25.8
"i love thus game but i can not figure out why windows keeps turning the app/task down.",23.3
"absolutely fantastic. runs like a dream, and is gorgeous.",77.3
"it was well worth the wait! smooth and well optimized, graphics are gorgeous and im finally able to go mental in 60+ fps. 11/10 would download 60 gb again",12.2
"a cop killed my black character without any reason. its so realistic!!! 11/10 would buy again",11.6
"this game is amazing! i would recomend it to anyone!!",26.4
"its fun playing with mates, tho the loading is too long.",73.8
"1010 gonna kill the  after using them in car again.",26.9
"so far game keeps crashing, cant even get to the main menu.",12.0
"10/10 awsome game.. i got myself in the wrong neighborhood and got shot by dozen of gang members -_-",37.8
"what can i say? ive bought been tricked into buying this game 3 times now, by rockstar. yet i find it just as enjoyable, again and again. want a good story with interesting characters and a bit of above-average humour? gta v is your game! want to just mess around and blow  up? gta v is your game! want fun online wiht lots of customization and fun gameplay? gta v is your game! then again... im a sucker that bought this game on three different occasions for three different platforms, so you probably shouldnt trust me and my views on this game...",21.5
"excellent! i have this on ps3 as well, but couldnt resist getting the game on pc! and the pc version is much better!",13.5
"after having alot of time in multiplayer im updating this review. what i can say is this. right from the start you see this game is very optimized!! runs like a damn dream and looks amazing. i run the game on all high and very high with advanced settings on and fxaa no smaa at 1080p with 60-70+ fps. runs very smooth. the single player i havent played much of but from what i did play it runs as good there. but the maltiplayer is where i have been addicted! heist is just awesome and a challenge for you and your friends. having to plan out youre attacks. survival mod where you fight waves of enemies is like any other game. its fun though and a good challenge also. heist is just awesome and a challendge for you and your friends. having to plan out youre attacks. survival mod where you fight waves of enemies is like any other game. its fun though and a good challendge also. pvp is pretty fun especially in first person only matches. i can finally kick s in the face in first person! 10/10",39.4
"not even lowest settings are as bad as xbox 360 lol",55.5
"great optimizision very additctive with execellent soundtrack!",23.3
"not good.. cant play.. activation code already used after paying for this game.. unhappy.",0.2
"10/10 would get account locked due to failed sign in attempts again (it lasts for 24 hours by the way)",67.2
"runs very good on gtx 660 / fx 6300 at high / very high settings never had problem with starting the game / activating it on rockstar social club, dunno why some people seem to have problems... anyway i r8 8/8 m8. see you in gta 8",51.4
"3 delays later the games comes out ruins my csgo inventory 10/10",50.5
"worth the wait! online works good, graphics are amazing, & fps keyboard + mouse flow is amazing! pc release really nailed it so far, been playing for 12 hours straight since launch! looking forward to making lots of great content with gta v and its editor! 420/10",33.2
"wow! runs amazing maxed out on my i5 4960k and g1 gaming 970!!!! theyve done a really good job with it!",22.8
"rockstar shows one more time how to build a masterpiece. gta v is not perfect but has everything youll ever dream in a sandbox game. san andreas is gorgeous and full of life, trevor, michael and franklin are a trio full of charisma and the game simply raises the bar in so many aspects. its worth your money, its worth your time.",37.0
"seeing i already clocked 50 hours on it i have the right to say that this game is the best gta ever!!!! i feel sad for console people!",86.8
"when i load the game, it all loads fine until the launch pannel comes up. right before the game opens the launcher crashes. the game is unplayable",10.4
"im not one for singleplayer games, so i cant tell you crap about the campaign. however, online is awesome!! it seems that some things coulda been cheaper...buyt its still good. there are the occaisional idiots and morons who make the experience unplayable at worst. for the most part ive only run into three people who just are morons who seek attention cause their parents didnt love them enough or maybe they really are mental. (o.o) get it if you like online games as well as singleplayer..but be warned again...i havent played campaign so look elsewhere for the singleplayer reviews. sorry! hope this helps!",22.0
"got online. only one other person online. bought a plane. crashed it twice. 10/10",28.6
"activation problem... social account problems ... im still waiting for play gta v.",3.9

"first gameplay expirence: i got in my car and drove to my helicopter, then over a little while i picked two guys up. i took the heli to the stip club and got out for the atm. i come back outside and my helicopter has been stolen by one guy, the other shoots me. 11/10 great community",13.0
"nice work rockstar and take my money . 10/10 should buy this game !",43.1

"amazing port. i really enjoy playing. i sold my xbox a long time ago and regreated the fact that i did just because i lost gta. then it finally came to steam. i have already played 12 hours in two days. 10/10!",54.7
"this would be great, i only i could launch the ing game.",1.7
"beautiful graphics, great optimization. havent stopped having fun. worth the money.",54.6
"worst online gaming experince i have ever had, does not work, its slow the loading screens are un godly and the player base are full of trolls and s, the single player i got stuck as franklin not able to do anything, and that was my breaking point. gta5 is a waste of money do not buy it, stick to your other games",92.9

"i am a biggest fan of grand theft auto and i been waiting for this game on pc since last years but i as a pc gamer i hate rockstar delaying to much for this game, in my mind i thought okay if i wait rockstar will make perfect grand theft auto 5 for pc without bugs, glitch and rockstar will optimize the game perfectly but i was wrong when i play it there is alot of bugs, glitch, missing image, poorly optimization, there line on the character face, the game crashes while trying to launch and forever to load please rockstar please do something about this issues fix it i hope you patch it.",41.8
"what should i say about this game its gta its an awesome game 1 of the best games ive ever played like it really much and the graphics on pc are wow really impessive ^^ 10/10 !!!",67.9

"thanks to rockstar!! really recommended. - good story - good online gameplay",51.3
"complete disappointment. cant even start the game to begin with. crashes like everyone else complaining in the forums. im running on amd gpu. but due to the nature of the ing manufacturer, it needs slightly custom drivers. only official ones that could run stably was 14.4. gta v requires you to have 15.4beta, and installing that causes the whole system to blackscreen forever. no games has need me to do this thus far, not even newer ones. really really disappointed with rockstar.",0.2
"most people got their game running, and a few dont, its maybe on their side not the game, first time i installed it on launch day its smooth and running, maxxed everything out and i am happy with the result! from 90-120 fps on high and 60-80 fps on ultra/very high, over all i am happy with the game, been playing it since it launched on the 360, money well spent! recommended to all of gamers out there (not for kids tho)",80.8
"awesome game!! the graphics are just beautiful runs very good and all the things added to this game are very good : heists and rockstar editor and wildlife and more. the game was awesome and there were many things to say on him in his first release and all of that good things in the game wich makes hin gta are already said in consoles reviews. in general 9/10 because there is some fps drops but i am sure it will be fixed and so many time of waiting and disconnecting from online but it am sure it will be fix either.",62.6
"one of the best launches i have experienced. the game is very well optimized, and runs extremely well. once you get past the social club stuff, its incredible.",31.7
"game wont even run, going to get a refund and buy it on xbox one. if they could atleast put out some info on when we could expect a patch or something but absolutely left in the dark which makes it seem as if they arent even working on anything otherwise they would mention it somewhere. save your money until you are 100% sure itll work.",2.7
"this game is fun, but holy ing ! can you fire the dumb  who thought of the whole hacking mini game.",71.3
"this game to gta iv is what gta:sa was to gtaiii. theres a huge amount of stuff to do both online and in single player. it becomes crystal clear that rockstar werent just sitting on the game throughout the multiple delays - they were constantly polishing it.",44.3
"its like a better version of gta iii and that one was really fun.",70.5
"the only two things that i do not like are the online waiting times and the steering when using a keyboard which is too sensitive. this game is better with a controller, but again i play on pc for the keyboard, not the graphics.",33.3
"has some optimization issues, and problems with the refresh rate, but overall good port. if you are experiencing frame rates and hitches, and are using a nvidia card. downgrade to the previous driver, and it should work much better.",60.4
"the game is not even working for me. the almost-3-hours-of-gameplay-on-record are just trying to launch the game. still waiting for a fix. until then, im downvoting. --edit:-- rockstar fixed the problem in the recent patch (17/4/15). singleplayer: pros: -its gta damnit. cons: -you wont play it because you have gta online. multiplayer: pros: -its like gta iv online, but much better. cons: -a few annoying bugs, for example: unable to drive when entering a car, camera does not follow the player. -long loading time. tldr: best game 11/10 would throw my money at rockstar again.",37.9
"this really is the best version of gta v! well worth the wait :)",10.3
"fairly gpu demanding but if you can run it, it looks ridiculously good. plays smoothly and everything feels good. only downside ive seen is that every time i load the game it goes back into window mode. other than that gg rockstar.",45.0
"first day had a few hickups as you would expect. but really came together and is rockin. love this game",39.3
"before i played it i thought it was terrible then i tried and the addiction started. the game is fun but the campaign needs a list so you know which mission to do first because i messed up doing it the wrong way.",61.1
"10/10 great port (or at least seams to be so far) wouldnt revise again.",40.4
"good game but i just lost my adder!!! on gta 5 online. dont steal a car and park it in your garage if you have a car allready out and about it will delete your car. since i am pissed the  off about this issue i will be down voting untill this is fixed",59.2
"ok i spent 40 to pre order this game thats fine the date is delayed again, bit annoyed but ok ok 14th of april release cant because of 60gb download 16th of april downloaded ok lets play nothing happens reinstalling 21th of april reinstalled nothing happens rockstars support crew is non existent and steam cant be bothered to help i think 40 is expensive for something i cant even play",0.9
"ive never played grand theft auto v in ps3, xbox360 nor ps4, xbox1, and its my first time playing grand theft auto v! i had a lot of fun with it and i think it is really optimized because the graphics is amazing and it still runs good enough.",62.8
"rockstar promised to give us a smooth launch. they took two years to make the pc version, and hell, they even delayed the game three or four f****ing times on top of that. my high end gaming pc handles mostly everything in max setting so i was expecting nothing less with this game. instead ive had fps drop from 60-40~ and sometimes from there to 20~. i cant stand this stuttering and those fps drops, so im a bit disappointed with how this turned out. i suppose im lucky i even got to launch the game at all, since people seem to be having issues with that. in this current state i cannot recommend this game. p.s i will update my review once rockstar releases another patch.",47.6
"took 3 years to unpack... worth every missed birthday 11/10",59.4

"crashes to desktop or freezes up when playing. currentlly unplayable on a upper mid range/high end pc for me.",9.2
"ive played the console versions of this game and it is fair to say that this is worth the wait. gameplay was great in both 3rd and 1st person mode (dont recommend first person if you have motion sickness), the cars didnt feel slippery, the campaign feels like sort of episodic (if i spelt that right) and the graphics were impressive. especially on the last gen versions of the game. 10/10 ps. be prepared to run into high level pr*cks going on a rampage in their tank on the online portion of the game",7.8
"fun game! i own on all systems. online doesnt seem to work though and their are already problems that have been found",12.1
"its  as of april 15, 2015. gtao wont let me join my friends through steam, and is very laggy. sometimes alt+tabbing in to the game will give you a black screen that cant be fixed through cntrl+alt+dlt or multiple restarts. update: well a bunch of  decided that the because the game works for *them* it works for evreyone. if youve just stumbled upon this review, its being downvoted because i actually pointed out flaws the game has, and some  got butthurt.",35.4
"due to consistent crashes, issues that break the game, horrid rockstar support, and the fact that your entire garage and character can just disappear and rockstar wont say a thing, i would highly reccommend not buying this game until they publically fix these issues.",64.1
"until they fix the ongoing problem of still a large amount of players that cant even get past the social club this gets a thumbs down. as expected gtav was released to pc with a boat load of bugs just how it was released on ps3 and 360 for the first time. social club support is as horrid as steam support because no one answers your question. i really want to play this damn game but now i have to waittill they fix this game.",7.9
"it does not work. i bought this game in january with a promise of a march release. lie #1 i was told that it would be delayed until today to make certain that the game is perfected. lie #2. i called rockstars customer service well within their hours of 7:00 am est and midnight est and got a recorded message stating that they are closed, and listed the hours. lie #3. how do i get a refund?",0.8
"everyone was excited for this game on pc. its better than those console peasant versions. this version is ................ amazing. amazing doesnt even describe it enough. pros: - enjoyable gameplay, many things to do online as well as in single player. - online is really well done, except for the disconnect bug still around. gang attacks, jobs everywhere, robbing stores, blowing vehicles up like a boss. - team play is very beneficial, allows you to fight stronger, play quicker, and enjoy the game even more. also encouraged really well. - graphics are amazing, fantastic quality all over the game. cons: - desync bug online, shows everyone leaving the game all at once. really really irritating. - needs an above average computer to run. - you can get banned for blowing peoples vehicles up to often, and yet there is passive mode that makes it so you cant be killed by players. not to mention there are vehicles almost impossible to kill people in, how are you suppose to defend yourself?",80.3
"i was so excited for this, like the hype was unreal, and it is good certainly, but unfortunately the game has so many issues right now that it severely hinders the experience. i have way over the suggested settings, and the game is supposedly perfectly optimized for my specs, but the game runs very very poorly, with unbearable lag spikes that make the game almost unplayable. it is ridiculous it took them this long and still both i and my friend with high end pcs can barely run it. rockstar, get it together, you more or less fixed the console versions and you better fix this.",27.1

"i already own this on two consoles (ps3/ps4) and now the pc version looking as well. i am looking forward to modding the crap out of it. its a great game and i think people get turned off the online too easily. long load times, the occasional lag, and spotty server connection dont always help the argument either. it is easy to get frustrated especially early on when it looks like there are only a few activities and youre getting constantly stomped by people with better toys in the open world. dont give up, steal cars and rob mini-marts. buy guns or cars to do missions or race, then property. dont get lured away from the goal by the icing (clothing, haircuts, tattoos, custom paint and neon kits on starter cars). id rather be the worst dressed guy killing your faces any day. as you level up more and more activities will unlock and if you put in the time and find a good crew (you might as well it gives more point to run with a crew anyways) this game is beyond fun.",2.8

"dont waste your money (yet). dont get me wrong... im glad you finally released the game after ensuring there wont be any bugs.... but i cant even get passed the social club screen. you would think that is something you would get fixed before releasing. ive tried the fixes supplied online and still nothing. ill edit this review when i can (at the very least) load into the game.",6.3

"the game is great and lots of fun! however, you all should know that it freezes and crashes in online multiplayer alot. expect to look and feel like a total scrub because you will crash at the worst possible time when doing heists with a group and let everyone down, and then itll rinse and repeat and everyone will hate you and unfriend you because of it. so much fun and so much to do, but eventually youll get enraged because of all the crashes. good luck, have fun ;)",53.8
"this is truly the best version of the game. no crashes, no bugs, no nothing that is bad (at least for me). and that improved foliage system? its by far one of the greatest ive ever seen in a game. although, i still havent figured out how to aim down the sights/use the scope...",46.6
"at least it runs well on my pc. game itself is good. looks a lot better than it does on my nephews ps4. unlike the gta4, at least this one is not horribly optimized. this review would have been a positive had not a certain petty even occured. the moderators of this game are trolls. they ruined my perfect steam account with several bans. i was locked out of steam for a few days pending ban. i wrote a petty post stating too bad p!r*t3s are enjoying the game while we are just stuck with a preload. that comment resulted in ban. then i got in more trouble for contesting it resulting in a temporary lock out of my steam account. forget about steam support. they dont answer calls, and the ticket is a week old. maybe i should not have wrote it, but i dont think it was worthy of a ban of any sort. bottom line dont even say the word p!r*t3 or any other related word in any way. not even in the old definition before we had internet. you could say a racial slur, and nothing will happen to you, you say p*r*cy and bann. seriously though is steam becoming as evil as ea? ps. they keep deleting this review. so my truth must be getting to them. i keep rewording more carefully.",16.9

"once you go fps , there is no turning back. i had this for my ps3 , i will sell it so i have this here now. the games is still incredible but after rockstars new stuff , its a total killer. would buy it 10 more times in 10 different times.",9.5

"gta v is finally on the pc and many people are loving it. and so am i, if you bearly meet the requirements for this game, its going to lag at some points of the game, esspically in first person mode, if your driving super high speed, most likely your going to hit a texture popped tree that you didnt see 10 feet away until the last second. this reminds me of the good ol days in gta iv. now i dont need to say much on how great this game is because everyone already knows. the only problem i have with it is the fact i cant connect to online mode for some reason, could be a day one glitch or the servers coughing a lung, but hopefully they have it fixed soon, after all, its the main reason why i got gta v",33.3

(running on a gtx970) if youve been waiting for the pc release its definitely worth it. if you played it for the console, graphics will be night and day :). graphics: 9/10 compatibility: 9/10 multiplayer: 9/10 editor: 10/10 (make your own movies!) chop: 10/10 (chop does what chop does best :) ) other notes: you can max out most of settings then lower down the shadows and still maintain about 60-70fps which is pretty good :)",14.8

"as far as nicknaming the game grand theft auto v pc: loading screen edition this game has some beautiful graphics when running with a gtx 970 4gb card. there are a few bugs here and there but thats expected like one of them mention previously, loading screen. sometimes it gets stuck or takes forever to go away. other than that the game is awesome and is worth the $60 i paid for.",70.6

"the following is a personal preference read the following with a open mine or f*ck off i have played all versions of the game and the changes between xbox 360/ps3 graphics and xbox one/ps4 are massive to be honest it is a waste of money if you own a console copy. the graphical changes between current gen console gta and pc is next to nothing on top of that they have promised many additions on all platforms but it is still not here they promise additions many additions and hold back as proof of this look at the heist dlc it was delayed for a bit over 1 year even the pc version has taken blows like this it was meant to be released in late 2014 here we are in 2015 and it was still getting delayed unless rockstar lifts their game i think this game is in some ways the worst gta to be released if i had to rate it i must say as much as i am level headed between pc and console id say console is like a 8.5/10 and pc in its current state is like 3.5/10 my opinion may change with rockstars progress but i am unsure if this is going to change my opinion",13.8

"a rare, but fantastic, port from rockstar. the development team have clearly learned that the pc community wont be satisfied with copypasta garbage (*cough* gta iv *cough) and, as a result, have come out with a highly optimised game that can truly be considered the difinitive version. hopefully soon, those guys on gtaforums or whoever will be able to crack and modify the game folders they can, currently, only see through openiv. the modding potential for this game is enormous... its just a shame that rockstar didnt embrace this idea as openly as, say, bethesda with skyrim and the like. if you can run it (and you porbably can), buy it. this is one of the best open world games ever created and youd be doing youself a disservice not to have it on your hard drive.",24.2
"from what i experienced in the short time i was actually able to get this game to run(probably around a half hour total), i would rate this game 9/10. unfortunately this launch was a huge disappointment as 95% of the time the game refuses to even run, and the few times it did, crashes resulted randomly or even as a result of clicking on a different window and then clicking back on the game screen. i have opened a ticket with rockstar support and tried all of the fixes they and other people have recommended but nothing has worked. funny how they delayed the release again and again to ensure that the game is as polished as possible, and to make certain that both heists and the gta online experience are ready to roll out on day one for pc. well guess what rockstar? the game doesnt even run for a lot of us. im sure eventually this problem will be fixed on your end and then ill be able to forgive you but until then, i just want to warn anyone whos thinking about spending their hard earned money on this game that there is a significant chance the game wont even run, and so i would recommend waiting until rockstar has fixed this issue.",1.8
"ah, the legend returns to the mastah race! but more seriously, this game has finally arrived on pc with its fenomenal graphics (some dull textures here and there though) and stunning visuals with 4k support in all its glory! what i love: just about everything what could be better: mouse movement feels like it has a delay the gpu usage could have been better as i see some fps drop even if the gpu usage is at 70-80 ish. there is also a frequent happening of cars popping up from the ground, wheels on idle cars stuck half way in the ground.",57.6
"no more delays or any stupid bs, just endless hours of picking up hookers and playing golf. gta v is filled with things to do that will keep you entertained for well over 1000+ hours and is without a doubt worth the 39.99. as long as you like open world, multi and single player, first/third person shooter games that involves driving, flying and shooting then this is the game for you!",30.5

"ive never banked more hours in a video game ever. prior to the pc release, i had invested in both the 360 and xbox one versions and have well over 1,200 hours spread across both platforms. the only negative thus far in this release has been how hard it pushes some pcs. however, this should get fixed, and dont let those negative reviews sway you!",9.0

"first of all, the pc port was well worth the wait. the developers thought of everything; from showing how much vram is in use, to including a whole separate game mode (rockstar editor). performance is great and the graphics are stunning. overall, its just a fantastic pc port. ive been holding off gtav on the consoles because i wanted to experience this game completely fresh on the best possible platform and holy moly am i glad i did. after about 6 hours, its abundantly clear how marvelous this game is and i get to experience it at its maximum quality for the first time, w/o any spoilers or nothing. the gameplay is solid, the aesthetics are beautiful, and man, the story is phenomenal. i mean, im no real world gangster/etc kind of guy. hell, i really dislike the theme entirely and tend to avoid other games or media of the sort, but the writing in this game is just so top notch, so well thought-out, i found myself being invested in the characters and their stories. (havent touched the online yet so cant comment on that) ive barely scratched the surface of this game, but i believe ive played enough to highly recommend this game.",43.3
"hi gamers, i heard that some people have problems launching the game on windows laptops, here is the workaround i used. 1) - open device manager by clicking on the start button and typing in device manager and pushing the enter button. 2) - find the tab display adapters and then right-click on your main graphics card (for me nvidia geforce gt 555m) and click disable. 3) - start the game and wait for social club to showup and wait like 5 secs 4) - repeat step 2 but instead of clicking disable now click enable 5) - the game should now start after social club is done doing its thing. hope you have a great time playing gtav!",15.6

"moving on from the console versions of gta v, even after months of delaying and waiting, this game proves to still amaze all gamers. obviously, the graphics is the biggest upgrade, but the delation for the release of the game turned out well for its great optimization to the pc port. its amazing how relatable gameplay is with consoles just by using a controller. feels like theres no difference except (better) performance, graphics, and details in the game (like its music). i already owned a 360, ps4, and xbox one version of gta v, but it was well worth $60 to buy the pc version. you get what you paid for, and even more. this pc port is what every game developer should aim for. how optimized it is at launch compared to other games that releases a dead-bugged game that makes it almost impossible to play. its safe to say that all gta players will be missing out on a new experience if they dont purchase this game. 10/10",32.7
"well... its not even a question. buy it. the only reason you wouldnt have that game, is because of your low  specs!",60.1
"excellence in one 60 gig package. runs at way more than 60fps, i know this because im having screen tearing issues. so to fix that, i turned on vsync. its gpu v-ram hungry so be sure to have a 4gb gpu if you want to run on max settings. i run high-very high mainly and my cpu is the amd fx-8350. my gpu is geforce gtx 760 2gb. it only eats up 1500megs of my v-ram with my settings. buy the hell out of this game! it really is excellent!",37.3
"the game plays very well on my 3200 x 1800 monitor at high settings. no issues with the launch.",21.2
"you roman! i never want to see you again!!! gta 5 is 5 times better. rockstar have done a great job optimising this. it even runs better than gta 4! however, there is a glitch meaning you can only play once. until they patch it, this game gets an average recomendation. afterwards, this game gets a complete recomendation! and you never have to go bowling with roman again.",47.3
"best optimized game ever! my specs gtx 670m with i7 3610qm and i got my 1080p 60fps experiance. well done rockstar! thanks for this masterpiece.",47.1
"after playing the console version this really enforces that pc is superior. the graphics are amazing and its just so much better with higher framerates. 10/10 i skipped homework to play. now... time to start that powerpoint",13.0
"i have played this on xbox 360 in the past, but stopped playing it since about december. i got bored of it. i felt like it was just the same thing, over, and over again. i preordered this, hopping for something different. when i started playing it, i was amazed by it! i felt like i had never playing this game in my life, even though i have. i have played about 11 hours in game now, and i have never got bored yet. i have all my settings on high, and it is truly breath taking. i love how much detail they put in this game that 1% of people may notice (maybe a ciggerette bud on the ground, or some griffiti on the wall.) i definitaly recomend this game for its hours and hours of enjoyment.",12.1
"having put ~150 hours into the 360 version of this game, i can say this is a vast improvement. not only visually, but in the playstyle as well. i see that a lot of people are having issues with the game, and all i can say is that i havent had any issues, and im running on 8 gb of ram and a 750 ti 2gb sc. getting a solid 60 frames on some mid range settings. the technical issues are a big problem, but will surely be fixed within a week of release. rockstar isnt known for their stelar releases, but they usually fix them pretty quick. to those coming from console versions, you will notice better graphics, provided you have a capable pc. to those who have never played the game, oh boy are you in for a treat with this one. this is simply a game you must own, regardless on what platform you play it on. the constant online updates that the devs give adds a nice flare to an already mouthwatering and addictive multiplayer. i give this a 9/10, only off by 1 point because of current technical issues.",49.0
"a game i was hyped for, for a very long time! it came out well but im dissapointed after transfering my gta online character from xbox 360 to pc his appearence and traits were completely reset, also not to mention the insanely long amount of time it took to unpacked the game files! i will think about changing my review once my gta online character is fixed. -------------------------------------------------------------------------- update 4/17/2015 rockstar has never contacted me back.... my entitiy xf which i paid real life money for is gone online is horrible i regret ever buying this game on the xbox and pc. this was right before i was going to change my dislike to a recommended game... an hour later 4 more cars dissapeared from my garage",34.3

"loyal player of gta series and as a ex console palyer i played gta5 to death but the max payne 3 crew must of been outdated with rockstar saying they ported gta5 to pc with the launch problem list being so long after the 2 delays it took to polish with my specs listed on my profile i get lag spikes when driving even on low settings with the latest drivers meaning the game has issues with some gpus! one of the i need to wait for the next patch games in your steam libary. oh one more thing the dlc favours consoles still with rockstar :l",6.8
"been waiting along time for this game. big fan of the series since the original game. not completed it yet but its definitely a thumbs up from me. the game is missing the line of orange people to run over, lol, unless i havent found them yet.",41.3
"ill make this quick, played gta since the very first top down one on pc. i played them all and loved them all like we all have. so when the time gta5 came out i was waiting to maybe get it on a next gen console, so i waited and didnt play it even though it was killing me. fast forward, i never bought a ps4 or xbox one because im pretty much 100% pc at this point. so i had to wait and wait, and then it gets delayed and delayed. so yesterday i finally got to play this on pc in all its glory and wow, runs amazing looks great and is the same great gta type of game i expected. if anyone is on the fence about this because it may not run well, i wouldnt worry about it rockstar nailed it on the optimization for pc. im completely happy with it and cant wait to spend 100+ hours running over pedestrians.",32.8
"my experience with gta so far well i can tell you i havent gottin to play yet the rockstar social ui keeps crashing and seems there is no fix i dont know what to to at this time cause i kinda got scamd at this point please someone let me know if this is getting fixed or can i get my money back?",2.0
"this game is one of the greatest games of all time, i mean as of right now you can see it has 19000 positive reviews, i have been playing the gta series since i was a kid, i owned gta 1, and had gta2 on dream cast, and to see it come from its early days from a unknown developer at the time called dma to becoming rockstar, and eventually rockstar north and being this beautifully crafted game is amazing to watch over the years of playing. the wait sucked for pc, but thank you rockstar for another beautiful, epic story line, built on a beautiful, breath taking environment. i fear death because i know once im gone, i wont be able to play these awesome epic games anymore. lol, how much i love gta, and a great improvement on port this time!!! standing applause!!!!",0.2
"had it on my xbone and bought it for pc. was worth the waiting. they really made a great port, the game works smoothly in 60 fps with best graphics on my not so great graphic card. the new features are nice and now that it got released on pc i can finally play with my friends (they dont have xbone).",45.5
"the game is fun enough, the story is funny and you always have something to do. online is kinda lame since youd normally go from single player with all the items to online with nothing, and if you dont have a group it seems like a gank fest for the most part which can be fun if youre into that kind of thing. my only real complaint about the game is the horrible controls. with a gamepad its not to bad but mouse / keyboard it is so awkward and clunky. for example you go through the game using wasd for movement and then suddenly go into a plane and it wants you to use your num pad, wasd, and then youre expect to look around with your mouse. they could have done a lot better with just using your mouse to steer the plane and wasd to control pwr and left and right (forgeting the name). the game is fun and once you get over the controls is very good. id highly suggest atlest having a gamepad of some sort atlest plugged in for those flight missions since its very easy to switch between the two.",7.6
"in simple way, bad reviews are only from peepz who can play only solitaire on windows. i have never problem with this game from when we can start it. good optimized for old pcs like my. serious review comming later. watch less porn and ur pc will be ok.",22.3
"highly suprised gta online is such a good game. graphics look nice, the sound is really emmersive, and most important, tons and tons of different jobs, from arm wrestling to racing with many variations, to bank heists and other sort of jobs, and oh yes, car customization is there, also up to the point where certian things will fit different type of landstyles better then other, character customization that goes pretty deep aswell, and a gigantic open world to explore. god, there is not a single thing i can dislike about gta v, this is just the game i have been waiting for, especially the gta online.",62.6
"gta5 from childhood has been accompanied me! this is a great game.",93.8
"we all know (or should know) that this game is excellent and probably the best gta of the series. so lets skip that! the forum is litterally filled with questions about if the game runs well without having a high end rig, so lets talk about that. i personally was worried as well about if i could run this game as i have a graphics card that doesnt even meet the minimum requirements, but i took the (expensive) gamble anyway. i was pleasantly surprised to see that the game ran fine right from the start! i could even go beyond the recommended settings and still have a very smooth and stable fps. so if you have a desktop similar or better then mine you should definitely be able to play the game! i5-3350p (@ 3.10ghz) 6 gb ram geforce gt-620 (2gb) 720p",42.8

"optimized very well. this just proves that most pc devs dont even try. obviously because they have a secret deal with gpu manufacturers to optimize badly --> more sold gpus. this is basically an old game with new skin. but thats some nice looking skin, and runs silky smooth. some people have had problems like crashes. for me zero crashes. had a problem with installing though, gta5 needs 120 gb space to unpack files, even though after its complete, its only 60 gb. but the game works fine on (modern) hdd, doesnt need ssd contrary to what many believe. loading time is not long.",12.6

"like the developers said, gta 5 on pc is basically ultimate edition. -beautiful graphics (if you got the right graphics card) -awesome gameplay, even for returning players -first person -rockstar editor mode which allows you to play as multiple characters that were originaly npcs (non playable characters) and you can use rockstar editor mode to, you guessed it, make videos! -online can have 30 players instead of 16 (i think 16?) -character customization for online is much more unique and fun -you may transfer your characters from online if you had older versions of gta 5 -who doesnt want to play gta 5 on their desktop? biggest dissapointment is that you cannot play offline. if you have horrible internet that shuts off ocasionally, do not buy this game. buy better internet first. trust me though, the game is well worth the money, even if you have to spend more on internet and possibly a better graphics card, its a very very good game. and this is coming from somebody who has already played the game for almost 2 years on console. overall, 8.7/10 sucks that you need a pricey graphics card to run on full graphics, and i wish we could play it offline :(",14.2

"this game is amazing! the singleplayer is very dramatic/cinematic and has the feling of a movie about a group of thieves coming together to perform massive hiests. as for the multiplayer it feels like theyre trying to get you to buy shark cards as the online ultimatly feels like a huge grind but over all is still very fun and with the addition of hiests this gives the game a new feeling to it making players who have played the game for houndreds of hours to come back and play even more! so overall this game is worth buying the only thing i think needs changing is the grind in online. 11/10 ign 100% legit",24.9

"the definitive gta:v experience which, for me, was the ultimate multi-player game of the last generation. granted, its been a bit of a wait for the pc crowd, and the online facet of the game is not without its glitches (abominable lag despite having a +100 mbps connection, jumping into a car and not being able to drive for some reason, weird vehicle damage modelling loops, just-killed enemies coming back to life due to disparity between local and server-side assets, etc.), but when you compare it to similar games in the genre, i still think its way ahead of the competition. yes, the delays should have meant a more stable launch, and i agree that the whole windows username thing, whilst not affecting me personally, is a pretty big oversight, but a quick patch or two later and it should all be rectified. then again, im one of the jerks whos been playing it on xb360 and ps4 for the last year and a half, so im probably a whole lot more forgiving than the average pc user. either way, its a 09/10 from me - now we just gotta wait for a pc remake/sequel to red dead redemption.",19.5

"gta v is a huge production with lots of things to do in a big detailed world so dont get me wrong but the game braking bugs(not related to my system) with a lot of fiddeling to get through, the things the game pushes you through without you wanting to, boring minigames, clumsy characters, clumsy menus, characters choosing their own clothes, cars playing random radio channels and no way to trade cash between the characters its better to wait for a sale. im just forcing my way through this now for some value from my cash..",17.8

(40c average load temp with stock cooler; no problem ) ive also got a slighty outdated-> amd-fx-4300 quad core 3.8ghz - (runs a little hot with stock cooler but solid fps; so upgrading to an after market cooler and dab of thermal paste) pros- unbelieveably immersive and detailed world to explore. same things the last bazillion people said. cons- its slightly more unrealistic when it comes to the driving speeds.

"its a good game but without steam workshop and stability issues i dont think i can bring myself to buy this since i already own it for the 360. thats not to even touch on launch day issues which is totally inexcusable for a game that came out in 2013 and has been waiting this long for a pc release that has been promised for so long.",4.7

"the game works perfectly for me, with 2 minor crashes in the first hour when i was messing with graphic options. the game is greatly optimised as expected, and may even become better optimimised when woth dx12! i can recommend it at least, its a great and fun game!",13.6

"best 3 words to describe this game: best game ever.",56.3
"ehh, its ok... the work theyve done is great and is easily worth the game cost alone. however, craftsmanship aside, this is a bit better than gta4 technically speaking, but not better than gta3: san andreas immersion/story-wise. - its a bit of a cheap gimic for game makers to let users create their own content (movie mode). that was a novel idea back when minecraft came out... now its just lazy. - the missions feel cobbled together and the character switching requirement/feature causes immersion loss. - main characters are as deep as a kiddy pool, and supporting characters are mostly just annoying and not lovable. + trevor, however, was really well done! + graphics, controls, cars, city, diversity, engine, optimization are all cinima grade awesome. all in all, its fun to screw around gta2 style, but at $260-ish million development budget... they could have done considerably better. rockstar, if youre listening and think i should shut up or put up... deal... ill help you build gta6 :)",59.9
"really well optimized, compared to gta iv, the graphics are amazing, even in the lowest settings, the shadows are unbeliavable, tottaly soft and without pixels. the only bad thing is the lot of problems that came on the launch day. lots of people trying to download, install, open, but without success. i had to deactivate my nvidia gt 630m and use the intel hd graphics 4000 to launch the game, then activate the offboard gpu to run it, because the launcher crashes at every try. worth the money and the wait, but me and tons of people are still waiting for those compatibility fixes. 8/10",19.0

"even though i have only played an hour of this on pc i must say this game is absolutely amazing. i had some scares about if my build could handle the game and i was very surpsrised at how well the game ran. i was able to transfer my old character from xbox 360 to pc, no problems everything was the same. got the extra money for the pre-purchase. gg rockstar, thanks for releasing one day early :) cant wait to play this game and do some heists.",20.2
"i am only just now starting to realize how much time i put into this game on the 360 originally because of steam tracking my hours. i can tell you that these 15 hours that ive logged on the pc so far have seemed like nothing. heres to many many more hours in this game.",83.6
"this game is amazing! it is very well optimised. i can run this at high settings with my 4gb ram, nvidia 840m laptop with little lag. but i lag more with the lowest settings o.o anyways, its a very fun and enjoyable game to play with your friends or by yourself ;d also highly recommended for people that like beating up  and racing",23.0

"single player is awesome, i really hope they can bring back the jazz radio (the one in gta4, its my favourite radio channel) multiplayer is quite laggy at the moment (i know it is just released) also, it automatically switches my character to another server when im on a mission. lack of options on appearance (e.g. cant change body shape, clothes are not good looking as well....) biggest issue is heist, if one player leaves, the whole mission failed, it would be nice if the missing player is replaced by bot. also, everytime i died, my screen freezes and not be abled to play the restarted mission unless the host die as well. (sure rock star will patch it in the furture) overall an awesome game, 9/10 (would be 10/10 if they fix",43.3

(unplug any controllers, or else your system will crash) now for my review love the game, graphics are eye-popping, gameplay is phenominal. when exiting the game through the online (settings) option, my desktop crashed (twice). the secong time i exited my pc never recovered from that crash. im resolving the issue as im typing (system restoring). im not too upset because all of my data is backed-up. just worried that this game is unplayable currently.",27.1

"if youre a gta fan this is the version of gta 5 you want. as someone that has hundreds of hours logged in the ps3 version of this game im literally stunned by how much better and more immersive the pc version is. 5 out of 5 stars to r* for doing a pc port the right way!",76.5

"tell me a good thing that this game teaches you, i dont even feel the hero that saved the day or anything, all i can do is killing civilians and steel and crash everything, and at the end of the day i really feel stressful, i am not trying to be boring but this my experience, and there is a different between a violence game and a game that install violence in your actions and corrupted ideas. for now i am sorry , but i feel the game is so filthy and it even teach me the most wrong english of all time. however the online playing is better i really like racing with other friends and everything work fine and smooth, the game didnt even crash once and it has everything you like, i still remember once we where trying to code another game to include all these features before gta v came, the game is very customizable and i cant find anything that it doesnt include. yes buy it, you will like it but dont get too crazy about it, just remember that life has more valuable and your career is more beautiful than the image of this stupid crap game, it is very hard that i gave it yes but dude, i am telling you the developers didnt miss anything.",32.1

"after a long wait and many delays, grand theft auto v has finally arrived onto steam. its a great game that you can mess around on, wreak havoc, break laws, obey laws, buy stuff, shoot stuff, blow stuff up, drive stuff, fly stuff, play with friends, and many, many, many more features. the graphics are amazing, and i especially like the motion blur added to the pc version. those with low fps (20 - 30) will be glad that motion blur is a thing. the gameplay is fantastic. i cant recommend another game as good as this one. the controls feel right, the movement feels right, everything feels right. the texturing is very detailed and so are the many small things in this game. not a single thing is left unpolished in all of san andreas. why are you still reading this review? go buy the game already. its worth the $60.",46.2

"having bought this game twice before i can tell you that, content wise, this game is absolutely excellent. port-wise, its fantastic. its unreal that a game can be so dense and detailed and still run at a rock solid 60fps. bravo rockstar, this game is well worth the 155 pounds ive spent on it so far.",5.9

"i cant even play this game, the colours get mad ingame ....",5.8
"overall this is a great game with some flaws. they should have allowed you turn down your graphics further for with my really bad computer, it lags on the lowest of settings. there are still some graphical errors which are probably because of my low end pc. i would give it an 8/10. i would take two points away because of the general flaws in the gameplay and graphical errors.",9.2
"i skipped all the console versions of this game, but what i can say that the engine is an improvement compared to gta iv, and runs pretty good on my machine. i cant play the game on the best settings but i dont mind, most settings are on normal or high, did need to disable msaa/fxaa, but at least i can play in 1920x1080 with 60 fps most of the time. from what i have seen i love the storyline with the different characters and the online mode gives you enough hours of playtime. whatever mode you play in, you will eventually run into awesome moments. at this moment i play the game with keyboard and mouse when on foot or in verhicles and a xbox 360 controller when flying, because the default numlock controls used for flying are horrible. one other downside is that my saitek x52 or any other joystick aint supported by the game, only xbox 360 controllers are supported. i would like to see this feature in the future or hope that i will get some xbox 360 controller emulator working in combination with my joystick.",43.7
"must must must must must must must must must must buy! great game overall, i have had no problems starting or launching the game ever. i am not sure why some people are having problems. but if you were like me, and wanted the game but had no money, sell all your csgo skins, trust me its worth it! 10/10 gaben would approve!",28.7
"i have been waiting for this game for well over a year, and when i finally get it, it doesnt even open, let along get to the point where it crashes! for the ammount of time this was delayed, i would expect for it to work first time. until this problem has been fixed, i would advise that you do not buy this game!",0.4

"great game. great port. looks nice. vram usage chart in graphics menu goes above and beyond what id expect from most modern games. benchmark kinda breaks the game if you try and use it outside of normal free roam, and there are a few occasional glitches here and there, but overall this was very much worth the wait.",40.5

"it runs surprisingly well and has yet to ever drop below 30 fps. i generally hang in the 50-60 fps region on high-ultra. i only have an 8230 oc to 4.2 and a r9 270, so you could say this game is very well made, and it has many more updates to come.",45.4

"played roughly 200 hours when it launched on the xbox 360, loved it, and now its finally back in its definitive edition and all them console peasants be like ay bruh thas some nice graphics u got ther and we be like well you know, just some normal pc master race thing, nothing special. but yeah honestly, its impressive, and having a good pc like i do makes it even better, it runs great with everything maxed out *cough*unlike gta iv*cough* and the time we waited to have it on pc was definitely worth it. some people are having some hardware issues, but you know, its pretty normal with games on day one nowadays. im currently experiencing some horrible mouse acceleration and fps drops in the menu, but this will get fixed eventually. bottom line : if you havent played it on console yet, buy it, if you played it on the xbox 360, buy it, if you have xbone/ps4... well, theres no real reason to buy except for the slightly better graphics so unless you have a potato, go for it if you have the money and the power to run it at 60fps high/ultra.",70.6
"single player: same as always with way better graphics(loading screens for multi and single player take 10 years) multiplayer: was great for the first 20 hours or so, i get on friday morning and it kicks me from the first few servers i join i think its my internet so i get on later. same thing for the last 4 days no mater what internet i am on. the servers are complete  and everyone is having problems playing on them, for a aaa game its servers are complete .",33.3

"this game... even the newly released alpha early-access games are less buggy. after downloading the huge 60gb game, i had to first make a new windows user account only so i could run the game. when i finally could get the game to run i got stuck in a loading screen. i had to go and delete some files that were presumably in an infinite download-delete loop, when i deleted those the game was supposed to download the original files back and stop doing the infinite loop, but no. f*ckin s*it, the game didnt even want to start, so i had to torrent the files (about 5gb) back and put them in, yay now the game launches but still stuck in the  loading screen. so now after four hours of troubleshooting and trying to get the game past the first loading screen without any success, i am deeply dissappointed, dear rockstar, what the flying f*ck is this?",35.8

"a solid port, not much better than console version but run smoothly ... as long as you dont mind rockstars ing social club. nothing more exhilarating than twisting your thumbs while staring at the loading screen for hours since the game cant load past scs authen check. on gameplay: single is ok, as expected of a gta game. multi is okayish but somewhat misleading. the famous open world gta is known for is no more than a glorified lobby, every match brings you to a separate match instance. nothing new since the game is already 2 years old but if you are like me who didnt bother reading up on the game before purchasing, its something to reconsider. tl;dr: tic tin th ng mua, crack m i cho c vic. update: third day in, and the game still refuses to load past the initial loading screen. this pile of shiet is officially the worst purchase in my collection after rome ii total war. if you can, dont buy it, but pirate it. a port is still a ing port.",5.6

"if youve played grand theft auto v on consoles, then you wont be disappointed. if you havent, youre in luck because this is indeed the definitive version. in my opinion, rockstar have done a wonderful job developing the game for pc. it was well worth the wait. the amount of graphical options means you can tweak the game to how you like it, especially if youre limited by hardware. the addition of the rockstar editor is just he icing on the cake. you may not be pleased with the price point due to when the game was released, but think of it as a brand new game being released in 2015 (because its that good).",31.3

"right so this wont be a review of the content of the game but whether or not to buy it in its current state since we all know the game  rainbows anyway. i am not reccomending this game on the pc for the sole purpose of it having optimization issues i call it the stutter essentially whenever i run the game it could run fine for 30-mins or 1 minutes or for an hour its completly random but then the game has these stuttering fits almost like trying to start up a brocken down car and it works for 10 minutes at a time. just for anybody who is looking at this and about to type well maybe its your computer specs these are my specs- gtx660ti 8gb ram i5-2310 and 5981mb left for page file use. my setup is almost identical to that of the reccomended specs on the front page of the game if that doesnt give you warning whistles you might want to consolt your local cautious pharmasist. the stutter problem gets worse the more you play i have also searched it up online and it seems alot of players are having the same issue dont buy this game right now use your head like i didnt and wait until the game is more polished i say 5 or six patches have a good day everyone.",44.8

"even though i have played and enjoyed this game on the ps3, there is no way i can currently recommend it on pc. the game simply does not launch, and there has been no official word from rockstar about a fix for it. hopefully i can change my review in the future, but right now id avoid buying it and wait for a few patches. _________________________________ update 15/04/2015 after finally finding a fix thanks to the steam community (i had to uninstall my antivirus), i can finally recommend this game! looks incredible, runs smoothly, and plays like a dream. 10/10 would preload, rage about it not working, then find a fix again.",68.0

"my first contact with this game i watched a friend beat a mexican luchador in an arm wrestling contest. afterwards he rode in the car with the luchador and waited while the luchador ran into a 7-11 and robbed it. after a short chase from the police the luchador drove the car into the bay. they then swam to shore and upon finding another car the luchador tried to steal it and was beaten to death by a redneck. 100/10 i bought the game no questions asked after seeing this.",44.5

(just turn off aa, at that resolution you dont need it at all :3). as for online capabilities, much better than the torm that was launch on the peasantstation 3 and xbox #360noscope since you can actually play gta online without disconnecting 24/7 (all hail pc master race). *good on rockstar for not pulling another gta iv on pc",24.5

"the patch and amd driver update (beta) actually made the game a lot faster and more stable (it was barely playable at first). there are some technical flaws thogh. nice visuals, quite stable fps, a-lot-of-new to explore and learn. suddenly theres something more time consuming than skyrim. i didnt try gta online yet since my internet is very unstable atm; people say its chaos and the most of the time you watch load screens, not los santos. im very happy with the singpleplayer so far. maybe the game is not totally worth the full price (i usually buy games on huge sales), but its not waste either. so, im pretty happy with the buy and i look forward for new updates/fixes. specs: msi gx70 laptop (fullhd) amd a10 5750m (2.5/3.2 ghz) radeon hd8970m 2gb gddr5 16gb ddr3 1600mhz 7200 rpm hdd win7 64 settings: 1920x1080 high texture quality high shadow quality high reflections quality softest shadows v-sync: half (30 fps) fxaa the rest is low/default. 9.5/10 (not so satisfying shooting, few other things are off, otherwise very enjoyable). 2015-04-17",19.7
"i was scared that it wouldnt work, because i still cant get gta4 to play because of windows live errors. gta 5 makes you log in through social club but its not nearly as bad. i have all the recommended specs and then some. the game is beautiful. i have the game on ps3 but havent played it in so long that im ok with starting over. there are some new features - new cars, first person mode and online heists. i love 3rd person but 1st person feels extremely immersive, like youre in the city. i dont need to see the back of my characters head. also shooting controls are great with a mouse. no need for auto aim. driving is tough though. i do have a controller and its a lot better with that. to sum it up, the game runs great. nvidia came out with a driver last night, so i was good to go.",28.4
"if you only own a keyboard/mouse combo (or plan to only use one) gta is ready to frustate you. gta loves to throw you into the deep end without prep time, wether its driving, shooting, diving or flying. flying however is the worst, with default pc controls being an unworkable nightmare that also happens to be delivered while being shot at. from my current perspective flying in gta v is about -10 of fun and there is no excuse for it. it isnt just dedicated flying titles that do it better, like world of warplanes, but also so called rivals - where one presume rockstar paid at least cursory attention to - like the saints row entries 3 and 4. they all can boast better control schemes right out of the box and that makes the poor performance of gta on this front all the sadder. im now off to see if that gamepad i bought for emergencies is any better at not hitting the virtual ground but even it is - why the hell do i need to install an entirely new input mechanism when there a several aaa title that dont need it ? steering planes on a pc isnt some new and arcane art.",45.9

"cant play this  game because of infinite rockstar social club charging, gonna keep this negative till this ing game works. edit : so i was able to get on the game after having to tweak some  that i shouldnt have to be doing but oh well, i dont know if rockstar came up with a patch or anything yet but this really isnt serious at all, they delayed it so many times and for what ? so many people had and still have issues just launching the game, its a joke... aside from that, the game is pretty well optimised, im running on high and a few setting on very high with a r9 280x oc 3go and an i5 4690k at around 40-60fps, mostly over 50 though which im pretty satisfied about, amd will probably still come out with another driver to make it even smoother (yeah i guess im an optimistic person) only negative point i can really think about which is pretty ing annoying are the endless loading times on gta online, i have the game on a 240go ssd and its so ing annoying as im not patient at all when it comes to video games. all around im enjoying this game now that i can actually play it, id recommend buying it if you have the recommended config.",64.4
"certainly gta, despite being an extremely late release, the improvements to this game are pretty strong! pros: the fps feature makes a great improvement in playability and experience, for it may help players who are used to fp shooters not feel completely alienated being forced into 3rd person, and driving any vehicle from the inside delivers a nice touch of depth (working odometers in a non racing game.... wow). further more, the story for this game was great! this is to gta v as a whole (meaning pc/console); anyone who hasnt played through it already, anticipate a solid story if you plan on picking this game up. single player content is loaded. cons: more of a personal gripe, ive found myself switching between my xbox controller and mouse/keys due to control-complexity. xbox controller for anything involving a vehicle, and m/keys for in combat (whether in car on the move, or on foot). theres a lot to remember for different key functions.",43.7

"the game is great and lots of fun! however, you all should know that it freezes and crashes in online multiplayer alot. expect to look and feel like a total scrub because you will crash at the worst possible time when doing heists with a group and let everyone down, and then itll rinse and repeat and everyone will hate you and unfriend you because of it. so much fun and so much to do, but eventually youll get enraged because of all the crashes. good luck, have fun ;)",53.8

"it was really really good and then it got revoked from my account because the guy i bought it from did a chargeback on his credit card. ive sent a steam ticket to try and get it back but they probably wont respond for a while and even if they do i dont know if ill even get the game or my 22 keys back. 10/10 the worst thing is its all my fault",13.4

"buy this at your own risk. looks like almost all of the negative reviews are from people who cannot even play the game due to social club errors. im currently still not able to launch the game after hours trying the possible fixes. still no response on this issue from rockstar after more than 1/2 a day. i rarely pre-order and i sure do regret this one.",73.5

"i paid for gtav and instead got social club loading simulator (with no fix) 2015 0/10 would not buy until rockstar adresses this issue. (also, it seems to be an inconsistent problem that does not happen to everyone, keep that in mind)",13.1
"the game runs at 40 fps and microstutters all the time, even though i meet the recommended specs. pathetic port. ridiculous optimization. after 19 months of wait, that is the unfinished piece of garbage rockstar dares to give us.",28.4
"i love this game so much. and all these new features and effects are just incredible. i have played this game on ps3 since the day it came out back in 2013. this is my favourite game out of all. i recommend it to everyone!",35.6

"rockstar has completely outdone themselves this time around. the game runs great! i get an average of 60 fps on my hd 7850 2gb oc and i7 2600k. the graphics are a huge improvement as well. i was a little worried about purchasing this game, but i am glad that i did. keep it up! :)",34.8
"review only for online. i cannot recommend this game, maybe if the price was 1/3 of current. it is a very bad ride. started good, but after some patches loading times extented, got graphics glitches. but thats not all, if you do not know a lot of people who play this, there is a possbility of never getting to do any heists, or you can try with a team of random, but 95% times there is this one dumbass who will ruin it for all. my advice for the past me: save the money and buy witcher 3.",22.6
"even on intel hd 4000 this game runs smooth on meduim graphics and im playing on a bootcamped mac so that just goes to show how truly amazing this game is",32.1
"in this review i will be reviewing this version of the game as it stacks up to the other versions. graphically its outstanding, you cant really get any better on the console versions. too bad for a large percent of users the port is riddled with problems (like the one where you cant load jobs online without your game crashing) i am finding it hard to recommend this game in its current state, since it seems to be a flip of the coin wether or not it will actually run consistently without crashing.",47.5
"not a bad game. needs a little more optimization. online is fun.",34.3
"if you had the grand theft auto v launcher has stopped working bug, a recent patch has fixed it. game works for me now. good pc port. if youre hoping for a decent online community though, you wont find it here. people will shoot at you randomly and run over you and call you racial slurs, but you can turn on passive mode to prevent them from doing that. the first two things anyway, theyll still call you racial slurs.",36.2

"the game is broken on launch. i guess testing wasnt in the budget. very common, above average setup here. at first the game quit after a few minutes. the first transition cutscene then failed. i then installed nvidias update specifically for the game. started it back up made it to the second cut scene transition before it died again. kind of sad that this is the product we get after waiting so long.",27.1
"its great, idk what else to say its gta 5 on pc...",46.5
"10/10. if you dont buy this game you are missing out on a piece of gaming history that has been tuned over the last 4 generations of releases for absolutely the greatest fun potential that can be built into a game. a couple good friends with headsets and you can ignore pub servers and playing with the pew pew kiddies. hope more of my friends get it! single player is great too...awesome replay value. runs beautifully, tons of advanced video customization options, and 4k compatible. get it!",41.8
"very amazing game. dont believe some people when they say it is just another badly ported gta, sure it has a few problems still, but just be happy it runs better than gta iv, a game that came out 2008, and gta v looks just about as good as gta iv with a ton of mods. if you have the money, buy the game it is very worth it. these slight issues will most likely be patched within a few months time, probably not even that.",91.3

"where can i apply for a job in the rockstar team? two years of development and still they didnt even try to do a test run on some laptops, i think they have mighty fine siesta breaks at that company. oh well i guess the laptop players will have to wait 2 months more on a patch. sleep tight rockstar (for people with switchable graphical units i.o.w. intern graphical processor unit (cpu) + dedicated graphics card, dont invest money into this game yet. gta5 doesnt support this verry common laptop setup.)",1.4
"terrible multiplayer, cant join anyone, game crashes randomly and forces you into the campiagn. did not live up to hype",36.8
"with the last incarnation of gta on pc (gta 4) i was very dubious with this purchase, but it was a great purchase in the end, be it with a few les here and there. it might have took a few hours for the last chunk of the game to be installed with it being unpacked and installed but it is just as good as the max payne 3 port and runs smooth on my i5 3570k and amd 7950 3gb. the only time i experience noticeable fps drops is during high speed driving and im sure with a few graphical tweaks in game in regards to texture quality it will improve. all in all a good purchase.",42.5
"overall this game is amazing ofcourse the singleplayer is good. but when it comes to everything else its bad. i dont like how you have to restart the game everytime you change the graphics and get a long intro for the game not even a loading screen when it comes to the multiplayer sometimes when you invite people they cant join because it says its full or something even tho its not and random stupid bugs and glitches like that",65.5
"good game but i just lost my adder!!! on gta 5 online. dont steal a car and park it in your garage if you have a car allready out and about it will delete your car. since i am pissed the  off about this issue i will be down voting untill this is fixed",62.0
"after playing vice city it was mind blowing to see the change in visuals. luckily the story telling is still gta standard. multiplayer is also very entertaining for hundreds of hours to come.",41.8

"love this game since it was released on ps3 its like san andreas but more graphical",44.1
"outstanding version of the game! graphically for the better systems this game is a must and the best gta yet. havent tested with more force feedback steering when yet, once i have will confirm wether it is working in game.",34.2

"doesnt launch. just tries to load and then nothing... and with steam, no money back.",57.6
"garbage port, dont buy unless you have a really good rig. online is even worse very unstable, the game has crahsed atleast 10 times on me. getting really sick of this. 2 damn years rockstar fix it",39.5

"spent an hour chasing around a woman and shooting out her tires and windows, simply because she owned a compact car. 11/10 would project again",28.8
"honestly the most difficult game i have ever had to deal with, and sadly i have even avoided most of the major issues. it loads about one fourth of the time and the other 75% it provides the annoyances and frustrations that i can only imagine be rivaled by a barbedwire laced power drill rapeing my nostrils. seriously considering a refund.",19.3
"loading screen simulator 2015 (for online, that is) seriously though, ever since my mom first banned gta from my brothers and mine game collection, its been a favorite of mine. gta 5 is the ultimate gta. everything annoying in the old games is gone, and just the right amount of realism is there. story mode is great and takes years to beat, and online mode is basically a second, more personal customized story mode. i just wish it hadnt taken so long to come out.. but hey, perfect things need a lot of polish ^-^",57.3
"really like it but i have a few problems - the amount of time it takes to download is way to much and its a bum : the social club screen crashes for me alot and i almost cant play but i really enjoy it its epic, chaotic and i play it in 4k ultra settings and it looks a-m-a-z-i-n-g!!! if you should buy it - yes :d buy it now - no, wait for the server loads to decrease and then wait for a sale ill rate it 9.5/10 because of the a bit anoying launch : enjoy the game :d",5.9
"ive always been a big fan of rockstar. they are my favorite developer. that being said i have bought this game 3 times, and it is well worth it in my opinion. i bought this on ps3, xbox one, and now pc. ive been waiting for a pc release since the game was announced in the beginning. this has to be one of the best games i have ever bought because even after around 100 hours on the ps3 version, 40 hours on the xbox one version, and with the above amount on the pc version i still find that this game does and will have a bunch of replayability for years to come. and for the sake of the race: 4k 60fps or die",27.1

"on my first day of playing gta v, i realized this game is about freedom to do whatever you want. after completing 1,2 missions, i decided to hit the golf course at about 10:30 pm. a sharp pain in my right eye broke my concentration and ive messed up the shot. alas, when i looked upon the cellphone clock, it was 4:30 am and my eyes were bleeding. but i honestly cant remember when i had so much fun in life, and i have a pretty cool life too, cant complain. the thing is, there is so much to do, so much to see, im guessing its gonna take me 100+ hours to see it all. every ride reveals beautiful, realistic eye candy that just puts a smile. dont believe me? grab a chopper or a plane and gain some altitude, then look down on the city. it feels so alive, every car driving with a purpose, every pedestrian doing his own thing. this is so much more than a video game, its the video game. its a life simulator that it sadly, way more fun than real life. p.s. one of the best optimised games for pc ever. looks and plays wonderful. i have to sleep now, or ill die.",61.3
"definately a good port, i get 50 fps at 1080p on a 760 oem and a fx-8320. also a great game.",43.8

"gta v was my most craved game of 2015. every delay even further made me want it more and ensured me rockstar was going to give us a fully-optimised product here. yeah, this game works for a lot of people, hence the dominant recommended reviews, but for me: no. this game crashes all the flippin time. im running an r9 290, i5 w/ 16gb ram. im above rec. specs and this game crashes like there is no tomorrow, even after its 2 updates. i dont have all of the graphic settings turned on and many of them are lower than the highest setting available and itll still crash like crazy. sometimes it crashes after 10 min of play, sometimes 1 hr. sometimes driving, sometimes walking, sometimes in a mission, sometimes just standing there. i have found, however, that the lower the graphical settings are the less the game crashes. but man the lowest settings look almost worse than the ps3/360 version of the game. i dont have a $1,200 computer to deal with that. its just not worth it. please, rockstar, patch this puppy up. i cant enjoy it. dont ditch us.",25.9
"gta v finally made its way to pc if you are lucky enough your copy will have downloaded and played fine on the first day which is something pc hasnt gotten much of in recent years (cough cough watch_dogs & ac unity). i am also very pleased as i can actually run this game (on the lowest settings, which just looks like xbox360 version) on my potato of a laptop with the following specs. amd a6-5350m (dual core 2.9ghz turbo to 3.5ghz) apu with radeon(tm) hd graphics 8gb ram amd radeon hd 8450g - about 750mb graphics win 7 i also have a desktop with much better specs which will look much nicer but the fact that my potato laptop cant run it is definitely awesome and last of all, its gta of cource it is gunna be a sick  game, good job rockstar",56.1

"fun game, looks good, runs well, great voice acting and soundtrack. only 3 problems with it so far: 1- game is hyper-unintuitive. i had less difficulty learning to program with the unix vi editor than i did trying to do very simple things in this game, like figure out what the hell passive mode is or how to disable it. hell, i couldnt even find out how to leave gta online, and i had to force it closed with task manager :/ 2- pvp in free roam is extremely shallow. get mg, get fast car, spray from car. if not, get spammed from car, die. shame, if you had to actually aim to shoot from a car in third person this game would be a much more fun and skillful pvp experience. 3- dear god, the law enforcement system in gta online is atrocious. you would think that offing someone in a dark alley with a suppressed pistol would reduce your chances of being discovered, but apparently big brother sees all in los santos, and the nations entire police force will dispatch endless troops from your anal sphincter. why even have a suppressor when you have radar always on and cops see everything? just remove it from the game rockstar, stop misleading people.",39.8

(fx-4100) the textures look great compared to the previous version i played on the last-generation consoles, even on the normal setting. the game has a very useful video memory gauge like the other rockstar ports which makes tweaking the options a cinch. i had no trouble transferring over my gta online character from the ps3 version, and the online so far hasnt given me any trouble in terms of connectivity. i did have some trouble with what seemed like mouse acceleration, and i was unable to find an option to disable it. but after changing from raw input to directinput it seems to be much better. all in all, id say it was worth the wait.",40.4

"well im going to start off by saying this version of gta v is definitely the best version of it available. i understand the perks of 4k res and 60 fps, but that isnt what makes it the best version for me. keyboard gameplay is smooth and easy to pick up after a little bit of playing and a few double checks in the keybinding tab. what makes this game the best version is the rockstar editor, i love making movies and this is a home run for me. i am still learning the camera behaviors and the editing tools, but this is an amazing addition. it makes this game shine, i love the fact that you can use action replay and record epic moments that we not intentional or intended. plus it is available on online and campaign. ive been playing this on ps3 since it came out and i am happy that i pre-order this game worth every penny.",43.9
"servers are still horrendous. every gets kicked off of servers constantly, in the middle of jobs or just cruising. loading screens take forever all the time. i have 300/300 internet and these issues happen to many other people as well. until they fix their servers i would not recommend wasting your money on this game.",31.5

"gta as normal, just better. not tons of miles better but good enough to be better than iv. massive open-world, tons of missions, lots of side-bits you can do, the little unofficial personal rampages you can do in this series that make it worth the fun. its hard to escape police unless youre low-level, which is how it needs to be. online play is dependent on players but plays well enough. most shocking is just how damn fast it runs on the same hardware as i played gta iv on. i was expecting massive drop in speed - its parallel or even slightly faster, despite being prettier. i have an old mobile nvidia card, so i wasnt expecting that, but i dont think you could get away with a run-of-the-mill business pc with any nvidia card - the first of the 64-bit-only games ive seen and for a reason. but with quad-cores and 8gb ram and a half-decent directx-10/11 card its more than playable at full res but its just a question of what options you have turned on. havent seen any popping-in issues but my hard drive is constantly streaming data when im playing. great game, looks great, plays great, tons of freedom, huge world and more vehicles and missions than you can shake a stick at.",28.7
"honestly, i was so excited at first when the pre-order for gta v went up, i purchased it in a heartbeat. and i jumped on as soon as i could to get it. the campaign is kind of glitchy, and online is absolute . i cant even get past the tutorial without my computer crashing. how long has it been since it came out for xbox? a year and a half? i would have rather waited longer for a game that actually works than what ive gotten now. if youre thinking of buying it, wait for the fixes first.",2.0

"same issue as many other laptop gamers. unable to launch game unless i disable my nvidia 780m. i have been re-enabling the nvidia gpu immediately after the game launches but for some unknown reason the game still runs as if its not. so multiple issues: - unable to the lauch normally with a nvidia 780m - 780m gpu is not supported for gta 5, even if it says it is - even after the 780m is enabled after game launches, game still runs off of factory intel gpu i love gta 5 (played it on xbox 360 and xbox one) and would love to be able to enjoy the game on this pc, but alas, i cant. now the nvidia 780m that i have is pretty good (runs arma 3, total war: attila, battlefield 4 just fine) and should not be having issues with gta. the issues are with this launch. i mean come on, no support for portable gamers (laptops)? no support for certain nvidia gpus? buggy and unstable gameplay for those that can run gta? gta 5 has been out for 2 years... come on rockstar. get your $hit together. awaiting the much needed patch in order to play. kinda of wishing i didnt waste $60 bucks.",8.3

"10/10 amazing graphics, the ammount of attention rockstar put into every minor detail is mind blowing. i would highly reccomend this game running on a i7 4770k and a gtx 980 g1, and it runs so smoothly. i spent the first hour walking around and looking for flaws in programing and in the game world itself i.e glitchy walls,, misanimations. havent found anything yet. the game world is so alive! i rode the subway, walked around a realistic baseball field, and while i was exploring some rooftops(the parkour reminds me of mirrors edge which is a good thing) i heard get on the ground! so i went to investigate and see cops starting to arrest a guy before he pulled a gun and a firefight ensued. they killed him and the cops moved so lifelike. love it! great job rockstar!",22.3

"man, this game really is great. its absolutely beautiful, the story is compelling, and its bigger than ever! the only problem is that..its not optimized for pc, oddly enough. it has issues using the full power of some peoples gpu, including mine. despite being able to run the game at 40-50 fps on medium high settings, you get wierd dips, stutters, and micro sound-cut outs at times, or, your fps will randomly drop to 20 and stay there for a minute, even when youre just standing still! when they release a better version ofthe game, it will have my full support. right now, im just not feelin it.",47.0

"i absolutely loved the game on gaystation 3, the only reason why i bought a gaystation was to play gta v and it was totally worth it (selling it now btw) and now i finally have this masterpiece on my 600 potato. it runs smooth at 30 fps at high and you dont need a 4000 pc to run this like most console peasants like to exeggrate their stuff. anyways, 60 is quit high for a game (imo) so if you can wait to buy this, wait for a sale or something. you really want to play this masterpiece to bad? go ahead and throw 60 at gaben fat  (jk, i love you <3). my overal rating would be 8.5/10 it just lacks some life, i mean, the city is almost empty and there barely isnt any traffic/pedestrians. rockstar should take an example from watch_dogs, the city if full of life!",53.0

"so i just installed gta 5 to my laptop (ihave nvidia 870m), after i opened up the game the right bottom bubble said gta5.exe has been blocked from graphic hardware and the game stopped working. i opened geforce experience to look for an update or something, but the app said the driver was unknown, it couldnt find the driver. after i restarted my computer it gave a blue screen report that says video_tdr_failure (nvlddmkm.sys) and when i opened up geforce experience again it couldnt not find any hardware. i tried to install the driver again but the installation program couldnt find the hardware either. i believe the problem is the new release of gta 5. also my gpu tweak program says the laptop is currently using intel graphics. after all these happened i contacted you and you told me that you should contact with the manufacturer. and i did that too and got my geforce experience fixed. this time when i open up the game my laptop shutted itself down 3 times. then i optimized the game from geforce experience. then it gave the blue screen again and there is no hardware detected again. i can fix it again but i dont think i can play the game again to not get the same crash.",18.8

(gotta love getting into a highspeed chase in a stolen car that just happenes to be playing something fitting to the scene) -hours upon hours of gameplay. -etc. downside: -requires a really powerful pc/laptop to truly appreciate its greatness. -may lead to psychosis ... lol",54.1

(maybe you couldve had a crash every 5 minutes then.) exquisite fun for you. game is good, port is... kinda optimized. story is great. cba to play it, getting put off by annoyances. so. no!  off with that  rockstar social club. you can do that  on consoles, not on pc.",28.4

"with the last incarnation of gta on pc (gta 4) i was very dubious with this purchase, but it was a great purchase in the end, be it with a few les here and there. it might have took a few hours for the last chunk of the game to be installed with it being unpacked and installed but it is just as good as the max payne 3 port and runs smooth on my i5 3570k and amd 7950 3gb. the only time i experience noticeable fps drops is during high speed driving and im sure with a few graphical tweaks in game in regards to texture quality it will improve. all in all a good purchase.",42.5

"story isnt great, neither the characters. the supposed irony and social comentary isnt there, dont believe people who says that. its a silly story, with lame supporting cast and bland main cast - excluding trevor, he grows on you. so far, the worst gta story and characters wise. but the best gta technically. its a beautiful game in every aspect and an exemplary port. rockstar did its homework this time: the game is an extraordinary port, really well optimized and ridiculously pretty graphics. even the physics improved in the porting process. gta v on pc is the ultimate experience for this game, believe me. san andreas state is the strongest character youll ever need for this game, followed by the beautifully accomplished vehicles of all sorts and amazing weather effects. oh, and theres the somewhat smooth online experience. if your pc falls between the minimum and recommended specs, just buy it. you wont regret.",42.7

"amazing so far. great sequel to the series and finally on pc. running on a gtx 760 at 1440p. 4k looks nice, but fps drops to below 30. buttery smooth @ 1440p. radio is very entertaining. the map has definitely changed alot since san andreas, but there are still some areas that are very close and reminicent of the older game. cars handle alot better than gta iv. switching between characters isnt as bad as i thought it would be. im also a big fan of how the map is not locked down from the beginning such as all the other gta games. first thing i did after the prologue was boost a car, drive to the airport and grabbed the first plane i found and cruised around the map (dat turbulence). love this game so far. only played online for a few minutes and hit rank 3. lots of potential and really looking forward to continuing this game. 10/10.",32.2

"having played a combined 75+ hours between the x360 and the pc i feel confident enough in my review. this game takes place in a obvious parody of los angeles where there are plenty of things to do and pop culture refrences to find (no spoilers for those). the main story has a total of ~40 hours and then another ~5 in side missions. the main story is very different from those of the other gta games but it is still quite interesting. the online mode is par with some other online games but it could be more fleshed out in my opinion.",32.4
"waste of time and money, it asked for my cd key to unlock gta v on social club. once unlocked it gave me a gta setup tool, once my steam account was linked to social club it asked for my cd key again to unlock it a second time. sadly it was already used to unlock it in the first place. this is why pc people torrent games... good thing i got a refund to this crap.",0.9

"what is not to like about gta? i have played this game on x360 and x1. story mode is fantastic. the elements of playing three different characters was a great idea. seeing the game evolve over the years of releases has been a blast. x1 version looks great but once you can great the game up to max and play it at 60fps it feels like an entirely different game. trying to go back and play it on console just doesnt satisfy anymore. frame rate is king to a degree. driving just feels incredible at 60fps. gta online is a blast to just drive around and mess with people. once you can get ranked up heists are fun but they do leave some things to be desired.",16.3
"gta v on pc is finally here (which was delayed for 1 year, 6 months, 28 days), but it can easily be forgiven. because the content is already awesome and its technically stunning. it feels like a new los santos. there is no open world game that can match that. and the rockstar editor offers such an easy access and so many possibilities in terms of clips/movies creation that we can only be sure that the pleasure will last for a long, long time. the game is well optimized for pc as well. excellent work rockstar!",56.8

"12 hours played in record. fine. spent 10 hours maybe more surfering with those f*cking bugs and f*cking connection problems f*ck!!!!!!!!! this mind be the first time i so sick of a so wonderful game like this sh!t in nearly 15 years gaming life. thank you ! rockstar!",33.3
"amazing game, and a great pc port. definitely worth the price. i already have it for console and this is just the icing on the cake.",31.1
"drank 12 shots of whiskey and passed out. then i played gta",56.6
"so its been about 7 hours since gta was finally ready to play. a year and a half could not have prepared my eyes (and my mind) from the visual onslaught brought on by the high resolution textures of gta in the very high settings. the amount of detail that was put into every aspect of the visuals is impeccable, from the high detail of car headlights to the boob wobble when you shoot a woman in a bikini with a beretta for looking at you funny. once you adjust to the detail you realize that the game seems to be set in overdrive mode, almost seems like its being fast forwarded. thats because its at 60fps, where our eyes have been used to seeing the game run at a near constant 30fps, to see it doubled is amazing. its is truly the ultimate version, better than both console generations combined.",2.8
"amazingly done r*. game runs smoothly on an average rig. some issues, but the positives overwhelm the negatives",63.4
"i played the game for a while now, both online and single player and as a guy who completed the game several times on ps3 its still incredibly fun to play with all the additions and improvements. the game is extremely well optimized unlike gta iv.",49.5
"this is pc porting / optimizing at its best, and most patient. this is what the community expects from a developer that delays a title, for it to be as complete a pc experience as possible, and have dimminished a sense of it being made for something inferior. rockstart has accomplished that w/ gta5 - its an amazing to look at experience, and it runs flawlessly. we all already know how great the content and story is, so ill leave this review as is. its a great game on the pc. it truly is the ultimate edition.",50.0
"pros- no roman bellic. looks great. skills/rpg system. low system requirements so i can run the game on pretty high graphics. edit: my online charaters no longer look like zebras. cons- no roman bellic. poor optimisation at lower graphics qualities. 1/5 of people who bought it cant play the game. edit: takes a ing year to load anything edit: sound sometimes ceases completely. edit: its impossible to stop single player from automatically loading if you leave the title screen for more than ten seconds. i leave the worst to last. no bowling with your fat, annoying eastern-european cousin. or a jamaican bloke. or a woman who inevitably betrays you. 2/10 will give better rating if roman bellic added",39.3
"so was the pc version worth a buy...so far i bought a pad, i got stoned, and drunk, also looked in a few peoples backyards with a telescpoe i dont need!! this games still a 10 outta 10 and probly best copy yet, which i can only compare to ps3 and ps4!!",57.6
"bought this game for myself and 2 friends. 420/69 i r8 8/8 m8",59.3
"i would personnaly recommend this game to anyone who is willing to spend endless hours on this game. i have alot of fun plaing this not only by leveling up and getting new equipment but by doing stunts and tring to do what is consider impossible had some issues with the game at the beginning eg. didnt want to lunch it but with help of our awesome community i got it to work it :d so if you are looking for good game gta v is a good chioce",50.0

"wait until they fix the numerous online issues. -crashes -server dcs -instability -loading screen connection issues fantastic game and amazing to play with friends but cant honestly recommend this game if your looking for the multiplayer experience. if your looking to this game for its single player experience however, go right ahead, but bear in mind the numerous problems that the online experience currently has",40.3
"could use some polish on the graphics and optimization. 6.5/10 - ign",55.1

"one does not know true pain until theyve downloaded gta v at 600kb/s. 10/10 would download ag... nvm i wouldnt",63.7

"game is broken!!, it crashes after a second of social club crap! rockstar are useless....",9.5
"day 1 of playing :- graphics looks ok , was expecting better though , 3 missions in and cant get any further due to being too hard to control , need 2 extra fingers :/",33.9
"utter ! if you have a laptop that runs intel api with amd gpu, do not buy! gta v will not run on intel cpu and amd gpu on laptops at the moment, rockstar refuses to answer the thousands of people waiting for a fix, and it does not look like the fix is coming any time soon.",0.6
"this game had a few release day hiccups, but no where near as many as some games. the hiccups included some unpacking errors and some other bugs involving rockstars social club, however these are easily fixed or you just have to wait a ad longer to play the game. my initial impressions were; the graphics are amazing, lots of customizable options (key bindings, graphical settings ect), the game runs at a butery smooth 60 fps (even on a pentum cpu and a gtx 760 ftw) at mostly high - maximum settings. however i have experienced a few bugs, which prevented my car from moving, however this is the only bug i have encountered. pros; 1) graphics 2)runs on not to good hardware very well 3)60 fps 4)key bindings and lots of customization 5)high resolution and multi monitor support (4k - 3 monitors) cons; 1)release day hiccups (not a big deal) 2)a few bugs (not many though) so all in all this game is brilliant on the pc, i love it more than ever now and it looks amazing.",9.9
"solid, ing ruined my entire social life however, but totally worth it",21.8
"well, i am actually very hyped for this game but when it first released there is a lot of crashes and settings that i need to deal with. im using lenovo y510p, for laptop users there is a lot of trouble going through to play this game. a lot of contant crashes god knows where it came from but after everything i am still giving the positive review for all the awesome gameplay i had. i did had bad moments starting the game but after playing it, every minute of it is worth while. ps: i dont recommend laptop users to purchase first, wait till they fix this thing.",50.4
"we know for a fact that all we do in gta is visit dem strip clubs, and have fun with s :) however... its all better with the pc version. thats right, you show those console peasants who the master race is!",26.9
"24 hrs, no patch. have the missing .exe file many have so the game doesnt even load. avoid.",34.3
"usually games get worse with sequels. rockstar seems to not be affected by this.",78.9
"best port ever, works so well. is bloody beautiful. tons of gameplay to be had in singleplayer or gta online. gta online has plenty of fun game modes, shooting is awesome with no  auto aim from consoles. its all manual aim here! insane game.",47.6
"now, if only i could run the game. you should only buy this once a patch comes out",0.6
"i would lick peanut butter off a homeless persons toe to play this game for an hour.",20.0
"best thing ever! especially when using a controller, driving is much easier.",6.9
"wonderful game i dont have the right requirements but it works smooth",29.0
"great game, runs like any modern pc game, clearly not a port tons of graphic options and custom settings you can change, graphics look great even on medium so far no problems the gta we waited for is finally here :d",5.6
"total waste of money. wont even start. does simply nothing. its a very good simulator how to start a game and a very hard one, too. i did not menage to get past the first level...which there is start the game.",29.6
"didnt expect it to be that good on pc. great story and awsome multiplayer (10/10)",47.6
"although this came out after nerly two years after the orignal release, this is hands down the best version of the game i have played. the settings are top notch, it has sli and crossfire support day one and is the best optimised game rockstar has ever relased. they say you can run this game 4k@30 fps with a 760. i play at 3440x1440 with a pair of 780ti in sli and this game runs at round 75+fps on ultra settings. only thing i have to turn down is aa. i highly reccomend this game to anyone who has played the earlier version and to those who havnt yet. 10/10",45.3
"rockstar told us the pc-version would be the ultimate version and they were right. i just love this game, the heists, the missions.. everything! 10/10 and its running smooth. :) pros: beautiful graphics and city 3 character switch smooth gameplay hours of fun gta online. cons: rockstar social club integration itself. taking a long time to load sometimes.",19.0

"one of the best games ive owned on steam so far. already clocked 57 hours on it. just the main story line alone was awesome! took me 24hrs to complete the main missions, but i still have tons of side missions to complete! multi-player is awesome as well even without friends. however, not everyone speaks english, thus there might be a problem when it comes to heists.",61.1
"fun game especially with friends to much stuff to do hiest missions if you have tried the console version you will deffently love the pc version better fps reolution and forget console lag ,this is on to watch,lol!",44.2

"on launch the first person mode of this game is unplayable becuase the fov is locked to 60, and on top of that there is horrible mouse lag, no matter what mouse input setting you use. rockstar, it took you 2 years to make this game, and still managed to  it up. i am never going to preorder a game ever becuase of this.",47.7
"so i bought gta 5 for pc :), drove up a hill, met a jaguar, punched it in first person. 10/10 goy.",13.0
"the game overall is good but my game stutters like crazy. the 1.01 patch was supposed to fix this, but only made it worse and entirely unplayable as of 4/20/2015. this is unacceptable from rockstar since alot of people have been having this issue. there is no fix for the stuttering as of yet. gtav uses alot of cpu and ram for some reason. rockstar support hasnt responded when i put my problem in on the 15th of april. this issue isnt due to my system due to the fact that i get more than 70fps when i dont stutter. ive tried running at the lowest setting, but it changes nothing. rockstar needs to fix the bugs that this game causes for people, it is just unaccpetable.",51.2
"this is literally the best game of the last 10 years, hands-fcking down. other opinions need to apply, you dont know what you are talking about, objectively speaking.",90.9

"i heard you like loading screens, so we put abunch of em in. in all seriusnes though, some poor lobby choises, like friendslist and crew mates being your preferded team members. so you might be fighting your friends in several game modes. but hey, nothing like shoting a friend in the butt. and all the loading, god all the loading. why cant we accept an invite, stay in freemode untill the game is launched. atleast have that as an option.",62.9
"please make a option for 30 frames per second in the game just as a option please",2.3
"after playing gta iv on pc, i had few expectations for the pc port of this game to even run. rockstar has really learned something though. i get a constant 45-60 fps on ~high settings with my 750 ti. and the game is great fun, so much to do. 10/10 best $60 ive ever spent (except for cs:go :^))",13.0
"this game is the only reason i would go back to console gaming, now theres no need. everyone needs to play it.",2.9
"bought it downloaded 50% realised i have a laptop regrets everything downloads 100% plays chanes graphics to 768p goes complete  changes to 1080p runs smooth af 100% worth it",39.2
"awsome game if you dont have it yet what are you waiting for?",49.5
"excellent port! after gta iv, i was concerned this port would be rubbish as well. so far, gameplay has been buttery smooth with no hiccups. i get 60 fps with little to no drops at high settings at 2560x1080. loading times to get into game are loooong, but with an ssd that time would probably be decreased. i havent had any issues at all logging onto gta online at all. my specs for reference: i5-4690k @ 4.4ghz, 2x gtx 770s @ 1200 mhz, 16gb ram, windows 8.1 pro, and game is running off of wd black 7200 rpm hdd.",19.2

"ok let me start by saying i have been playing pc games since cs 1.4-5 with mirc and cal leagues.. ive played alot of games. yes i seem to enjoy first person shooters the best (bf4) but also enjoy games where i can explorer and do what i want. this game does everything that all current games do.. its like 30+ games in one.. u really can do whatever. its the first step into a world like the movie gamer.. which can get interesting! as for gta, for me its like playing gta part 1 on pc from the top view, but super hd bad  graphics and lots of content. simply amazing!",16.5
"single player game is wonderfull, however, the online component suffers from crippling lag in more places than not. if you have even the mildest of concerns with your online stability, and are only considering this for the multiplayer components, you might want to consider passing....",15.6
"i cant recommend this game yet. in fact, if youre on the fence i strongly suggest you wait. the online play is horrible, and heres why: -it takes forever to load initially. -frequently it fails when you try to join a friend or crew member. -missions fail to load. multi-part missions even more frequently fail to load in-between parts. -whenever you finish a mission or activity (eg golf) it will return you to a world, but not the one your were in. if you were playing the activity with a friend/crew theres a very good chance you will be split up across worlds. -any time you join a world or activity, or leave an activity it will take forever to load. -voice chat just doesnt work for some people. -numerous other glitches, especially things failing to load. if you like constantly jumping around servers (worlds) and the accompanying loading screens this game is for you. everyone else should wait to see if they can alleviate these problems.",26.0
"so far so good. the game works and looks great on ultra settings. so far i have been having a blast!",30.8
"err_gfx_d3d_nod3d1x_4 this error.... this error makes me want to take a stick... and shove it up a woodcutter! but in all seriousness, this error wont let me play. it states that i either dont have directx 11 or my gpu is not compatible witth directx 11. this is absolutely not true. i have directx 11 and i have played so many games with it. this also means my r7 260x gpu is capable of handeling dx11. i really dont know what to do and rockstar wont even really attempt to help. i called, left threads on their forums, and nada. dont buy it untill they pull themselves together.",34.9
"this game truly is a masterpiece of modern gaming. it has been refined and refined to the point its at and it is glorious. it genuinely feels like a real living breathing city with immense attention to detail. the graphics are astonishing, everything feels smooth and clean. the gameplay is cinematic and addictive and the dialogue is some of the funniest i have experienced in a video game, i never skip a cutscene or dialogue. 10/10.",30.6
"this game is amazing! ignore the bitter people who are upset and clearly have mental issues. i have to admit that the game did take forever to come out, but its so worth the wait! the graphics the story and the multiplyer is well worth over $60 in my book. you could honestly play this game forever and there will alway be things to do....what other games can do that? (i still play all the old gtas still to this day...thats should say something.) loved the game! it going on my personal favs it lives up to the other gta games. one to keep on the shelf forever! thanks rockstar for making this beast game! pros: - unlimated game play. - easy acces. - great story. -awesome online. -free dlc updates. -sound track is new $ fun. - graphics realstic. - unlimited fun lol. cons: -delay of relase date. -little kids online. graphics - 10/10 story - 8/10 online 8/10 sound - 10/10 coustmer support - 10/10 **tips for the people who give this game a down vote or a bad review. your personal problems should not effect your review. either go buy a consle or buy a better pc that can run the game.**",91.4

"at the moment the console version is better there is alot of issues. i have never once played without some sort of issue. its either a graphic error, the game minimizing and not opening, randomely freezing but i can still hear sounds around me, or it wont even launch. 2 years and the only thing different is the number of players and the graphics its kinda dissapointing atm.",21.3
"i love this game. ive already played 44.5 hours of the game less than two weeks after it released. ive so far only touched the single player and im loving it. according to ingame stats, i have completed 65% of the overall game. ill start playing multiplayer very soon and im sure that will be just as fun as well!",56.9

"played alot of this on ps4... even better on pc. great optimization. that was pretty much the only worry on pc. millions of reviews have been out... the port is solid. able to remain above 40 fps always at 1440p maxed out with just a single 290. much better than anticipated. even shows you how much vram is going to be used as you adjust settings. great looking game.",12.4
"aside from the 10 hour 60gb download, the game is giving alot of people problems and rockstar is sitting on their asses counting money. i have put in a support ticket and followed up 6 times and no one has responded. the online freezes and crashes, a problem that many other people are having. on others forum posts, rockstar also has failed to reply. it seems as though they have absolutely no clue as to what is causing this problem prohibiting online and story play. totally unacceptable for it to be out this long and no patch for an issue making the game unplayable for some customers.",54.5
"i love the detail put into the game, from the characters, to the missions, and even the little things like stockmarket changes due to the missions you complete in-game. i would recommended it for what i mentioned above, but i still have big problems like everyone else. when i started the benchmark, it loaded the very first mission and the benchmark scene at the same time randomly switching between the two. i get massive fps drops randomly (down to 9fps typically), from walking down the street, to driving a car at moderate speed. ive even gotten some graphical glitches from time to time, for example a rectangular line of light appearing around my character, and it even not loading an entire area it spawns my character in making them fall through the ground. as well as other things. so like others i wont be currently recommended it. edit: also i thought i should mention that the money promised in-game for people who pre-ordered is only given to franklin.",46.2

"the best installation and port to the pc by rockstar games since max payne 3. they have learned from their mistakes and given us something that works great right after launch. the game is highly optimized than its counterparts and offers a lot of choices in terms of graphics settings which will keep the average pc gamer busy. for new players, it is extremely important to go through all the graphics settings as a misconfigured option could ruin the whole experience. otherwise, the game runs very smoothly and the online feature has no flaws. the only downsides in my opinion is the requirement of linking your social club account before you can play, and of course the massive 60gb filesize. but we live in 2015, games are bound to get larger, and hard drives will also get larger as standard. other than that, you are guaranteed to have the time of your life.",23.4

"great job rockstar spent a few hours getting around endless social club loading and finally the game started loading....forever....60 dollars for endless loading screens seems pricy",19.5
"because rockstar is so concerned about pirates playing their game its made it so that even though ive bought the game i cant play it. their support is very very limited and staff members dont get back to you. if theyre going to have online authentication there should be 24/7 chat support to help with any issue. edit - just found out that a bunch of their accounts got hacked. yay for leaked passwords and emails. now my account is locked out. yay i just paid $60 for a game i cant play.",1.8
"people say the online part of the game is boring considering the story mode. let me say you this, after completing the prologue, i thought i wanted to check the online mode a bit and maybe create a charater just for fun. now i cant leave online mode! its great. even the worse part of the game is incredibly fun and addictive. man, this is going to be a long ride... regarding to the performance; i know that the game kind of buggy on some systems but i have faith in rockstar that they will fix it eventually (maybe not in a fast way, though). its running on my system beautifully. even i dont have a high-end rig and playing with ok graphic settings, its a nice game to look at. i can probably continue this for pages so im just gonna leave it like this...you get the idea anyways...",53.7
"joined an online session and got run over by a tank. respawned and tried to rob a store and the shop keep shot me in the face as i left the store. listening to people rob stores and sing in the shower over mic at the same time is one of the weirdest things i have ever heard. game of the year.",62.6

"my pc is so good but i dont know why do i have lags i think it is bbecause i have some problems with dropped fps but i dont know why... :((( what can i do ? please help me!",22.1
"amazing game, rockstar obviously wanted to do the best delivery of a game they could and even if they didnt, that was achieved anyway but im sure they were. amazing graphics, better than any console graphics, 60fps makes it so much better and feel like youre actually there at times when youre in the amazing... 1st person mode! which you get on ps4 and xbox one anyway but still it looks way better on the pc. director mode makes it way better aswell because you can play as so many different characters and costumed characters which is alot of fun when bored in the game. definitely recommended (if you have a graphics card of atleast radeon hd 7770) but it might look alright on a lower one, but yeah definitely recommended!",16.4
"- preload failed causing a redownload. - framerate drops - stuttering - needs an update to fix major issues. - social club is a disaster for the game  the issues metioned above such as framerate drops and stuttering that i was having was fixed. i played around with the nvidia control panel in order to maximise the power use of the gpu and ingame settings i turned off vsync.  in terms of the preload it kept showing me errors through the unpacking phase causing me to miss the first day of play.  my fps stayed at a consistant 60 but sometimes saw huge drops reaching as low as 20 for a second.  i highly dont reccommned the game if you have a pc below the recommended requirements.",40.3
"i dont think anyone needs any introduction to this game so i will just comment on the port. the game runs perfectly at 60+ fps with all high settings with my gtx 970 sli. the new feature of having your own custom radio station that plays your music is a really great feature, just put your music files or shortcuts (both work) in the user music folder found usually at c:usersyour usernamedocumentsrockstar gamesgta vuser music. after putting the files just perform a quick scan in the in-game audio options and you are ready. my only gripe with this game is that it will be tied to your social club account and in case you lose the account then you wont be able to play the game anymore.",24.4
"pros: overall a great game for the pc. if you are used to how this game looks on the console, you will be blown away by the graphical improvements and the gta experience at over 30 frames per second. there are a rediculous amount of settings so you can customize the game to your liking. the controller support is also amazing since gta v provides a seemless transition from keyboard to controller. i personally use a controller for flying and keyboard and mouse for everything else. the game as a whole seems so smooth, driving especially. cons: you have to start nitpicking in order to find something about this game that isnt up to par. the obvious for me was the excessive time spent on loading screens. finding a gta online game is a pain since loading screens can sometimes take up a substancial chunk of time. joining jobs and heists also have the loading screens. in the end, i couldnt recommend this game enough. the game itself is among the funnest ive ever played with the graphical improvements over the console version making it even better! buy this game and you wont be sorry!",30.2
"amazing but why canr i aim right like its no aiming",50.5
"you have been waiting for 19 months? well, here the good new, youll have to wait only few more months to get this games bugs are fixed.",22.3

"first day had a few hickups as you would expect. but really came together and is rockin. love this game",39.3
"there is one thing missing...... hey niko, its your cousin! lets go bowling?",16.1
"its not a perfect game, but its a damn good one. the storyline and atmosphere might not be as strong as older titles in the series, but as far as gameplay goes this is definitely the most innovative game of the franchise. the cover system is kind of clunky (and this is disappointing considering that the cover system in max payne 3 worked pretty well) but you can do fine without using it. the guns feel like they have force behind them, the driving returns to the arcadey style of older gta titles but with more reliable physics, and the game world is so detailed and varied that not a single inch of the map feels copy/paste. is it worth the launch price of $60? thats arguable, but if youre looking for a fresh third-person shooter this is worth a look.",20.1
"the all-in-one game which includes open world roaming, heists, sports such as tennis & golf, racing and deathmatch. there is nothing more can i ask for.",46.4

"for those who wonder...the feeling is here. i never liked consoles and i ve been waiting for the game 2 years now. totally worth it... best gta game since san andreas era. the absolute digital playground!!!! 10/10.",20.2
"ive tried all the fixes, even reinstalled still clicking play launches social club and stays at loading the entire time. no word from rockstar at all about this problem or any of the other one tons of the community is having. seems like rockstar is more concerned with partying now that the pc version is released instead of fixing any of the day 1 gamebreaking bugs tons of us are having. thanks rockstar. update: well finally over a day after i installed iit, a few hours after reinstalling(didnt need to) i finally found the fix to my problem, installing service pack 1 for windows 7. i looked and looked and didnt find this solution anywhere, and im sure this solution fixes the problem for others. its too bad rockstar isnt trying to get this information out to anyone anywhere. further review of actualy gameplay coming",85.7
"i never played gta v on console but i have to say this game so far is 10/10 the game runs super smooth on all settings. obviously with better hardware you will get better performance in this game, but dont expect to be able to max all of the adcanced settings unless you are sitting on 2 x titan xs. story is really really fun the charachters are all very different from one another and have there own unique characteristics. map is really big, los santos is also really diverse so the ares are all unique and dont get boring with overused textures, vehicles, npcs. the driving in this game is really fun. there are plenty of fast exotic cars and bikes for you to rip through the city or kick it hard on the off road on a dirtbike or raised pickup. the game itself has a lot of personality. the npcs that walk around the city will all react to you and you will even be able to respond to some which results in some pretty good dialogue . ill add in a bit about gta online once i have experienced it all",26.7
"i love this game too much ,this is my favorite gameplay ever :)",61.6
"this comes with a whole package full of tv thats still better to watch and cheaper than your monthly cable/satellite bill. oh and game runs great!",28.3

"only the uttermost skilled players will join your heist and ofc they wont die at all after 5 secs in the game.. 3/4 would play again. quite funny, isnt it? game of morons award 2015 approved.",25.2
"owned this game for xbox 360, and the pc version is like a brand new game. so much more enjoyable on the pc. playing this at full settings with a gtx 780/ i7 4790k is just amazing. would buy. also, i would use a controller for this game.",29.2
"its awesome game and addicting,the city looks more alive than ever befor",83.1
"man this awesome. i already had excepted that i had to play this game on low-medium settings on my gaming laptop. but this game runs smooth as f!#$ on pretty much high settings. just once in a while, while driving it gets stuttery, because of loading i guess and probably my rigs fault. this is surely the best gta version out there. seems like i will have to call in sick for the next few months :d",19.7
"amazing graphics and game. few bugs on release, benchmark tool not working, fps drops sometimes, especially with lots of grass and trees around. early days, though, id hope these minor issues get fixed but so far 9/10! well worth the wait and effort from rockstar.",9.2
"stole a car as franklin and the radio was on east coast classics 10/10 not racist at all",4.5
"while i am still annoyed with rockstar and their numerous delays, this really is a fantastic game and worth the purchase. great dialog, great missions, the city is fantastic and the amount of stuff you can do is great and i look forward to trying online. my only real complaint is first person does not seem worth it. the guns do not work with iron sights and i do not see a distinct advantage to playing fp over 3rd person for much of anything except if you want more realistic pov for driving.",71.6
"i was going to write a bad review because the game kept crashing and my online character had zebra stripes. but then i noticed i had to update my nividia drivers. now the game runs perfectly and hasnt crashed yet! 97/100",68.4

"this is a psa regarding garages in gta online on pc be careful when putting cars off the street in your garage while you already have a car out. there is a glitch where the car off the street will replace the car you had out already, treating it as the same car but obviously without all the stats. this has happened on numerous occasions (a saber turbo i put in my garage replaced my fully upgraded armoured kuruma from a different garage because i had the car out at the time) the replaced car will have the insurance and sell value of the old car but will look and handle like the car off the street (not upgraded, base car) once again this is a psa regarding garages specifically in gta online where i have had this issue (might be effecting single player as well) just make sure your car is in the garage before taking cars off the street. thank you for your time.",43.3
"my computer isnt even a toaster and it cant run this game. its slighly better than the system requirements, and i can hardly play the game without rage quitting from the lag. i would only really recommend this if you have a great computer, otherwise i would wait until they fix the lag.",1.4

"one of the greatest games ever made just got even better!",68.5
"i have a few problems with this game... story- great storyline, no problems in my eyes. i love it. online- also great, if thats what your into. graphics- looks awesome, but shouldnt be as system straining as it is, considering what small porting of the map youre rendering at a time. i have an /okay/ build and get on average 30fps the in game chat is very confusing (also the bound key is poop but you can change it ofc) but you can never tell who is speaking! there is no on screen text telling you who is talking, leading to a lot of confusion and half the time in game, you cant see the persons name over their character. making friends when you dont know who youre talking to is quite difficult. now for the big one. half the damn userbase cant start the game, and rockstar is ignoring the issue. i bought the game just so i could play with my friends, and they cant even get to the splash screen. at the moment, do not buy this game.",51.4
"best crash (stopped working) simulator ever. 11/10 - would crash again. i was waiting for king 2 years .. then thats what happend... *waiting for the new patch* wp rockstar.",4.6
"i played this game for the xbox 360, and i can tell you that this is a huge advancement from the 360. the game looks absolutely beautiful, even with normal textures. adding very high shader settings definitely makes a difference. my only problem with this game is that the game crashes every 30 minutes to a hour. i do not know why. hopefully the next patch fixes it.",14.2
"a game that will no doubt provide incredibly memorable experiences from trying for an hour to get a sailboat over a bridge with a cargo bob to get it out of a lake only to find theres a second bridge down the line, to going through hell to steal a motorcycle from the lost but then finding out you cant keep their version of that motorcylce, to spending hours driving back and forth to get a car you want to spawn then seeing it all the damn time after you finally have it. despite the uncountable moments of blind rage this game has given me, its truly an amazing game with something to offer for everyone, so get it dammit!",39.4

"the fact that you dont have to listen to roman asking you to go bowling every few minutes should already be a good sign. provided that you have a decent enough computer, you should be able to run it quite nicely. when the graphics are turned all the way up the game can really look amazing. the controls can be a little wonky, but youre free to re-bind them to whatever key you want. (caps lock was the characters special ability button which was super annoying to reach) but in terms of how it runs on pc, i havent seen many glitches which is a really nice comparison to their 2008 release of gta iv.",17.4
"worth the wait. everything works, and you have all the pc options you can ask for. should be possible to tweak to suit both low and high end pcs. it is also an amazing game, ive played it on both ps3 and ps4 before getting it on pc. you cant go wrong with this game. buy it!!",23.8
"wow. rockstar is just pathetic. someone stole my code, while i was streaming. someone just saw my steam preorder bonus cd-key and used it on rsc, so they could activate the game. and they are playing. apperantly, i cant play the game, without rsc, when i enter it, it says, that the code is used. good job on the safety, steam and rockstar. good job. im not the only one who lost it, i have full proof, that i bought the game on games4you.lt and that it is mine, but rockstar or steam, cant write back, while doing something else. just lost 60 euros, which was really hard to get. good job... *sigh* *sad-face* *cry*",2.2

"when i was playing max payne 3 i was running the game on normal graphics it was still amazing and the framerate was perfect and smooth so i decided to get gta v so heres the good . 1.its on pc 2.it has gamepad support 3.achivement the bad thing about this game is that the map texture is messed up the game has framerate drops and glitches easily when playing gta online they dont have the assist aim which sucks also the keyboard controll sucks they need to update game to make run on low graphic easy and fix the framerate",5.0
"my review will change once im able to play the ing game.",1.4
"this game is just perfect. the graphics are amazing, and with astounding performance. my pc shouldnt be able to run max settings under and circumstances yet somehow i can and keep a very stable 60+ framerate. this game is detailed beyond belief, the developers put in every single detail, no matter how small they are and it adds the nicest touch to the game, making it that much better. the first person mode was done brilliantly. they went to the largest extent possible, adding in great animations and a variety of options. the options for first person go beyond the extent of some other fps games, adding in things like head bob control, and an fov slider, which many of the modern military shooters today simply dont have. get this game, its worth well above $60. the build quality on everything in this game is just amazing. the developers obviously put a lot of hard work into the game, and you should support them.",33.2
"this is the game we were promised when the ps3/xbawks versions came out. heists give everyone a reason and a way to get wealthy, the fps is acceptable for the pc master race, and the graphics have potential which exceed most mid range rigs capabilities. have not tried online for pc yet but heres hoping the community is slightly less.... aggressively stupid.... then the ps3s was/is.",54.7

"buyer beware: if you are an average gamer that does not have more than or eaqual to 3gb graphics card the game will look horrible, you must havea graphics card to play but it must be a spendy one because the xbox 360 verson of this game looks better then the pc version for me, im so sad i wasted $60 on this hopeing for better graphics but am now out $60 and very dissapointed.",27.3
"installing this piece of crap was a challenge. since launch ive had 3 random ingame crashes for no apparent reason. after this much development time they created the ultimate magnificent piece of crap that you can buy today for 59,99. i sincerely recommend gifting this game to your worst enemy.",22.9
"it is completely absurd that rockstar still requires you to sign into social club to use their games. absolutely ridiculous. i dont know my password. you know why? because social club is completely useless, and i only ever think of it when i have to look up my password every single god damn time i start a rockstar game. so i tried the passwords i thought of, and now im locked out.  off with this , rockstar. i dont want to use your ing garbage social service to play your game. i already own it on the ps4, and i guess ill keep playing it there since im already logged in.  you.",14.6

"ok, i edited my review because, after the new patch everything seems to work fine. it really sucks that when the launcher was crashing and i was unable to play, everybody just assumed that my system iwas  and i didnt know anything about computers when it was rockstars problem. steam support community doesnt exist. we should help each other, not critize everyone pcs, what a bunch of 10 years old, rockstar fanboys. saying that, the game is awesome and you should buy it right now. but you already knew that.",34.9
"played this on ps3 at release, yet it is a completely different game in my eyes. the graphics and the framreate change everything and make this game a game to contend with on the pc platform. also the fact that i retained my online stats and charecter is awesome. i have owned this about 30 hours and i already have 14 of them logged into this game. praise gaben",19.3

"amazing game, long awaited for the pc but it doesnt matter i thoroughly enjoyed playing it on xbox 360, xbox one and will do so on the pc until the next gta comes out, highly recommend, its not a horrible console port either its built with pc gamers and all kinds of rig builds in mind, for people who are skeptical my rig is i7 4790k, gtx 970, 16gb ram and playing with vsync on at 60fps constant on the highest settings possible @ 1080p, it will dip like most games but all i got was 50 at lowest.",18.5

"it is so addicting and fun that i cant let go of (good story,awesome graphic especially in pc :d ) it look and sound amazing not to forget the online of course (if you have a pc that can run this masterpiece just go for it you wont be disappointed)",67.6
"rockstar made me hype for this game three times they made me hype for the last gen launch and in the end it was ing awesome they made me hype for the current gen launch and in the end it was ing awesome and now they made me hype for the pc launch and yes its ing awesome",74.5
"you cannot write a review of a game and base it off of a launch error, every game nowadays has them and we should see it coming. however, the game is still great, and is worth buying once all issues are resolved.",26.6
"very disappointed with how this game is running. i preordered in jan. and when i got it on the 13 it would crash everythime i started it up and it got to the loading screen. its not my windows name, its not my graphics card. i spent 60$ on this game and if i dont see it working anytime soon i am going to be very upset.",2.0
"on my chest and call me nancy this game runs in fine!",22.5
"well, it seems rockstar did a good port this time, unlike they did with gta iv. i`m having no issues so far. the game runs great on my mid-range pc, and it looks way better than it did on my ps3.",10.1
"biggest piece of  ever! paid for it, spend 3 days downloading it as the servers used for preload are just crap and now i cant even play the ing thing. the gta v launcher crashes every time i try and run it. as i cant even play this game, rockstar needs to give me my money back.",0.9

"i think that it is extremely sad for these giant aaa games to come out in such terrible condition, this should not be normal. the fact that i have to disable my video card to get the game to launch then reenable it is extremely sad. once i get in game the singleplayer is fantastic, however when i go online public lobbies are great and so are the jobs, however once i leave or quit a job i get stuck on a loading screen and the screen freezes while i get the same sound looped over again, whether it is a seagull or a gentle breeze. its very annoying and the fact that as of the time i am writing this review rockstar has not even issued a statement is extremely dissappointing,i will hopefully be able to change my review for this game once it is patched. i would recommend waiting to get this game until it is patched, until then i cannot give it a positive review.",28.8
"was it worth waiting? yes is it awesome? yes is performance good?  yeah! 11/10",66.5
"now r* should go reskin san andreas and make it work this well on pc bring the graphics up to date and i would pay full price for that again. gta v is making me happy, i had low expectations after the last decades worth of r* failure. i was not going to buy the game. but i am glad i did. it works really well, plays very smoothly i have had no issues at all. only reason i stopped playing was to pop in my own music. now i am off to play again until i die in my chair from not eating or moving. good bye.",50.8

"grand theft auto, crash edition. i have a descent computer, but this game has crashed 5 times in two hours. ive adjusted the video settings to stupid low levels, and the problem still persists. until the game is stable,its no fun and nearly unplayable(thanks to no saves mid mission). stick to the console version, unless you enjoy playing the opening scene mulitple times ina row.",47.3
"so far great game! 10/10! at first i wasnt really into the whole 3 character story mode thing, but it eventually grew on me, and now i really like how the story is unveiled through different perspectives. it can also be a little confusing at first as to how to advance the story since theres sooo much to do in the game. driving is fun in this game too! each car handles a little differently and the first person mode makes it feel like another game in and of itself. online mode is also really fun. it goes without saying, but of course heists go much better when you have friends to coordinate with, instead of random people doing their own thing. not anyones nor the games fault, just something that is what it is, ya know de facto and all that jazz. so yeah, make your friends buy it too!!",41.0
"this is a really good game. ive not experience any bugs whatsoever.",74.0
"aqu4botz recommended 11.6 hrs on record posted: 13 april last year pre-ordering watch dogs was the worst decision. this year pre-ordering gta v was the best decision. the game floats like a butterfly, stings like a bee, runs so fast even console peasants can`t see.",44.8

"as someone who has played gta5 on ps3 and clocked many hours in it so far, id have to say that the pc version was definitely worth the wait. they could have released it in a state like gta4 was when it was finally brought to pc but they decided to polish it which im grateful for. so far ive clocked 69 hours (perhaps a little too much...) and every second of it has been wonderful. the only issues (that i personally have experienced) would be a large fps stutter when ive been playing the game for longer than 2 hours, however after restarting my pc it allows me to play for another 5 (i regrettably tested this last night...) tl;dr: fun game, restart pc if stutter. i now have no life. thanks rockstar, you enabler.",79.2
"ive seen reviews for the game, and i was pumped. until they pushed the game back months. it releases, finally! but then,it takes me another 3 1/2 hours to launch it. 3 1/2 hours to pre-load, another 3 1/2 hours to launch it. sadly, the game lags like hell. walking is bad enough, but driving?!... your fps, drives off a cliff. waste of $59.99 and time.",5.5
"2 years, 3 delays, one day downloading, 1 hour decripting.. but you know that was all worth it when you steal your first car in only 5 minutes. 10/10 gotygoty inbound. would scream to the world gta v console peasants again.",11.6
"what the actual  do you call these excuses for controls on this game? why have you not fixed the wanted level system yet? why are all these stupid- bugs that should have been fixed when the game was released a year and a half ago still happening? you say that you rushed the pc version at first, and we get this ?! this is ridiculous. i loved it at first, and now i regret buying this excuse for a game. maybe if it was $20 or something like that but no this game was 60 ing dollars, and becoming the worst 60 dollars ive ever spent yes the graphics look awesome. but the game still ing sucks. you shouldnt even waste your time playing online, itll only serve you to scream and make you want to throw a knife into every head at rockstar games",41.4
"i recommend this game to anyone who loves action and adventures and if your pc is not the best its okay because this game is amazingly optimized for any new gamer out their hope you enjoy this game.",49.1
"coming back to los santos for the third time and im still loving it. the pc version is the definite version, with its supreme graphic options, better performance and easier matchmaking. the controls work well for keyboard and mouse, but i can switch to my controller instantly if i feel like it. im loving it. had a couple of errors on launch day, but now its working fine for me.",47.1

"such a good game, its a shame rockstar treat the pc community like pure . games been out a year and a half on other platforms and they have the audacity to delay the pc release 3 times and still charge full price. a well made game but really rockstar have let themselfs down on their only good franchise.

"no idea how this is getting so many good reviews. this game freezes randomly which then requires a pc reboot every 10 minutes, with no fix in sight, this is a widespread problem with a large portion of the player base, just read their forums before buying this - wish i did. btw - my pc is also close to top of the line right now, with no issues with any other game since building it 6 months ago.",1.2
"great graphics and sound but overall story is just kinda boring and heists is almost the same thing everytime.",7.0
"a challenge to even get working, and when it finally works mouse lag makes the game near impossible to play. incredibly unsatisfied by this, and the people at rockstar should be ashamed that they have not fixed these problems yet. screw you i want my money back.",12.7
"its a huge step up from ps4 and such. the pc version shines with color and view. textures are amplified and crisp and even a low end gpu can handle most tasks. my gtx 780 runs everything maxed out at 60 fps now that is a deal.",8.6
"i remember that i accidently dropped my xbox 360 with the gta v disc in it. the disc broke and i couldnt play anymore. so i waited for pc. when i finnaly knew that it will came to april the 14th i was so excited. just the hype from the xbox 360 release. i really like this game, the graphics are amazing. it couldnt be better. i will continue to play this game and continue to enjoy it.",34.1

"doesnt matter what i say, the second i hit the dislike button this review will only be hated. gta online still needs more content, i dont find any enjoyment after the first 2 playthroughs of the single player and 1 hours of online gameplay which would have been way worse without playing with friends, all in all i feel like the online jobs need more variety and less loading times.",8.7
"this game truely is a masterpiece. game launched perfectly with no issues for me luckily. a must buy.",8.0
"when i launch the game, its says im playing then nothing happens and im suddenly not playing. no word from rockstar about a patch and none of the community fixes worked for me. i wouldnt purchase gta v until rockstar makes an official statement. although, from what ive seen on streams the game looks and runs great but the launch issues overshadow the good.",25.3

"who would say this is a bad game? sure, launch was messed up, but that happens. and yeah, there is a problem that kinda stops people from being able to play, but its extremely easy to fix. 10/10 game, would play all the time if i could.",56.4

"took me four days to get it working, but when i did, i was and wasnt disappointed. i was disappointed by the graphics and shadowing. the shadows for me at least, were pixelated and horrendous. the shadows went through typical textures and just was a massive turn-off. since there are so many shadows, its really hard to ignore them. they were so gross, i just had to stop playing. hoping that when i play it next, the game fixes itself. i know for sure my computer should be able to play it with ease. as it can play each other aaa game out there without breaking a sweat. but for some reason, gta v is just like lol,  you, suck my , i aint workin for you. the graphics, for me at least, were exactly like ps3/ps4, with no noticable difference. as the gta series is my favorite game series alive, i am going to recommend this. but, a lot of people have been having problems. so be wary when buying this game. you could  your pants on how amazing it is, or you could thrash your keyboard on how big of a waste of money it was.",1.8

"in the limited amount of time i have had to play this game i can confirm that the pc version for gta v has been far more enjoyable than the xbox 360 and xbox one version (mainly because just going on the console version i was always being killed by the level 300 guys when i was level 5, and the community was terrible). the 60 fps is beautiful and if i were able to play in 4k im sure i would be able to see the los santos skyline all the way from mount chilliad. a beautiful game that can finally discover all of its potential now that there are machines that can run it. 9/10 because it was delayed alot.",9.4

"this game is incredible! not only is it optimized for pc, but the graphics and pretty much everything have made the pc version a definitive version. however, there are a few quirks for this game, at least for me. also, keep in mind most of these problems are specific to online. first is that the stocks for bawsaq in story mode seem to be broken (not moving) for now, but i believe it will be fixed in a new update soon. the second is that transferred characters have a few problems on them, notably the lipstick problem. however, it can be fixed through a simple trip to the barber shop, but even then, it is an inconvenience. those are pretty much the only problems. overall, this game was worth the wait and delays, considering how polilshed it is. i do, however, believe that we will be seeing new features, as well as performance optimizations from rockstar in the next few weeks.",56.0

"gta in first person is the most immersive experience i have ever had. i even, stopped a couple of times noticing how real this really seemed. the single player is the samme but hey it was amazing the first time around, and im ready to go at it again. online felt a bit weird at first, public server to me are really boring, get missions with people driving everywhere like , jumping out of the car, shooting at nothing, not giving a f*** about objectives. so that really cut my immersion and made me think about this online thing but then again found somme good buddies and i play with them for real fun coop heists and stuff. i dont have to tell you how beautiful this game is, i run it at a steady 60 fps with max settings, it runs smooth as ever. no bugs no crash no nothing simply perfection. best pre-released purchase ive ever got.",30.9
"best pc gta ever! but really, this game looks absolute stunning and runs well even on non top end hardware. im running a gtx770 and even with the game telling me that its using 2500 out of my 2048mb vram it runs fantastically smooth. gameplay with mouse and keyboard is working flawlessly aswell. story is very well done and the singleplayer has a high replay value. online is just a joy to play. ( when the servers work(but i only had 1 disconnect so far)) id advise everyone that likes action games to buy this amazing piece of software. 10/10 recommended",51.2

"after a long wait, us pc masterrace folk have finally recieved gta v. not only is this a huge screw you to the console players, but this is a great step for us all. long live the pc masterrace. in all seriousness gta v for the pc is great. its alot more than just a port, it plays perfectly for me and exceedes my expectations. the graphic options make the game really come that much more to life, it plays and looks amazing. if you were on the fence of this being a good port or not like i was, trust me. its a good port. see you in los santos!",27.7
"game of the year? probably once again..:) btw i recommend to update drivers on your graphic card to avoid fps drops",29.7
"as of now rockstar has kept there promise of great version for pc and even though its insallation process takes a while, its all worth it once you get into this game.. people cant get mad over a install process its just going to take longer as we get into the future (for any game)..",22.1

"rockstar fix your ing game, the stuttering in this game is ridiculous, the way the textures are streamed is ed up, after 20-30 mins the game just starts eating more and more ram to the point that it starts using the page file memory instead.... there obviously a memory leaking issue, and alot of people are having the same problem no matter the brand or how powerful the rig is. based on multiple users configurations, i can safely without a doubt that your game is not optimized properly. 3 delays for more optimization my , release a patch that can fix this memory leak, after that then i might recommend this game, but for now. hurry up with a proper fixing patch.",40.9
"great port of the console counter-parts. there are things that could be polished up, but they arent, by any means, gamebreaking. the game looks unbelievable on max settings.",86.6
"i see all these great reviews of this game, and what i have been able to play of it i really like, but thats where the good things end. for the most part, i have to sit here and start and restart, start and restart just to get the game to work, and in the rare times that it does work, it only works for a short amount of time, so with that said i cant play it until they come up with a fix for what is wrong with it, and thats 60 bucks wasted. so in light of the fact that i cant play i cant recommend until rockstar fixes the crap thats wrong with it.",8.5
"so i bought the game, but havnt played yet. when i try to play online it keeps crashing. i tried every fix available and it still wont work...",37.4
"i was playing campaign in the prologue and when trevor hits the shutter switch and the door opens, there were no cops, cop cars, or the armored vans usually on the left. i tried and tried and tried and they will not show up. so i pretty much just wasted all my money on it.",0.6
"wont work with my radeon hd 7700m series despite it having plenty of power. if i try to use that card to boot the game it wont boot. 2 years of dev time for the port and it cant support a common card. nice.",2.0
"oh boy , this game is good but couldnt enjoy it at first since i had the launcher crash issue but now that i fixed even if it took away all my hype before the launch still enjoying it . for those of you how might have the launcher crash problem i followed this simple steps ; 1. open : device manager ( search it in the start search toolbar ) 2. go to the displey adapters 3. disable you nvidia card ( disable dont unninstall tho ) 4. open gta v while you did the previous stept 5. when social club pop up just re-enable yout nvidia crad worked great for me ,was a bit sceptic tho at the begining but worth trying with all the issues it has some minor bugs ,launcher crashand social club issues this game is still solid 9.5/10",32.3

"i dont have this game on console, so this is the first time playing. and needless to say, it is amazing!!!!!",58.8
"man, first person takes this game to another level. at first i thought it was poorly optimized, and have the rig to run it great. i soon learned all you have to do if you get stuttering, is alt+tab out and click icon back in. this has fixed all stuttering without lowering graphics options at all. gta v is a lot of fun, and was well worth the wait. 3 characters to control is a nice switch-up. good variation of missions. this game on pc looks way better, and runs smoother than the consoles. i would recommend this game to anyone who wants to take a hiatus from life for a bit heh heh. recommended!!",66.4

"its here on pc now, is it worth it? yes! rockstar did a great job with the graphics and the game looks great with lots of attention paid to details and evnironments. they also did a great job with bringing life into the characters. the game runs completely maxed 1920x1080 on my system with full antialiasing (i7 4930k @ 4.5ghz and a gtx 980 4gb with 32gb of memory) and i get 50-60 fps constantly. its really fun, a big improvement from gta iv. driving is a little tough at first, but once you get the hang of it, its much better than in gta iv.",38.1

"most gaming companies, especially ubisoft and ea, should take a lesson from rockstar on how proper optimization is done on pc games. very well executed rs! the delays really paid off and after a very long time i feel i got my moneys worth. what other company, nowadays, releases a game with such demanding graphics, which from day-one are fully optimized? which company spends actual time to release a polished product and values its quality first and foremost, instead of following the fast and easy money tactic? rs took its lesson from the gta iv clusterf@ck on release day and delivered a premium quality product. i run gta v with everything on ultra at a constant capped 60fps. finally a company that respects its customers and the glorious pc gaming master race.",31.1
"this game is soo perfect :d. seriously its rare to see so polished games. totally fun, totally amazing !!",21.8
"its a really good game. nice graphics. the graphics amaze me. but i have been getting random fps drops to the point where the game is unplayable. is anyone else getting those too or is it just me? i do have a somewhat pretty good computer. but even with the graphics down as low as it can get. i get around 50-70 fps but random drops to around 20-40 fps. maybe its just me. i dont know. anyway. excellent game as always rockstar. defiantly worth the wait. the computer is also an amd? i dont know if thats also a problem.",3.6

"by all accounts a good, well optimized game. the ui, controls are fantastic. the graphic options and graphical quality is exceptional, especially for the performance i get on low-end hardware. they really put a lot of work into optimizing this and tweaking the engine to perfection. far more than any company has anything else released in years. that is, if it runs at all. theyre dragging their feet about fixing the myriad of issues which plague many players. at this time i do not recommend buying it with a 50% chance that itll just crash repeatedly, either during the intial launch of the launcher itself, or during gameplay.",52.9
"i tried to move over to a wall on the building to climb over, but instead i turned and leapt off the roof. 10/10, would learn control system again",74.7
"i have changed my non-recommendation to a recommendation after rockstar released a patch to fix the issues in their optimized game. everything seems to be working fine now, so it appears ill be able to rate the games content in the future (if i remember) rather than the crashing i was experiencing.",26.9
"worth the wait. everything on highest settings stable @ 60~ fps w/gtx 780 im pretty happy with the game, it runs so well. heists is a lot of fun and is actually pretty hard. do you like gta? if yes, buy it!",72.9

"great game, stunning visuals! downside, horrible studdering after 30 minutes of gameplay.",55.1
"cant recommend this game due to its terrible state at the moment. to make the game run, i have to disable my nvidia card for the launcher to appear. then reenable the nvidia card as soon as the launcher is appearing. the game crashes about 50% of the time i try to launch it. online: messy interfaces with looong loading times and very unstable at this stage. the game itself, however is great: awesome graphics, fun gameplay, nice atmosphere and interesting characters. this game has a lot of potential and i will probably recommend this game at a later stage if the technical issues are resolved, since playing it is awesome. the game runs smooth(30-50fps) on my laptop (gtx 660m) with 1080p and settings medium/high.",13.0
"game looks great and runs great. i dont know who the main character is...or if there even is one. i started off as some white guy....somewhere along the lines i became black. i fully suspect and look forward to becoming asian but hope driving performance wont degrade. maybe i will even swap gender. gameplay is fun so far. best gta i have played. have not tried online. so far i have learned to steal cars using a tow truck. run over aliens. understand car flight physixs. and am trying to learn my way around the massive map. optimization is amazing. i have 3 1080p monitors and get 60fps on high settings. i was not expecting this at all. single gtx 780.",14.8

"its no longer just a game, its a experiance for the soul. i played gta v on the xbox since it first came out and this is quiet honestly the best experiance ive had with it ever since then, and ive had some great experiances. if you want a game where you can do pretty much anything you want and have it look amazing at the same time then this is a game you dont want to pass up.",10.7

"gta v for pc brings great framerate, better graphics, and lots of problems for some gamers. you can tell by the reviews. most (if not almost all) negative reviews are people having trouble launching the game. the positive reviews are full of people loving the pc version of the game. so buying it is a minor risk of will you be able to log in without problems or get stuck troubleshooting. for the moment. afterwards i can see most reviews turning positive as they enjoy the first person mode with some amazing graphics.",10.0

"i will not waste my time commenting how great this game is, as many people have experienced on the ps/xbox already. all i want to say is that unlike some heart-corrupted devs, rockstar did a great job in game optimization on pc. even a low-stat old-fashioned pc like mine could run this game smoothly. gj rockstar! 20/10",76.4

"it is a great game but i have had many problems. i run a amd fx 3850 cpu with a nvidia 660 gpu. i believe that is the main problem. the game does not even start as well. but when i go on my laptop it runs ( i5 with nvidia gpu). i dont think that the windows account name is the big problem, i believe it is hardware compatiblility issues !!! fix it rockstar !!!!!!!",19.5

"well, a got a bad luck and i think all this great dev should be more attencious about their games before their let it availible. i got a issue with the game launch and, yes, i did all the steps trying to fix something that i couldnt. to be more specific, my issues were: 1- i cant launch the first screen ( social club ), when i thought it would works it crash. 2- my serial was duplicated. 3- it was missing one .exe file on the folder and i couldnt execute it as admin. 4- i play on laptop and i read that almost every laptop users got problems with the game. therefore, my negative reviem is just because i couldnt got to play it and it was kind of frustrating to not be able to play with my other friends... now im the black sheep of my friends group (lol). for those who bought the game and it doesnt works as well, you can reclaim your money if you want. i did it and when the devs launch a fix i would buy it again.",0.3
"ill leave this negative until i get a fix. doesnt start my game, just keep pressing retry button and nothing happens.",44.7
"14 hours in, im enjoying the game. main characters are strangely likable and interesting. gameplay is more or less like iv, but smoother in some respects and missions where you can switch between characters become a lot of fun. the special abilities do seem just a tad overpowered at times though. port seems good. im not running it quite maxed out and have the occasional frame rate hiccough in certain circumstances, but it isnt anywhere near bad enough to say its not a good port. if anything, it could do with the settings menu being less annoying to navigate. the intro movies could also do with being skippable after first launch, they get very annoying when playing with settings that require a reboot. i have experienced a consistant bug with the benchmark going crazy and failing a mission halfway through (it seems to start a new story mode at the same time or something) (pc gamer had the same issue), which made setting up a bit more of a hassle than it needed to be.",74.5
"this is a great game it hasnt been out for 24 hours yet and i have loged nearly 12 hours of gameplay so far (that should tell you something) i run this game maxed out on 60 fps. let me just say this game looks better than i could have imagined it. the game is pretty optimized (i will be getting a controller just for flying and driving) i had no issues during install. the 17 month wait was well worth it. 10/10 would buy again!",53.8
"not sure why i spent $60 on a 2 year old game, but thats a different story. pros: there was a lot of time spent on the game and that shows with the detail in the landscape. fun missions. interesting characters. lots of replayability. cons: there is nothing smooth about this game. nothing functions as it should. same old gta physics. you cannot customize expensive cars without purchasing them. you cannot steal a nice car and claim it as your own, despite the title of the game being grand theft auto. the community is awful. you cant do anything without a rude player killing you or harrassing you.",20.2

"it is a great game very fun and ive read a few negative reviews saying it crashed as soon as i started it up. well my solution is read the min specs before you buy a triple a title game your computer probably doesnt have the specs to run it and if thats not the case if you have a nvidia card you can get some drivers for it that make it run a hell of a lot better. i also had some problems with social club here are some options 1.make a new social club until rockstar fixes it 2.reset your password and email and sign with those new credentials on a rating scale of 1-10 id give grand theft auto 5 for the pc a 8.5/10",10.7

"tried all fixes; the game does not start. hardware is over the recommended specifications. the most expensive desktop icon ive ever bought, but at least it comes with a free 61gb of useless data, just in case youre not enticed by the desktop icon alone. edit: completely uninstalling firewall fixed the issue. changed the recommendation to yes, even though this fix shouldnt be necessary to play the game. game itself is 10/10",69.4
"game is amazing! so much fun and have zero issues. looks and runs amazing in 1080p 60fps. sorry for those that cant play but you should reserve your negative reviews untill you actually play it. getting pissy in a negative review on steam isnt going to help your problems and you are just bashing an otherwise amazing game. this game is a must buy!!",43.0

"this game has been out for years now, so you should already have a good opinion on the game and its gameplay. the main thing people worried about was optmization, because gta 4 was a disaster. however, i am glad to say that so far this game is very well optimized. i am running this with a gtx 970 and i am never below 60 fps on highest settings.",12.7

"for 40 you get tons of content, main story missions, tons of side quests and just things to go see and do. the editor is just friggin amazing, if you not used it or even tried it its a must (other companies can learn from this no question). the online content is another game entirely that give you the opportunity to experience gta pvp (like only rockstar could), working co-op to pull of heists (this imho is the biggest seller for online) that are both challenging and rewarding, or go deathmatch, car racing even just shoot another player after you done a heist and take his/her loot as well (ah betrayal always good! no honor among thieves!). there is nothing more to be said really except its a must to have on your shelf or steam library & i look forward to mugging you every opportunity! ps - only negative point i can make is wish i could make a transfer of funds from game bank to my real life bank, come on rockstar share some of those billions with yer investors ^^",18.9

"despite the plenty negative reviews on gta v, i honestly think that those who did post a negative review were just dissappointed that they werent able to play as soon as it was released. sure there were some problems that many people encountered, but with a game this big, problems are bound to come and go. i havent encountered too many problems and so far the game is beautiful. ive played on the ps3 and the pc version is so much more detailed and thoughtful. there are things that boggle me still to this day. best game to play with friends, and overall you dont need to think twice on buying this game, the problems will ultimately be fixed as rockstar do not want their reputation and expectations to drop.",42.2

"oh boy,gta v on the pc the textures,the fps everything so perfect but the best thing about this game is that its actually fun driving around los santos mountains with your friends on an pick up truck driving around the city while your friends shoot out of the windows killing some noobs flying a plane across the map with your crew and jumping out to skydive robbing a bank to get some money to spend on hookers the list goes on and on baby",41.1

"for once, this is the first pc port i have ever bought for $60 to say that it was well worth the full price. game runs smoothly and i havent run into any major glitches so far on launch day. however, if you have a crappy pc, dont expect it to run well whatsoever. ive noticed this with some reviewers complaining that the game had limited video settings and bad lag just because their video card didnt have enough vram or their processor wasnt good enough to handle the load. aside from the windows user account name bug, the game is great. tl;dr: game is shiny and smooth, 5/5 would delay again.",31.8

(hell, you should have gotten it back in 2013, !) game looks amazing, but the sound effects for the guns are terrible, unfortunatly...",40.5
"this game is what i wanted it to be. the single player is long enough for it to be enjoyable, and the online mode seems to be really good. the heists mode is like an improvement for payday 2 where there are a couple of bugs not alot though. you should get this game :)",46.8

"i pre-ordered grand theft auto v back in 2013 for the xbox 360 and i pre-ordered it for the pc this year and i dont regret buying it. i played the console version of this game, and it was incredible, loved the storyline, the features, the online mode, everything, even though i hate playing on consoles. i played it few minutes after the game release, a long with my buddy i was the first few thousands to launch this game. i played the game, its incredible! go buy it, do it. exploring san andreas in 60 frames per second in high resolution feels wonderful. what, youre still reading? what are you doing here? go buy the game!",75.9

"this game is the best grand theft auto i have ever played. (and one of the best games i have ever played) i played it on xbox 36 originally but compared to pc that fealt so stripped down to what it really is and im seeing that now. the story isnt the best ever but it has some intresting characters like trevor, a very well acted out psychopath. the gameplay is great however atleast for me the starter keybinds are a bit wonky. lots to do esspecially if you have never played it before and its your first time playing it ever. the graphics are amazing on almost any graphics level to be honest and its a pretty stable game. the only issue is that for windows users the game tends to wanna crash and have issues. however rockstar did say they would eventually fix this issue and so other than that this game is fantastic.",59.8
"day one issues happen with almost every game. i didnt experience any though. pc gaming takes patience guys. this is the most emersive game in the series by far. there is a lot of world building decent story and fairly exellent gameplay.",27.8

"runs very nicely on my i5/r9 290 machine. a lot of people reporting various problems on opening day, but my install and day 1 gameplay (both story mode and gta online) went off without a hitch. looking forward to how well this game will look as further optimization and bug fixes come along. this is the way gta was meant to look. as far as the gameplay goes, im fairly new to the gta universe and i did my first online heist today. good fun. recommended! edit: dont forget to update your gpu drivers! both amd and nvidia have made adjustments for this game!",60.4
"right, so you can disregard a majority of the negative reviews on steam for gta v since rockstar has recently rolled out an update to fix issues related to their launcher, and just go right ahead and click purchase on one of the best (if not the best) games released. theres a reason that metacritic score is so high... ;)",23.7

"the game itself is great. i expected to be able to at least run it on minimum settings and for the most part its reasonable. still looks better than console with shadows being the only issue. the glitches and speed of launch/ loading will probably be fixed soon. it does freeze up a bit luanching the game but i just get a snack and its loaded when i come back, probably 2 minutes at most. gameplay is fantastic, i love the story (never bothered getting it for console) and there are so many interesting things to do in the game world. if you are very impatient and expect a lot from your setup, maybe wait a few weeks for the glitches to pass. but if you can handle a bit of lag, a few glitches, and dont care too much about flawless performance, definitely buy this ultimate edition of gta 5",57.5

"to sum it up pretty short, it was well worth the wait and was sure worth buying the game twice, first on 360 then pc. four hours in on launch night and it is running flawlessly, at well above what gtav says i should be running it at as well (memory warning in settings with 2gb gtx770). the first person view is awesome, constant 60+ frames is awesome, the extra detail combined with extended view ranges is awesome. this release is just awesome all around.",35.2

"im very positive about this game, we all know whats good about it. still some points that need attention: - combat is quite bad (especially if you played a lot of shooters) it feels clunky, slow, weird hit registration, annoying movement. - first person mode is a bit of a flop. it could have been made a lot better. - interface and keymapping is bad, just like any console port. having to press enter or moving your mouse to a small corner to confirm something doesnt work smooth. it just feels slow like on a console. (played gta5 on xbox360 for about 200 hours) combat was actually better on the 360, felt way more fluent.",20.4
"i have to addmit i was dissapointed with how badly this games launch went for me (not that i wasnt expected some sort of issue), my game wouldnt even launch. but once i found a fix and got round the issue and can realy recommend this game. it is a big step up from gta iv. the campaign is great and the multiplayer is even better. if you are having issues with this game stick them out, it will be worth it in the end.",76.6

"rock solid performance, sp rocks, mp even better. buy it now.",33.7
"the port for this game is down right amazing. running on an i5-3570k with a gtx 660 ti i am able to get a smooth 60 fps with medium-high settings. obviously the best way to play this masterpiece.",22.7
"i love this game sooooo much, gonna keep putting hours into until my life is wasted. just buy it! dont hesitate anymore! also one of the most optimized game ever, not a single crash while im playing.",78.9
"this game gives you exactly what you want in real life. the ability to kill a random colored person on the street and then hide from the cops behind a trash can. 10/10 would kill again.",18.3

"gta5 is an open world game with a great setting: a living and breathing city, the music, the npcs and behaviour. all that with stunning graphics. crisp and clear at 60 fps lots of gamemodes, from sp story mode, and freemode, and ofcourse online. so much to do, so much to see. you can rob stores, steal cars, race cars, kill people, rob banks, dive and fly, get street hookers in your car, visit nudie bars and look at . what more do you really want? really, after a lousy day at work there is nothing better then beating the  out of some people with a baseball bat in gta5. driving feels great, and for pc gamers the controls are so much better now. 10/10!!",47.2
"fantasic and emersive game, i just cant stop playing. not encountered any bugs so far, and it runs very smooth on my comp. gtx 770 and an old i5 proc runs it above 60 fps with some settings reduced to high.",40.4

"i have this on console and i decided to buy it on here because i wanted to play it with friends. i must say it is a great game and the first person gameplay is amazing, from doing missions down to the team deatmatch! this is a must buy even if you have played it on console, pc version outshines console. 10 out of 10 rockstar!",32.9

"rockstar did a great job, i wouldnt even call this a port from consoles. just an entirely new version of the game. i am able to run it with a 3770k + gtx780 at 4k and get ~50-60fps maxed out, i enabled sli for my second gtx 780 and i am running at over 100fps (90-144) with both cards. the first person mode + drunk is amazing when driving because you actually get the holy  im about to  up moment. but overall, i have only crashed one time due to driver issues, but so far so good. r* is one of the few game developers who still actually give a crap about pc and the optimization in this game running at 4k is amazing. all other game developers should feel shamed.",19.6
"this is pathetic excuse for a launch of a game. i recommend only buying it when the ing servers actully work. well another billionare game company managed to  up another launch",10.9
"holy balls, is this port good. essentially a mirror of the console versions, but with aa. brilliant gameplay, awesome graphics, wonderful and lovable characters, and a bit more realism. now, instead of in gta iv where your car could be a flaming husk and work just fine, vehicular damage actually effects performance. the only downside to the increased traffic and pedestrian activity is the downed car damage. maybe ramming an armored truck from the back at full speed in a sports car should do a bit more than a dent on the front. otherwise, i have no qualms. tl;dr: awesome. great succession to gta iv with a better story and likeable characters. graphics and gameplay are amazing and the cars actually work. 10/10 - ign",20.3
"the best just got better! one of the most iconic games to ever exist.",55.5
"this has been in the works for so long o hardly think it could be called a port. r* did an amazing job on this. pros optimized well good keyboard controls loads of graphics options rebindable keys rarely crashes and no game breaking bug, even minor bugs are minimal cons get disconnected from games a lot (this could be just my internet tho) tl;dr- the game is good, i recommend reaading not just my review because im no professional review writer",59.4
"this one is up there with the greatest video games i have ever played. there are so many things to do in los santos, and so many ways to do them. every single mechanic in this game is impeccably polished, and feels great. this is the most convincing open world i have ever seen, and really immerses you in a way that no other game has before. the fact that it can run so well on even mid-range hardware blows my mind. this is the one and only game that i would recommend for a $60 price tag - it feels like a steal compared to many other full price games. pick it up as soon as you can, you need to experience it to believe it.",17.6
"thank you rockstar for not bull shiiting us. this makes us pc gamers really happy and crave even more for it. it is greatly appreciated. in the end, not every company are butt holes towards their customers. as they had said, the game is optimized for pc and it doesnt even require a high end pc to play it. i am very happy with my pre order purchase. :) p.s fu ck those rushing games or just delaying them to give us a version that still is crappy!!!",45.2

(i still wont recommend amd tho) everything else with the game is just great! apart from the fact they have have made modding very hard which sucks. over all i would recommend this game to anyone or everyone!",26.8
"this game is superbly ported. if you havent played it on pc, then youve never truly played the game the way its meant to be played. i am surprised of how this game run incredibly smooth and it just look amazing!",79.6

"after launch and when it was done unpacking it was difficult to get started, but once i got it working i couldnt stop thinking, holy **** this is great. i would recommend to anyone with a decent desktop, even my budget pc can run at a smooth 30-40 fps.",46.4

"its a great game if you have a spare pc you dont need for anything else, after install my pc went from 4 seconds upstart to 5 min, impossible to use coz harddisk is in 100% use (and yes i know how swap works and checked it). also my browser is 100 times slower to use and i need to restart firewall to control it now. my new pc is now acting like a 2001 pc. this game works like a virus, but its a great game dont get me wrong.",38.3

"you must install correct drivers in order to even start. the game already has glitches, you cannot push esc or it will auto close down and try to reboot in safe mode. secondly when you go to take covor the game will freeze and you cant move to covor, the bots will just stand there doing nuthing. i bought this game to add to my collection soon to be all gtas...i do not reccomend buying this outrageous expensive game, sold my gut knife on csgo for this....",8.9
"gotta love a game that crashes all the time :/ its one of the best games on pc atm i find, but that only when it actually runs. im running this on a good machine with sli and everything, but no dice. ive dropped the settings too but nothing, it will still occasionally crash. hope theres a fix soon. atm i cannot recommend this game.",21.7
"grand theft auto is a video game thats based around its title. its a open world game based on american satire and crime you play as four characters for the sole goal of retriving the american dream. the four characters include you, a online character that takes place before the events of the three other characters. you can get drunk, get high, have sex, crash, die, become a terrorist, take selfies, die, have fun, buy a house, make yourself your american dream. now lets get serious do not play this game unless you have the absolute requirements, minimal isnt enough, even slightly above minimal. this is a next gen title that i expected it would play perfectly fine, but it nearly didnt play at all during my first time playing it. i highly recommend to invest on buying a ton of upgrades, and this game. at the same time. its a fun game i enjoy, and you should take a look at it too.",13.9

(1) the game actually has a fairly interesting story. i find myself not skipping the cut scenes for the most part. (2) being able to switch between characters is really cool. (3) fps!! first person mode is really cool. i like being able to switch when i want (4) graphics. wow! the game looks so pretty on my 5820k/gtx980 combo. (5) smooth. the game feels so smooth at release -unlike watchdogs which is still a buggy mess. (6) the game will still provide hours of entertainment even after you finish it. conclusion. it was worth the wait. but, with all of the money they have made, they better hire some more people so that gta vi gets released on all platforms at the same time, like every other normal company does.",36.9

"yes, i would recommend this game. a couple things first. (i can only vouch for amd) the game is not optimized for pc yet. it crashes randomly, i get ballz fps drop when driving, flying, ect (i have an amd 6970 in crossfire. thats 4gb video memory) around 30-45 fps, and the graphics option and advanced graphics options dont really give that much. it needs more options and locations on how to change this. i cant even edit it manualy through the file browser in windows where its installed. i love the cut scenes and story mode but if the game isnt optimized i cant even play it! rockstar please fix this. i know its all softwear sided. many pc gamers have been waiting forever, including me, for this game to come out and the least you could do is make it run smooth.",63.4

"grand theft auto 5, well.. first of all its a brilliant game even for being two years old on the consoles, its definatley worth the purchase, if you have a couple of friends too, this game becomes too fun! i have spent too many hours laughing really hard that my jaw starts to ache. so yes, i highly recommend this game! so the downsides to gta v on the pc that i have found so far. unexpected game crashes - yes i have the latest drivers. random fps drops.. that could be just me but for some reason my game runs at a nice and steady framerate then all of a sudden drops to 1-3 for like 4 seconds and then straight back to normal. final bad point that i can think of, the servers, even though a couple of my mates and myself have a decent connection, we still find that they are bouncing all over the roads when doing races. the same for ai traffic too! overall, i rate this game a 8/10 and would highly recommend buying this game.",23.2
"love the game so far! i havent noticed any problems yet.it just took some time @ the launch of the game. im running it with msi gtx970 and a i7-4790 with 16gb ram. really amazing graphics and game! i recommend it :) 10/10",22.1
"great game but the damage model for vehicles is a huge step back. compared to gta iv every car is a tank now as it can take so much damage. further more it is now impossible to deform a cars roof or its doors. this is a huge malus for me as i loved finding creative ways to demolish my car in gta iv.",44.6

"excellent game. when it works. pc version crashes alot. sometimes when im just standing still in my apartment doing nothing. suddenly windows stops working. game play is amazing when i can play it. i am patient enough to wait for them to fix it. excellent game if you can handle the errors till they resolve them.",22.3
"took about 45 minutes to decrypt the game once the release time hit. and here we go again, another time devouring game. so far so good, no issues running the game and getting started. runs great on a 3770k with nvidia 770 gtx sli @ 2560 x 1440 with asus rog swift g-sync. not a fan of making a rockstar account and finding my name taken by someone years ago. this rockstar drm requirement is encumbersome and shouldnt be a requirement for steam version. pro-tip install this on a ssd, will make installation much faster and gameplay much better. will update when i experience and discover more, but so far lots of fun.",14.1

"had fun with what little i was able to play the online mode. not going to recommend this game due to its poor support and time wasted by me troubleshooting unknown errors that did not lead to being able to play this game. downloaded the game, was fast 59gigs~. 1 to 1-1/2 hrs tops installed and started the game. no issues at first through the story requirement portion. once i obtained access to online play, the entire game has gone belly up. upon starting the game: 14x its not made it past the loading screens, 10x its crashed mid game, 18x its crashed randomly. ive tried everything from rechecking my drivers are current, automatically manage paging file size adjustment, dx10/dx10.1 toggling msaa, setting all gfx settings to the very lowest, r* create a second user profile with basic characters, restarts, and closing the launcher once the game is open. i run a i3 4630 3.6ghz, 8gb ram, r9 270x... which are all above the mark for running this game. i suggest steering clear overall due to r* poor release of this game.",12.8

"i played and finished gtav for ps3 on initial release, and purchasing on pc was a tough choice for me. after two days of playing, i cant say i regret purchasing it twice. the game is optimised really well, even for those who have to run it with low settings, the first person mode is addictive and gives the game a new feel, and overall it really does feel like the definitive version. note: some people have trouble with frame drops at the moment and with rockstar social club, which disables them from playing. this will most likely be fixed, but no problems for me as yet, and online seems to work fine.",60.7

"this game is truly worthy of waiting for the amount of delays, i play put many of hours into this game. i admire rockstar for their effort putting into this game and i know for sure that this game will live on for many of years with continuation of mods and dlc. this is truly a great port but be ware of the performance for those who using under minium or recommeded, it will eat up all your vrams and ram.",30.8

"what can i say? its the game that ive been waiting ever since i finished it on ps3 1.5 years ago and rockstar didnt disappoint me. the game is obviously great, which we already knew since its been out for so long, but the way they made it for pc just stands out. it looks fantastic, runs smoothly and should run well even on some mid end pc. if you have not yet played the game on the consoles, then id suggest you to buy it. and if you already own the game on one of the old generation consoles, then i would still suggest you to buy it. not only it looks and runs much better, but you also get the first person view and quite a bit of exclusive content thats only available for the returning players. i have not tried the gta online on pc yet, but id imagine its better than on the consoles, where its already great.",40.7
"well, i guess it is like all the rest of the gta games sp atleast, and if you like the other games you will like this... me however i have tried the mp and it is beyond s**t imo, im glad a friend of mine bought it for me, becouse i would not put a cent of it in to this game, not even 2 hours in it and im fed up with it already.",1.9

"after watching the positive pc port report video totalbiscuit made i figured gta v would be a great pick up, but unfortunately i ran into so many issues rightaway that i ended up requesting a refund which was still an option due to the other problems the game had. issues i had: - jerky/laggy mouse movement in the menu. changing vsync or mouse input didnt help. - settings didnt save after quitting the game and restarting - display calibration screen on every start - benchmark crashed to desktop after a 3 minute black screen - fps tied to sensitivity (not this crap again, sigh) i run a i7-4790k, 16 gb, r9 290x machine and from what i could see from my short experience, the actual framerate ingame is fine so performance seems ok otherwise. this is the first refund ive ever requested and im glad it was still an option. fully priced games, in this case even more, should always have an option for refunds to avoid these sorts of things. one thing steam could learn from origin. i hope they patch the game and fix all these issues because i am certain the underlying game is brilliant, but i just cant support it while theres so many problems before even getting to the actual playing part.",0.8

"this payday 2 dlc has it all... masks, guns, gun mods... it even took the concept of driving cars from that one heist no one liked and expanded on it, adding an open world, bank heists you have to actually prepare for (sadly theres still drilling, but at least they improved that too!), the list goes on. its even got mindless pvp for those that just like to hold w and the left mouse button all day and think its a game. overall, a bit pricy for a re-mastered version of the original game, but well worth it when you realize it includes all of the dlc, weapons etc., with a streamlined level process that takes all of the rng out of unlocking your favorite items. bonus: it still has the kawaii mask.",55.0

"you dont need mine or anyone elses opinion on why this is the best game that ever was, instead ill use this space to give you guys some troubleshooting info: game wont start (win 7) - make sure you have service pack 1 installed (win 7) this fixes most social club issues. - make sure you have the latest drivers. - .net framework 4.5 is required - disable antivirus and firewall for installation low fps with good hardware - turn of high res shadows - take postfx down a notch - use fxaa only for very high end systems (980, 780ti, 970, 290x etc) - watch the memory meter for vram, when setting up game, and add about 20-25% to get a real number of vram usage. - push settings up, one thing ive noticed is game runs much better when pushing the hardware. happy gaming",39.7

"problems i currently have with gta 5 - loading delay when the game launches - resolution changing from fullscreen to windowed - built in benchmark program does not work properly - graphics stuttering, especially when driving - some textures and objects loading at a slow pace which result in blurred images on the screen ive updated to the amd experimental drivers for gta 5, which helped a lot. im disappointed in amd, they need to make better drivers and churn them out at a faster pace for big game launches. switching to lower graphics improves the fps, but doesnt remove the stuttering. so once again im in this waiting game for bug fixes. the sad thing is this is rockstar games best port they have done for the pc recently. both max payne and la noire had more problems at launch, but eventually those games ran very smooth for me on high settings. shame on rockstar for the mediocre port, shame on amd for the mediocre drivers, and shame on me for pre-ordering again from a publisher with a history of pc launch problems. this game is great, ive played in on ps3 and i really want to play it on pc and change this to a positive review :(",2.3

"worst launch ive seen yet, i cant even play the game i ve payed $60 for yet. i have to wait for rockstar to fix it. such a dumb error. i wonder what they are going to do to make up for all of us who cant even get passed the launcher. 1. it took 30 minutes to link social club to steam, because of a login error on their end. 2. finally got past that, now i cant get past the launcher, it crashes every time. 3. now we have to wait for who knows how long for a fix. this sucks rockstar!",4.1

"i played gta v/online on console and aside from a rocky start with updates and bugs and connectivity issues, the game played great. i loved the easter eggs, i enjoyed the off-line story mode. and the online mode was great, even as a vanilla game with no dlc or updates the game had so much to do: racing, darts, tennis?, golf, parachuting, base jumping, deep sea diving, the list goes on. i felt the graphics for this game were about par as far as gta games go, they slowly keep pace with the times, the graphics werent mind blowing, but they were very decent. as far as support goes, rockstar is currently reviewing a ticket i submitted regarding a few bugs, and things seem to be moving in a positive direction. do not rate games on their glitches and bugs, rate the game. and i give this game a very good rating. now if the bugs and glitches are not fixed, my rating will unfortunately change, as i am rating this game under the assumption that those bugs will be fixed sooner rather than later.",19.1
"this is a very well made game; however, at the time of this review, the gta online portion sucks...it is really laggy and there are some major sync issues. i havent had any problems with the single player though. i hope they continue to patch it so that he multiplayer is not shoddy, and i think they eventually will. rockstar isnt going to give up on us. its just disappointing since it took them two years and 3 delays to release it. there is no real good excuse other than they are new to doing this online for pc. anyway, fun as hell. never had so much fun doing a burnout on a hookers face, and you can do it in 4k too!",26.8

"like the developers said, gta 5 on pc is basically ultimate edition. -beautiful graphics (if you got the right graphics card) -awesome gameplay, even for returning players -first person -rockstar editor mode which allows you to play as multiple characters that were originaly npcs (non playable characters) and you can use rockstar editor mode to, you guessed it, make videos! -online can have 30 players instead of 16 (i think 16?) -character customization for online is much more unique and fun -you may transfer your characters from online if you had older versions of gta 5 -who doesnt want to play gta 5 on their desktop? biggest dissapointment is that you cannot play offline. if you have horrible internet that shuts off ocasionally, do not buy this game. buy better internet first. trust me though, the game is well worth the money, even if you have to spend more on internet and possibly a better graphics card, its a very very good game. and this is coming from somebody who has already played the game for almost 2 years on console. overall, 8.7/10 sucks that you need a pricey graphics card to run on full graphics, and i wish we could play it offline :(",13.7

"all these negative reviews are people complaining that they cant run the highest settings on their laptop or some  with social club. man it really doesnt take a genius to figure either of these things out. it runs fine on my computer. social club works fine. its a huge open world so i didnt expect to be able to handle the absolute highest settings but the game still looks phenomenal without them. and its the most fun ive in a gta game to this day. my only complaint is the first person fov but someones already made a mod for that.",82.5

"rockstar has made no attempted to fix issues with the games launcher system. currently does not work for lots of users edit* after about 3 hours of installing things, going through forums and checking game files the game started to work, though it shouldve at the beginning. the game is visually stunning even on some lower resolutions and the character switch function, although locked for the tutorials, is super fun to mess with",2.7

"although i had to reinstall after pre loading, the game ran beautifully and had little to no problems at all. so far, i have only had problems with the resolution not saving on startup, but i was able to fix it. other than that, this game is practically perfect, and i would reccomend it to anyone who enjoyed watch dogs or just cause.",29.9

"as i am writing this, some people are reporting issues with launching the game due to an issue with windows user names. unfortunately, i cannot speak for them. my experience, however, has been perfect. this game runs silky smooth on my computer, which has a i7 4770k and a gtx 980. i am running at 1080p, 60 fps and maxed out settings. i do not have a 4k monitor, so i dont know how well it runs in 4k. there is no doubt in my mind that this is the definitive version of the game. after 1 1/2 years, we finally get to see los santos the way it was meant to be seen. and thats just the graphics. my favorite thing about this port is that it doesnt even feel like a port to me. it runs like it was meant to be played on pc. the addition of the clip editor and director mode adds a whole new level of depth to the gameplay. the director mode allows you to use characters from the game. many are already unlocked, but some have to be earned through gameplay. that already sounds like so much fun, and thats before mods. which will make this game perfect.",55.1

"i know, i know, this was just released today. however, i was hoping that, with the release date being delayed twice, that gta v for pc would run well. but, of course, it didnt with the objects loading alittle too late, lag on a card thats much newer than rockstar gamess pc requirements card (xfx radeon r7 260x 2gb), and that i had to restart my pc when i stopped playing. however, i still recommend this, because i know that these problems will be fixed in a given time. but if you arent itching to play, id wait until a few bug fix updates roll out. if it helps, ive got an amd athlon x4 860k (stock-clocked), xfx radeon r7 260x 2 gb (also stock-clocked), and 8 gb of g.skill ripjaws 1600 mhz ram running windows 8.1.",25.2

"its really great, pay alot of money, wait for 2 days on the installation. get really excited and think about what you gonna do when you finally can play. first problem, launcher wont start. okay, look things up. fix it, next problem, the social network or whatever its called tells me that it wont find any windows media player installed on my computer, when i have it, and use it everyday for movies and music. okay, once again, i look things up to find a cure to this curse! then i do everything that guides, fixforums, tips/trixes tells me to do. still wont work. i have no clue if it will be fixed, but one thing for sure, why the  in heavens way do you need windows media player to actually play? thats just absurd, i loved the game on console, i really wanted to play it on pc, but this just makes me really dissapointed. i know my computer is old, but i can play titanfall without problems, and thats one hell of a game for sure. so my conclusion of this so far. not happy at all. if it wont come any updates soon and fix this problem, i want my money back, full refund. over and out my fellow gamer-lads.",28.1
"my loading screen loads for ever and deosnt start up",9.6
"i dont even know where to start, this game is a huge improvement from gta iv. there is so much to do in this game that you cant get bored. i was playing on ps3 and ps4 before this, and i can say this is worth the wait. the hype was real before the game was released and still is even after the release. i was waiting for pc version since 2011. if you are a console gamer, there is nothing to argue, you cant beat the pc version, 60fps max graphics no problem on any modern pc. 3 playable characters - michael, franklin and trevor. the idea of 3 playable characters was really smart, i cant imagine gta v without that. i do not want to say anything about the story, play it ! everyone who is reading this - buy the game and support r* !!! if you ever get bored you should try rockstar editor as well as director mode, its hard but worth the while. you cant just explain this game in words. good job rockstar games ! 10/10",75.3
"lets start this review off by saying that im playing the game on a hp pavillion hpe pre-built computer, which is the pinnacle of outdated rigs. my geforce gtx 550 ti wasnt made for this, not at all. ive been running the game in a borderless 4:3 window with most graphics settings on normal (which is the lowest setting) to keep the game stable around 30 fps. heres the deal though; ive been having an absolutely great time playing the game regardless. the controls are great and the game looks very good, even on the lowest settings. ive already played through the story before on console, so ive been spending most of my time in gta online, which does have the occasional connection problems. problems which are likely attributed to the high load on the rockstar servers. all in all, the pc version definitely has issues. however, the pc version is definitely better than the console versions were and is one of the best (if not the best) aaa games released so far in 2015. of course, opinions may vary and the best way to find out would be playing it yourself. ps: loading screens.",24.5
"two black guys say n*****. a third one says it intermittently. well optimized fun first person lots of options can run over hookers and take your money back from them.",32.0
"i really recommend this game to everyone pc version is so much better then console and it was worth waiting for this pc version!!",22.3
"sometimes physics might be silly, mior bugs, first person mode is quite disappointing, default controls for keyboard and mouse are not very good, annoying camera, silly crowd shoutouts. surprisingly decent optimizations and nice graphics, gameplay-wise has gta flavour. next step after gta 4 - certainly. nextget ? if you say so.",74.7

"its wonderful, it looks so good, even better than on ps3 and xbox. ive been enjoying this game alot. and i will for a very long time. this is so worth it. if your pc can handle it of course. you can even transfer your character from your ps/xbox to pc, so no worries.",59.6

"great game right from the start, i liked the other gtas but that is the best one. i will tell you it bad side, rockstar sucks at support, ea at list have live support and i need to wait a month so i could submit a bug report, what brings me to wonder around there site for bug report. the bug is not importent for the moment. im also disapointed that you cant change the level of the first person view. but the game still worth the money, great buy.",35.3
"at this time, multi-player is a complete unplayable mess for me, i have more time spent looking at loading-screens than having fun. -going to your desktop and returning to game doesnt work -after a time the loading screen is stuck at a multiplayer lobby (note that the screen is moving in panoramic mode so my computer isnt freezed due to hardware limits) -connecting a xbox-pad and keyboard at the same time can cause unintended inputs really disapointed at this moment, i hoped for an exelent port upon release after 2 brief delays. note: i will edit this review, up until a fixed patch is released",20.0

"original post 4/14: i cannot get past the first mission due to sporadic game crashes. i tried the latest beta drivers for my amd cards in crossfire. still no luck. from what i could play... up until right after train crash it looks good and plays good. update 4/15 i verified the integrity of the game files in steam and four files were bad. it did its thing and i was back in the game running in safe mode. i got past the intro mission and hopped in my white convertible and started the next mission. it lasted a total of 15 seconds before the game crashed again. update 4/15 part 2 i deleted the game and reinstalled. i was able to play story mode with no issues. i completed the first mission and then did some exploring stealing cars, driving eratic, etc. framerate was great, graphics are outstanding. i thought maybe it was an issue with the preload until i tried online. i was able to get through character creation and then was unable to join a session due to a network? issue. not on my end no. this brought me back to story mode. i then tried online again and when selecting my character the game crashed as it did before. ill try it again tonight. ill update this at a later date hopefully to change to a thumbs up.",11.4

"first it wont launch into the launcher. so i disable my nvidia video card (!) and it does. then the game crashes on the first screen. i assume thats the menu screen. i play many alpha/early launch games that cost a fraction of this, and rarely have issues. i think there should be a big disclaimer before puchasing that says, game in pre-alpha",13.8
"this game has so much content it is amazing! the story is brillient and the online is never ending fun with a massive amount of missions and minigames to do, by yourself , with friends, with your crew or just with some randoms over the internet. little story me and my friend went into the strip club, we had the cops on us, all the strippers ran out and we then chased them for 5 minuets beating the  out of them then being shot in the face by the police. this happened about 3 times..., i only wanted a dance!!",38.9
"figured out how to launch it, turns out the driver update specifically made for the game causes the launcher to crash. but forget that, still cant play it. rockstars sh*t tier drm couldnt stop my key from being stolen. guess ill be staring at the social club screen instead of playing the game. nice job rockstar, glad to see you have your priorities straight.",46.7

"its grand theft auto 5, my favorite gta game... on pc! this game already kicks  on consoles, but this is by far the best version of grand theft auto 5! i have played the ps3, xbox 360, and ps4 versions and the pc version tops them all. better frame rate, better graphics (supporting resolutions above 1080p, directx 11 features, and higher resolution textures), and (by opinion) better controls (mouse & keyboard). if you have not purchased this game yet, what the hell are you waiting for? go and hit that add to cart button and buy this game already! i will see you online!",61.2
"just... just buy it, trust me. this is not just a port, this is more. the game is beautiful and the hype is not fake. you must know one thing - 2gb graphics card, is enough, now let me define enough: some features (graphical ones ofc) require a lot of graphics cards memory, and for beautiful game, without huge fps drops, crashing, etc. you will need more than 2gb :) every penny that you give in this game, if worth it!",71.6

"first of all, the pc port was well worth the wait. the developers thought of everything; from showing how much vram is in use, to including a whole separate game mode (rockstar editor). performance is great and the graphics are stunning. overall, its just a fantastic pc port. ive been holding off gtav on the consoles because i wanted to experience this game completely fresh on the best possible platform and holy moly am i glad i did. after about 6 hours, its abundantly clear how marvelous this game is and i get to experience it at its maximum quality for the first time, w/o any spoilers or nothing. the gameplay is solid, the aesthetics are beautiful, and man, the story is phenomenal. i mean, im no real world gangster/etc kind of guy. hell, i really dislike the theme entirely and tend to avoid other games or media of the sort, but the writing in this game is just so top notch, so well thought-out, i found myself being invested in the characters and their stories. (havent touched the online yet so cant comment on that) ive barely scratched the surface of this game, but i believe ive played enough to highly recommend this game.",43.3
"brought this game yesterday, im sure its a great game but i have been unable to play it. everytime i click on the icon i get a steam installation come up for a few seconds and thats it...nothing, gtav will appear in my processes for a few seconds then disappear. ive tried installing the social centre manually and running as administrator as a recommended fix but this hasnt worked either. not worth the 40 until its working correctly after installation for everyone.",25.7
"tired of watching grass grow? tired of tree simulator? then this is the game for you. best 59 gb loading screen youll ever see the detail on the loadin bar is mesmorizing in all its high definition glory. 10/10 would buy again. i almost forgot to note how efficient the cancel button is good thing there isnt a refund button next to it. my brudder tell me its a good game and he was right loading as far as the eye can see. be careful though if your c:users(name) has even a character as foreign as space you might have problems launching this game.and yes those 2.4 hours i played was of that loading screen that never changed. ign gives it a 10/10 but then again ... they have 4k monitors",5.6

"smooth like silk.....all settings very high or ultra, even in advanced, running on an evga 780 classified! constant 40-50 fps.......anyone who thinks thats low because its not 60 fps has no concept of what these numbers actually mean! oh by the way, still rocking an i7-920 from 2009 clocked at 3.8ghz......still as powerfull if not more than most current cpus! most people with crash problems and poor game performance on cards like a gtx 970, is just that, their problem!!! learn your hw, and learn how it all works. dont take it out on the developer just because you run mcafee/norton along with itunes and skype and chrome and 300 other apps all at once, then try to load a game and it runs like . rockstar, amazing job! cant wait for red dead on pc!",42.8

"simply broken and wont start. unless i disable my graphics card. well done, rockstar. best money wasting simulator 2015. edit: after finally being able to get into the game after a recent patch, now i can say..  this game! from the bottom of my heart, im more disappointed and pissed off then ever. its  and so overrated. not even being close to worth the price - especially considering all the problems. i want a refund and now. this is not a bad game. but not worth the price tag and not even close to 10/10, or even 9/10. its a 7.5/10 at most.",1.8
"right now, theres a reasonable chance you wont be able to launch the game, or youll be like me and youll have to find an unreasonable workaround. in order to play, i have to turn off my nvidia card, launch the game, and then turn my graphics card back on. wait until its on sale and has been patched.",39.5

"the patch and amd driver update (beta) actually made the game a lot faster and more stable (it was barely playable at first). there are some technical flaws thogh. nice visuals, quite stable fps, a-lot-of-new to explore and learn. suddenly theres something more time consuming than skyrim. i didnt try gta online yet since my internet is very unstable atm; people say its chaos and the most of the time you watch load screens, not los santos. im very happy with the singpleplayer so far. maybe the game is not totally worth the full price (i usually buy games on huge sales), but its not waste either. so, im pretty happy with the buy and i look forward for new updates/fixes. specs: msi gx70 laptop (fullhd) amd a10 5750m (2.5/3.2 ghz) radeon hd8970m 2gb gddr5 16gb ddr3 1600mhz 7200 rpm hdd win7 64 settings: 1920x1080 high texture quality high shadow quality high reflections quality softest shadows v-sync: half (30 fps) fxaa the rest is low/default. 9.5/10 (not so satisfying shooting, few other things are off, otherwise very enjoyable). 2015-04-17",19.7

"doesnt work for me, wont launch wont do anything, ive spent the past 2days researching and trying to find out why the  it wont launch and ive tried every single work around possible. some of them are just bloody ridiculous especially rockstars one of forbidon characters in accound user names. serious displeased ive payed 40 and rockstar have had 2years to try and sort this out for pc release and they have failed completely. they failed with the console launch and they have failed with the pc launch.... its a shame because its a fantastic game but ive lost all faith in rockstar after this.",23.3

"honestly, it was worth the wait. thank you rockstar for making one of the best pc ports of existence. the rain runs well at a full 60 fps most of time in very high settings. however, unpacking simulator isnt a far off synonym to this title. the game is well polished and the online servers are actually a lot better compared to the consoles. i guess this time we should thank the devs. if all else fail, vinhll fix it.",49.9
"after two years, the blockbusting grand theft auto v has finally arrived on pc. and now the question im sure everyone is asking: is it worth a buy? i can safely say this is one of the best optimizations of a pc game i have seen. even a gtx 860m, a the midrange laptop gpu in my comp, is able to churn up 60fps on high settings with little to no hitches. kudos to r* for delivering a fantastic product. note: now while the game itself runs beautifully, the installation issues were a royal pain. if steam ever crashes during the unpacking, or the social club client is unable to start the game: grand theft auto v has exited unexpectedly verify the game cache, it turned out that 10 files were missing so let that unpack. other than that great port 10/10",55.9

"incredibly bad customer support. dont buy it from steam because if you do the customer support will just tell you is your problem when your activation code doesnt work. my story: bought the game---excited and ready to play---installed the game---activation code require---no problem, activation code entered---activation code invalid---scratch my head, lets try it again---activation code invalid---keep trying...---45 mins later contacted customer support---waited 12 hours for their reply---reply received, says please ask your actual seller for another set of activation code, which is steam itself.---i raged---story end.",30.4

"buy this instead of mortal kombat x. just trust me.",15.0
"this game looks awesome, unfortunately it arrived too late because when rockstar didnt release this game for pc first and i gave on the pc platform altogether and decided to go back to using the swizel and stone. since rockstar abandoned us pc players for years, i lost all hope on this innovative technology and decided to stick whats been tried and proven. due to the godly graphic requirements of this game i will be forced to upgrade the video card of my swizel and stone so something a bit more new age. thanks rockstar for taking so long to remember about the fans that started it all. next time dont sell out to consoles and maybe i will give my rock 3.1 os and return to the pc platform. until then ill stream this game to my swizel and stone from my sons pc.",12.8
"took me all darn day yesterday to download just to have a stupid the rockstar update service is unavailable (code 2)  error with the social club launcher messing up and not being to fully update.. was p.o.d cuz was not able to play, got a refund of my $59.99 to my steam wallet.. gonna wait and see if this problem gets fixed soon, if it doesnt, then that $59.99 will go toward something else and rockstar can go to h e - double hockey sticks",0.8

".. i cant even everytime i start the game it just crashes pls fix this r* .-. refund pls",1.3
"the single player is very robust and runs as smooth as silk without a hiccup. the game is a breath of fresh air compared to how grand theft auto iv ran on pc. no more gfwl and optimisation issues. the rockstar editor is also a very agreeable addition. however, the online from my experience is somewhat negligent. i have experienced 2 game breaking bugs: for the first one; the entire screen freezes except for the mini-map, for the second; the game sometimes gets stuck in an infinite loading sequence. in both of these scenarios, i ultimately have to shut the game down via the task manager. overall i am quite impressed, but also completely confounded by how unstable the online can be at times; especially considering the copious amounts of time rockstar had to perfect this game on pc. i will rate this game as an 8.5 for now. my opinion will very likely increase if rockstar remedies the online issues and as more enjoyable mods arrive.",54.2

"i never had the xbox or playstation version.... i have only played this is a ps3 that was not mine. anyway i think gta v for pc has not yet demostrated how better can it be compared to the consoles exeptuating graphics of course. just wait and lets hope they add mod support thats what im looking foward to.... modding the  out of gta v until it explodes. :d",52.1

"very well optimized. i was playing a game of league of legends aram with my generals and i barely got 60 and that is only a linear game. gta 5 is a huge game and a very beautiful game. as the android leader of best korea. this is a good freedom simulator. because i feel opressed by my countrys dial up internet as it took me 2 weeks to download gta 5. anyway i rate 8/8 cause damn good game.",69.7

"ive owned the game since release in 2013 on xbox 360. enjoyed it well enough to land it again on the pc. this really makes use of all hardware across the board. its funny how well this game functions as opposed to predecessors. gta iv simply wasnt optimized for heavier builds i guess. 60fps helps a lot, and it looks fantastic. this isnt just a simple port. price may or may not drop during the seasonal sales, but i found it perfectly worth retail.",5.4

"after almost 2 years finally comes to pc. huge open world filled with brutality and prostitution with amazing story and awesome soundtrack this is grand theft auto v. single player is ok but best thing is online! online will give you a lot of fun especially if you play with your friends. race, deathmatch, survival, capture you can do a lot in online but for my best thing is heists. the heists to need communication and cooperation with your friends. your team can die only one time so you must concentrate and have some skill. i like this style of playing. this game is also well optimized. i would recommend this game for all. 10/10* ____________________________________________________ delay simulator!",67.1
"this game is one of the most immersive, free space game i have ever played. i cannot say ever that i do not love it. the only downside to it is that this game is a huge game, therefore requuiring a ton of memory and speed on your computer. but if you meed the minimum reqirements, you should be fine!",7.6
"game is great. to quote some of the worlds top-men, so much to do, so much to see, so whats wrong with taking the backstreets? but if you have a laptop like me, you can screw off. because just like dying light, this game just takes a huge dump on mobile graphics cards. gl hf",22.1

"+ im surprised how well this game runs on very high settings, single player and multiplayer. (gtx 670 overclocked) + lots of graphic setting options. + new soundtrack + hasnt crashed once + day one multiplayer is working + first person view is great - flying controls are little weird (maybe because i havent played gta on pc before)",8.8
"in typical gta fashion, it doesnt work on release. im waiting it out tho",0.3
"really rockstar? 2 years and 3 delays seemed to have added up to nothing. the game is unplayable for me as as the launcher crashes and i get a message saying gta v launcher has stopped working. it then checks for a solutio to the problem and closes. and it also seems about 25% of all people who bought gta v are experiencing game destroying problems. i have tried reinstalling both the game and social club, verifying my cache files, restarting steam and my computer, and fidddling with my gpu. nothing worked even the slightest. rockstar - fix. this. now.",51.7
"this is my first time ever reviewing a game. ive come from console gaming to pc, which ive had this game on ps3. i can only say its way much better i dont have super highend graphics like most people do on here but im playing on high settings with 30 fps which is pretty good considering im not too worried about having mind blowing performance.",53.5

"let me tell you a story about gta 5 / online... here we go... on my first time driving around in gta online i decided to do my first robbery of a gas station. i strolled into the gas station, and politely aimed my gun at the attendant and started asking him to put the money in a bag. when all of this was done, i went to leave the gas station to find that some other player parked their suv against the door so i couldnt get out. i looked at the situation for a second to realize there was c4 strapped to the rear bumper... bang... it goes off, i die, and the guy drives off on my motorcycle. 10/10 would get blown up again robbing a store.",13.1

"i am not sure if i am the only one experiencing this problem but this game stutters as soon as i start driving, basically when i move around quickly. i tried to turn down graphics settings and optimized it through geforce experience and still experiences the same thing. i opened up fps counter and it started above 100fps (im running 3 gtx980s with 144ghz), so is my cpu the issue? i have a i7 4790k @ 4ghz so really? an i7 couldnt run this game smoothly?",35.6
"this game is so amazing it was worth the wait. the graphics are amazing im running 60fps at 1920x1080p on a gtx 970 (yes the one with the vram issue but non the less its still a great card if youre looking to buy it) and on high settings. the game is 61gb total to download, its a long wait but trust me its worth it. out of all i would rate this game a 11/10 just that amazing!",27.3
"is this grand theft auto or grand theft arcade? i purchased this game assuming its an evolution based on gta iv, but they removed the realistic driving/crash/deformation physics. it feels like youre playing a browser racing game. wth? i am not playing this game until either the developers add an option to switch physics to gta iv-style, or until a mod has been released.",0.7
"this game kicks a$$! cant wait for the mods to start rolling out!",34.0
"one of the most detailed game ive ever seen. worth its money and time spent in waiting. the true successor of grand theft auto series, now with even more detailed story. storytelling, graphics, activities, everything is perfect here. but grand theft auto: online is still crap, sorry. no heists can make me stay in 30-player world where other 29 are barely intelligent kids. and missions/races are boring as hell too.",66.7

"game is unplayable at recommended or even below settings,slow mouse movement because its tied to the fps of the game,heck you cant even get out of the benchmark and back to the setting page before starting the game,upon ending the benchmark you have to start the game ,quit and relauch it to even tweak youre settings before you play.",1.6
"i really dont understand all the issues people are having. i bought the game right before the release, and it worked fine. it signed into the social club and let me play right away. singleplayer works fine, as does online. the game runs like a dream, even on very high settings. havent crashed at all, except for it freezing up when i tab out, but that doesnt count. my only real issue are the servers, which keep lagging or dropping everyone out every once in a while, but then again, when theres that many people playing all at one time, its kind of understandable. the game is absolutely amazing, and is even better now that its on pc.",49.1
"fantastic and well worth the wait, runs better on my computer than gta iv did, far better optimization. i do however feel for the folks affected by user account name issues, im surprised they didnt bump into that in 1.5 years of testing. hopefully they fix that eventually but this still gets the thumbs up from me.",45.2
"buyer beware: if you are an average gamer that does not have more than or eaqual to 3gb graphics card the game will look horrible, you must havea graphics card to play but it must be a spendy one because the xbox 360 verson of this game looks better then the pc version for me, im so sad i wasted $60 on this hopeing for better graphics but am now out $60 and very dissapointed.",27.3

"looks amazing when i finally managed to stop it from crashing every 5 minutes. didnt seem to have any problems from r* social club either. like i said it looks incredible, i can nearly max it out with an amd r9 270x (make sure you download the updated drivers). pushing the textures detail up too high seems to make it a bit twitchy but still looks lovely. 10/10 would develop another stomach ulcer due to stress from figuring out why it kept crashing and thinking id just wasted 39.99 on an unplayable 60gb parasite again.",13.2

"i think the game was well worth the wait. rockstar did actually deliver what it told us it was going to deliver us. a smooth gta playing experience on the pc. and the graphics (even on medium or high) are pretty darn astonishing. i was sitting here earlier today watching the sunset ingame overlooking the city and all i could say was: this sunset looks darn better than in real life!. if you havent already, buy the game. because this is the best gta we have gotten yet on pc!",51.2
"wow... what a game. i pre-loaded this sometime over the weekend waiting for 4/14 but was released a bit earlier on the 13th. ive had this game on all the generations, 360, one, and now pc. let me tell you something... i honestly looked at the trailers and pictures for the pc and thought well, this doesnt look that much differnet for such a delay. until i pressed play... (i did have the windows account error - which was an easy fix for me.) the game is just purely stunning and the crisp sounds of engine and rifles. the story line... now that is an amazment that would keep you entertained for days and days! the gta online dlcs; some may be bad but then you have massive ones such as gta online heists which is just spectacular. this game could bring hundreds of hours of fun once you really get into it!",11.7
"rockstar did an amazing job with this port. while my single gtx 770 isnt running the game at full ultra, its pretty close to it. much closer than i expected, after gta iv and many of the overhyped games to come out recently. this game looks absolutely amazing. i havent played as much as i would like yet because of work, but i will be playing when i get off. gunplay is as good as ever, driving is smoother, switching characters (not that ive done it much yet) works exceptionally well, and its all bound together by one of the most beautifully rendered games ive ever seen, and certainly the best open world in terms of visuals. i havent played on console since ps2, so this is my first time playing this amazing title. if, like me, you are a true pc gamer, you will pick this game up. even if you are a cross-platform heathen using both consoles and pc, you should pick this up if you are interested in the in-game video creator. it seems like a great feature to play around with, though i will wait until ive beaten the campaign first.",52.5
"as much as i was hyped to finally be able to play this game on the pc since ive never played it before, i was unfortunately let down from an error that i have spent countless hours on trying to fix with no progress. i have searched countless places with countless way of tryign to deal with the problem of just even trying to load the game once properly. this game shouldnt have been released with such a bad error that isnt fixable, to my knowledge and everyone elses that has come across a similar problem. i still really want to play the game, but after almost a week from the release date and unable to play it after waiting months from buying it, to prelaoding it, and now this, im quite upset. i do hope to play it still, but this just isnt a way to release a game with such a glitch that wont let the customer even play it for a minute.",35.4
"huge game doesnt do it justice. great graphics, top-notch gameplay, and tons of stuff the average person wont ever do. third-person action game, with first-person thrown in as well, that uses a three-person main character storymode all about heists, revenge and the like. multiplayer is a blast, with buying apartments, cars, and weapons with the objective being what you want to do. you can race, heist, deathmatch, or just enjoy the fanastic chaos that will ensue!",4.7
"how to ruin your life: 1) download gta v 2) learn how to press buttons on your keyboard to play gta v 3) played for hundreds and thousands of hours for that one thing that looks really cool. 4) congratulations, you now have no life. this method is tried-and-true, i have even tested it on myself thats how sure i was that it would work.",72.8
"my little brother and i share our libraries between accounts. unfortunately, you cannot share this game between accounts because r* sucks and you have to have a key code to start the game. its fun otherwise. i love motorcycles.",0.6
"the game is the same from all consoles. but the 60fps is what you are looking for. still the mods will be great. i have a pretty good computer. but when im trying to get 60fps its pretty hard. - 780 gtx - i-7 processor - 12 gb ram im getting 60fps on the outside of the map but it dips down to 45fps in the city.",30.2
"i had trouble with my grapihcs card at first, but then i got it to work. all i had to do was enable it when it was loading. anyway, game is great 11/10",43.9
"i cant even play gta v is anyone having this problom",2.0
"it took a while but the result is probably the least broken pc relese in recent memory. it does have its issues and there are bugs, but way less then normal ports. pc master race!",59.2
"great game so far, makes you wish you got it 2 years ago. crashed incredibly fast sports car. stabbed a woman talking on her cell phone. bought some guns. had a shoot out with the cops. things were getting interesting. my cat hit the power button. 10/10 would cat again.",18.5

"its freaking awesome!!!! <3 <3 <3 beautifug graphics,amazing gameplay!!big difference from the ps3/xbox360 versions!!!",56.3
"even if you played on ps3/xbox360/ps4/xboner, gta v for pc is much better than a lot thought it would be. its a great port, it feels smoother, looks better, has much better controls, and is just flat out amazing. sure, online has a few bugs but its a day after. and when im writing this, i have so much more time dedicated to this game on ps3, so... story : pretty twisted, kind of dark, but enjoyable and deals with real situations, while having pretty funny parts. and the three protagonists thing was an intresting feature to add. i would definetly recommend. online : my favorite part : its amazing to just mess around with friends and do whatever the  you want :). plus, heists are a great addition to this. so  yes i would recommend this.",23.4
"got 7 hours in, and already know im going to play for much, much longer! this game lives up to the hype for this pc version esp. if you went in cold like i did. perchasing this game is the best $60 dollars ive spent in a while.....other then the internet bill :....",75.6
"this is like the console game, except better #pcmr",33.5
"this game is great on single player and multiplayer. textures are... meh. (nothing a few texture pack mods cant fix.) and my 970 runs it well... right up to the point where i crash around 3hrs or less. 8/8 its gr8 m8. would crash again...",82.6
"just awesome. that year waiting was totally worth it! if you consider buying it, do it right now! you wont regret! firt day 10 hours of gaming in a row...",49.8
"im unable to review the game since im stuck on a loading screen after the prologue. after walking through a door (20 seconds into the game) the screen goes black and nothing happens. very disappointed with this release.",20.9
"i dont have friends to play with.. 10/10 would buy again",8.7
"now i can get a private dance from a stripper in ultra graphics and 200fps. well done rockstar! #heilgaben",48.1
"best in series for sure. lots to explore, lots to do. possibilities in this game never ends but im having a problem that without disabling the graphic card, i cant run the game. after having run the game, i enable the graphic card then carry on. this has to be fixed as soon as possible.",19.2
"unplayable since it crashed every 10 minutes, often resetting progress.",7.2
"so i spent $60 and 6 hours to troubleshooting. all i got is the rockstar update service is unavailable (code 2) and dispointed.",49.9
"dont buy this game until its fixed, i have a r9 290x and a i5 3570k and the game runs like **** with fps drops and stuttering",57.2
"so it looks like r* learned from gta iv and managed to succesfully launch the biggest game ever. i had 0 errors while instaling and 0 after. for me, the game runs as smooth as it can. (you can check my hw in my profile and my native settings are very high) [i preordered and i am fully satisfied] thank you r* 5 stars out of 5 ;)",51.3
"never really played any of the gta series but after playing gta v for 5 mins i am now a convert. massive sandbox of glourious graphics littered with characters of real depth , recommended 100% :)",20.2
"i have encountered more than one game breaking bug that has existed for years on console versions of this game. despite many open tickets from countless users, rockstar has yet to post a single working solution to the problem on either consoles or pcs. this is unacceptable; theyve had plenty of time to address this. im powerless to hold them accountable. the only thing i can do is post a bad review, so here it is.",56.3
"i was buying snacks when a hipster and a furry came in and robbed the store, pulled me into a firefight with the cops, forced me to get into their van, hijack a plane and crash it on a strippers club while they cried allahu akbar! so one could say it was and average day.",64.9
"the game is well optimized and it was was worth waiting for. the director mode is quite fun and is a good reason to buy the game, even if you already bought it before. you can play as characters from the story, pedestrians and even animals. (you can use your online character in single player). play as any character like the republican space ranger and you can enable cheats, making you feel like a superhero. youll be able to make some really creative movies with all the options theyve given you, an improvement over gta 4. theyve also added a custom radio station as well. this is truly the ultimate version of gta 5 and i highly recommend it.",60.5
"loved this game on ps3, its 100x better on pc. 11/10",46.4
"the game is fun, from what ou can play. the load times are ridiculous. it will take about 5-6 minutes to load from event to event. gta v/0nline is not worth the money atm; maybe in a year, when the game is updated, it will be",18.8
"so good! racked up loads of game time already, the online feature is incredible! must buy! worth every penny!",38.1
"i didnt even start the story game yet, got stuck on gta online then i try the story until chop mission and curious how to train the dog, bit googling and turn out you need to download ifruit app on your apple/android gadget, spent 10 min looking for the app at in game phone and computer, turn out that app is for real phone lol, anyway best game ever and i love the fps mode",38.7

"amazing game 10/10 would run over dirty peons again.",38.6
"i can without a doubt say that this is my favorite game of all time. on the ps3 ive spent over 500 hours in it, and im gonna spend even more on pc when its been upgraded so much. definitely recommend this.",48.6
"i saw a cat and was like whoa a cat then my inner cynic took over and went ahh its just part of the scenery, you cant interact with it so i ran over and kicked it. it fell over twitching helplessly. 10/10 would give cat internal bleeding again.",22.5
"good game. but i really hate these very long loading... and these sessions. and sometimes a huge lags... singleplayer is perfect.",39.5
"once this game works out its issues with the launcher and fixes performance issues it will be an absolute masterpiece.",64.6
"gta v launcher sucks ! ! i cannot get my gta v to start up... same goes for my friends~~",73.0
"as of right now, this game will not run on a dual-gpu laptop. amateurish oversight even for an upstart.",9.4
"if your pc can handle the fps issues then yes i would recommend it but as for me, the fps drops and the constant lock up of my pc, i would rather wait till they sort it all out before trying this game again",11.0

"glorious pc master edition. 11/10. grand theft unpacker",27.9
"rockstar finally learned how to optmize a game for pc. gamewise, i have no complains, as this game runs perfectly on my mid-end system. i also would like to point the attention they gave to detail in this. i.e.: for the first time in all of gtas, the steering wheel does actually move. that may not sound much, but it is truly a big thing. things i didnt like were the rearview mirrors on cars being nothing more than a low-quality mirror and the online having nothing new. i hope this will change in time. either way, good job on the and its enhancement, rockstar. definetely worth my money.",48.1
"only problem ive had so far is the memory leak. works great even with it, though.",62.7
"best game ever~ 10/10 friends kill me above 100 times.",44.1
"gta v has been the best game ever, with the loads of activities you can do in the game you can never get bored. this game has the best replay value by far with the extraordinary campaign and online multiplayer to play with friends. although this game has been delayed for pc for over a year it is worth it. the gunplay of this game is good, if you dont prefer using keyboard thats alright because you can switch over to controller with ease-i use controller though but either way this is a must buy game.",10.4
"when you first come into the story line, you will meet a little kitty in the street corner. i tried to hold that cat and pressed some keys, instead touching the kitty the character i controlled kicked the kitty. and its dead. definitely the worst gaming experience in my human life. yes i am a kitty lover. highly not recommended.",27.1
"wonderful, immersive game, but at launch rockstar screwed up so bad i wasnt able to play for 5 days. -1 point for every day i couldnt play; 5/10",15.3
"i cant believe how well this game runs compared to the dog that gta iv was. guess they learned thier lessons that pc gamers demand performance. this game runs very well on my 2 year old i5/win 7/8 gb ram/radeon 7850. the storyline as with all gta game is very well written and sucks you in. plenty of random events and missions/heists to keep you busy for a long, long time.",57.7

"wow, 60 frames solid, 1080+, hi cap multiplayer-perfectly optimized. musto buyo!!!10/10",36.2
"this game is perfect. it plays like a dream, and its most definitely the definitive version of the game. 10/10 on r* redeeming themselves, this port is perfect.",31.2
"i love this game. i have played it on ps4, but its whole differrent experience playing on pc at 60fps+. the game very well optimized. i did encounter some problems at the launch though, but i looked it up online and made a new a local account on win 8.1 and boom rock stable. if you have money to buy this game, buy it now!. you wont regret it.",51.2
"awsome story mode. online is endless hours of fun and there is a mass amount of content when it comes to online missions, races ect....it will keep me a happy games for a long time! i pre ordered for the 360 and was really pleased with the game. however the pc version seems a lot smoother and the graphics are brilliant on my msi 7970 frozr. i did run across a glitch that game me achievements for reaching level 25 / 50 / 100 in online play & im only level 18! im not sure how i would report this to rockstar if anyone knows give me a message. a solid cash investment, endless fun to be had on this game. nothing quite like running over pedestrians then going to pick up a hooker, get drunk smoke weed get chased by the police and see how long you can survive!",28.6
"i realy like the game, apart from major crashes when doinging heists, but this will properly get fixed in a patch",18.8
"absolutely a fantastic game... nope, a life . you can simply play tennis golf with your friends, purchasing any hige quality racer and high-ended apartment. vehicles like planes, helicopters, submarines can also be used. definitely a life game. especially the gtaonline, thats  wonderful.a real feeling in a game as in a life i have waited this game for 2 years, since it delayed ..",44.5
"the game run smoothly, but i dont know why i cant create a heist job even though im at rank 22",78.0
"so long, consoles, and thanks for all the testing!",22.3
"it seems like a really good port, i havent noticed any bugs while playing the campaign however i have been experiencing long loading screens and a few game crashes once in a while. with that said, i have really enjoyed both the campaign and the multiplayer part, escpecially heists and deathmatch and i would recommend the game to anyone that like the series. as i mentioned there is a few bugs that might occur a few times duing multiplayer but it isnt really enough to be a deal breaker, i assume they will be hot fixed in the future.",42.5
"best game crash simulator 2015. in all seriousness, i loved this game on console when it first came out and ive been waiting for its release on pc as long as anyone else. after playing a little bit of the game however, seeing its amazing graphics, it crashed, and now all it does it crash on startup. i know its not my computer, because no matter what settings i put it on it has the same problem. youd think since they made us wait so long that it would work on release. guess this is what we should all expect for 2015. ill change this once they fix it, which im sure they will. but when 25% of people whove bought the game cant play it, thats pretty sad :/",22.1

"gran theft auto v is an amazing game. id have to say the optimization for pc is among the best out there and this is only a week after launch. i can consistently maintain 60 fps on max settings with a rig that i have had for 2 years (specs at bottom). i cant even recall having this game crash on me yet. the story for this game is set to be a classic as expected from rockstar. you can see characters develop through the game which is something you would only come to expect from good movies. the controls take some getting used to but overall seem efficient. i am rating this game as v/v. the only time i am not having fun in this game is during loading screens. specs: intel core i5 3570k @ 3.8 ghz, evga gtx 780, 16gb ram, 500 gb 7200 rpm hdd.",7.4

"fix the launcher problem ! every time i have to swicth between my two graphic cards to start the game, what a stupid bug. fxxk you r star.",17.9
"i would love to offer a review of this game, if it would even start. maybe if rockstar got up off their beanbag chairs filled with 100 dollar bills and weed and realized nobody wants to deal with social club, it could be launched using steams perfectly fine overlay, and this whole  issue with social club blanking out would be resolved. but, then again we have to rememebr its not as if they actually give a  about any of their customers. review staying negative until i can actually play, which im guessing wont happen until wednesday of next week, if i know rockstar.",16.5
"rockstar seems to be taking a page from nintendo with this port. the idea that you should only play an hour or so (with breaks inbetween) is strictly enforced by rockstar, as the game will forcibly shut itself down at regular intervals. thank you for looking out for the health of your consumers, rockstar. <3",61.1
"10/10 whould watch 40 min. of unskipable credits again",46.1
"this game might be a little prettier than it was 2 years ago, but there is nothing new added that makes it worth paying $60 for a 2 year old game. the online portion of the game is still an awful waste of time. not to mention for some reason they never got rid of the boring ifruit app which requires you to feed, water, and walk chop. all in all this game is not worth half of what they are asking.",6.9

"gta v is finally released on pc, with much improvement from the previous gta iv release. it runs smooth 40-60fps even on my old hd6850. the same reaction when max payne 3 was released, why is this running smoothly on my old graphic card? rockstar has done a really good job on this. but still, 4 months of delay is pretty painful to wait.",45.4
"great game on pc however it would be much better if rockstar would just find a way to allow modding in singleplayer without it affecting online because mods for the gta games on pc is what made gta alot more fun to play overall its a good game has a few crashing issues that need to be worked out but i would recommend this game.",77.5
"now that finally my game started working (after spending a few hours). i can say that this game is worth every single euro/buck. the graphics are absolutly amazing and a game very well optimized. the story is interesting, more detailed than the story mode on ps3/4 or xbox. the mode online is interesting and fun, consider it the multiplayer playground where everything can happen. this game is, what everyone expected a 9/10 ign rate. until now ive seen no bugs. a very good game to spend some hours playing and great to play with friends. i cant wait to see the mods that are coming. if you are not decided if u should or not buy, i tell you that you should. see you there!",17.3

"at first i was very sceptical, especially because i have seen the flaws of this game on the xbox 360. the issue with that game on that console, was that you could glitch your money in many different ways by using 2 online players, and the pay & spray shop. you could also gate glitch, and get underneath the red parking lot building, and if you had a fast enough car, you could even make a jump towards the metro, underneath los santos. most of these glitches i have tested if they still work, and from what i have gathered and tried, its 9/10 made impossible. along with the graphical update, the first person view, and for how you can transfer your gta console character to the pc makes everything just perfect as it should. i espect many hours that i will spend inside this game, all under the form of total freedom that we all care so much about. the only thing i really dislike about gta, is that they have taken so much time, untill the pc port was finally there.. for future games, this should really be quicker, prostponing will make gamers angry, and nothing positive comes out from that. i give this game a 9/10.",66.9

"well, what can i say? grand theft auto iiiii is another installation for the infamous gta franchise developed by rockstar. first impression was immensively outstanding. the ability to immerse yourself in the online multiplayer is extremely corporeal. this has everything that i could ever possibly want from a video game, and delivers ten fold. there is simply not enough time in the day to spend playing grand theft auto five online. it is pretty enjoyable. kind of wish i pre-ordered, but that is pointless considering it is easy to accumulate cash, if youre not wasting it on tattoos, cheap suits, or car mods after you complete each and every job, which, in my case, i have a bad habit of indulging in all of the above. to make a long story short, its fun. there could be a few improvements, but you know how the old saying goes... you wish in one hand, and poop in the other; which one fills up first?",13.7
"this version blows the console versions out of the water, great visuals and high framerates make this much more enjoyable then the next-gen versions. gta online works for the most part, it worked on day one and the only issue i have had it losing connection sometimes but it is only after being in a session for a few hours. i have had some crashing issues, three times in 35+ hours but this is before any patches have been released, im sure they will fix the crashes now that tons of error reports are being submitted. some people say the game will not start for them at all, i have been able to, luckily, play since the game lauched. a user on reddit posted a fix for my crashing and it was to disable v-sync, that seems to have fixed the problem.

"very disappointing. having not played this on another platform previously, it was entirely new to me. the plot is very very poorly written, haphazard, vague, and short. if i hadnt messed about doing unnecessary things it could easily be completed in 10 hours. compared with gta 4, the story is severely lacking. the graphics engine and port to pc however, very well done. after the debacle with the gta 4 port i was worried. but this was ported very well and even on an old machine runs well on mid graphics. the online experience isnt particularly inspiring however. feels like they tried to include a lot, and in doing so made it quite unenjoyable. i wish i could recommend this, the engine and potential are great. but the story and characters are just pathetically scripted. their actions in the parts you cannot control make no sense at all (including the npcs), and if there is a plot that youre supposed to be able to follow, it seems huge parts of it are never spoken, and just assumed happened. wait until its on offer, was not worth preordering.",56.8

"they finally cared. now gta 5 is without a doubt, the best gta so far, but its still tied down by the social club, and games for windows live, but it works so much better than gta 4, im using the same system, i can run everything on high in gta 5 with minimal lag, gta 4, i still can drive without being 2 seconds behind. controller support works great, and it feels like when i was playing on the ps4, it has the very rare stutter,but its pretty much perfect for me p.s. never have to bowl with roman or be a yokel or say push me push me again, goodbye 4, hello 5",31.1
"first time playing on pc was with pesants for 2 months before it got released first frakin group all had mics and we even teamworked all the way through humane raid from the coke the insurgent the harrier and so forth we became the expendables 5 got into the first harrier and all i heard was highway to the dangerzone and so before any of my teammates got off the platform into their jets all aircraft was gone one of our team members even sounded like jet li and even did a quote exactly like him in the last raid but 10/10 would top gun again!",46.1

"way too much racist talk...every other word in the game dialog is the dreaded n word and its really off putting when trying to play it. if there was an option to remove this then id support it! until a mod comes out that enables this option, then the game is on the back burner!",5.0
"this game is ing awesome, but its glitchy and the players are s/trolls. its also already got hackers in it, mostly just people getting infinite money and rp which i really dont give a  about, however i found out some are doing much more when my tank was instantly blownup from an smg shot (im scared what the future holds if this is already here). the glitched are pretty bad too, i have had issues with everything from crahing and getting achievements i didnt do (i have the lvl 100 achiev and im lvl 71..) all the way to being white screened for eternity during heists and being forced to restart. even with all this ery, im still having fun, the game is still a ing blast and ill continue to play it i reccomend this game but please understand the games current state before you purchase.",40.9
"best grand theft auto game! this game seems to me like a combination of san andreas and vice city on very detailed graphics.the world is immersive and the graphics are amazing.the optimization of the game is the best if you put in balance quality of image and frames per second that you have.i recommend it! good game!",22.8

"crashes on startup, i cant play the game to write a proper review.",35.3
"friendly for normal pc 10/10 online servers so bad, loading too long, stuck at loading screen. if you want better online try psn or xbox live servers, not pc servers!",47.3
"for some reason i cant even open the game cause the game asks me to log in to my social club account and then to link a social club account which i then did, several times over and over, but the game still asks me the same thing!!! what the hell is wrong with this. i even then tried to link with a new account but the same issue occurred. it seems that what ever i do it wont let me play the damn game! for that reason and that reason only so far since i loved playing the game on x360 i will vote this game a no!!! rockstar fix this!!!",10.1
"wtf, i cant ing link my rockstar sc account to windows live account. already 2hrs!",49.2
"ive played gta 5 from the console release, to the next gen release. now finally and most importantly, i have begun to play the pc release. the differences were subtle from console to console but to go from that to the pc, those differences are now striking. with almost every graphical option any pc gamer would hope for and a framerate to boot, what is old is new again. whether you are a new comer or an old one, this installment of 5 will no doubt impress.",73.0
"you dont need me to tell you how good this game is, but i can say that the pc version is the best version of the game with its extensive array of settings. fully bindable keys ,ability to have own radio station of your favourite songs and ofcourse the ability to transfer old characters from previous versions 10/10 buy this if you can run it",30.3
"lets keep it short and simple. singleplayer is great. the story is interesting. there are three different characters with very distinctive personalities that you can control. their have their own missions as well as missions where they work togheter. theres also a lot of things you can do in this game, it feels like its a mix of sim city, payday and need for speed. now, the multiplayer... its great except for the long loading times. you rank up and unlock stuff you can buy, like weapons, attachments, car mods... you can buy your own house, store your cars in the garage. you can play heists with your friends or randoms, you can get killed while you are wandering around los santos. its weird at the beggining, you will feel lost, but once you understand how the multiplayer works, it becomes an addiction. so... the game is totally worth your money. normal price for an aaa title and it gives your hours and hours of fun. not like these ubisoft overpriced and overhyped games that last 20 hours or so.",71.3
"going to start with negatives: - no more street food vendors. wtf r*? - cars either refuse to react because you are slow or overreact if are going fast. - killed a streetwalker and medics didnt show up - after watchdogs and being able to creep on streetwalkers, gtav streetwalkers are kinda dull and lifeless. wish they had more ai to them. - car handling and damage model is . pros: - the world itself is well done and decently sized. - for a game with the open world scope it looks good. - seems well optimnised and runs great. - its gta. will update after i play some more.",31.5
"wont launch, this is what we get after two years.",19.0
"ive seen some horible launches, but this takes the cake. im actually impressed how well this crashes my system. trying to exit the game crashes computer, but forcing it to quit through task manager just asks me if i want to retry playing the game in safe mode. online character creation is, well, broken too. occasionally, the game will let me into what i think might be the main menu, but that dosent always work itself out. i dunno. overall, im really dissapointed. i wasnt expecting the game to be good at launch, but i simply wasnt prepared for this disaster. i really hope this gets fixed soon. for refrence, my computer has a x4 750k, and an xfx r9 290. edit: occasionally, i was able to actually boot into the game, however i was not able to load anything beyond the minimum settings in dx10, and it averaged 45 fps. with the new update, it refuses to load correctly, constantly jumping the landing page and always attempting to load into story mode. this just makes me sad. edit 2(4/19/2015): game now runs, but the framerate is sub-60 fps, all settings on normal at dx10.",42.4
"launcher ridiculo! jogo bugado! sistema de inicializao nao aceita as placas sli, nem nada! uma @$@$#@... rockstar games deletando os tpicos do forum de suporte, steam nao da um parecer!!! no fazem fix para solucionar! uma %$%#%#",17.1

"first of all, i love the gta series and after seeing people play, it looks amazing, if i could play it. there are so many people unable to open and play the game, that you start thinking have rockstar even tested if the game could start? my windows user account only have letter a-z a-z and 0-9, so i dont have that problem. i click play, it loads for a few seconds, then stops, and nothing else happens. bugs like that should be tested for and fixed before release. have been wasteing hours, trying to fix it, nothing works. so untill i get to try the game, it gets a thumb down from me.",22.7
"this game is ing great! people scream at me for no reason...update: i found out people were screaming at me because my characters black 10/10.",47.0

"welp, its brilliant. its gta v, excellently ported, running smooth as silk on pc. plenty of scalable options, no issues at all. not much else to be said. this game is a stunning technical achievement and an instant classic.",28.6
"a masterpiece. if youre new to gta 5 or have already played on consoles, this is worth it-- so long as you have the reccomended minimum specs on your pc. the games visuals are beautiful and the gameplay is very fun. singleplayer is great, but gta online is the real deal. if youre used to the auto-aiming on console youll be very surprised to the change of pc not having it due it the precise controls with keyboard and mouse. theres so much more to say about this game but it will be way too long to read so ill just leave it at this. sooooo worth the money, youll have a great time playing this game.",56.4
"thought rockstar would implement 12k for the time it took. still 4k/4k, would burn comp again.",39.3
"i remember that i accidently dropped my xbox 360 with the gta v disc in it. the disc broke and i couldnt play anymore. so i waited for pc. when i finnaly knew that it will came to april the 14th i was so excited. just the hype from the xbox 360 release. i really like this game, the graphics are amazing. it couldnt be better. i will continue to play this game and continue to enjoy it.",34.1
"just another open world rpg. only 3 classes that are almost the same and also have predefined races that cant be changed. skills level up by doing stuff like running. there is a main story line and a couple of side quests. but no boss fights, only trash mobs the whole game. you can buy a lot of items, but they dont have stats. weapons are mostly ranged and you will get in trouble using melee only. theres only one kind of armor that isnt even visible on the character. good thing so far, there are a lot of different mounts to ride. some of them can also fly but are destroyed quickly if you collide with the level geometry. setting could be interesting if youre bored with fantasy.",15.0
"i have a beast of a pc. 10k score on 3d mark. this game is unplayable even in the lowest graphics settings. something is just wrong with it, even after the recent patches.",15.2

"went for a ride with a friend along the coast. shot a woman in the face. 10/10, would shoot again. serious note: the game is just damn pretty. if you like the previous ones, prepare to have your face melted. a+ servers for pc launch day, smoothest launch ive seen so far. (there were hiccups, but within 2 hours i was online and playing with friends without issues, which is pretty damn amazing considering the volume of people.)",27.2
"ive never banked more hours in a video game ever. prior to the pc release, i had invested in both the 360 and xbox one versions and have well over 1,200 hours spread across both platforms. the only negative thus far in this release has been how hard it pushes some pcs. however, this should get fixed, and dont let those negative reviews sway you!",9.0
"after the complete mess up that was the launch day, i let 3 - 4 days pass hoping something would be done, and then it still gives me the code 2 error, so i reinstall, and it gets to the first screen that the game shows when starting up and then crashes, even in safe mode, and online mode, i had updated all drivers rebooted my pc, restarted steam several times, to no avail. definately the last time i pre order a game!",1.3
"gta has finally came. not much more to say besides pressing the add to cart button.",45.8

"crazy fun game. great to play with friends. preordering was definitely a great idea to recieve the extra headstart money wise. very detailed environment and gameplay. amazing physics in game and amazing driving. no need for forza anymore. cons- i wish there werent so many different menus. a lot of loading screens. game will not let you go fullscreen with under 1gb on video card (windowed fullscreen is able to be chosen)",44.6
"this game is awesome and the graphics omgosh!!!! this game was worth the wait get it now if you didnt get it",30.5
"it was a tad buggy at release, but theyve since patched that. connection issues? a vpn can clear those right up. gta5 is one of my top games of all time, but running this on pc full 1080p 60+ fps makes it a truly remarkable experience worth the wait (and loading times). i couldnt recommend this game more for someone who enjoys racers, shooters, massive online rpgs, or any combination. a++ rockstar youve done it again.",42.2
"10/10 amazing to play this game @60 fps. only problem is that the game crashes frequently. hopefully rockstar will patch this in the future. :d",11.1

"i have an problem starting it,cant even start it and it just says loading,after i signed in at social club,any one else having the same issue? please if rockstar isnt fixing it and you know it post it on their website because i dont know if they will,other wise it is probably a good game",26.1
"the wait is finely over...playing this game maxed all the way out at 60fps is nothing short of one of the most beautiful things ive ever seen in a video game...i crash my car in this game all the time from just looking around...animals look more realistic in this then in real life...r*star really did pull out all the stops in the title. this is what a real game should be!! walked up to a random woman walking a black pug. kicked the dog, the woman started attacking me. i punched her in the face and then a mexican stabbed me... 10/10 pug kicks r*star can you add alienware alienfx support for this please! would be so sick if my keyboard and lights responded. have them flash red and blue when having wanted level and have tempo and brightness change depending on level. when switching between char. franklin have the keyboard green, trev orange ect...i think it would make the level of awesomeness i already for this title would be even greater thumbs this up if you agree =) cheers and see you in the city",74.7
"i played the game for a wile got tired took a nap with the game running. i woke up to a gunfight in the front yard 10/10 would nap again.",41.5
"very optimized game from rockstar games, i love it... superior graphics and many activity to do... thanks grand theft auto v...",38.9
"well the wait is finally over pc users, after being treated like second class citizens gta v fianlly came out. this is a franchise that you either love or hate, nothing here reinvents the wheel but this game is absolutely stunning and as fun as any of the other gta titles. a plus for me was a channel playing old punk rock with keith morris (black flag,circle jerks/off!) as the dj solid game woth the purchase, i just wish the wait for release was not so damn long.",8.3
"awesome game, a bit hard to find friends for heists, but not a problem. great game overall really fun.",68.4
"- transfered console account. - bought a tank. - smashing in people. - got blown up. - got killed on spawn. - smoked a cigarette > slowly dies. - smoked another cigarette > die more. - painted my gun pink. - out of money 11/10 would paint more guns to pink.",31.5
"so i havent played any gta since gta 2 (1997), and that has been one of my favorite games from my teenage years. i skipped gta 3 and 4 mainly because i didnt care for the change from 2d top down to 3d third person. however seeing the total biscuit review for the game convinced me to give this game a try. honestly, im blown away in regards to how good this game actually is. the attention to detail and the grand scale of the world is really amazing. i have only a few hours in so far, but i am completely sold by how good the game actually is, and look forward to playing it for many hours more.",4.8
"as of now rockstar has kept there promise of great version for pc and even though its insallation process takes a while, its all worth it once you get into this game.. people cant get mad over a install process its just going to take longer as we get into the future (for any game)..",22.1
"cant log into my rockstar account. gg release day bugs.....10/10 would play again",32.8
"this would be awesome if it worked! i love it for xbox, but with the errors i am getting for pc i feel that rockstar kinda blew off making the game run for average pc users. much better for console",1.4
"my little brother and i share our libraries between accounts. unfortunately, you cannot share this game between accounts because r* sucks and you have to have a key code to start the game. its fun otherwise. i love motorcycles.",0.6
"really great game. i launch it and it opens up a computer simulator that looks exactly like my desktop right before i launched gta v. the only issue im having is getting out of the desktop and into the open world, anyone know how to fix this?",33.5
"with me personally being a massive fan of open world games and specificly mafia ii. once i had played the game a few times on a ps3 and it was good but for some reason its so much better on pc. there really are very little faults with the game but not everygame is perfect",67.6
"this game has kept and kept crashing. i cant get any real solid run time on it. now, after the update, the game crashed and i received 2 different errors. the part that really pissed me off is that i got frustrated and opened csgo right after, and now my csgo is an unplayable blackscreen with stuttering valve intro sounds playing in the background. this game is doing some serious damage to my files.",15.3
"pros: - 10/10 single player game - gta online is great - save yourself airline ticket to los angeles cons: - terrible misrepresentation of la--where muh 6~8-lane rush hour traffic at? - clearly visible sky. there should be smog. - too much rain. we aint in a historic drought for no god damn reason. - only k-town has ching-chongs. there should be more places no speaku engrish.",61.1
"well, great launcher crashes everytime i try to play. i give this game a solid 10/10",1.8
"unbelievable. the coders from r* have been porting the game for almost 2 years, but they didnt think about the owners of the modern laptops with 2 gpus. im not even able to launch the game. upd: ive managed to run the game by disabling my second gpu (and then enabling it), but i hope the devs will fix this as soon as possible. the game is gorgeous, no doubt about that. upd 2: i should make a huge remark. the game optimization is just outstanding. r* did a great job here. everythings running smoothly on my 3-year-old multimedia laptop with high details in 1080p. just amazing.",51.9
"well.. awesome game overall, prefect graphics, first person, nice missions like heist. although i currently have 18 hours of gameplay which may not seem much but when you play this game you will notice its not a game you could play for 48 hours in a row. of all the 18 hours i have spent i have spent 7+ hours just trying to get into a heist/mission. the loading screen is way to long. hope they fix it so you can play this game without checking your phone ever 5 minutes because its a 20 minute long loading screen.. if you dont have a job / school / social life, well then you obviously have time to play this so then it would probably be worth it! its hard to say if it is worth it or not, but the game itself is so good that i have to recommend it.

"game of the year simulator. if youre thinking about buying a game and you dont have gta5 you basically need this game. beware you need a pretty fast computer to keep up, the game is cheap in comparison to what you might need to spend to get it running but i can play it on a radeon hd 5870 1gb without much fuss so the fact that it can run on 2009 hardware is pretty impressive. no complaints in the optimization department. i must say, the pc options are fantastic. there is a lot of tweaking to do, especially in regards to the controller and keyboard settings in addition to the expansive performance tweaks. my favorite part is having a keyboard and mouse and gamepad in front of me and when the game gets to an intense shooting part i can put down my controller and use the keyboard/mouse and start shooting without having to go to a settings menu and change anything. it just works. its perfect. the gameplay itself needs no introduction. you can do pretty much anything. even online play is pretty good, first time i played two guys were in an airplane and nosedived right into me while on foot and everyone died. 10/10",27.8
"this game looks amazing, it feels amazing,it has just so many pros. i played gta 5 on the xbox 360, then i transfered to pc (because pc is life) and when i saw gta was coming out for pc i didnt actually intend on buying it. but then they did the smartest thing ever by implementing character transfer. they made a troal of 400$ from me and my frined because we all bought it twice lol. good job rockstar ;)",36.2

"*pro tip, ignore the negative reviews that have 20+ hours of gameplay but their review states they are locked out of the game... by far the best game in the series. first person view mode is a great addition to an already fantastic game, crisp graphics and a video editor are just icing on the cake. story is good and improved from previous versions by having 3 main characters, all of which are introduced to eachother through some pretty funny circumstances. the multiplayer is top notch and considering it was a free update (from 360/ps3) its amazing rockstar has delivered as much as they did. heists improve the mp even further by giving you a team and multiple objectives to work towards a high payout. none of the previous gtaiv issues on pc are present and it really seems rockstar learned some valuable lessons from their previous release. i cant recommend this game enough.",21.4
"runs great on my computer (was built to game, but is getting older (i have a 7880 2gb, just above the recommended)), but i could get better preformance in this game. i have to play around with the graphics settings just a bit, but its fine for now. plays well with no crashes, even testing with a 360 controller (yeah, i played it on console, now cant use kb&m for this game because it doesnt feel right). the first person is pretty good, the extra music and car customization is pretty cool, and thank jeezooz there is an option for custom music again! so far, ive only played 1.1 hours, but i plan to find my graphics settings that i need and port over my old characters. and also play online. waaaaaaayyy too much online.",19.4
"i highly recommend this game, in spite of some non positive aspects, such as the price in russian region. it is ridiculously expensive game. but as the positive sides, i want to point to: - high optimization - pushing the limits graphics and physics - next generation sandbox environment - advanced ai - well enough online mode - over 1kkk hours of fun and madness - i killed a cat while running from the cops also, this game helps to release stress very well :)",7.5
"i have a problem about gta v launcher,when the rockstar social club window appear and then theres nothing happen.i wait for a patch that can fix my issue for 11 day and a patch that rockstar release doesnt solve my problem it make me feel annoying that i cant open a game.i recommend this game for high-end pc only and people who use a low-mid tier pc like me(my gpu is hd 6630m) i recommend you to play this game on a console its a better way hope r* will fix this problem soon...(i will edit my note if they can solve my problem and a time that you can see me playing for 3.8 hr is a time that i was try every way to open this game and i can play this game on intel hd graphic and it work like .) -5/10",3.7
"so here it is. the pc game to end all others. first off, this game is extremely well optimised. ( at least for my system ) i have yet to really drop below 50fps. in terms of graphical fidelity however, it really takes the cake. my god. sometimes, ive felt like i was playing real life. buy this game, tell your friends. 10/10/10 - would ragdoll down a mountain again. but seriously. buy this game. buy it. stop reading this and buy it already. -.-",27.4
"one does not know true pain until theyve downloaded gta v at 600kb/s. 10/10 would download ag... nvm i wouldnt",63.7
"after waiting this long, i can say its worth playing",19.8
"this game has a nice online mode. minus the  load times, i really enjoy this grindy game that has nothing but mission grinds and other . i like this game because black people. rate 1/10 bad load times fix please you rongles.",27.3
"i was gonna go and buy clothes and then got killed 13 times constantly by an online player. 10/10",22.2
"fun play game, the best game ever. payday + sim + gta = gta v can play mod and multiplayer, wohooo",35.8
"very well optimized, even for old toaster setups. 1680x1050 with a gtx 660ti and a i7 920 cpu at the stock 2.6ghz has no issues maintaining 50-60fps in every area ive been to so far, most settings medium to high. there was some pretty glaring stutter at the auto graphics settings, but reducing soft shadow quality fixed it. population density is still nearly maxed out, and the world feels alive because of it. rockstar was wise to take their time with the pc release, they definitely didnt want a rehash of the gta 4 release fiasco. so if your specs are greater than mine listed above, you should have no issues running the game at high settings. its just as fun as it was the day i brought it home on the 360 - only this time its even better.",90.4
"1.3 hours playing with the splash screen its great! 9/10 would reinstall their windows because of 1  error.",1.3
"i am sorry i must change my review because i downloaded a patch from nivdia and it worked. this game was good on filthy consel but now at 4k it is amazing and i would say to any one with at least a nivdia gtx 860 and 1080p display to buy this game if not go to the discrace of gaming and play it on consel. 9.5/10",17.7
"i bought this game two days ago. and i have already used 17 hours in-game. it had no problems installing or downloading the 60gb and there is very few bugs. the online services works very well and i have already completed multiply heists. generally, this game deliveres what it promises. buy it 9/10",42.7
"theres a lot to say about this game.. on pc it is a whole entire new game, its amazing!!!! couple problems i have tho is there seems to be a lot of bugs with the graphics and other people have the same problem but other then that its a amazing game add me on socail club @ xxchaoticrainxx",67.5
"this port is great !!!!! i played it with gtx650ti all high and got 3-170 fps all the girls in strip club is suck keep talking about your master race thou",26.4
"there is only one thing i can say about this game, 11/10 legendary ! - well optimized - great graphics - 60 fps fluency - great gameplay best value for every penny ! ;)",34.5
"spent an hour chasing around a woman and shooting out her tires and windows, simply because she owned a compact car. 11/10 would project again",29.0
"awesomely fun really well done port, getting 60fps at veryhigh - maxed on a gtx 760 and i5 4690 rockstar have finally managed to make a game worthy of pc.",59.3
"i rly love this game but i hope that i can buy ingame money in steam pls make this <3",32.3
"first of all i would like to say thank you to console gamers for the beta and alpha testing the one title that always stands up to the hype. no disappointments except for, the obvious situation why it came 2 years late and tremendous loading times in online when lets say i join a job which is full or host quits or whatever happens and instead of only starting to load when criterias are met i wait around 30s for loading and then get an error msg and get dropped back to(hopefully) where i was",55.6
"i have tryed all the fixs that ppl post still not working this is same as last game can any one help?",1.0
"i cant play my gta v because i linked the wrong social club account to my steam account seems like a prob that could easily be fixed but nooooooooo rockstar made the link permanent i just blew 60$ because im stupid but i know i cant be the only one who has done this",1.9
"taunted people as trevor, got whole block after me. 10/10",40.0
"this game is truly amazing. 1. looks great, runs great. 2. easy to pick up, doesnt bore quickly 3. some hard nut achievements 4. great storyline, best multiplayer gta has ever seen id type more, but i gotta get back to my missions... cya",65.4
"the game is good, runs well and looks amazing, the only bad things are that the defult controls are a little fiddly and the rockstar games social club adding an extra layer of drm isnt great, but other than that is good!",19.8
"third time im playing it, just as fun but several times more glorious to watch.",41.7
"great game last copy i had of this was on xbox 360 and i sold it for cod ghosts worst decision of my life :d",38.6
"+=+=+=+=++=++++read+=+=+=+=+=+ if you steam share you arent able to play code is in use and wont give you a seperate code for the game. the gameplay i heard was really good but some issues. you should buy it if your not steam sharing or has it steam shared. review: yes and no.",0.2

"its amazing. 10x better than being played on the console.",55.2
"i no longer have a job. 10/10, would quit my job again.",23.7
"been waiting for this game ever since the release on ps3 & xbox 360 and finally it arrives to pc after 2 years and 3 delays. im been waiting for this moment forever and now my babe have finally found me. rockstar is the bomb. 10/10 for not having to ride with my  cousin roman ever again.",29.6
"its really a game worth buying. still has some issues like problem with textures when v-sync is off but they are most likely going to get patched. it was really worth the wait and i am glad that rockstar moved the release. 9.9/10 imo",64.5
"this port has been done right. looks & plays great.",52.5
"someone stole my car in the game oh no, got a message on my phone, my car was impounded didnt matter, i stole another car to get home.",8.3
"slept only 5 hours(taking naps in between) after its release, its mind blowing. for a game that was released in 2013, it doesnt feel like its old. the real mvp? my girlfriend. even tho she despises gaming, but for this she let me play for extended hours ^_^",81.0
"upvoting this with confidence that the issue causing me to not be able to pause in any fashion or play online will be fixed by reinstalling it. i will change this review as needed.",1.2

"i can not play the game, it keeps crashing everytime i launch it. whenever i do get in i crash whenever i load a mission or leave a lobby. :( i just want to play the game.",19.6
"i love this game, the graphics omg the best i came from ps3 to pc and i am loving it i recommend people to buy such a fun game to play you wont regret it. :d",38.7
"for laptop player dont buy the game until they fix the issues!! always have to disable my dedicated graphic card for access the game, then enable it back, and where is my pre order bonus? until now the game has been play few missions, i still cant claim the bonus. always crash out from the online mode, i cant even running more than twenty minute in the online mode. please fix it!!",62.7
"well, seeing as this game isnt launching for a great deal many people, i cant give it anything but a negative rating. you dun goofed, rockstar. would love to play this, but apparently that isnt in the cards.",20.2
"keep calm and play gta v....... best game of the year......... love u rockstar <3",42.6
"50-60 fps on my 750 ti on max. runs like a dream! the only thing is my hdd is a little slow and sometimes causes the screen to jerk due to loading something. that is nothing to with rocketstar, but i really am likeing this game so far!",79.1
"i cannot run this game even though my computer is not particularly good this game doesnt even give it a chance. i am disapointed in this design flaw. and i was antisipating this game from the start.",1.5
"no imponte dukes on pc, next gen exclusive cars 0/10  game",53.8
"defines epic! first game my dog is addicted to (sits in my lap while i play) he attacked my monitor because chomp look so real! i have this game for ps3, ps4, and pc this is by far the best version if your system can handle it dont waste anymore time buy this now! beware: so real you may actually get an std from the protitutes... #morerealthanreal #killeverything #wrapitbeforeyoutapit 4790k gtx 970 mostly very high 30-45 fps plenty for this game.",41.2
"do not buy this game until it is fixed. the game is horribly broken with bugs. not only are most people that are having issues not able to play the game at all, the gameplay itself is hit or miss. loadscreens are deathtraps and maybe about 20% of the time i can progress through them without the game just crashing completely.",20.0
"didnt crash at launch. became charlie scene. dominated server. 10/10 would smoke cactus again.",32.6
"sadly laptop gamers still cant play and no one from rockstar has given any signs of knowldge about the problem.",41.1
"11/10 killing hookers and getting paid thanks to all the xbox and playstation beta/alpha testers out there",34.6
"good port and and for the price you get your moneys worth thats for sure, so many aaa games release at the same price point and offer nowhere near the amount of time and enjoyment spent in gta 5.",65.9
"24 hrs, no patch. have the missing .exe file many have so the game doesnt even load. avoid.",40.8
"got my car impounded while doing a job. real life simualtor. 11/10",17.6
"10/10 much better than that tiny open world gta iv was. runs smooth like a butter, would play it for many years ahead",37.5
"this game is the best game i pplayed in a long time the last awsome gta i played was san andreas and that was 15 yrs ago",16.0
"simply the best game on this generation. no matter if its on pc or console. its so much fun to play this game, it never gets boring and you can do everything and anything! best gta ever, and probably the best game ever. you just must have it! theres no better time than this to use the word masterwork: rockstar did a colossal job creating a huge, visually stunning world chiseled in its finest details, populated by brilliant characters and with highly spectacular and varied gameplay. the city is spectaular and massive it would take solid days to explore, i just cant stress enough how amazing this game is, five years well spent i say",21.8
"how much time does the social club luncher to finish loading?",89.9
"very nice game, played it on ps3 and still the same feeling. runs very smoothly, but the only bad thing is: the high cpu usage. i can change everything, but my cpu is always on 100%, still on low settings. and this causes no texture loading while driving, which is very bad.",74.9
"much better than the console version, it even better with friends online. all of playing hours.",50.8
"it took a long time for gta v to make it to pc, and an even longer time to install it on my pc, but a few space-making steam game uninstalls later and i was back in los santos, and it holds up even better than my rose-tinted goggles could ever see. with the sheer amount of settings available, it feels like gta v was here on the platfrom all along, and i cant wait to see the mods. i gave it a 10/10 back on the ps3 nearly two years ago, and its only gotten better since.",31.0
"im so glad that i paid $60 for a game that delayed for significant of time to ensure its was polished for the pc. it wont even start. i get an error saying the game existed unexpectedly every time the rockstar social club launcher is loading. was this game beta tested at all during the year it was delayed? doesnt look like it. no official response from rockstar - not even to acknowledge the problem and reassure its customers that it will have a fix soon. only video game producers can get away with selling broken/unfinished products as finished products. these folks wonder why no one wants to pay for their games.",31.9
"could play at launch, only had one unexplained crash. story mode is alright, multiplayer needs a bit of stability improvement, but graphics and average fps are top-notch. this is how pc games should be released instead of bullspit deadlines and moronic over-hype. just wish it would have come out sooner than waiting so long for two generations of consoles to beta-test.",62.3
"after a long wait, its finally here! gta v is on pc. this game is one of the most optimised games i have ever played. the multiplayer part of this game is actually working day one, unlike the console versions. had absolutely no problem for more than three hours of gameplay. there are some negative reviews, which are extremely  and they do not reflect the actual game. some people had problems, some people did not have. you can expect such things if you are going to play the game immediately after it was released. hopefully, they will change their negative review into a positive one after they see the beauty of this game.",86.4
"2 hour long, unskippable multiplayer tutorial and impossible flying controls made a really bad first impression. also, controller users have a horribly unfair advantage against keyboard users when it comes to racing. waited 5 months longer than i wanted to to get disapointment. *edit: looks like the fanboys are disliking. oh well, i have a right to an opinion",16.2
"tons of content in this game. you could spend hours of time exploring the detailed los santos or you could invest in the fully functional mini games. you could even (once again) spend hours just watching (very funny) tv stations. the campaign is excellent with only a few bad missions. i played this back on the ps3 and recall it taking me more than 40 hours just to do the main missions. a very cynical parody/exaggeration of modern life and culture. taking the game literally you will easily get offended, but the game essentially channels the style of a tarantino film. if you have played the game before then you know it is worth replaying. never played? this game comes with my full recommendation.",27.4
"got attacked by a bunch of 12 year olds shouting allahu akbar, they chased me a persuaded me to join them. we then blew up loads of . 10/10 would allhu akbar again",34.6
"watching chop go to town on that other dog never looked better. but in all seriousness, first-person mode is addicting and bank heists are pure adrenaline.",20.0
"good game but for the love of god fix the ing first heist, it doesnt finish properly, you are either stuck in a white screen or in the c ar and cant to anything. please fix it.",62.5
"runs fine on very hight 1080p fx6300 4.5ghz r9 280 oc 8gb ram 1333mhz but if u have 4gb, nevermind. the game just cant run on 4gb. about the game: 10/10. its gta, i dont need to explain it.",81.9
"the best gta ever made in my opinion. if you liked earlier games youre gonna love this, i quarantee.",56.2
"okay, so this being the second time, fully priced, that ive bought this game. i absolutely love it. ive played grand theft auto through its generations as well as my own. from gta 3, to now and everything in between. this game has first person down to a t. ragdoll effects and everything. they implemented a lot of cool new tweeks since ive played it last. graphics look wonderful. love this . anyways, i do commentaries. not just on gta, indie games and other . my gta vids up here.",36.7
"you need about 5 years of downloading this game. but the first time running over a hooker in your undies while playing trevor. priceless. 10/10 would run over again",49.8
"pls buy and do heists with me. much luv, ty p.s. dis game is da b0mb, 10/10",55.4
"after years of waiting we finally got it - the holy grail of self indulgence. was this masterpiece worth the second wait? you can absolutely bet on your life. welcome to los santos once again. michael, trevor and franklin have been waiting for you. new vehicles to drive. new missions to explore. new weapons to play with. new properties to buy. new wildlife to discover. new online events, modes and extra content. new overhauled engine improving graphics, textures and world population density. not to mention a huge menu for graphical optimization, it is truly impressive. if you previously had or have a rockstar social club account you can transfer all of your previous data into your new game. this is the definitive edition of gta v and it feels so good to finally play. 15/10",59.5
"ran over civies in a truck in first-person while listening to backstreet boys on the radio. 11/10 would want it that way",43.8
"since rockstar were pretty good about getting that patch out that actually makes the game start, i can join others in saying this is the best version of a fantastic game. it is superbly optimized, as even on my scrub-tier pc, i can run the game with even more smoothness than i was able to get when i played it on consoles when it first came out. i am happy to say this is the complete opposite of the gta4 pc release. theres not much to say apart from that. its the best version of an excellent game, with a wealth of options, and now that its patched, i can actually play it. the future looks bright indeed.",3.6
"fps rate is really well, even much more smooth than old gta4. rockstar did a good job !",56.2
"well so far so good the game is good i love the way it looks i mean other than the fps drops and trying to get the launcher to stop crashing for almost 2 hours its pretty solid game. i fixed my launcher crash by disabling my anti virus and it loaded and played fine after that. anyways other than those issues i give it a 8/10",55.1
"so everything is better then the console versions of this from xbox 360 to ps4 this is a great game even if your not interested in the online but cmon we all know thats why you want it. only downside is when alt tabbed the game decides it doesnt want to reopen when using programs like ts, skype and ventrilo but thats not that bad.",49.3
