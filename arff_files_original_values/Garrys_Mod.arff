"garrys mod...aah, what can we say about this little gem? this beautiful not-really-a-game-game gives you some of the most open sandbox software ever. not only does it give you the power to change physics and spawn gazillion npcs at the same time, it has spawned a few of the most brilliant gamemodes, such as trouble in terrorist town (ttt) and prop hunt. both are absolutely hilarious, these fairly small items already make it an epic piece of software. then theres sledding, gmod tower and countless others that make it even more amazing. gmods a gem, dont even hesitate to get this one!",39.6

"fantastic sandbox game, built on the beloved source engine that adds and installs different varities of models, locations, mechanics, actions and the crafting abilities to build, pose, share and even create animations and movies. however, it derives from the deepest recesses of notorious flashing, missing textures and of course, the blitzkrieg model spamming of the almighty cluster-mess. five stars.",25.7

"i dont really know where to begin with gmod. at its core, its nothing more than a sandbox to play in, no goals or points or leveling up. just a gravity gun and an arsenal of crazy crap to spawn in. the interface feels a bit clunky to me, it took a while to learn even the most basic menu navigation keys, but once you get the hang of how to work your way around, youll realize that the user generated content for this game is astronomical both in quality and quantity. i absolutely love trouble in terrorist town and prop hunters. id reccoment picking up garrys mod just for those two game modes :d",11.8
"would rate 1000000000/10. very satisfying sandbox mode, along with a game where, along with others, you play a very werewolf like trust game, a game where you can pick up cans, cars, computers, and even a cow and turn into them, and many other literally endless gamemodes to enjoy. reccomended server: creepys villa ttt",793.3

"garrys mod is a very creative and fun game. i find it different from any game really. garrys mod vanilla lets you build contraptions and structures out of props from valve liscensed games. and for people who think that isnt enough, there are about 50+ gamemodes to choose from, and who knows how many addons and duplications there are to download from the steam workshop. garrys mod, in my opinion is very good game, only contridicted by the occasional squeaker noobs that mic spam.",1204.8
"do you own garrys mod? if the answer is no, then what are you waiting for? 5.99 will get you much more than just a silly sandbox tool for messing around with hl2s props and ragdolls. garrys mod is much more than that. garrys mod is a hub for a vast number of games. buying garrys mod, you dont just get garrys mod. you get pirate wars, you get trouble in terrorist town, you get darkrp. you cant really go wrong with the silly sandbox either.",108.1
"the amount of hours ive played speak for themselves, but i have to still say this: gmod has something to enjoy for everyone. you may have to spend a bit of time looking for it, but its there. the biggest downside to this game besides the bronies, is that you must own half life 2, both episodes, tf2 and counter strike source in order to get the full experience and see the content used on most servers. but really, is that a downside? who doesnt own those games?",1355.9

"i dont really know where to begin with gmod. at its core, its nothing more than a sandbox to play in, no goals or points or leveling up. just a gravity gun and an arsenal of crazy crap to spawn in. the interface feels a bit clunky to me, it took a while to learn even the most basic menu navigation keys, but once you get the hang of how to work your way around, youll realize that the user generated content for this game is astronomical both in quality and quantity. i absolutely love trouble in terrorist town and prop hunters. id reccoment picking up garrys mod just for those two game modes :d",11.8

"this game is amazing and never ceases to entertain",225.8
"garrys mod is not a game. it is a platform where people can innovate by turning their thoughts into games. you can choose from a variety of different game modes and maps and play them alone by joining servers or along with your friends. new content is continually added. the only limit is peoples imagination. one of my favourite game modes is murder, where you have to figure out who the murderer is along some innocent looking humans. prop hunt is cool as well, where you turn into objects, and the opposite human team hunts to kill you. you can download more content via the workshop. the game is based on the source engine and uses graphics from counterstrike source, so it is mandatory that you own that game in order for gmod to function properly.",46.0

"what can i say about garrys mod that would do it justice? howbout the fact that you can just keep downloading new mods to make the game even better. what about the fact that you can play a gametype where you becmoem any object and hide from people that want to kill you. this game is amzing.",27.2

"brilliant mod, not even a game, that has it strong pros and minor cons. gameplay: its a sandbox. install maps and stuff from the workshop, and watch hours fly by. 10/10 replay: achievements exist for how long youve played. 9.5/10 graphics: half-life 2ish. unless you have cs:s or hl2, the graphics dont work so good on some maps and objects. 8/10 sound: base sound is okay. sound mods from the workshop make it a joy. 8/10 music: non-existant. play the radio in the backround, you gamer. radio mods exist? 2/10 overall, addicting as heck. install a ton of mods and have fun alone or with friends. the games lack of music makes it seem incomplete. not a major factor, but efficiant. 9/10",499.4

"as someone that doesnt find build anything you want games to be fun i really could care less about the sandbox potential, and even if i did, the physics engine, like many others, doesnt exactly work well with the concept of precision and newtons laws of motion (the main issue being how objects in motion in gmod interact with npcs and player characters in a less-than-relativistic fashion). with that all said, however, the ability for the community to create custom game modes has resulted in a lot of interesting, fun and somewhat unique multiplayer experiences, which include trouble in terrorist town, jailbreak, dark rp, just to name some of the more popular ones.",88.8

"this game is the pinnacle of showing what the pc community and the modding community can do. i could not recommend this game more. this is a must own game for pc and is constantly being updated with new mods and gamemodes to play. this game is home to classic games like prophunt and ttt. the only downside i see with this is it requires many downloads to get the textures used, and if its on sale, i would recommend buying the cs source package with this game, as alot of textures and maps come from that game. otherwise, just download a cs source mod that gives you most of the textures and maps from cs, but be ready to see a few giant error signs, especially in prop hunt if you choose this option. 8/10",266.0

"definitely a top pick! never really knew what this game was until i finally played it when a friend recommended it to me. it went on sale and i decided to give it a try, and i can honestly say that i was not disappointed. garrys mod is esentially a bunch of smaller games roled into one title. using half life 2 as a base, it edits its gameplay mechanics to create an entirely new experience for players, with even more content and creativity added in by the community. this is definitely a great go-to-game if you have some friends to play with and want an entertaining time waster.",112.6
"from cool mini-games and game-modes, to awesome mods, and the best-created maps there was, garrys mod has a ton in stock for the player to enjoy. trouble in terrorist town, murder, prop hunt, all well-created game modes, will entertain you for, a very, very, very long time. this is the coolest sandbox, where you can make almost anything, like a human slingshot, be anything, from a zombie to a tyrannasaurus rex, and see anything. (you get the point.) i recommend buying this, creators! if anyone doesnt have this game, i feel bad for you. 15/10",36.2

"this game is very satisfying it is full of new things each day i found myself playing it for 637hrs that is crazy and i havent noticed the game is very fun , it is not a serious game so if you are a serious gamer you might not enjoy it that much. the game is a fantastic game to play with friends , i would say if you play the game on your own you may miss some really enjoyable moments out. overall it is a laugh honest ( not in a bad way) it is a fantastic laugh you will lol so haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaard read before buying ps : get counter strike source aswell or it wont run that well so gmod i think its 6 with counter strike source which i think is like 10 but its always on special offers (thaaaanks steaaaaaaaaaam xd :) xxxx ) its worth buying !",746.3
"if youre one for playing a game that sort of requires minimal gaming skill (like this person) but have a functional mic and a likeable personality, then this game is a 100% must. after purchasing, i made more friends than i could have ever hoped for, being that the community is more or less completely welcoming of pretty much everyone - this is certainly for the awkward gamer who doesnt really know what to do with their time and needs a new outlet aside from minecraft! please purchase, and we hope to see you soon!",154.4

"it is the absolute utopia for sandbox games everywhere. garrys mod can be everything from making houses, to doing heists and capturing hostages. the multi-player is what i belive to be a key factor in this games success, it has so many different gamemodes that the people have made such as, roleplay, sandbox, racing, trouble in terrorist town (detective), if you can think of it, this game has it.",1391.5

"fun with friends. youll find yourself losing hours because youre enjoying yourself. it also has its downfalls.. needs a lot of mods to be interesting though. mod management is a pain and usually requires other games as well. only worth it if you have the time and games to set it up!",672.7

"gmod (garrys mod) has been a long time favorite of mine and i think its about time to right a review. basically, for the people that dont know/or cant tell, its a collection of games and ideas that was put into a sandbox. this game has developed over time (7 years, current date 12/27/2013), and has developed with the community. so many whacky, funny, interesting things can be added to this game and now with steam workshop, its just the click of the button. though i will say this, some versions of the game of been better than others, including the current version. but that doesnt stop it from being any less fun. this is a very good sandbox that i highly recommend for any hardcore or casual gamer.",151.9

"this is just tremendously fun. at the mere price of $10 (and an accompanying source game, but if youre on steam, you probably have one of them already), this is probably the most value ive ever gotten from a game. the core game is great for faffing about, but the add-ons (all free!) are where it really gets fun. want to race a lamborghini around dustbowl? go ahead! want to have a giant hatsune miku beat up godzilla with a crowbar? make it happen! and if theres some crazy idea you have that somebody else hasnt had already, you can make your own creations in lua script and import them into the game with ease. all i have to say is just buy it already.",116.5

"so much fun! play this with friends or random people! really do!",18.1
"this game has ruined my life. after sinking 395 hours into a game that i bought in a sale for 1.50, i really would reccomend this game. building silly contraptions to outright murdering your best friends, the game offers something to everyone. the addon library is huge, people upload dupes of their saves and contraptions so you can spawn them into your game and an amazing host of multiplayer game modes build on top of and improve a core game that is nearly ten years old.",429.5

"i love this game, i just need a better pc and more friends to enjoy it more.",35.6
"garrys mod is a physics sandbox. unlike regular games there arent any predefined aims or goals. we give you the tools and leave you to play. you spawn objects and weld them together to create your own contraptions - whether thats a car, a rocket, a catapult or something that doesnt have a name yet - thats up to you. if youre not too great at construction - dont worry! you can place a variety of characters in silly positions.",12.8

"this game has a lot of variety and many gamemodes. if you havent tried it, you should pick it up if its in a sale.",482.6
"this is a very fun game, but it is also unpolished. for half of the gamemodes, you need to buy source games to get the maps and textures. the addon lists are very strangely set up, but just messing about on this game is fun. 7/10",59.2
"best graphics ive eva seen on my pc! amazing sandbox and you can also play online with friends and different games! i strongly recommend this game to people if they love building and random ideas! :3 with probably a year of experiance playing garrys mod its the second best game ive eva played!",180.4
"one of the best games i have ever played and i just love it",107.3
"what can i say about garrys mod? umm.. nothing. the game is a mixture of epic, weird and funny! garrys mod sandbox is not a pretty girl to look at on its own, but the servers.. oh the servers. coming from gamemodes such as trouble in terrorist town, zmod, murder and every gmod tower gamemode... i just can not come without recommending this game. but if the workshop conetent and the ability to mod this game was to be cut from it, this would not be appealing at all. what drew people to this game is its simple and yet genious lua code. it can be modified but you cant live without seeing some pointers first! even i was a server host during time.. long long ago, and even tho i was new to the thing, lua drew me deeper and deeper in! so overall, garrys mod is a 10/10",471.1

"you dont know what you are missing out on...definitely the most expandable and ever-changing mod i have ever played. i normally get bored of games pretty quickly, but hence the amount of playtime i have with this, it has never ceased to stop entertaining me. the community is very diverse, and depending on what directions you take you will probably find your niche easy. some of the gamemodes play like they could be a game just by themselves, but in any means you can never get bored if you keep trying new things. and singleplayer/sandbox is already perfect enough in that matter, if you find the loading times worth it. very developer-friendly too, it uses lua and as time goes on more and more hooks are being updated and added. definitely worth a script-kiddies time.",2254.3
"this game, well where do i start? if i could try to convince you to buy this game for one reason it would be that this may be the only sandbox game or any game really with barrels that actually explode in it. i rate the barrels 9.56 out of 3 because of them. definetly worth buying if your into them. i should know i was once a barrel, but thats not what im here to tell you about im here to tell you about garrys incident. wait what, this is garrys mod? well screw it garrys mod has ummm pretty much anything you want in it. and literaly i mean anything. on that note i hope to see you in game... ill be wating for you. yes you the one reading this thinking wtf is wrong with this guy. you will find me in the sewers like a rat, with a barrel. always watching.....",820.0

"youre sitting here reading this review, when you could be sandboxing in this wonderful game. with mods. and addons. from sonic the hedgehog player models to excessively powerful nuclear bombs and everything in between, this game is one of the best to mess around with friends in. on top of the randomness you can encounter in sandbox alone, there are different gametypes create for garrys mod, such as rp games where you can mug somebody for their coffee.... mug. or trouble in terrorist town, a game where friends become foes and the traitors must eliminate the terrorists. soya. buy it.",242.2
"this game is great fun, there are hundreds of gamemodes within this game. this allows hours and hours of playtime as once you get tired of one gamemode you can just play another more interesting one. you may have already heard of this game from many highly known youtubers such as pewdiepie. the only issue is that this game is not for a truly casual gamer with litlle money to spend. this is because you need other games to be able to get all textues and items within the game. the number one other game you need to fix most problems is: cs:s. if you dont know what that is, then you shouldnt by this game.",536.5

"if you are going to get any game in steam i advice you to get this game it 6 and with special hoidays it drops to 1 it doesnt need a mega pc to run a simple pc will do it has many fan made games on like ttt and prop hunt but what i find cool you can make anything in sand box and with thousands of download content in the workshop you will never run out of ideas it allows you to add games on for more content for excample if you have team fortess 2 you will get all the models preinstalled, but it is heavy counter strike lots of content is counter strike but you can fix the errors by downloading the maps which can take time which make the game 9/10",809.2

"youre sitting here reading this review, when you could be sandboxing in this wonderful game. with mods. and addons. from sonic the hedgehog player models to excessively powerful nuclear bombs and everything in between, this game is one of the best to mess around with friends in. on top of the randomness you can encounter in sandbox alone, there are different gametypes create for garrys mod, such as rp games where you can mug somebody for their coffee.... mug. or trouble in terrorist town, a game where friends become foes and the traitors must eliminate the terrorists. soya. buy it.",242.2

"this game is like skyrim with combustable lemons. but in all seriousness, its a great game as it is guaranteed to run on many of the older machines but be careful of textures. i do not like at all how they handle the textures. you have to own certain games to have certain textures, and without the textures you either cant see the model or you have to look at black and pink squares.

"why do i like garrys mod? how could something so entirely simple be so amazingly fun. well garrys mod was most likely the best 10 bucks i didnt spend (gift from a friend). you see its not the building or concepts that make this game truly cherishable, but simply the people. the people who are mature and listen to you, and allow you to have a good time along with them in whatever gamemode you specialize in, darkrp, ttt, flood, sledbuild, etc. its as if each new game mode is a whole new game in itself, and it satisfies for endless hours unlike some things like some cod game. there is obviously the small downside of squeakers, but are you really going to let them ruin the game? play this game, buy it now, but dont buy it for the game, buy it for the people.",300.9

"this game isnt something you would think a game would be classified as. people normally think of a game as passing levels and earning coins, but garrys mod isnt like that. its a fun sandbox where you make the rules, you make the props, and you make the memories. you can mess around with your friends, or make masterpieces worth putting on the steam workshop. garrys mod helps build a strong support for you to unleash your imagination and build what you would be able to in real life. this game teaches you about taking one simple thing, and turn it into something interesting or new. garrys mod is why we still have creativity at the end of the day. 5/5.",614.8

"definetly worth it. the singleplayer is really fun, although i would like to see less of an influence of half-life 2 in it. 90% of the stuff is from that game. nevertheless, singleplayer alone is worth the price. multiplayer is just amazing, with gamemodes like trouble in terrorist town and prop hunt. it makes for endless replayability. the community is an integral part too, creating thousands of workshop items and hosting thousands of servers. all for $9.99? dont forget that it periodically goes on sale for as low as $2.50. definitely get it on sale, and also at face value. you wont be disappointed.",7.6

"game: garrys mod genre: life simulation review: garrys mod is a sequel to farm ville 2 and it keeps its promises. just like farm ville you have to farm for tomatoes, carrots and potatoes to level up your chicken. you can even coustumize your own chicken. there is a whole open world to explore. you can skate, swim, cook, go biking, learn how to drive, get married, cheat on your wife, kill, shop for carrots, buy a pet, go to a four hour long job interview, get a hard depression and a drinking problem, buy houses, kill dogs, kill cats, smell flowers, kill zebras and fish. but as you can imangine you run out of things to do pretty fast. all in all this pretty boring, but the mlg quickscope 1v1 battles make up for it. 10/10 enjoy the game",123.9

"honestly there is not a good reason to not own this game. the only problem is cs:s textures and you can download the textures, or just buy the game. the game lives with mods ranging from the humor and fun of darkrp to the suspenceful and shocking moments of ttt to haning out with friends in the theather mode watching funny memes on youtube beacuse you are afraid to leave your home to the endless possibilities of sandbox mode. this game has something for everybody. its like a wholesome family movie 10/10 a must have title",548.8

"its a great game with a addon for pretty much everything you could want. it does take quite a bit of getting used to the controls though, so that does make it a little harder. if there was less blood im pretty sure more people would be allowed to play it but i think its fine like that. i wish the pannel to spawn items was easier to navigate and it would be cool if you could make your own folders to sort things into so you know where everything is. other then that, it is a great game and i would recommend it to anyone 10+ also, the fact that you cant remove the dead bodies of the npcs gets kind of annoying... anyway i give this game a 8/10 for a great game thats a little confusing.",16.0

"it is so hard to even describe garrys mod, but i am going to try anyways. to say the least, garrys mod is very unique. just in a singleplayer sandbox session, it will right away stand out as different. you begin by playing around with the spawn menu, chaning things colors and turning off gravity, but just when you think youre starting understand it and you go to join a multiplayer server... boom... you see the list of gamemodes. it is a bit overwhelming. this is where gmod shines. it is so open source that third party developers are able to easily create these mini-games of sorts. they range from the fun and frantic trouble in terrorist town (ttt) to the serious darkrp. whatever your game style may be, i am sure that garrys mod can provide for it.",181.6

"pros: this game is probably one of the best sandbox game ive ever played. i think the price is right, i mean, you can get so many addons to the game. cons: lots of glitches, although they do not effect gameplay. if your screen is wider than most screens, the mouse will not show up on the screen. the gamemodes are really cool, like prop hunt, trouble in terrorist town (ttt one of my favourites) and sandbox. overall, this game has got to be the most creative game since minecraft (that craze ended ages ago!) you can build airplanes, exploding watermelons, guns, cars and much more. this game, i must say is not that fun without addons, so i reccommend getting some addons before you start playing. thanks! have fun!!",217.8

"gmod... where to begin? there is so much you can do. i have 15 hours logged already and thats on the murder playmode alone. so much fun. basically, theres one murderer with a knife (which he can also throw) and everyone else is a bystander. one bystander starts with a gun which you use to kill the murderer. it has to reload after one shot. (the murderer obviously has to kill all the bystanders). you can also find 5 green-glowing props around the map to get yourself a gun. just one of the many gamemodes in gmod. rating: 10/10 definitely would recommend to everyone. i usually play for story. i dont even play fps games online like that but wow gmod is addicting.",57.0

"its a fun game, but maps that are used in the multiplayer menu that have the tag cs, hp, etc at the beginning of their name have some serious texture glitches and make the game very hard on the eyes. this occurs every time in the games called ttt (trouble in terrorist town), prop hunt, and murder. you cant really see where youre going or what everything is, making the game difficult and frustrating to play. while i like this game a lot, you will need to buy the more expensive gmod/counter strike combo to actually play it flawlessly. if the makers of this game can fix this, or if someone in the workshop can possible make a fix, that would be awesome! but regardless, id recommend this game.",48.1

"one of the randomest games ive ever played. there is no point to gmod other then to mess around with the physics, props, and well just about any thing else in the source engine. just note the game does require certain other source games for some content. that being said this game is really fun and you can do any number of things in it. you can pose ragdolls and make screenshots or comics, build ny number of crazy things, or just roleplay with and or shoot your friends. there are an insane number of mods for this game ranging from maps to weapons to more props to whole new gamemodes. there are infinite ways to play this game. 9/10 a few suggested gamemodes for the curious: -prophunt -trouble in terrorist town -murder -hide and seek -the stalker",195.6

"have not spent too much time on this game, but the time i did spend was extremely enjoyable. playing with friends made this game iconic. it is a great game to hop on to and start goofing off. there are plenty of gamemodes and different ways to enjoy the time spent on this game. unfortunately, my one gripe about this game is the fact that you sometimes require other games in order to see the object from those others games in this one. they should have just included the remaining files with this game and made it possible to play without owning any other games. besides that, seriously consider buying this game, especially if you have friends to enjoy it with.",39.9

"if there was a never ending game, this would be it. if the sheer amount of things to do in game doesnt catch your eye, such as posing, animation, mulitplayer, etc., then the amount of community based content should keep you coming back for more! the only problem is that youre going to need games with the source engine in order for it to work properly. other than that, this is easily one of the steam esstinals.

"starting out originally as a mod for half-life 2, it went pretty far. the game allows you to toy with props from games like half life, counter strike, and other valve games. you can download addons that ads to the games environment. making it even more interesting. there are gamemodes that can even make the better. it may seem boring at first, but soon youll be playing it all day. although there is no storyline, it works amazingly. there are glitches, but that wont be a big problem. i would rate it five out of five.",257.6
