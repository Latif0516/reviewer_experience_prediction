"get this game if you love repeatedly hearing sounds of fire in the hole!, not respawning after you die and having to deal with players hundreds of times better than you when you first begin playing. if you enjoy a game of frustration with a terrible community who will look down on you for not having reflexes like a cyborg, this is the right game for you. also, if you dont already have this game, you are a . please either buy it or leave steam immediately.",1325.1

"how to be cs:go pro 1. buy c-s 2. launch it up and leave it on for 2 weeks straight 3. get over 100 hours of c-s and then brag about it on your next cs:go comp game how you played with the best pros back in the day 10/10 still best game and s better than cs:go",228.3

"this game is very good and is fast paced especially with 30 other people! there is a money system where when you kill someone or do the mission objective you earn money. with that money you can buy guns. powerful weapons are expensive and not as powerful weapons are cheap! there are 2 main game modes but plenty of maps! the players are friendly but competetive! i highly recomend this game.",7.6
