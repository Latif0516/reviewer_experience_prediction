"legendary game with absoludly fantastic gameplay :) i spent about 2000h on nonsteam version of this game and then i bought it, becose i got a respect to the developers and becose i loved and i still love this game. 11/10 there wont be any same and great game as 1.6.",102.2
"the good old counterstrike never seems tiring and boring. i still play it till date alongwith counterstrike : global offensive. valve should release update for the remaining bugs and glitches and revamp the graphics keeping the gameplay same.",1032.8

"when _orange_ maps were but a far off concept and nipper ruled the world. seriously, get all the nipper maps. especially the crazytanks. 9/10",1.4

"this is the beginning. this is where all started. awesome game of all times. up until cs:go came out, no other fps shooter compared to this games phisics.",290.9
"cs 1.6 it will search for you. it will find you. and someone in the game will probably kill you. if you are noob that is. 10/10 would kill noobs again.",19.0
"pewpew shuuuuuuuuuuuu bbudubudbudbudbubudu pfoooooooom headshot counter strike 1.6, one of the games i played the most thats for sure. from my own experience, as most of the gamaes, counter strike is best played in team, with friends, it makes things more fun and interesting. but you can have fun playing alone too ofcourse, just not as much (only my opinion here). it may be annoying in the beginning, but as you start to get the hang of it youll start to enjoy it too.",1279.8

"although it has poor animations and graphics, it is still one of the most played games, and its still running. this game is created to test out players reflexes. with great skills, comes great victories. put your skills to the test with this counter strike, one of the best first player shooting game ever released, with more than 1000 of servers online 24/7.",432.6
"fun classic game involiving alot of strategy and team tactics. hard to get used to.",11.7

"aaah, keep spending so much money on this game hahaha, love it though",1.1
"plz delete my cfg of cs16 in cloud cant do nothing black screen",21.3
"classical, if you looking for the basics you should start with this game. good community and lots of fun. the gameplay is easy but can be repetitive after a few hours, but there are so many servers with so many modes that it cant be boring for more than 10 minutes.",1404.0
"spent many years playing this game and it was amazing. console commands and the simplistic gameplay makes it a great game. mods such as wc3, uwc3, shero make the game half fps half rpg which i loved :). however, like most fps, hackers ruin the game and is probably the main reason for the low population aside from the repetitiveness.",243.4
"they should just rename this awp and deagle game, because those are the only two ing weapons that you will ever use in it.",0.7
"old classic - if you starting with counter-strike adventure, start with 1.6 - its a good start from zero to hero!",769.8
"running this at 60fps doesnt really help seeing as how the animations are at about 15fps. gotta respect the classics though.",2.0
"best game ever, ever. destroyed by hackers(cheaters).",394.3
"if you want to be a pro in team fortress 2 , you must be a pro in this first . dont ever stop playing this.this will make you a true sniper :d",398.2

"the reason why you should be using steam in the first place.",1.9
"i get my  wooped by people who have been playing since electricity was discovered.",26.7
"very fun game, graphics are disappointing and just not nice, i personally live in israel, israel has a lot of multiplayer servers and their sons loads admit most enjoyable so it makes up for the graphics ... also has the option to fight against bots you can practice with it or simply pass the time, i wish there was such a nice single player. so in short, if you are looking for a game with many indians, multiplayer servers, easy and fun then this is the game for you!",395.6
"my favorite fps shooter, i think i will never stop zooming because aim is not for me at all =] p.s im awper...",254.3
"after all this years playing on ns i finally bought it ! good game worth the money. totally recommended !",117.5
"one of the first first-person shooter games i ever played, and im so glad it was. this game was amazing and i easily clocked 1000 hours over the years of playing. for its price now, you should definitely buy it. source is good and all, but the original of the series is the best, by far.",366.0
"well, this game is kinda old school, but still gold, like this, im playing it like from 2009, but im still likeing it.",654.4
"best online shooter ive played also because you can mod it for fun. this game takes more skill than a multitude of other games and for anyone to ever miss out on this game is doing a complete disservice to onesself note to get the original onscreen multiplayer skins set the game models to not be hd in the video options menu",103.8
"this is a great game, made in 2000 and still has a reasonably high amount of players. definitely recommend buying.",10.6
"just amazing <3.. most complete first person shooter game :d",838.7
"bought and played a generation too late. it makes me sad to stare at the empty servers.... those ones actually have good maps... all i have are the 24/7 dust 2 maps.... oh well, still, this game is one of the best.",117.0
"this game is the game that started the counter-strike series. it started as a mod for the game that started it all, half-life. like team fortress, counter-strike became a standalone game after its popularity as a mod. if you enjoy the old half-life engine, goldsrc, and want to play a shooter that doesnt have a complicated story and chapters, counter-strike is the game for you. condition zero is the same game but with a campaign mode that allows you to play with bots and unlock maps as you go.",0.3
"if you were a fan of this game back in the day youll feel nostalgic and want to buy it but dont, it doesnt hold up if youve done any gaming of any sort since then.",1.3
"ill say one thing... its a challenge and like that im sombody that isnt really good at this game but i can still mange to get that rewarding 3 kills or headshot.imo i think that this a good game challenging but rewarding in the for me that is. im 13 years old and i just came from cz and i like it. more severs than cz so more fun.",88.1
"why cant i run counter strike 1.6? its running half-life and gives me some kind of error message, and then i press ok on that, and it closes down...what the hell?!",1278.9
"nearly noone plays it anymore but it is still the best!",706.0
"steam is what it is today because of this game! 10/10",24.4
"ya cant play it on windows 8, wow fail #windows8fail #geezewindows8beabetterperson #cstho #jailbreaktho #memories #mems #windows7 ##.",235.5
"one of the best fps games ive ever played, still doesnt compare to many games out there for me. just hate the fact that its pretty much dead here.",88.3
"probably my favourite game in the series. has a more arcady feel to it, probably give it a miss if youre into realistic shooters and maybe get go instead. if youre more of a quake guy like me then its worth it, but probably wait until a sale before you buy.",56.4
"best game ever created! i may not play anymore, but this game will always have a place in my heart...",98.1
"fire in the hole. i hear that so many times. 10/10 the game that revolutionized multiplayer first person shooters.",6.7

"the best realism half-life mod as its the one everyone remembers. causing incalculable rage in dialup users for years and years. if youre bad youre a nub, if youre good youre a hacker, if youre just mediocre then youre just right.",3.3
"probably this game doesnt need any introduction, old and good, still played by a large number of gamers, on of the best online shooter that was created. still remember my first days finding a good version of the game and playing with bots.",31.2
"without a doubt, in my top 10 games ever. without cs, my life wouldve been a lot different. this game is freaking amazing, and i remember playing hundreds, and hundreds of hours in the 1.6 version. playing dust2, dust, aztec, inferno.... man those were the good days. if youre even checking the reviews out, you should buy it. not because you will be playing it for hundreds of hours now that its old, but just so you can get that vintage feel. like the smell of a vintage t-shirt. 10/10 must have for anyone calling themselves a gamer.",0.4
"i love this game since 2006 when i played it first time. im playing it still and its 2014! this game rocks!",906.2
"the best game ever, since 6 years ago playing this game.",725.9

"this game is absolutely amazing! even though the graphics are not one of the best but still the game gained popularity. if you will know how to play counter-strike it will be easy for you to play other games. and there is no game like counter-strike ( in my opinion) that will give you pleasure when you are doing 5 kills and all are headshots and im 100 % sure that this game is a legend!!!",86.5
"this game is the game of the millenium...its the only game that is played from 2000 to today. every pc is capable to play this game, even the one that didnt got their driver updated on 2003(probably). so yeah, if you are a fan of old-school, this game is for ya.",31.5
"the game that started it all for me. simple and to the point is how i would discribe it. bad guys vs good guys, eliminate the team and take your place in the cs hall of fame. i ended up playing this game for a professional team in the cpl tournaments.",11.7

"the game is good, but not a lot of people play the original anymore. if you dont have any friends who play this one, stick to cs source, because the few servers in the original that are populated are not exactly your standard modes usually. but a good competitive shooter none-the-less",1.2
