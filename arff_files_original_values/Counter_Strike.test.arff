"very fun game, graphics are disappointing and just not nice, i personally live in israel, israel has a lot of multiplayer servers and their sons loads admit most enjoyable so it makes up for the graphics ... also has the option to fight against bots you can practice with it or simply pass the time, i wish there was such a nice single player. so in short, if you are looking for a game with many indians, multiplayer servers, easy and fun then this is the game for you!",395.6

"+ competetive. easy to play. can include ai for training. tons of servers/server plugins/custom maps/even custom guns. fun to play, always. - little repeating. in overall, i recommend it to everyone, please do not judge this game for graphics and/or lack of military actions, goldsrc engine is not real virtuality 3 ( arma 2 engine ), and this game is old school, typical classic so graphics are what they are.",460.8

"a still alive first-person shooter, since 2000. the game that changed everything, along with half-life. still, the best first-person for thousands. and you know why? because this games focus isnt on graphics. its for having fun with your friends, or, even aim for world turnaments. all proffesional teams, such as fnatic, navi, sk, still play counter-strike, doesnt matter if it is 1.6, source or global offensive. highly recommend this game.",1959.1

"every counter-strike is a must buy. not only are they all really fun, but it is really interesting to see the progression of them. 1.6 is the start of the series, and i thoroughly recommend looking up and downloading the original beta maps from 1999 like docks as they were originally part of the game (although most of them removed due to unfair map design [except docks]). cs 1.6 is a fun game, but if you arent interested in playing older games then i wouldnt bother, source and global offensive are newer and more replay-friendly games.",1.7
