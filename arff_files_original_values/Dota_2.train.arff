"great for casual gamers. my favorite dota 2 hero is soraka who s2 games should nerf because hes so powerful. with enough micro sniper is immensely powerful but he is countered by early blink stalkers. rook is a really cool character because ashe can get bonus range from his towers. much better than the riot games trash game demigod. the maps in dota 2 are really cool, especially the aram map howling abyss because baron nashor and kongor can destroy people. however soraka still goats the coolest hoof and his eclipse ultimate has a lot of power.",546.4

"for anyone wanting to play this game, prepare for it to suck your soul away!(in a good sense.) the gameplay is addictive and no two matches are the same. however, the gameplay is diffrent from most games in the sense of the stratagy and the skills of your hero. essentially, theres two teams of 5 heros in the game, and the battle out in 3 lanes, im not going to explain these terms, as thats something you should see for yourself, or reasearch for yourself if you want to know more. 10/10: game of the year all day everyday.",483.1

"dota.... dota has its times where you play with your friends with a max team of 5... however things happe. when alone you are swarmed with asians, mexicans, russians , and maybe even aliens who would know. also aliens will watch and learn about the people in this world by peoples name calling and yelling. you will be screamed at by other languages and dont know what is going on. then you will be in games with blamers that blame everything on you. filled with racism and yelling 10/10",739.4

"this is very high quality game. graphics are very detailed and good. but still, you can play on low quality and enjoy. the thing about this game is, that while starting , you wait too much time : match searching and player waiting. players often fail to connect. second thing, if you like rpg games, the fact that someone can be first and take the hero that you like, want will be terrible. and to be short, if you dont have enough free time to spend (40 min-1hour) on match, dont start it, if you leave , you wll recieve abandon and ruin your teams game (butin reality no one knows is it ruining or helping , couse in late game, money is everything and your money will be spreaded between your teammates). so yea you should try this game if you like competition and sometimes rage :)",356.6
"miner hamsters and 3 bears!? sign me the  up 10/10 would",1357.0
"dota can be described in two words fun and annoying. dota is a game that not only helps you with your team work but also gets you closer to your friends as you work together to win the match. although that might seem cool dota is also a stressful game that when you screw up everybody on the server screams at you calling you noob etc. trust me this will happen. i rate dota 2 a: 9/10 this game is a masterpiece",352.1

"this is not a game, this is a tournament sport. go in at your own risk, as this game is quite unforgiving and should be played with a full team. fun will be determined by how good you and your team is... not by overall gameplay. ignore the veterans that try to pull you in, this game is not for casuals... this is strictly a professional sport... if you want to have fun, go play something else.",736.8

"dota 2 promises to take the unique blend of online rts and rpg action that has made dota popular with tens of millions of gamers and expand upon it in every way. this is a competitive moba game of action and strategy, played both professionally and casually by millions of passionate fans worldwide. players pick from a pool of over a hundred heroes, forming two teams of five characters. radiant heroes then battle their dire counterparts to control a fantasy landscape, waging campaigns of cunning, stealth, and outright warfare.",285.0

"one needs to be somewhat fond of moba games to really like dota 2, but if you do, this game is for you. now that its free it is just extra awesome. the graphics are great and the gameplay is awesome. no game is the same. a warning though: new players will be scolded for dying and the learning curve is pretty harsh. but once you understand the game pretty well it becomes one of the most awesome games youll ever play.",1234.0
"dota 2 is an very addictive game for lovers of the dota-mod for warcraft 3 ! :3 you can recieve skins for your heros without buying anything ;3 itz not a pay to win game and it would be amazing if more gamers would play this beautiful piece of software ! :d much greetings, datsik <3",2000.2

"verry good game spent 4000 hours of my life for this",598.6
"the moba equivalent of getting kicked in the , repeatedly, for hours on end, until little remains of what could resemble genitalia. however, the truly astonishing part, is that this wasnt torture, but done through your own volition; you wanted to made miserable. hell, you probably paid for it a little. every game brings such traumatic pain and anguish, this game should be considered a war crime. psychologists have analyzed why dota players put themselves through this kind of hell, and all tests have come up inconclusive. this game has caused the perpetual virginity of thousands of people. friendships have been ruined, careers lost, and marriages have ended, all because of this game. dear god, get rid off this awful blight on humanity. only the dead can know peace from this evil... 10/10 i recommend this game to all my friends!",388.1

"game where ingenuity, creativity and aggression merge to form something stellar.",936.6
"approaching 2100 hours played...wow. while i do completely agree with the reviews that talk about how bad the community is, i have to say my experience of dota on the whole has been very enjoyable. the mute option is great, i insta-mute anyone talking crap. admittedly dota has an incredibly high learning curve, and you will often find high level players playing on noob accounts so even the early matches for new players can be brutal. if you can push through the first couple of hundred hours of games ;) and ignore the torrent of expletives thrown your way when you let the team down!; you will find dota 2 to be a: competitive, intense, challenging, and completely engaging experience.",2380.1
"remember when you had a life? i dont and thats all thanks to dota 2",2527.6

"spending a year learning to shuffle a gaggle of fantasy heroes up dotas teetering stack of rules and game mechanics will do that to you: weve developed a secret language of our own, one that runs parallel to the talk of creeps and lanes and farm and rax common to everyone who plays the game. whack a ward on the donkletron im going to stick one up their jungle is a sentence i can say out loud and be completely understood by at least those three people. for some reason, theres also a lot of singing involved. its a lot like being a sailor.",208.1
"much russians in american servers. such scrubs in games. quite fun. what a great learning tool for new language. 10/10 recommend it if you love to be a pro player like me, ggwp ez scrubs i win commend me.",735.5

"reviews for dota 2:rosetta stone for gamers - if you hate russia, think league of legends is too mainstream, and have a lot of time to waste, this is the game for you. - best language learning tool ever especially for the following languages: portugese, russian, and every language in the entire eu! - i didnt know valve made language games.... - before dota 2, my friends called me a wannabe hipster, but now im a genuine hipster, unlike all of those lol playing imbeciles",155.3
"like almost any other moba out there, its free unless you want any of your looks customized. i only played a handful of matches, and being at least semi-literate in both moba uis and old custom warcraft and starcraft maps, i can in no way recommend this game to anyone but the most hardcore of moba fans. the ui is unintuitive, the shop is a mess to look at if youre new, and you will likely get your face smashed in by even the computer-controlled players time and time again while you punishingly learn every little thing it takes to be good at this game. if you have never played a moba, if you dont have a friend who already plays this and can walk you through what to do, do not try this game. if you really love mobas and are looking for a new one, yes, definitely try this and i hope you enjoy it. i did not, not even remotely.",3.5
"i have to admit its a pretty fun game, after playing it for a while, it really does feel like most of the heroes are completely unbalanced. if youre going against an experienced team or even higher difficulty bots, youre bound to struggle and get frustrated. im kind of on and off with this game, but i uninstalled and really dont feel like playing again. new players are going to find this game hard to play, especially when matched with more experienced players, it takes time to even figure out what to do most of the game after starting and before ending. everyone should at least try it!",239.6
"you can play a game, and get destoryed. but atleast you learn russian! 10/10 it was medicore - ign",424.3
"yes because it was a amazing game and annoying game",1039.5
"why did i get the message  unable to load version from steam info when i load the game. can someone solve this problem?",349.8
"its a purgatory simulator based on the existential novel no exit, in which you are trapped in a game with 9 other people who hate you. you spend your time killing the same enemies, who spawn every 30 seconds for all eternity, until you have amassed an arbitrary amount of gold/items with which you kill the other team. the worst 2 players in the game are blamed for every mistake made and ridiculed without mercy, while the player with the highest kill/death ratio (often times not the best player) calls you a  for the 60 minute duration. its a nice game and i highly recommend it.",541.3
"its a really fun game, but you must never play the following -drow ranger -riki -spirit breaker -huskar -meepo -slark if you play these heroes, then your a scrub",553.7
"awesome if you want to have no life pretty much ever again... takes a long time to get used to but once you do? youll wish you never did.",2894.9

"played for a few months daily, learned fluent spanish, portugese. thank you volvo for this very great language learning program. 10/10",854.9
"if you want to play a moba game other then league of legends, then you should wait no longer. dota 2 is an excellent moba game with alot of exciting events. unlike league of legends you can play every hero in dota 2 without paying for it. you dont have to buy any hero. you can collect cosmetic items for your hero in dota 2. you are eligible to find items after you finished a game. you can find items like chests, couriers, hero gear/weapons and much more. there is also a ingame shop where you can buy cosmetic items, but this is optional.",1911.4

"this game is amazing and its way better than lol. it is aweosme sfgetegsgf get it",1117.9
"most played game. never-ending learning. versatile. great artwork and animation. aggressive, naive, cocky, idiotic players fill the community but most of your mates are probably playing and you just add the good people you meet along the way. pick your supports first!",1783.0
"many people argue about wether dota 2 is better or league of legends. i play both (dota more) and i wouldnt say dota is better. there are many differences between the games and the main one is strategy. in league of legends vision is required and map awareness is essential however in dota, position matters a lot more than lol. since the 4th minute on, in dota everybody is ganking around the place and tp supports are coming in to survive ganks. in lol it is a lot simpler. farm, kill, push mid. in dota you have to think, constantly watch the map, counter draft, counter build, position yourself and rotate correspondingly. in lol there are many lacking features such as, vision obstruction (hills and trees) missing, diverse range of active items and ability types. if you want a simple, just play game go for lol, but you are a a strategic player and look for osmething that truly tests your skill id recommend dota 2.",500.3

"dota 2 is like driving a car. (they have similar intensity) you have to look at minimap like wing mirrors you have to look at chat like looking rear-view mirror the more intense game becomes, is like the more you drive into big city or complex places in rush hours the less you know about what each hero can do or how the game play, is like not knowing roads/streets or even shortcuts ****if you dont care about winning (zero percent), then it is like you driving a trashy car and crash to other cars and you simply run away. (you just might got caught)***** the game is full of possibilty and it is well balanced. but its just that most people just like to driving to some same places rather than the rest of the places because its easier reach the destination without stress.",740.9
"this game improved so much since it was released on the beta. there are over 90 heroes to choose from currently and the gamplay is as intence and as rewarding as dota 1. i know alot of people will be hesitant to try it at first but there has been a new tutorial system implemented in dota 2 and i think it will help new comers. i know some people who play lol might bash in this game, but both games are compleatly different. its like comparing cod and battlefield, they are so different that connot be compared. (no preference on either game, i think bot of them are good) give this game a try, the learning curve is very steep but it is rewarding when you learn. i think this is the best gave valve has ever developed and has been the most played game on steam ever since the second year of beta development. try it out, its free and badass!",2758.9

"dota or defense of the ancients, was the first of its kind, and originally started off as a warcraft 3 custom map but it quickly grew to become one of the most popular games in the world as well as spawning a whole new genre which we know today as mobas. the game is simple, 5v5, 3 lanes and both teams objective is to destroy the other teams ancient. there are over 100 heroes in the game each with their own unique skills and attributes and forming a well rounded team with synergy is key to victory. closing notes - the community can be awful. you will get yelled at, flamed and even reported for making mistakes. if you can overcome this, the game is amazing.",316.5

"the game is free so yeah, what can you lose? it can be fun to play but it can be horrible sometimes. and yea that depends on a lot of things. communication is the key and if u play casually you will find out that in most games no one speaks in your team. just pinging and commands. or they start speaking in some foreign language ( blyet) and that will not help at all. in the ranked games its a little bit better. the learning phase can be long but if you have some experiences with other mobas it wont be that tough. basically the game itself has no problems if you ask me. the problem is with the community of the game.",1972.1

"this kind of games is not my cup of tea, in spite of that i like dota more and more. why? game is not about stupid clicking, how i thought, but if you want to win, you have to strategize and combine special abilities of 5 unique heroes. so if you are not a team player, the game is not for you. the graphics is really nice, but there are some negatives too. the tutorial is very tacky and discourages players from playing more than helps them. the game is very hard and chaotic for newbies. but if you understand to the game a bit, youll have a great fun. mainly with a couple of friends. moreover the game is free to play, so the conclusion is that i recommend dota 2.",33.4

"this game will beat the living crap out of you when you start. but if you give it time, it becomes one great game for you to play over and over again. all the heroes are free to play to begin with so youll find a character that fits your playstyle. there are plenty of tactics and items for you so you will not get the same experience. there are also the cosmetics that cn make your characters unique. you can buy them, or you can play matches and earn them by completing them. it is a game that will be addictive but it is good none the less.",1678.5

"started out playing dota on the old wc3 engine and i played that for 7+ years before i shifted into dota 2 with the beta. dota 2 offers much more than the original wc3 version in terms of graphics and gameplay, as the old engines hero and skill interactions were hampered by limitations (dota allstars was just a custom map). cosmetics, tournaments, and streaming are all seamlessly integrated; and are constantly being improved at the behest of the community. the game is a bit hard to get into at first, but after you have the basics down, youll play for an innumerable amount of time. adding friends into the mix for crazy strategies and plays increases the replayability and enjoyment of the game to another level. one of the best games. ever.",1777.6

"if riding around on a big hairy creature, bashing people with a hammer is your thing, dota 2 has you covered. sort of. dota 2 offers a huge array of characters that enable players to take roles that are in their wheelhouse. whether you like sneaking and ganking, smashing through the frontlines, or sitting back and supporting your team from a distance, there are characters that do all that and more. what immediately strikes me about dota, to coin a hideously overused clich, is that its easy to learn, but difficult to master. while the game is generally forgiving, the players are much less so. as with all multiplayer games, the experience of playing with others can be a bit of a mixed bag. the most important thing to remember about dota 2 is this: its not about winning, its about losing stylishly to progressively more back-breaking, marrow-sucking odds.",1881.9

(too many , griefers) --> you make 1000 good moves in a game, and you wont be recognized. go feed once and get reported. --> you will start putting aside other priorities. ty dota2. --> to sum it up, it has a  community like most other mobas, unless you are insanely good at the game. 10/10 recommended! best game ever played!",2817.3

"this game is definately worth the price: free. the community is friendly and willing to teach if youre new to the genre. if youve played any rts game in the past ten years, youll be able to figure this game out pretty easily. with around 100 heroes and counting, this game has a great deal of variety and will always be challenging. unlike many free to play games, this games micro-transaction model is aesthetic only. there are no huge powerups or big weapons or purchases of in-game currency that will give the payer an edge over others. this game is very much the antithesis of the pay-to-win model.",309.3

"a pulchritudinous looking game, it is definitely my personal favorite moba game yet. it has a huge hero roster, is completely free (the only possible transactions result in aesthetic changes), requires coordinated teamwork and has a huge fan base and community. that said, you should be wary of many of the players, as many are extremely negative and will work to frustrate and annoy you in whatever way possible. in many cases you will feel that an opponent is overpowered, or a particular hero is cheap, but i can assure that in 95% of these cases, that is not true. i would also highly recommend that you learn the basics first and complete the tutorial, because your first few games are gonna be rough; you will probably get crushed into the finest paste youve ever been in your life.",1708.7

"it is an amazing game but there are two very negative points about it. one of them, and the most prominant one, is the lack of optimization for the mac version. the mac version, simply put, sucks. it does not do justice that this version is so incredibly buggy on the osx operating system. plus, when moving the camera on the top part of the display when in full screen on osx, the game glitches as it is invoking the status bar.",4.8

"ahhh.... dota 2. this game is severaly unbalanced since no matter how well you play, your team will always blame you for the loss. it is also insanely luck based because the team that gets most russians usually looses. a lot of functions in this game are completely broken as well. for example, even if you pick english in the language bar everyone still speaks russian. sometimes german or french, but never english. playing this game i had a few mental breakdowns and smashed three windows in total. it sometimes feels like my life is fading away and i imagine life in prison with a really musculine in-mate would provide the same level of . to sum up, this is game is ing terrible. 10/10 would recommend.",1273.5

"well for starters, take a look at my total hours played. that should tell you how much i like this game. i honestly find the idea of a moba very appealing. although there might be other games out there in the genre that (dare i say it) are better than dota 2, i still find dota 2 to be the one game i always go back too. the game mechanics are solid, the character balancing is always changing, adding new depths to the gameplay, and many of the players in dota are relatively laid back. is dota 2 the best game in the world? probably not. is dota 2 the game i have spent 1000+ hours on and will probably spend another thousand on? absolutely.",2262.9

"originally a warcraft 3 mod, this highly influential arena style game has inspired many spin offs including the acclaimed league of legends. unlike league of legends however, you can control all 112 heroes when you buy the game, and there is no pay to win features at all; all bonus items are purely cosmetic and for fun. the community can even create content that can be acquired in game! the only shortcoming to dota is that it will be a little more difficult to pick up compared to league of legends. given the chance however, dota2 will prove to be a much more balanced and skill-oriented experience, with meaningful item and ability selection and a more dynamic gold farming game which both provide superior short and long term strategic gameplay. try the one that started it all, you wont be disappointed!",277.5

(no preference on either game, i think bot of them are good) give this game a try, the learning curve is very steep but it is rewarding when you learn. i think this is the best gave valve has ever developed and has been the most played game on steam ever since the second year of beta development. try it out, its free and badass!",949.5
