"pretty fun at times, good graphics and just like the good ole counter strike source :)",370.6
"could be the only fps that is truley skill based, if you want to win, you have to play smart, know the maps, and have wicked good aim and reflexes. every kill feels like an achievement :) every now and then youll play with people that will irritate the **** out of you, and play against people that you are convinced are hacking. if you lose a match, blame your team or the lag, or the hackers on the other team ;) if you win a match, the other team will blame their team or the lag. they may call someone in your team a hacker! oh, and the virtual knives in this game cost more than real knives.

"really good game. worthwhile and entertaining. it can be addictive at times, but if you can control yourself, it can be a rewarding experience.",68.0
"i find it funny how the new cs is still cheaper than the old one.",358.6
"perhaps your friends have been playing counter-strike since you were young and your buddies tell you, hey why dont we get the new counter-strike?. well, dont. cause you are complete : you are junk. while your friends get to ak, you just twiddle your thumbs with your gold nova. keep it real and play a shooting game you can win at: goldeneye 64.",151.5
"every since its beginnings as a humble half-life mod, cs has been one of my favorite (if not my favorite) fps games of all time. at the time of counter-strikes creation there was no other fps game like it. it truly gave a sense of skill & accomplishment no other fps game could reward you with. there is a huge learning curve in this game where its somewat easy to learn, but very hard to master. fast forward to this day to counter-strike: global offensive and you will see that in this case it is no different. the weapons however have changed with a few additions and tweaks. if you decide to play this game, ill warn you now... prepare to die... alot!",106.9
"so i get into a game right, everyone agreed on knife round so we did and you know that one person starts shooting, so next round we didnt agree on knife round and people are knifing so i shoot and get kicked for it plus a lot of the poeple on here take the game way to serious its fun but it can get bull  to. i recommend it and at the same time i dont recommend it. score wise maybe 6/10.",84.7
"+ well. its a counter-strike game (that means its amazing). it looks better, than cs 1.6, and css. i really like the new assistance feature (i hate when you take someone 98 hp and than suddenly noob appears and kill him with the biggest crap gun that could be bought in that round at all), plus some new tactic equipment (as decoy grenade or molotov coctail) is quite refreshing. another great stuff is that you can watch official matches in the menu, and achievements are well written. some new guns. - on the other hand, this game still miss something i cant properly describe. lets just say i am having more fun when playing the good old cs 1.6 instead of this.",10.3
"this game is quite cute. you shoot people sometimes. 99% of the time your bullets wont go where you are aiming, but thats ok. i still love this game. if you are the type of person who enjoys gambling way too much, dont start opening any weapon cases. you will become addicted. i cant think of much else to say. ggwp.",444.8
"my grandfather smoked his whole life. i was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, if you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately.. tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. he gave it up immediately. three years later he died of lung cancer. it was really sad and destroyed me. my mother said to me- dont ever smoke. please dont put your family through what your grandfather put us through. i agreed. at 28, i have never touched a cigarette. i must say, i feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway.",224.3
"counter-strike: global offensive is an addictive shooter with a steep learning curve. the series has been true to their original strength, giving old-schoolers the chance to pick this game up quite easily and new people the opportunity to experience its never-ending greatness.",424.0
"someone spend 1500$ on cases and didnt get a rare item. 10/10 would recommend",271.9
"i have played cs:s in the past and decided to get this game. didnt know if my pc could run it that well. i was surprised. i never knew that counter strike could get better! i could run it perfectly, and i have an old pc. great game. get it!",120.2
"a balance of skill, speed, and tactics that has yet to be matched by any other fps. this is the perfect blend of traditional cs with modern game elements. steep learning curve for the uninitiated, but a great, great competitive game.",234.4
"this is basically an exact clone of super mario world for the snes, if you liked that game, youll love this one. its the same , but like with more level, and slightly higher res textures, the soundtrack was better on the prequel tho. if you like mario, youll love it",599.4
"great graphics, gameplay, development, and the best part is... you can get tons and tons of money off of it :3",565.0
"if you like 1.6, youll definitely enjoy this game.",1655.0

"wanna learn polish and russian? well then this game is for you! in a really short time i learned words like: kurwa!, kutas!, bliad, axaxaxax and lots of more words. 10/10 recommended for people that is looking for a fun way to learn polish and russian.",459.1

"crappy d2-like mm, and of course counter strike cant live without  camos and kills tracking versions of weapons. moar hatz and crates",231.0
"this game is awesome when i first got this game i thought it would just be call of duty or somthing but when i played it boy i was wrong. this game has actual team effort the game is realistic and the maps are so fun to learn and play. skins are cheap and cool to get but some are like 100 dollars and i think people actually buy that o_o. overall the game is fantastic. pros: realistic,fun,many fun community maps, etc cons: some people are  bags lots and lots of idle servers people brag and brag and brag about there skins -dogdude",313.0
"in this beautiful game by volvo you take the role of either the terror-filled isrealis or the guys who are chasing them. everybody has a big nerf battle as the terror-filled israelis try to put their pda on a big spray-painted a/b on the ground. this can go one of two ways. 1) their pda downloads a freak virus and explodes and the game mistakenly calls the israelis terrorists, or 2) the chasing guys find the pda and push buttons and again the game calls the israelis terrorists and worse: calls them losers. 11/10 would download a virus onto an exploding pda again.",65.5
"10/10 would bang again, put a crap ton of money into it like on an insane level and lost most of it to betting. cry every time. but still fun to spend all your life trying to rank up.",282.1
"99.9% of silver rank players in cs:go say that they cannot get out of silver because they get bad teammates........lies",522.6
"extremely smart fps, and it is extremely nice to see a game that doesnt have the usual call of duty game-play. ton of achievements, steam workshop accessibility, and hours of unique fun to be had.",21.2
"this game is the bees knees. all the game modes in csgo are fun to play and competitive. highly recommend this game and advise one to give it more than a day to get used to, once mastered it can be endless fun",939.4
"i havent played any cs until this game. i bought it about 1.5 years after it gout launche, this summer exactly.first 100 hours i spent them on casuals and i had a pretty fun time!after that i started playing competitives and i can admit that this game is a blast! the gameplay is awesome... i only got bored of it when i had bad days and i couldnt play well and got owned. this game can even run on a potato so i think youll have no problems running it. in conclusion: even if you are a new cs player this game will still be enjoyable at first and a bit later, after you learn the basics it will become awesome!",444.2
"excellent game.. spent over 100hrs on the game. what more do i have to say.",655.4
"this game is like riding a donkey and shooting lazers out of your nostrils at the same time. it is strange yet highly erotic",126.3
"best game ever got another acc with 700 h never will finish playing this game gj vavle love you for good game like that",719.4
"got banned for a week because i blue screened 11/10",566.4
"obviously one of the best games ever created. so much more life-like than any other fps shooter ive ever played. 5/5 great game.",418.1
"play competetive matches against ranked opponents on classic maps, and some new ones! untill you get kicked from the match mid-game with something is wrong with your computers blockes vac u can not plays you get disconnected, and your team loose the match and get pissed off. get it now while its still hot.",617.8

"if i never bought this game i would probably have had a girlfriend by now. 10/10 must buy.",772.4
"this is an amazing game and is a nice change from most first person shooters!",411.8
"picked up this game because my friend told me it was like call of duty so i decided to pick it up in the 2013 summer sales but after playing it for a while (check hours) i realized that the aiming and movement in call of duty are more superior compared to cs:go, i dont like how when you move and shoot your bullets are completely random, im used to playing search and destroy and running around with my mp7 destroying kids dreams not having to stop and worry about recoil and its a huge inconvenience, also how come the mp7 can three shot people on modern warfare 3 but takes 5 shots on cs:go? because valve made a very unrealistic game! buy a game which takes skill such as modern warfare 3 or battlefield 4.",1251.0
"russia/10 learned native russian in 1 week. thanks matchmaking.  blyat.",153.2
"i have played this game for almost 700 hours and i absolutely love it. the team working on this game have really put forward a lot of effort into making this game as fun and as community based as possible. the only problem i have ever had with this game is hackers and even though that they are there , i dont blame the team. hackers cannot be stopped from any game so there is no reason to blame innocent people.",1369.7
"this game is really fun and addictive. the better you get the more fun the game is. i really like that you an sell in-game items on the steam market. you should definitely try out this game!",302.0
"if you enjoy a game with players that do not see the sunlight, this is a game for you. i personally dont understand why aiming wasnt implemented.the aiming makes no sense whatsoever. whoever designed weapons were their bullets would continuously either hit the ground or fly to jesus, should be hung. this is a real weapon shooters nightmare, a bunch of little screaming boys spraying their weapon to all , and the hardcore sniper using mlg players, is attrocious. the amount of time players have on this game is concerning. upwards of 1500 hours is scary. the best way to waste $15 is to buy this game. i would much rather eat $15 than have bought this game. i just plain dont understand the point of this game. also, who the  would want to be a terrorist anyway? 1/10",55.9
"source > 1.6 > global offensive. that asside, its still a great game. the item drop system makes you want to keep playing.",127.0
"well its nothing like cs 1.? and 2 me its like what cs:s should have been so its a better version of cs:s ! so if u liked cs:s u cant go wrong on this 1. if ur looking for a game like cs 1.? this aint it ! i like it anyway and my money is well spent :d 3r hf&gl",1615.2
"great game i got 46 achivmants in 10 hours on mulitplayer :d",12.2
"good game so far, with a little bit of bugs. but in the future its very potential!",1735.7
"you either die a noob or live long enough to get called a hacker",1074.3
"im a cod player, and i was very sceptic to this game. but now i found even more fun playing csgo than any other game i have ever played ;) i recommend this game to everyone +1",701.2
"its like roulette; fun until it turns into russian.",213.0
"the worst game ever! who needs and explanation do not hesitate to contact me ! cheers! this game needs to get to at least 50 $ price so we, old cs players can have some fun playing it. once again who really needs details to my review please contact me. bye.",143.5

"killed a chicken and obtained a point... must-have",611.9
"when i first bought this game here was how it went 1. join a match 2. get killed 20 times 3. get 1 kill 4. get harrased for being bad at the game 5. rage quit after i learned more strategy, as well as how recoil worked, here is how it went 1. join a match 2. get 20 kills 3. die 12 times 4. get praised by your teammates 5. think your the best player ever 6. cry after realizing your not all that good then after some more playing, i realized that in competitive, sometimes you should just have fun, it went like this 1. join a match 2. flash whole team 3. get yelled at 4. shoot the person that yelled the most 5. get votekicked from the match",505.9
"why cant i play my cs go it says i got a computer problem isit bcs of my uncle laptops?",1275.9
"i have to say this is the best fps game ever in steam most of the time it give u some awesome drops/skins then u can sel lthem in market to get steam money then u can buy different skins and also love this game best steam game i played besides tf2 there both great",1183.9
"i really dont have that strong an affinity for counter-strike but i do know that it does not need to be renewed and replaced every 6 months. global offensive is more of a hard-core shooter than anything im accustomed to but it is still very much a fun game and would recommend it over cod any day of the week. if only because of how much cheaper it is, and how much you will not need to spend another $50 to keep playing. that being said, i am kind of medicore at cs in general and while i will advocate playing with friends, im not sure i can justify the cost if you dont have people to play with and you only want to try it.",48.6
"great game in many ways im not going to list but this game is awesome",13.4
"step 1. lose lots of competive matches. step 2. cry step 3. be silver 1 step 4. be very sad",657.4
"this game can be really really really fun or a life ruiner...community is also beyond random. ranging for really annoying kids and trolls to really hardcore  . but when you meet in the middle its an experience like no other so i guess its alright despite the really inconsistent people. the game itself is amazing though so thats what makes up for it. takes a ton of skill also so not for the filthy casuals. if youre new to cs...gl hf youre in for the  breating of a lifetime 10/10 would derank again",235.1
"the graphics are great.  it has all the good old maps.  fun gameplay.  new guns.  too many cheaters!  too many kids with downloaded skill.  too many pros with 10-15hrs.",1641.6
"maybe good game, but not best (jw best). top player  top choice. and so on...",1566.8
"i think that cs go is one of the best and must-have game that all fps gamers must have! seriously if you havent bought it yet go and buy it emmediatly!",328.3
"having this being valves latest cs game made so far, i would say they did quite a good job on this one. more new guns, new maps, new game modes, new graphics and animations make this game even more fun to play. but what i hate about this game is the fact that there are way too many hackers ruining all the fun. i cant really tell whether i would recommend this or not but if you have always liked the cs series so far, youll definitely love this one!",175.8
"i love this game although its to addicting! ... im joking its an awsome game and not to laggy (fps+).",546.8
"best online fps shooter atm the use of teamwork and tactics is very strong in here and the ranking system is pretty good.",648.1

"pretty much a must buy, large improvement from source and its just your average shooter.",39.5
"chickens explode, the community hates everyone, and stuck at silver iii. 11/10",184.8
"fantastic game to play with friends. gets pretty, intense, but very fun. love the skins and gameplay, but there arent a lot of gun variety. some guns are used more often and are way more overpowered than other guns. other than that, i would definitely reccomend this game.",650.8
"this game is a very fun competitve shooter, recommended to anyone who is looking for a competitive and skill based experience",1249.9

"csgo, the sequel to the popular game team fortress two is a unique twist on the classic military style beat em up games. this game takes things from tf2 such as the awp and knives and combines them with elements from other popular games like pokemon snap by bringing in stealth. csgo is a must buy for any classic gamer looking for a game with a similar combat system to toontown online. i give thumb!",264.9
"counterstrike global offensive is a really  game there are hackers/smurfs there is no chance for the lower rank to get a higher rank. i truly think that valve dont care about this game, wait why would they care they are getting there money from you boys/girls buying cases/skins. this is my review on counterstrike global offensive i hope you ing like it.",730.1
"if you have friends, this is a great game to play with them. if you dont have any friends, this is a great game to play alone. if you dont have the game to play, get money for it. if you dont have the money for it, get a job. if you dont have a job, rob a bank. if you get arrested robbing the bank, at least you tried. aiming is more dynamic so it makes the gameplay more addictive and on a professional level.. buy only if you are not short tempered.. xd",917.9

"this game is definately worth the price! i would advise you to watch out how much you spend in game, though. several people i know have spent more than $200.00 on gun skins. it is really fun to play competively and casually! i would recommend it to any fps fan!",338.1

"counter strike: global offensive is the new counter strike series that brings your competitive level and playing experience to the next level! yes it might not be as good as 1.6 for all sorts of thing but hell i enjoy playing csgo a lot :) and all that skin as cosmetics is fun to collect.. but dont spend money to get skins kinda worthless.. well sometimes you can get profit thou.. if you are seing this and its in a state of 50% off or more.. go for it.. totally worth it! but if you cant wait id say 100% price is still worth the game :)",942.2

"this game is amazing for those who play competitive and also likes to trade",472.1

"ing awesome game it gave me old memories of cs 1.6 back must play !",728.9
"im kinda iffy on if i should say yes or no on if i reccomend this game. 1 it has great game mechanics and potential. 2 they made a tf2 out of it. 3 children o_o . 4 sometimes it gives you competitive matches with people the same rank as you ... sometimes.",726.8

"really good if youre into farming sims with chickens",5.3
"this game is fantastic and i love how fast this game plays through",519.9
"always been a counter-strike fan, played them all and this is my favorite one by so far and this brought me back to the series after a long break. absolutely love the competetive matchmaking to find players to almost equal skill level as you and the feature to party up with your friends and play a game (casual or competetive) with them. and the new game modes are also fun and the fact that you can search official cs servers and the community made ones. the game is good, but they need to buff the shotties a little bit (except the mag-7) cause im tired of getting 80-98 damage point blank (espacially with the nova)! shotties are made to kill with one shot or medium damage with fast followup shots. :c (okay rant part is over) summary: i love this game alrdy even tho only 70 hours in the bank, but it has its problems like every game out there. if you like fps games and/or counter-strike give this game a try and be brave and try out the competetive matchmaking too! :3",714.3
"pretty awesome game, nice gameplay and a lot of fun, i recommend this to everyone!",1031.1

"essentially meth. you do really good, and then can never quite reach the same high again, but when you do, you just want to go back for more to get that high again. tl:dr 10/10 would play again",559.8
"lots of tactical shooty-shooty action. its not exactly like counter strike 1.6, counter strike source, or even condition zero if thats your hipster-like style. but this is in a good way, it just feels cleaner and more fun to play",40.6
"this game is pretty much as excellent as its older releases (css,cs 1.6) and i really enjoy playing it and i would recommend it to everyone that enjoyed source or 1.6",400.3
"oh boy, lets get started... this game is like snorting pure 100% grade a cocaine that costs $10,000 to the pound. this game is most likely the best thing to ever be made. i also love how this was brought to xbox, even though the og one was aswell... it is still great, the only problem is that you need a good computer. if your ram can handle counter strike: source, it doesnt mean it can handle counter strike: global offensive. this game can run slow as hell, but if your ram is good, and you have a decent wi-fi, this game is like seeing a dragon fly out of a microwave. (komodo dragon that is), its so cool, your breathe is taken away...",632.1

"when people say this game is bad... im globally offended. :d",331.0
"hard for starters this int like cod where all the skills you need is pointing and clicking.on cs:go you need to use your brain the only thing i dont like is that you need to buy pho3nix pass to get some maps and you can only plae it once, and that competitive is the only good game mode for cs:go so this game is not for quick plays i would recomend this game if you have 100 minutes to spare on the wekkend",155.7

"haha lets just say this. this game takes alot of time for you to enjoy it! in order for this game to be fun you need to be willing to put 1000 plus hours into it. once you hit that point, your already pretty good. dont think its like call of duty where you can sit back and easily get 30 kills right off the bat. i suggest buying an aimbot for your first 80 hours of playing. trust me",32.1

"id like to say that this is a really good game, and dont get me wrong it is really fun and packs a lot of time in it for a game that is frequently on sale for 10$, but certain features in this game absolutley suck. 1st thing: hackers are everywhere, you might think that im just salty because someone was better than me, but their are real odvious hackers in this, and they dont get stopped. 2nd thing: matchmaking in competitive, its just really bad, enough said. and last but not least is the smurfing. its annoying how someone in gold 4 can make a new account and get matched with unranked or silver people, it makes the game very unbalanced and not fun. these reasons are why i get turned off from the game every couple of matches, but hey! if your looking for a fun time consuming game, be my guest and buy this game! just be careful of these few reasons.",699.6
"despite the months of beta testing beforehand, my experience in the first month after launch has been ridden with annoying bugs and ctds. the gameplay is pretty smooth, the weapons feel solid, and the flow feels more realistic. there are still many elements that make this game cheesy as ever (just float up a ladder), but for 15 bucks you will still get some very fun gameplay (demolition is well balanced and enjoyable) and decent replay value as valve adds more maps and content. if i had paid 50 bucks for this i would be pretty upset, but for its cheap price tag i can live with the bugs and slow updates. recommended.",547.1

"its quite a bit of fun. its pretty much what you can expect from counter-strike. theres a couple gameplay mechanics that have been changed from cs/cs:s to cs:go. mostly competetive improvements, stat changes that makes most of the guns viable, modernazations (the good kind), and the revamped hud. im a fan of the score and players alive being bunched with the timer. as for statistical changes, they seem to stay (mostly) familiar with the previous games. i dont know, im no expert in any way, shape, nor form. the problem is that the hit detection is awful (that, or my aim is terrible). from what i read, this is because the official servers run on 64 ticks per second, half as much as the maximum 128. another thing is that the community is a bunch of asses, but theres not much you can do there. i recommend this if you enjoy team-based tactics and coordination, and combat that involves more thought process than theres the enemy, right-click left-click- oh, im dead, better respawn.",65.3

"counter strike: global offensive is not a game for the faint of heart. you either make your way through the ranks quick enough, or you run the chance of risking your life. let me elaborate: the community of this game is renowned to be one of the worst, they would indefinitely skin your entire family if you showed any notion of being a noob. you could also become too engrossed with the diversity of the game, and have your skin mould to your chair. as you can probably imagine, this could cause severe skin problems, and you can die. finally, in a similar situation, you could once again become quite attached to counter strike, and fail to notice that youre dying of starvation, and/or thirst. in a nutshell this game is very dangerous to everyone with 11.99 in their wallets, and i highly recommend you invest quite a lot of your time figuring out if this game is for you.",679.7

(kind of like arma 2.) i recommend this game not because of a biased opinion, but because it is the only fps that i can play and actually enjoy it. sometimes you get matched with people with a lower rank, or dont know the map, but hey, youre that guy sometimes as well. 90/100, that deagle update.",195.1

"dear santa, for christmas, i would like for cs:go to receive an ai overhaul. you see, when i play a game, and a teammate gets grumpy, they wind up leaving. that leaves me and my friends with a bot. this bot is not very bright and will often run out into anything, whether it be a smoke, an incendiary grenade, an awp, or a five man rush of p90s and tec-9s. at the very least, i would love for the ai to be able to sit down in a corner as though it were a chick hatching an egg everytime it was asked to stay here team. sincerely kim jung-un p.s. ive been very good at using my cs:go betting money to feed the people of north korea. it makes up 30% of our gdp.",202.9
"this game use to make me cry cause i was so bad then i started whatching a video on tips then i slowy got better, not the best though the only thing make me love this game is the stragety, i love the footsteps and how you have to play as a team unlike call of duty where you just throw c4 everywhere this game is awesome. one this that makes this game hard is the aiming you dont spray you can just shoot while running and your bullets land right on him theres bullet drop, theres many sources of cover you may use to your advantage. making this game 10/10 with the aiming simulator. one last thing before i go is the crates and the skins, skins make gameplay alot more funner cause you dont just get the good ones you have to either get crates by drops or buy them from the community market but all in all this game is 100/10 p.s thats suppose to be 100.",659.4
"i love this game. i have been playing this game for a while and it is one of the most balacned games on steam.you are able to get skins for your gun but it wont change the stats,only the looks.it is hard to learn how to play well and some people may call you noob but once you do well it is very rewarding.",266.9

"i highly recommend the game counter-strike: global offensive to anyone looking for a shooter whether they be a casual player, a pro player, or even just looking for a game to collect skins in. the game offers up a few structured game modes (such as gun game and competitive) but thats just the tip of the iceberg. cs:go also, like its predecessors, boasts a community server browser which opens the game up to a world of game modes whether it be playing as a prisoner in jail or surfing on walls. the game has great mechanics which really give you the opportunity to explore your inner shooter.",697.8
"a cool games :d but you cant customize the games like you want (like the previous games, css) and the bot is kinda easy to kill (medium in csgo same as easy in css) but the games overall is neary perfect :d",106.9

"counter-strike: global offensive its really good game you can find hours of fun in competetive matches and if you play with friends it even more awesome. you can buy skins and stickers witch are not necessary to play a game but can make for refreshing new experience and if you open a case and you find gun for maybe 10$ your proud of your self. so final conclusion i recomend this game for me is 10/10 becouse its fun and long lasting experience its not like cod that new one comes out every year and thats what i like about it.",872.2

"the game is a classic counterstrike game and didnt improved much over these 10 years except for the graphics. the game still has horrible/bad registeration and bad effects such as explotions. if this game whats to really step up their game, they should evolve graphics even further, add realistic real world maps, and add more guns. we should also be able to change skins like before and not make it locked/random.",258.7

"i played this game like 80 hours i think, and my perspective on this game was... hmm, ok, it is the old engine of cs, and all the mechanics are almost the same, except that the shooting part its much more harder then the cs 1.6, for example. the visuals in their base line are pretty much the same, but you know they look much more gooder then the old ones. the community varies from guy to guy, i mean, you should expect everything, and when i say everything, its everything, some weird folks down there, but you know, they have their role, making you laugh sometimes. another aspect that i liked was the menu, every knid of menu, pretty clever the buy menu, it looks awesome, the start menu, it is very good structured and it left me a very good perspective on it. so, i must say that this game it is not a waste of money, you should buy it.",183.7
"so the communitys gone to  so hard that 4 players on low level comp decided to follow me and body block me in the face, games absolutely god awful in every way possible especially since its on sale for a couple dollars constantly hackers get a ton of copys and its just one big cluster of , so i deffinetly would not buy it",375.4

"bought it at launch(was beta testing it was different game back then). unfortunately i dont have 500 or even 1000+ hours like most people do, but cs:go has come a long way. the skill based gameplay and modifications of counter-strike were things which brought me to this title and are still keeping me to it. pros: skill based, fast paced, skins(its addiction for some people), competitive tournaments(cs:go majors are pleasing to watch). cons: no official zombie modification(in 2012 we hoped it will be implemented), no sprays(hilarious pictures back in cs1.6 and cs:s), spam bots inviting you.",156.0

"so lets make a reveiw shall we, if you are considering buying this game, it will take practice, more likely you will suck to begin with, then you will get silver before never ranking up because every time you think you are close to that nova some guy anchors so hard the entire boat sinks. 9.5/10 for great gunplay, map design (*coughs* dust ii *coughs*) and in general just a good game to get good at",409.5
"this game is more fun and realistic than cs:cz, much better graphic display and sound quality.",1297.1

"life in a competitive match your team: you f*cking suck d*ck c*ck mother f*cker!!!!! you: but im trying as hard as i can the one nice person on your team: then try harder and we can win this the rest of your team: shut the f*ck up! (to the one nice person) you: can i be kicked now? your team: no you deserve a ban if your abandoning us!!!! 69/1 would buy. but be prepared to be anally , mentally, and physically.",127.0

"other than the fact that im a total noob at this game, and that the community sucks, its fun. 10/10 would buy",79.5
"a very well done game. i have spent a while playing this game and like it much more than other popular first person shooters (e.g call of duty). the players are normally very helpful, polite, and mature. be warned, start playing and you might not be able to stop. 10/10 would play again.",884.8
"ive always wanted this game ive seen so many videos on it mainly frankironpcin1080p and when i finally got it, it was exactly what i thought it would be like. this is truely an amazing game for those hardcore fps players out there (not me xd), more realistic than any other fps game ive played before it has just an amazing enviroment to play in and realism.",20.3
"i have really enjoyed this game - its one of the best games that i have played. allthough there are some bugs after major updates, valve always fix these. best of all, they listen to the comunity. map changes have been put in place because we wanted it. there is a massive comunity surrounding this game - because it is an e-sport, there are international competions held regulary and it offers great youtube content aswell as amazing twitch live streams. the gameplay itself is epic. i play competetive and it is so tense, the small teams and limited time make it a fast paced, action packed game. if you play with a group of friends or even random people who have microphones, it can become very tactical. there are a few bugs with the matchmaking system, and the low-budget servers can glitch and not register your hits which can be fustrating at times. i would give this game a 9/10.",609.9
"a brillant fast paced action game. this is a new update of counter strike source. the graphics look much better and smoother with some extra added touches. i really like the idea of crates and loot drops much like team fortress 2 i am able to customise my own gun skin and also player. the idea of counter strike global offensive is you are either on the counter terrorist team or the terrorist team. the counter terrorists must either save a hostage or deactivate a bomb whilst killing the enemy terrorist team along the way. the terrorists job is to hold a hostage or detonate a bomb whilst preventing the counter terrorists from doing the opposite. i think this game like team fortress 2 is a marvel of multiplayer fps and i would reccomend it to anyone young or old.",64.2

"the best game to buy - 2014 skiperis. really worth the money. such reality, such graphics, such playtime.",726.5
"counter strike: golbal offensive (cs:go) is a challenging fps. there are different gamemodes and gametypes. for example, some gamemodes are casual where it is less serious and easier. but in competitive you better bring your a-game. you are paired with people in your skill range too. cs:go is a great game, but is hard to master and some people find it hard to understand. but once you get it cs:go is a really good game and is well priced at $15 usd.",804.9

"in which the rich majority of players join servers full of new players just to show off their ak-47 and awp skins, because whats the point in having nice things if you cant show them off, right? oh, and with the release of gun stickers, one can assume this game is going to head down the same route as team fortress 2, with an annoying item-based economy (trading craft items for worthless cosmetic garbage, hello?). the overall spectrum of players appears to be way off-balance, with very few in between the rich elite and poor noobs. despite all this, i reccomend cs:go for its excellent gameplay, faithful voice acting, and the fact that they updated de_dust. 10/10, would lag again.",8.2
"this game will ruin your life and make you broke the end",312.4
"good game that requires military tactics, better than blackshot obviously, who would play that kind of  game",326.9
"counter strike: global offensive has to be one of thegreatest fpss i have played yet. the ony issue would have to be the 64- tick servers it creates a bit of a lag and delay but other than that its great game to play with your friends.",321.9
"this game. exploding chickens have never been any more satisfying. i personally havent played this for too long, which means im not too experienced. but so far, this is a really great game, and its incredibly fun for being such an old game. id say this is a very competitive game, its very multiplayer focused and incredibly fun. most of the matches you go in you get to meet new people, and very nice people as well (this doesnt go for everyone). the game has really funny weapon mechanics, where you need quite a lot of skill to use the weapons. this makes the game a lot more fun, where players cant just run and spray, which makes the game harder, but also a lot funnier in many aspects. remember this game is hard! dont buy it unless youre ready to put in some good time into it. have a good one! - drunk unicorn",352.1
"great action game, but takes awhile to get used to if youre new to the series.",131.6
"much great. good looks. strategic game, better then cod",1696.1
"shoot people call yourself get_right and then proceed to jump off a bridge. in all honesty, this game is worth it because its learning curve is not as hard as the previous counter strikes. you still need to learn how to aim, and know callouts for playing competitive, but it also has casual gamemodes that you can play to let off steam(get it?) this game is worth. 10/10 would cry about missing 3 awp shots in a row.",621.3
"this game is so fun especially if you play competitive with friends. the one downside is that if you want to get cool weapon skins you will need to spend money. do buy this though because its a great game.",390.9

"this game is great and all, but take this advice from me. the game is hard for beginners. i will admit, i am not the best at cs go. i am used to aiming, because i have played a lot of call of duty on the xbox 360. i would give this game a 10/10, because everything is great to it! pros ------------------------------------------------------ -great, flowing game. -good controls, easy to use -casual mode for fun games rather then competitive matches. -i have a pc that is not meant for gaming, and it runs perfectly. cons ------------------------------------------------------- there is really no cons to this game. the game is amazing!",60.5
"this game is op. you dont need to have skill to be popular at this, just open 10,000 cases or buy skins off the market, buy expensive items like knives and vulcan skins etc. only buy this game if you have extra money, without skins.. you are nothing. 10/10",184.8
"holy crap this game!! its way to different to call of duty to even compare it to that. it is the best multiplayer game ive ever played and is great for people with game sense on the fact that you know where people will be camping and you know where people will go. and it is also good for team tactics unlike some other fps games where you just go round shooting people (call of duty). 10/10 buy this game 100% worth it!!",677.3

"cs:go is like cs:s, but with lube. its very sexy.",65.7
"cs:go by far one of the best fps for pc. this game will bring moments of despair while bringing moments of pure accomplishment. this is like the call of duty of pc but better, you have multiple cheap exspansions that become free after the event. competetive - where pros play for rankings deathmatch - where you kill, die, spawn, kill, die, spawn over again and again. demolition - basically search and destroy arms race - go throught most weapons in the game to finally a knife and get a kill with each to win. this game is a 10/10 for me and i highly recomend it! also no aiming! only on guns with scopes you can aim!!! beautiful!",143.3

"best game evar... probably. not only incredibly fun, but really useful for improving fps skills on. even battlefield on console is easier to play after learning this game, cant wait to wreck on some cod noobs if i ever play ghosts! easily my favourite fps.",12.6
"love this game, apart from the banning system and not seeing chat and hearing voice on over watch, no flaws :d this is better than cod and is worth the money. i have spen $100 in game and have all the counter strikes on steam 10/10",275.1
"needs better vac and more polishing. crashes quite a lot. still really fun to play and the new matchmaking is quite easy to use but really time consuming. better served with derpy friends",345.3
"counter-strike: go doesnt fail to please me. its a great competitive game with new guns, new modes, better graphics, and a gy community, thats pretty much the only downside... but cs:go is a very well made competitive game. but if you are me, you would prefer css over this game. but both are spectacular games. thank you once again, valve :)",30.9

"this is definitely the next generation of counter-strike games. i was recently able to play counter-strike 1.6 and source, and after having played this game for over 300 hours and going back to those games its definitely a different animal. counter-strike: global offensive is to counter-strike: source as counter-strike: source is to counter-strike 1.6, in this mediocre gamers opinion.",424.1
"this game actually forced me to study russian. this game is genuinely good if, and only if, you have a full team to play with. if you go solo queue, its 99% that you will get the ruskipolskiblyat team that calls gg after the lost pistol round / and then again you will get a full team of svenskapojkar in your enemy team that have the most luck in this game no explanation available. -start pistol round, buy kevlar, go somewhere, see a t running on the otherside of the map->one dinks you in the head. also the timing in this game is something magical. get a nade/knife in hand or reload -> no matter what situation enemy will be 500% more likely to peek. watch a certain spot for 30secs, turn around, get killed from the spot. -half time, the screaming and all nonsense noise contest. once it gets in your blood, you cant quit.",1730.1

"nice competitive game but, the community is horrible, and seriously you have to spend money to open cases even though you spend hours just to obtain them? on top of that you have to spend money on steam in order to even sell skins are you serious or is this just a greedy ploy? this game just exploits money in such a terrible way my friend gambled his money just to get a knife skin in this game. yeah a game that forces you to spend hundreds of dollars just to gain something that isnt even real. bad business model yet people promote it.",91.2
"yes yes and yes. very fun! and one of my favourite games. it is very different from other games where you can just run around like a noob and expect to be the best player, this game is all about accuracy, tactics and team work which is great! there is always an intense feeling that i dont get from any other games!",1100.5
"this game is fun. it has a few good game modes to keep you happy, along with the community servers and the custom server mods and maps, just like counter-strike: source and 1.6, as well like source and 1.6 people manage to take this game too seriously at times, so lets hope you know how to handle those types of people.",155.5

"one of the best pc games of all time in my opinion a must play, if you have the time to invest into this game it can be alot of fun",556.5
"this game is so fun to play if youve played css (counter strike source) then you will love cs:go with the awesome graphics which make the game fun and the slight realism towards the game by contrast, cs is totally egalitarian. everyone has access to the same items, and players arent ranked. nobody cares if you play four hours a day, seven days a week. all that matters is how well you negotiate the next firefight. you might take out half of the enemy team... but then again, a much less skilled player might blind you with a flashbang grenade and unload his top-of-the-line shotgun into your skull. its not unusual to see a good player climb to the top of the scoreboard only to decline back into mediocrity. in cs, skill and alertness are your primary weaponsand when you get tired, there are no unlockables to help you keep your edge.",131.7
"best version of counter-strike up to this day. the competitive mode, where players tend to play seriously in order to win and increase their personal rank on the game, is a feature that makes playing global offensive very interesting and extremely addictive!!",376.2
"i really enjoy playing cs:go. i think the franchise counter strike is one of the best shooters. period! i enjoy counter strike global offensive, because it has big community and well supported workshop. cs:go is the game from which you will get the most satisfaction when you score a headshot.",178.8

"probably the most addictive and rage indusing game i have ever played but, wow, i cannot put this game down!",334.6
"the good points: cs:go isnt reinventing the wheel of first person shooters. if youve played any iteration of counter-strike over the years, youll find most of the content very familiar. that said, go adds enough to keep it interesting. all of the weapons feel unique and the variety of gameplay modes will mean endless hours of entertainment. the bad points: ive been playing video games for a long time and the cs:go community might be the worst ive ever dealt with. in addition to the run-of-the-mill trash talk, you can expect to be inundated with anti-semitic, racist, and/or homophobic slurs (ive heard some people use all three at a time to insult other players). i dont think ive ever heard someone say something insightful on the mic in all of the matches ive played. your best bet is to simply mute as many players as possible. all in all, a great game as long as you ignore what everyone says during a match.",33.5

"7/10 this game is not bad but not good, the problem i see with this game, is that it just gets repetitive after playing a few games.this is more of a arcade game, than a fast paced multiplayer game. i would recommend this game, if you just wanna have some fun with friends or are cappable of teamwork. i wouldnt recommend this game to players who wanna invest time into a shooter game, because this game is kindda stale in just a cople of hours.",186.7

"really good game because its using your common sense to scout out the area find enemies and kill them. you have to be careful if you want to get loot because if you get sneaky kills you get a thing called mvp which adds to your mvp stars and you have a better chance of loot. i recommend this game to fps gamers.",165.4

"lets start off by saying this game is the best one in the cs series. id say that cs:go is a remade version of 1.6, which suits the needs of the current generation - better graphics, stuff is fancy. there is also this gambling aspect of opening cases and betting skins. i really do not know if i like it or not. some kids get happy over their new stuff when the other kids are crying after losing their whole skin collection in one click. now, the game itself. theres a new mode called competitive. people take this rather seriously. you can play it to get higher in rank - in case youve got what it needs to get there, which means youll get better opponents when you advance. remember that you have to be on the same (or higher!) level as your opponents to get higher. you can also play it to realize you belong to the bottom floor. but being on the bottom floor is okay, right? you can only get better.",706.7

"dead, once again, but you get used to it in counter strike. any longtime fan will tell you to never run through smoke and to always check your corners. sound a little intense? it is, but appropriatly so considering that this game has million dollar tournaments and one of the most competitive communities in the world. the game only has five game modes i believe and no single player (besides offline with bots) and there are only two main online mode. moving on however these modes have incredible replay value. i will assume that you know the basics - planting the bomb, defusing the bomb, protecting the hostages, saving the hostages...but hours upon hours you will sink into this game memorizing the maps and spray patterns and then boom headshotting people. buy the game now, unless you have a life because this game will take it with its one more round addictiveness and a brilliant although divided counter strike community will guide you through your journey into terrorism and counter terrorism.",110.8
"global offensive is definitely a counter-strike sequel -- it looks and feels familiar, with minor tweaks here and there to help balance old issues and surprise longtime players. this is a demanding, skill-based multiplayer game thats as satisfying now as it ever was, but its for a specific kind of player. if youre not willing to learn to play different than youre used to, look elsewhere. otherwise, this is a top-tier tactics game that will probably share the long-tailed legacy of its predecessors.",272.8

"cs has always been known as the best competitive tactic fps and this latest chapter isnt different. it isnt famous as other titles which, every year, hit the market, it hasnt the best graphics nor a movie-like story mode, but its a game only based on pure skill, and thats the only thing that matters. forget hours playing to unlock scopes and such things, or people killing you cause of better weapons due to their higher rank. in csgo everyone has the same possibilities (always!), no matter the rank, no matter the amount of hours played, no matter how much money you spent on it. but, in the beginning, you will need time (a lot of time) to fully understand and then improve aim, tactics, economy and teamplay. give it time to learn, be patient and it will become the only game youll want to play. if you are a fps enthusiast this is the must have game!",1211.9

"counterstrike really struck gold since its launch in 2012. not only the game on its own is nice looking and plays very well, the workshop offers a place for the community to put their own designed skins for the guns. this is probably the reason why valve also makes allot of money off of this game. it is pretty cheap at around 5-7 dollars/euros, but the selling of skins on the market, even though they only get a couple of cents for each,really gets in the money. not to mention the cases; these are boxes filled with a variety of gun skins ranging from ordinary (blue) to extremely rare (red), if you get really lucky and strike a knife you are instantly guaranteed around 50+ dollars (at the moment). ofcourse it is very prestigious to own a knife so most people like to show it around. lastly, recently a tournament in germany attracted the attention of over 400,000 people on twitch at once! this is huge, making cs:go one of the best shooters of this moment.",374.9

"this game is not really as bad as you would think. it does infact have alot of ups and downs compared to source. for beginners, this actually have a high playerbase and the graphics are improved, and im starting to enjoy it more and more. + * compeditive gameplay. where you get banned for leaving early and stuff * it have various communitymaps, and the biggest focus is on non-dedicated servers - * way to much focus on skins, its easy to spend too much on something that in reality have no value * people who play competidive might be mean as f if youre not a world champion at the game * the skins you want cost 1000 dollars i will give the game a solid 7/10 at this moment, but it might change later on",466.9

"despite at first being thrown by the limited use of aim down sights, i suddenly just got hit with how complex and fantastic this game is, if you are coming to play this, you have to try competetive. casual seems unbalanced, especially on certain maps (never go t on nuke for crying out loud), but competetive is so crisp and gameplay in comp works well, buy this game, download this game, dont stop playing this game for the first 200 hours, and keep coming back. just some steps to get the best experience from this, the price tag is so low, why shouldnt you buy this?",613.6

"its still a counter strike, but theres a few things that should be changed. this game should be about holding angles, not about checking corners. map designs should be similar to cs 1.6 maps. second thing, the flashes should be way more effective, as if you turn around you barely get flashed, while in css or cs 1.6 your screen would actually be a lot brighter than in this game. third thing, quick-scoping with awp is so random now, unlike in 1.6 where it is perfect as it should be. fourth and final thing, the deagle: it costs 800$ and you can get p250, which is way more useful, for 300$. deagle should have the same specifications as it had in previous counter strike games, because then those 800$ would be worth of spending.",1703.2

"even though i have a tough time confessing that a game might be better than counter-strike (1.6). if theres one game i would say goes beyond 1.6, its global offensive. condition zero and source was bad as  for a real 1.6 player. cs:go takes it to the next level.",688.7

"counter-strike: global offensive (cs go) offers a simple, yet surprisingly fun approach to the fps genre. coming from battlefield 3 (which i find fun as well), i found cs go to be a refreshing alternative. while there isnt much variety in what weapon one is able to use compared to many other shooters, it does make it easier for the developers to ensure that gameplay is well balanced. the fact that it is so easy to find a match to jump into also helps to make cs go a great game. my only criticism is that you are not able to disable bots in private matches (either that, or i cant find the option to do so), when i sometimes want to play 1 vs 1 with a friend. *edit: you can disable bots using the bot_kick command ingame* overall, at the normal price of $14.99 usd, which is the price of some dlcs in many games, cs go is a great value game that is worth every cent, let alone its price during the many sales valve holds on steam.",21.6
"greatest counter strike in the series, and ive played since 1.5. truly a real-life feel to it, almost reminds me of soldier of fortune 2: double helix/call of duty.",336.8

"dont buy this game if you are a casual gamer that does not enjoy spending money on virtual gun skins and boxes of pure misery. well i do enjoy this kind of games, so i guess ive already blown off quite a bit of money on it already, and more is to be dropped into gabes wallet. if you play in europe, there is a big chance that you will be queued up with russians. they tend to only speak russian to you, and nothing else which is kind of annoying. i do find the game itself quite entertaining and frustrating at the same time, but i do reccomend it if you are into 1st person shooters where the hackers are almost non-existant. i r8 8/8",707.2

"its a cool game, just like cs 1.6 has ever been. if you like fps games then youll probably like cs, like i do. there are some bad points like the highest recoil i have ever seen in my life, you crouch and shoot on feet to get a headshot... sometimes you get modified weapons, there are the boxes that you can sell on market and etc. if you get to play this game a lot, youll get so many items that are marketable that you can even get your money back.",204.6
"i still prefer cs:s...but the cases really keep me playing... i have to admit that... it is still fun thou...if you can find a server and play...hm ( in other words: when valve ed it up again) i still hope theyll fix some things...like for example the knivingsound when you knive the wall it sounds like you are kniving cardboard. but all in all the game is all about the money money money :p",746.7

"i truly love this game. it immerses you into great, tactical, combat that cant really end in success unless team work and well-planned strategies are used. the amount of dedication and time required to become even just a decent player is absolutely fascinating. i understand now why people are into the cs series so much. and out of all the counter strikes, this has the best visuals, smoothest gameplay, most variety and great customization. its a truly remarkable addition to the series. you actually feel yourself improving over time. unlike other games where it is just about timing, kills, or a whoever has the better internet connection, this game rewards team-play and taking things slowly.",305.1

"the game has the best balance of tact, strategy, teamwork, and skill of any realistic fps ive played ever. worth every penny i paid, but actually it was gifted to me... so that phrase doesnt work. its still awesome, and you should definitely buy it if you enjoy computer fps games. after playing almost 300 hours the game still holds up as my favorite fps ever. the teamwork element and individual skill/game sense gains even more importance as you progress through the ranks. although im still one of the lower ranks (gold nova 2) i still enjoy the game a lot with friends and random matchmaking lobbies. and by the way, ninja defusing is the best thing ever. ninja is love, ninja is life.",616.1

"an incredibly fun fps that is well worth the price. however, keep in mind that this fps is completely different from other shooters like cod or battlefield. if youre going to treat cs:go like such, youre going to have a bad time. imo, cs:go has a much higher learning curve compared to these fpses ive mentioned and youre probably going suck when you first start. however, once you pass this learning curve, getting kills will be much more satisfying in this game compared to getting kills in cod/bf. 10 chickens/10 would recommend.",78.8

"the newest addition in the counter strike series. counter strike remains one of the few first person shooters that features a tremendous skillgap, both for individual play and for cordinating with your team. playing the classic competitive gamemode truly demands you play at your best... if you want to climb in the ranks, of course. cs:go has a pretty decent ranking system that pits you against players of your skill level. fear not, new player. while the precise aiming, timing your movement with your shots and the recoil patterns of the main rifles are difficult to learn at first, once you start controlling them, you will be greatly rewarded. you will notice you will systematically become better than the newer players. at that point, the game starts to become addictive; getting headshots left and right is just so satisfying. in my opinion, anyone who calls himself a competitive first person shooter player should play counter strike and invest some time in it. theres really no other shooter quite like it.",1103.3

"recommended to all former 1.6 (and older versions) players. the game stays truthful to the counter-strike legacy and converts the gameplay, maps and handling to modern state of art in games. as in all games with rapidly increasing player count the community needs to improve. matchmaking, iteminventory for optional skin trading and additional features like reporting players for good/bad bevhaviour brings a great improvement and long lasting game experience.",762.6

"awesome fps game to play with your friends online. pieces of the counter-strike formula are dated at this point, but the superb heart and soul of global offensive is timeless. teams are small, guns are lethal, and rounds are short. theres an addictive just-one-more-round quality to it, because theres a constant desire to do better than last time, to earn a satisfying kill, or to win in a new way. call of duty and battlefield vets will wonder why they cant sprint to escape enemy fire or look down the iron sights to improve aim; counter-strike players will feel like they walked into their redecorated home. certain map redesigns will catch hardcore fans off guard, but the changes are for the best -- the underpass choke point in de_dust, for instance, has a new escape route.",1094.9

"this is a very good first person shooter: it is easy to learn, but difficult to master. there is a one problemsi have with it though, and that is the presence of microtransactions. while they may be entirely cosmetic, i dont like microtransactions in any game, especially a paid game. otherwise however this is a very good fps, almost every gun is different. while some may be obviously superior to others, its possible to kill anyone with any gun. the competitave mode is fairly balanced most of the time, but there are some games where you are either entirely outmatched or there is little to no competition. in summary this is a very good fps that, while difficult not impossible, and very fun at that.",1107.7

"i have been a on and off again player since 1.6 but this is the greatest version to date. competitive play changes everything, keeps people from quitting and adds replay to the game with goals to achieve! if you are a raw fps fan or played cs in the past then this game is worth the small price tag!!",360.2

"counter strike is still cs. the community blows and is full of immature kids. you have weird servers like jailbreak, surf, and aim maps. but it is still the most fun and hardcore fps out there. valve tried really hard to improve the way we play cs. you can escape the pub maddness and play on the competative ladder. there the players are much better and actually care about winning the game!!!! the first game i ever bought on steam and the second game i ever bought on my pc is cs 1.6. 7-8 years later i can say this game is the best cs out there right now.",53.5

"great game! the mixture of cs source graphics and the feeling of cs 1.6 is amazing. although the frequent updates seems to be untested, meaning every 5th update or so leaves players unable to play for a while until fixed. still, as a former 1.6 player i strongly recommend this game for everyone who enjoys a challenging multiplayer game.",944.5
"do you like classic cs? then this is your game. but if you like cod, battlefield 4, insurgency, this is not your game. its simple but thats what make this game hard to play. especially if you have played cod and bf for a quite long time. you will say this game sucks. insurgency is better in term of gameplay and realism. but if you enjoy classic cs, play this game.",48.9

"this game is 1 of my favourite game in steam . there are many modes in this game , such as arm race , competative , casual , deathmatch . the mode that i like the most is arm race and competative , arm race is a game that u kill 1 person and ur gun level will upgrade . competative is a game that u need to set boom as a terrorist while counter terrorist defend the point and defuse the boom . my rating for this game is 9/10",806.4
"without a doubt the best fps there is out right now, with the high skill requirements for it as with all cs games, the introduction of the competative ranks aswell as the pro-league scene taking off has got alot of people playing extremely seriously. yet there are still casual modes and community servers for the more casual players. cs is unlike any other shooter you will have played before it has a high skill cap as its a tacitical shooter wich requires alot of teamwork and strategic thinking. a must buy!!",170.1
"fun but i dont know if more fun than source skins are cool",273.8

"very good skill-based game. if youre ready to invest a lot of time to become the best one - game is for you. otherwise youll be dissapointed. also very interesting economical part - its not a pay-to-win. its pay-to-be-hated (expensive skins which are so desired by teens who cant afford them). 7/10 because of cheaters on high ranks.",514.6

"best counter-strike yet. at first, like most players i was skeptical on how valve would be able to take source and amplify that even more while bringing back certain portions of cs 1.6 that we all came to know and love and yet, they did it. cs:go has so many different game options and makes it a great game to play with a group of friends or alone. the weapon skins are a fun addition to cs along with stickers and other options. valve has created a game that allows players to play the cs theyve always known and loved, but continue to see new things within the game itself like operation breakout and new maps/weapons from the steam workshop. cs:go gets a 10/10 from me for sure.",799.9

"dead, once again, but you get used to it in counter strike. any longtime fan will tell you to never run through smoke and to always check your corners. sound a little intense? it is, but appropriatly so considering that this game has million dollar tournaments and one of the most competitive communities in the world. the game only has five game modes i believe and no single player (besides offline with bots) and there are only two main online mode. moving on however these modes have incredible replay value. i will assume that you know the basics - planting the bomb, defusing the bomb, protecting the hostages, saving the hostages...but hours upon hours you will sink into this game memorizing the maps and spray patterns and then boom headshotting people. buy the game now, unless you have a life because this game will take it with its one more round addictiveness and a brilliant although divided counter strike community will guide you through your journey into terrorism and counter terrorism.",110.8

"rating: 9/10 -you probably know this is one of the best and most popular shooters. from my experience it is more fun to play when queued with friends. i would rate my skill set as crap to mediocre. try not to get frustrated at first. -there are some people willing to put up with noobs, but there are still those guys that think they way better than the rank they are. like most games there are trolls, tryhards, and smurfs (people with a 2nd account). -try big market to get weapon skins. it can be ridiculous that you pay almost 3 times as much for a battle-scarred weapon than you paid for the game. - servers are good but not without problems. there have been occasions were there is a huge lag spike for both teams in the middle of game. queueing for a game server is usually quick, can obviously take a while for maps that people do not play a lot. - community servers and workshop maps are a welcomed break from competitive. - like most games it has problems but unlike other games it will still be updated",315.6

(4)not good at cs games, bad aim? -blame the lag. tell me if i forgot something, also let me show you some types of people you will handle in this lovely game: (type1) those who just play normally, dont care about the chat or anyone else. (type2) those kind of people who dont play this game seriously, they do their best to troll / be funny. (type3)  got real, they play like its their last game! (type4) afk people, they join a game just to be afk.. (type5) mic spammers, mute everything on your settings before your headphones blow up! *mostly russians* (type6) they have no idea whats going on, its like an adventure game for them. this game is full of adventure, its sometimes a pain in the  however im fully recommending it.",301.9

"cs:go is a tactical shooter where your team is made up of 5 terrorists, or counter-terrorists. what makes this fps stand out from the others is the amount of though that has to go in to making your decisions, while trying to win. if youre running low on cash, you can eco, meaning that you buy cheaper weapons (or no weapons at all) to try to gain back that cash next round. if youre pinned down in a bad position, and have a smoke, you could use it to block the view of your enemy, while taking out the other. the ranking system is made in such a way that youll (almost) always be put in a game with people at your own level of skill. this makes it easier to learn the game, while it also might give you a challenge whilst doing so. if, however, none of this appeals to you, there are several community servers providing different gamemodes like jailbreak, and surf. heck, even valve provides gamemodes like arms race (which is just gungame), deathmatch and casual.",448.7
"paid to constantly get shot by some guy whos name indicates he is proud to be on the dole. 10/10 for both the game and peoples incentive to do something with their lives",137.0
"wow...this game is very repetitive! i havent put alot of hours into it but from those hours that ive been playing, this game is very hard. its not a bad game at all. its just the people that play it. theres some people withover 1000hrs on it and then theres me. only a few hours into the game. back to my point, this game is good but its just very fast-paced and sometimes.... unrealistic. you will get mad alot in this game. i repeat, you will get mad in this game.... alot!! overall, this game is great! you just have to know what youre doing. id give it a 10/10 but with all the rage that has happened, id give it an 8.5/10",251.7
"the third game of the famous counter-strike franchise. the graphics in cs:go are amazing , as well as the gameplay. this version includes more gamemode to play , weapon drops and weapon skinning (making weapon skins for valve to add by submiting them on cs:gos workshop.), its also a good way to make some profit for your steam wallet. you can do that by simply playing and selling your drops on the steam community market. however if you plan on quiting durring a competetive match , its not recommended. youll be given a few bans and after that every single quit will lead up to a 7 day ban. cs:go is like counter-strike combined with team fortress 2. its a title that deserves the money. tl;dr ive invested too much to fall back now.",500.7

"this game is an eye opener to how much of a homosexual i was. i thank all the 10-14 year olds who told me how much  i suck or how often these kids have sexual relations with my mom. i never knew my mom was a  till now but i will talk to her about it. i also never knew my dad  me till they told me and thank god they did cause i filed a lawsuit and won against my father he was very angry, but i have peace now.",202.4
"one of the best games i have played. this is one of the first games i have played on my pc, ever since i joined steam. there are so many things to do to pass time in the game, such as surfing. competitive is one my favorite things about the game, it allows for team communication and co-ordination. also, opening cases have been the death of me, i have opened at least 50 of cases and nothing good, but that wontt stop me from opening them and getting the infamous butterfly knife. this game helped me get better at pc games as i was a cod player on console. this game will never get old, and ill never stop playing it. on the other hand, it does have problems in the community such as smurfs and hackers, but hopefully, they will try and remove this to keep the game fair. furthermore, this is the most played game i have on my library. i would definitely recommend this to anyone whether they are good at fps or starting on pc games. this game gets 10/10 on my book.",687.4

"amazing game! although ive only started, this game is really fun and the graphics are great.",67.7
"its a good game but, there are way too many nerds on it, though. it makes the game annoying, when you have 4 losers screaming in your ear because you got killed by a guy you couldnt see. i would recommend this game to someone looking for a smart shooter, youre not superman, absorbing 1,000 bullets like in call of duty or battlefield, so you cant just run around everywhere and think youre going to kill everyone because you wont. verdict: good, overall - smart shooter, fun and fast paced action but, too many nerds/annoying people make the game almost unplayable, at times. i bought this game for $2.49 at a steam sale and i consider it worth that ammount of money, however, this game definitely is not worth paying full price, my advice, wait until the next steam sale to get this game.",5.4
"i would say that on a scale from orange juice to a fish tank i would give this game a solid gaben",1193.7

"i personally love the counter-strike series! my favorite would be handed over to this game. now, dont get me wrong, cs:source is a g.r.e.a.t game too. cs:go would be my favorite for reasons. 1. more updated 2. now this feature is awesome, you can bots after you die. 3. i feel like in other cs games sometimes the shotguns are a little overpowered, (am i the only one who thinks this) but i seriously love this game! 9/10",37.2
"i like csgo very much i think it is a very fun game to play. i think that csgo has got a lot more popular since they added the skins. i like alot of the skins in the game. i also like to play comp and casual with my friends. i you didnt find this helpful then go and try the game your self. i would rate this game a five out of five.",1306.4

"best game i ever played, but still to much cheaters and its to cheap.",112.5
"this is one of the best multiplayer fps. some peaople say, everything great - is simple. same thing i can say about this game. why? beacause, its all simple. kill or be kill in two word, but in same time there are many other aspects. tactic, planing, and accuracy - its all important. you have to think 3 times, before you have to make another turn, or as i say before. kill or be kill.",54.8

"global offensive is definitely a counter-strike sequel -- it looks and feels familiar, with minor tweaks here and there to help balance old issues and surprise longtime players. this is a demanding, skill-based multiplayer game thats as satisfying now as it ever was, but its for a specific kind of player. if youre not willing to learn to play different than youre used to, look elsewhere. otherwise, this is a top-tier tactics game that will probably share the long-tailed legacy of its predecessors.",679.3
"so, you play a competitive/casual/community game, and get drops. those drops usually consist of cases. once you open them, you waste $2.50 of your money for a $0.01 skin. also, you trade and trade, and get a really valuable item. and you get scammed/hacked and lose it, and steam wont refund it no matter how long you go on. also, russians are ing annoying. also, matchmaking is  also, everything costs money in this game also, its hard to master the recoil if your a noob.

"i dont really know why global offensive costs less than source, but nevertheless, this is a great game, the successor of a real legend. its a little hard to adapt if you come from games like battlefield or cod because of the recoil and no sights, but if you are dedicated, you can master it in no time. if you are a fan of shooters, you must play this game... but warning: itll be addicting as hell.",841.5
"i really liked this game. it is fun to play, especially with friends and it is easy to access and understand due to a lot of guides and streams. the interface is simple and the wide range of settings allows even slow computers to have a nice game experience. i would reccommend this game to others.",713.4

"fundamentally a great fps game. the classic maps from source and 1.6 are still here, and have been nicely updated to look fantastic. competitive 5vs5 mode is very popular, and although there are issues with match-making and hackers, there is now retrospective rank editing, so if a game youre in contains a hacker, who is then banned, that loss will be wiped from your record and your rank will return! casual game modes are still fun, and there are a few great casual maps to play. one thing casual mode is lacking in a 5vs5 competitive practise mode, as currently its 10vs10 which is just chaos at times. apart from these flaws and the difficulty of the game itself which can be off-putting to newcomers, i would still massively recommend this game.",1403.5

"still an impressively awesome first-person shooter franchise which is always a pleasure to play. the only downside is that its wide popularity has created  communities and incredibly anti-social players who care less about team rapport and more about personal status. these kinds of people have made the game a little less enjoyable to play, but the mechanics of this game and its many options act as major benefits which outweigh the cons. as our lord gabe had said, it was worth the weight.",64.0

"if youre a fan of counter-strike and you want more counter-strike, you wont go wrong with this title. its more of the good ol counter-strike with little more guns, game modes and updated graphics. maybe a little bit better hitboxes too. guns i feel like are more balanced and i feel like theres not just a certain 1 and 2 guns you should always use. though ive heard also that this is something that cs 1.6 fanatics might not enjoy as it is a little sluggish and consolish to their touch. but i think its the best cs up to date.",23.1
"obvious as it is - this game is next part of legendary counter-strike series. would recommend to everyone, who previously played cs 1.6 or cs:s. with lots of graphical improvements, this game still has its atmosphere of cs. lots of new maps, workshop content, weapon skins, different stream and competetive matchmaking (5v5) with ranking system will keep you entertained all the time. higly recommend it. ;)",637.9

"a fresh perspective on the modern shooter. the casual play of this game is average and entertaining with several community produced game modes, varying from a mini-games based server to a server where you surf and slide down large ramps all the meanwhile fighting off opponents. the competitive play is what sets this game aside from any other shooter i have played. in the competitive mode there is an air of intensity and focus each time i play, with a need to rise in rank you do all you can to communicate to youre team effectively in order to secure a win. the sheer amount of effectiveness in strategy and tactics a team can deploy eclipses that of what 1 team member can do. the game also forces you and youre team to emrace the economic factors of the in game play, this is unique to the counter strike series and creates a whole new branch of possiblities in strategy. the 15 bucks for this game was more than well spent, i can imagine myself playing for atleast another 100 hours. 9.5/10",262.0

"hey guys, im here to rate counter-strike: global offensive. im only playing this game for an day or two but i have played a lot of games, and i can sure you that this is for sure the best pc game that you can buy. first of all its only 11euros (european corrency), anda second of all the game have a realy good video quality, in my opinian as good as cod, only need 6gb of storage and 2bg of ram, and all of other requesits are so low as this. buy this game was one of the best tinghs i ever done!!",960.0

"this game is great, it is so pleasing to note that valve has given such a contribution to the face of modern fps games. it has great core gameplay that is quick and flows into itself swiftly and easily. at least if a ct isnt camping a point with an awp, but thats besides the point. i havent played much, but what i have seen tells me that this game is engaging, fast paced and (without trying to make it sound like the most important thing ever) has some of the best graphics i have seen valve produce. also, are we rushin in? or are we going all sneaky beaky like? only negative i can really see is the scalding you get from people better than you if you go in competitive too early. this can be a drag for me, as i am merely a begginer, but the one liners the teams give and they gameplay earns this game, to me, a 7/10. now of course, as i play more i will most likely learn to like the game more! lets hope i do! also russians.",105.1

"counter-strike: global offensive is what a fps should be. this has to be the best skill-based fps on the market. the guns feel powerful and rewarding, and the addition of camos is great. the only problem with the game is the difficulty. the game is played competively, and a good amount of the players on it have been playing counter-strike since the beginning are godlike. so the game has a bit of a learing curve in the respect that it takes practice to be able to compete against some of the other players. but once you are to that point, this game is extremely rewarding. getting a kill in this game is so much more satisfying than any other fps ive played, mainly because getting kills arent easy. all in all, counter-strike: global offensive is a must have for any fps fan due to the rewarding gunplay, great map design, and large community as soon as you overcome the learning curve.",735.6

"cs:go is a great fps game for those who like tactical decisions. whether or not you throw that flashbang around the corner, will mean the life or death of your team. same goes with smoke, incendiaries etc. an aspect of cs:go that is nice is the economy system, if you get kills and/or plant the bomb, you get extra money added on to your base income to purchase weapons with. this limits how strong a team can be at any given time, so obviously at the beginning of the game people can not have automatic rifles, and towards the end, many will have one shot snipers or lmgs. overall, cs:go is a great game, the servers that valve provide are horrendous and need fixing but they work.

"death is a great teacher. failure in counter-strike: global offensive is, as it always has been for this series, the greatest way to learn where you should have gone, what you shouldnt have done, and how you could have done better. counter-strike players spend a lot of time learning -- consequently, they are always getting better. growth is an important factor in global offensive, especially if youre coming into counter-strike fresh or after a sabbatical. this is an extremely hardcore, skill-based first-person shooter, and it forces you to think differently than other modern shooters. if youre a call of duty player, youre going to need to change your play style to succeed here. counter-strike also tries developing into something new here as well, despite doing little to push itself beyond what its always done best. global offensive modifies old maps to keep veterans on their toes, and introduces official new modes that encourage different play styles for the first time in almost 15 years.",1097.4

"simply a awesome game.... it gives you that classic fps feel made by valve (the guys from steam). so the game involves everything steam has to offer. good examples would be the voice over ip, the integrated market system and etc. and with market system, i mean that you can actually earn money by the items you earn through the game :) the cons however would be the same as every other arena/competitive shooter.... although i must say, that the beta system in place called overwatch. somewhat involves the community in countering some of the cons.",582.6

"this game is good game to sit down and just waste time. it does lack in the graphics department but the teamwork and the fun time wasting game play makes up for it. playing with friends even doubles the expirence. i would reccomend this game for people who are not looking for a story mode game just one with a fun fps multiplayer only i would reccomend anyone to get this game but it goes on sale alot so just wait for it to go on sale but it is still worth it for 15 dollars. hope this helped have a good day",342.5

"if you like competative cs:s, this is definitely for you. while the game isnt any battlefield 4, its still good. i personally give it a 7/10, its basically a huge graphical (and bullet-physics) improvement of cs:s. theres a few new gamemode improvements as well as fun trading and workshop items, as well as new guns. the t models all look the same and lack at least some noticeable variety, which is very unfortuante because you would think terrorists would have at least some distinguishable features. the ct all look the same which is expected from a swat team, so thats acceptable. originality is a low in cs:go but they preserved the cs:s-style gameplay that everybody loves, so it balances itself out. it is worth your money if you love cs:s, but if youre looking for something like cod or bf4, youre in the wrong place.",5.9

"ultimately a great tactical shooter. graphics are refined and are supported with awesome gameplay. multiple modes also exist in the game such as demolition, making the game possess more variety and a greater experience for the community. into the competitive gameplay, the game is fundamentally uses tactics supplied with fps action, differentiating it from other games. if youre into shooters and tactics, cs:go is definitely a game that you must pick up.",428.2

"this game is pretty good. the community though can get quite annoying and they are the ones that can ruin the game for some players. the game is all about tactics and cases and how pretty your awesome knife looks. in some ways its cool to have but in others is a pure scam. other than that the game is usually heavily sided to the counter terrorists and alot more difficult when there are people without mics, but that is beside the point. competitive is a great way to really show your skill and prove to your oponents you are a force to be reckoned with. casual is well really casual and really layed back. all or most of the people dont really care if you win or lose or what your rank is, they just want a nice simple game while they talk about whatever. the guns here are usually pretty good but some are really over powered. the maps are nice and you should really lean how to read them, it will give you an advantage against newcomers. overall the game is a 8/10. cool game but has some dumb elements to it.",139.8

"cs:go offers a competitive matchmaking feature - unlike cs:s and cs. this feature also includes a ranking system which i think makes it even more exciting and its a great way to easily find a match without having to use irc, etc. in addition theyve added molotov and decoy grenades, which i think is great even though i usually just go with the same old 2 flash, 1 nade, 1 smoke. through recent updates, they added weapon skins and stickers. it basically means that you get to play with dolls as a guy. i think its decent and it doesnt affect the gameplay in any way. if you were a fan of cs or cs:s, youll probably like this game. you just gotta get used to it. ive seen many people complain about it at first but they all ended up loving it anyway. so, basically, what im saying is; if you liked the previous counter-strike games, you should definitely try this out, too. i recommend it.",1243.4

"counter strike: global offensive is a good fps game that may be hard at first especially if it is your first fps game. there are a few reasons it is hard, i find it hard because it is difficult for me to aim with no iron or attached sights because i am used to call of duty. it is also difficult to learn the different spray patterns of the guns that are available for use. there are a lot of things that you can learn ingame by hours and hours of playing, i mean i have played 800+ hours and i still cant use the ak properly xd. i definitely recommend that people give this game a go, i have enjoyed my experience so far.",1403.3
