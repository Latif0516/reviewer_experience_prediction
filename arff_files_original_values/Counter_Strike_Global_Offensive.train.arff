"counter-strike: global offensive is just as fun as the previous iterations of counter-strike while including realistic settings and modern matchmaking tools.",494.6
"for all people who enjoy fps games with competitive gameplay, this game is for you. unlike the pervious installments of the counter-strike series, this one does not take hours on hours of gameplay to get a feel of the guns and different games modes. this game is all about learning, not unlocking different grips and sights for the guns to make them better. it also relays on your team trying to work together to complete the objective whether it be stopping terrorists from planting a bomb or you trying to plant the bomb yourself. once you get a handle on this game, i can promise that you will enjoy every minute of it.",125.1
"pew pew kill terrorist n stuffs......or be the terrorist. ets gud.",619.2

"if this game was a potato, it would be a good potato.",916.8

"yeahhh, no further comment! , it always and will be an awesome game",339.6
"i am not a great fan of pfs online. cs: go is my total exception especially because its my money grabber that feeds my steam wallet with some euros, enough in time to buy games in special deals. still, you will find the community in this game to be erratic. youll find nice people in one side and complete  bags in the other, that think theyre the best players in the game just for you to find out theyre trolling you and cheating hard. if you dont have the stomach consider yourself warned! play this for fun and be nice to people, if you do that the matches tend to be a wonderful experience and better according to the teams mood, believe me!",1015.7
"stuffing morphine jabs into my  end would be more pleasurable than playing this game any more.",24.8
"amazing tactical shooter. steep learning curve, but its rewarding when you start hitting those clutch shots and being the hero. recommended to anyone who enjoys a high level competitive experience.",1165.3
"i very like this game. very good game every one should try it better then all cs",1053.2
"i dont need this gun skin but it looks cool so ill buy it for $150 the market system makes me feel like im merching at the ge in runescape and i love that feeling in a gunfight when the other player lags harder than me so i win. would rate 8/8, best sticker collecter simulator 2014 hands down. still a fun game with friends. never play alone, though. thats suicide.",92.3
"great game! really enjoy the teamwork aspect, when you and some buddies can work together and complete the mission! worth a buy for any cs fan or someone looking for a more challenging fps.",674.6
"its a really interesting game & very fun to play. i think im brave enough to recommend it to others.",230.1
"a balance of skill, speed, and tactics that has yet to be matched by any other fps. this is the perfect blend of traditional cs with modern game elements. steep learning curve for the uninitiated, but a great, great competitive game.",234.4
"this game is horrible. russians please uninstall this game. thx gaben <3<3",1583.5
"great multiplayer game worth the money. the trading is fun too!",503.4
"really really enjoyed this game when i played it. its very addictive and the economy was great so was the community but i think they need to sort out their anti-cheat. i kept going on about how bad it was, then one day, i am banned. so i feel it must be improved in some way. but to anyone buying it, there are lots of hackers lower in the ranks, but once you get higher its an amazing game. only buy it if you like playing with friends, teamwork and sometimes raging.",44.9
"an extremely exciting game, i am so passionate about, life of a silver for life!!!! everyone buy please!!!!!!",92.7
"i have played this game a ton, everyday 8 hours. this game has a huge skill gap, but once you fill some of it in by learning the maps, map awareness, aiming for the head, and everything else. this game is very addicting also, and almost never gets old!",676.6
"another addition to the counter strike franchise. been playing this game for 10 years plus, and still am finding new ways to do things each and every day. the community might be daunting and condescending at times but once you persevere through it and start working towards your end goal (whichever that might be), this game will bring hours of enjoyment.",760.7
"it`s an realy good tactical fps that i really recomend to everyone who both want a new rush of cs and/or want a satisfactory tactical shooter. really recomend this game to everyone!",1148.5
"this is so awesome game!!! <3 i recommend for fps gamers.... <3",364.8

"its amazing as its graphics are better than the othr versions of cs..",283.6
"the best frist person shooter, buy the game if you like fps.",3.9
"all my friends left my chats to play comp 10/10 would cry alone again",22.5
"i like the whole game! all of its features are well designed!",865.8
"a very nicely made counter strike, best version yet.",1750.9
"a counter-strike game that doesnt require hardcore skill to play it like 1.6 did, and that makes it more fun and more friendly for new players. graphics are very good, its easier to seperate ct from tt and radar is made much more helpful. this game makes you to come back to it again and again. even if you got bored from it, after few days you can play it like first you started it. there is a great value in it, so thumbs up!",500.2
"ing awesome game it gave me old memories of cs 1.6 back must play !",728.9
"99 aimbotting reports but being an asian aint one.",299.9
"very good game but the ruskis are annoying som times xd",606.1
"buy a couple of smurf accounts, get paid and get laid. at least, thats what the cover said.",1030.1
"this is game is awesome but if you are new to cs then you are going to practice allot",1080.3
"cs:go is one of the most played fpss around and theres a reason why: its great! yes, when the price drops there will be an hacker in almost every ranked. but, its still a great game to play either by yourself or with friends. youll die, youll learn, youll own. 9/10 would die from an awp again",449.2
"this game makes me go cs:whoa. so many purty guns to use, so little time.",279.1
"counter-strike global offensive is the second best after 1.6 its still better than cs: source and condition zero 15 euro is worth buying this game.. counter strike is still one of my favorite classic shooters",510.7
"hell of a game where it requires alot of skills and communication from your fellow allies (unlike most fps such cod).make sure you invest the time to learn its mechanics",985.2
"only for the kool kids. not for me in that case. (  w  )9",2.1
"my friend said this is a good game, havent got a chance to try it.",401.9
"csgo is a great game and i would recomend it to any fps players!",954.2
"the pinnacle of tactical first person shooters. nothing can recreate the feeling of a an actual team in videogames except for cs:go, and very hard not to recommend to everyone. even if the competitive mode doesnt interest, there are still very interesting modes to play other than it, and a lot of maps and mods to apply to it.",61.7
"the best counter-strike ever!!! i recommend it to enybody/ and everybody",196.6
"fantastic game! + great multiplayer + great team-based + great gunplay + great graphics + great game highly recommend 9/10",148.2
"what to write as a review for this game... well, i started playing cs:go just a few days ago with my bf and so far i have been called: fing idiot, r3tard and they even unsuccessfuly tried to kick me out of the server lol i never knew that only macho guys with tiny d!cks played this game >.< they all seem to think they are pros, even though, they know, for a fact, theyre playing with/against noobs who are trying to learn and improve. oh and did i mention they sure as hell cant play with girls?! what a bunch of cavemen m0rons. so yeah, i hope you find this helpful.",13.3
"its a good game. with good graphics. the maps looks very good and have a great texture. this game can almost be played on every pc cuz it dont ask a lot of the pc. and haves almost no lagg. the character models and weapons can maybe get improved a bit cuz they dont look really good in my opinion. if u have a weapon with a skin the weapon looks great. so maybe the character model can get improved a bit. for the rest its a great game. + points : no lagg. good graphics. nice weapon skins. great maps. - points : the character models",303.8
"its important to appreciate games like this for what they are, and this game is a callback to a past chapter of video game history thats been buffed and polished. and unfortunately as someone who never actually played the original counter-strike games, im not in much of a position to judge exactly how well they pulled this off. basically, it entirely boils down to the kind of person you are. if youre a die-hard counter-strike fan, then this is probably all you can ask for. if youre a more typical gamer who just finished playing crysis or battlefield and wants to pick up something to play over the weekend, then trust me when i say that this is not the game for you. its the online fps equivilent of dark souls, in a way.",69.8
"good game to play, except for getting spawn killed lol",90.8
"it needs func_vehicle. seriously it needs func_vehicle  func_vehicle now, func_vehicle forever! long live func_vehicle! func_vehicle func_vehicle func_vehicle func_vehicle",99.5
"nice, fun and competitive shooter. no fancy extras such as jetpacks or anything but the drop system is very fun and you have a lot of weapon skins you can get",105.1
"i love this game even if i havent played it that much yet.",928.1
"i never played counter-strike before. cs:go was the first cs i ever played and i love it! great gameplay, good graphics, simple tasks and lots of missions. the thing i love the most about this game is that you can actually earn cool skins. you should definitely buy it!",648.8
"just a cool counter strike game which is fun. enough said go buy it.",871.7
"as hard as it is to wrap my head around first-person shooters, counter-strike: global offensive was unexpectedly one of the easier games to pick up and wrap my head around. i was always afraid of competitive- id never played a multiplayer match until about a month or so ago- and i never expected much by way of nice attitudes from the community. boy, was i wrong. bout 90% of the matches we hit had fair, nice, understanding, and overall good-hearted players. theyd understand if you made a mistake- and would help you through it on occasion. this game has its fair share of exploiters, hackers, and general douches who will act like  to you, but theyre quite the minority from what ive seen.",160.6
"yes, you mays usckl buy u buy gunsz and u shot thing and if you suck you r nbad amd the comnuty would setroy u",805.9
"amazing game, sad thing, alot of trolls, or you get put in teams with people who dont have a single clue on what theyre doing",453.4
"i like this game becuz shurif scrappy is gud and mick is mean and so is simon seacucumber but that doesnt matter becuz i am kind of gud at the game wen it cums to killing jfj becuz jfj is bad and dereko is bad and reece is bad and timmipoo is bad and space is bad and erectin is bad!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1",29.0
"this game is actually pretty good. it even inherits my epic gmod jumping skillz. 8.5/10 (some maps need pay/ theres no mods. but all together pretty good game.)",25.4
"best game ever if you like competive games this is for you",61.6
"this game is amazing im not even going to explain it.... just buy it :d",1272.4
"really fun game. it has some quality of shooting real weapons like recoil, which makes the guns somewhat balanced and unspammable. fun once you get to the point that you know what your doing.",227.5
"this is my first cs game i have played and owned. i am sad that i have not play them before! this is a great game, and i have and am going to put many hours into this game. hope i can go somewhere with it!",1335.0
"why not to make this game free-to-play? most of free-to-play shooters are oldschool games (cs logic) with microtransactions. this is valve another free-to-play",2.3
"i play offline alot, so i was excited to find that counter-strike: global offensive had an offline with bots feature. it is really fun to kill bots and defuse bombs as a counter-terrorist. its also kind of funny when you spectate a bot to find that they have horrible accuracy. i like using shotgun weapon, and testing out cs:go skins on an offline server without bots. i do recommend this game.",20.7
"0/10 did not strike counters that were globally offended. also i was face to face against a guy with an awp and ih ave novuh, i shoot first right in the face to him, he apparently is in the matrix and dodges every single pellet that comes out of my gun and in turn shoots me in the face. yay. also gun spray mechanics make no sense what so ever.",31.9
"this game is so fun and amazing to play if u dont have it now u should buy it",1213.2
"this is a great game, im really glad they re-revamped counter strike it looks great feels great :)",21.3
"good game bit diffrent from css moving closer to cod i guess but overall fun game long learning curve",116.3
"when im winning, this is the best game ever created. when im losing, i want to uninstall and remove it from my library forever. 5/5",788.5
"at first i was cynical and hesitant to accept this as the successor to cs:s, as it only appeared to be better graphically. but im very glad i gave it a chance. cs:go feels like more of a modern shooter; think battlefield or cod, but done purely in a cs-oriented way: an improvement of cs:s. the weapons feel more versatile and there are less worthless weapons like there were before, in source there were really only 5 or so acceptable guns but in go, i find myself picking up many different weapons for different situations. the new maps are a welcome, i always thought the original lineup was rather limited (note: there are a few maps from cs:s that did not make it into cs:go, however, they are not really missed). a great fps experience, especially with friends. killing each other brings us closer together, no?",122.0
"if you are looking to get addicted to betting, and trading you cant go wrong here. very fun",214.6
"i dont usually play shooters. i actually hate them! but this game... its a masterpiece. it never gets old, backwards playability, partial controller support, skins, and so much more! so go ahead, buy it!",68.6
"best rage simulator out there! 10/10 best game ever. shoot people with the weapons invented such as p90/autos. <- silvers love them <3",1249.6
"if youre into competive, try this game. live short enough to call a noob and long enough to be called a hacker! xd",455.3
"it has every basic element of original game with many more things. graphics are very nice with no effect on performance. new maps and modes are well designed and fun to play. overall forget old ones and play this.",24.8
"i have played a lot of call of duty (until bops 2) and battlefield fps shooters, but this one takes the cake. with all of the issues with bf4 at launch, i wanted to try cs as ive heard a lot of positive buzz about it. wow...the map designs are great, no netcode or lag issues (that ive seen), people are helpful in the game (as a newb i need a lot of advice), and the graphics are really good. i would definitely recommend this game - especially when you can get it on sale. its a lot of fun and very challenging.",190.2
"(latest review) what do you do in this game??? shoot sh*ts up bang bang bang booooooooooooooooooooooom kinna like mordern fps...just like cod but hey,its not the sameeee.it has kick  graphs,differnet modes to play,and fun as playing gta v as trevor.physics?...no dont talk about this okay?......nao i dont... overall:9/10,wouldve been better if its have more modes.i know theres a opreation bravo thingy but...not free?i guess.~not ign (extened) i got a field-tested p250 franklin on a random casual match. 10/10 best game. execpt i saw a chicken floating at midair",290.9
"insanely fun fps. recommended. crates will make you addicted.",471.1
"this is one of the hardest games in the world. do not play unless you are willing to go threw frusteration as you build your skill. there are a lot of great players, there are also some cheaters. when you come acrost someone who is blatently cheating, just report them and players that are trusted by valve will review the gameplay and take the proper actions.",253.2
"been playing for 12 years. i still cant get bored of it. best shooter ever made.",1383.6
"really enjoyable especially with the drop system and competitive matchmaking.",338.7
"i opened a case for $2.49 and got a skins worth 10 cents",788.7
"best fps ive played to date. i couldnt really complain this game requires all skill and cheaters are pretty much for the most part are non-existent. lacks some features that modern day shooters have but honestly the gameplay literally just beats any shooter ive ever played so i cant complain. if you are looking for a game that is based on strict skill than this game is for you. but be warned, its not for everyone. personally, ive had a few friends try the game but they rely on over-powered weapons and even cheats to play the game. also if you decide to pick up this game you will learn fluent russian in about a week. im not kidding. 5/5 : best shooter ive ever played to date.",618.9
"man this game is the greatest fps around nobody does it better than this!! the creators and all around leader in multiplayer team and tactics shooter there is.... period.",920.5
"this game is an amazing multiplayer game with bots and other awesome features. i really liked it how they added the gun game. but there is one down side...... when you get capsules and weapons cases you have to pay 1-3 dollars just to open one. 9/10 altogether a great game. thumbs up!",538.4
"amazing game but the community of players is one of the worst in any game .......",864.2
"get judged on your teams skills during competitive matchmaking; 0/10. dont even attempt competitive if you dont have a pre - organised team. great game if you do - 9/10",338.2
"i like moaning as loud as i can in the mic whenever i get a kill 10/10",138.2
"the game of a generation. travel the globe and gather the most wonderful objects created by man. put them in a magic bag with a pile of moondust. the contents of said bag would still suck in comparison to counter-strike: global offensive. 10/10.",3.4
"this game is ing . riddled with hackers and  heads named chow and kelkoo.",668.8
"great fps, with a more realistic feel compared to other fps such as call of duty. contains only a select number of guns, but sometimes new ones may be added. not the best of communities, but is still one of the best games on steam. 8.5/10",284.8
"you cant play unless you pinch ya mums credit card ya dirty silver.",1102.0
"elegantaro remember polish is not the same as russia",875.4
"so many hackers, dont buy this game if you dont want to play with potatos againts hackers, it is impossible to rank up in this game, just saying, only fun thing in this game is nothing.",507.2
"i have never played counter strike until now. best. game. ever.",822.5
"pretty one of the greateful and most popular valves games ever. cs:go its a new wave of oldschool cs 1.6, and it brings many nice mechanics, graphics and usability improvements. i recommend this game for all players, who play 1.6 may years ago and who would like to discover something new :)",357.6
"cs:go is really a great fps if you dont want to spend too much money on it. it is not as good as cod or battlefield but it is definitely an amazing fps.",24.6
"balanced and fair. if you lose its your own fault. how any shooter should aspire to be nowadays.",574.2
"awesome, but new engine not source would be perfect",374.0
"0/10 would no longer play this game. player base has went to hell, join any game and you get a cod  blocking you or doing anything to get in your way. was a gold nova 4 went into five games. got body blocked told to eat  ect ect. played 5 games lost 3. won 2. top chart or 2nd best each time. deranked to silver elilte. played more games. got deranked to silver 4 have won 19 games since. no rank up. teamfag blocks me when i have awp. kill him and enemy get 7 day. 10/10 would use uninstaller. oh and good luck trading anything of value. steam/valve. does jack s#it to stop scamers account hijackers and ect ect. this game is a de-railed train full of s#it head cod players.",493.2
"this game ing sucks holy  worst game ever on steam 10/10",357.2
"definitly the most enjoyable counter strike nowadays !",325.6
"expect togglers at top 3 highest mmr ranks. id suggest finding a mix/team to play with on 128 tick server on faceit, esea or other communities. great game though :) edit 2014-08-05: well, since everything is about skins these days and you can get votekicked from a match if you are playing with  polish/russian (other third world country) you will get banned for 1-4 hours due to getting kicked to much. this game will never be great, never again. ive gone from playing this 100% when i play on my pc, to about 2-4 matches per month. go figure :)",1301.9
"this game ruined my life :d , would highly recommend :d",577.5
"a great game to play with friends, some games can be great but others can be spoilt by cvheaters and smurf accounts. all in all a good game to get into. the create opening system is good as well even though it is quite expensive it makews it more fun and enjoyable.",928.4
"decides to go solo. 4russians appear in ur team. ur top fragging. 1v5. you die. you get kicked.",278.5
"pros: -ridculously fun fps -ridiculously cheap ($3.74 on sale) -one time purchase, no addons (not counting gun skins) -unforgiving realism makes it very challenging -insane replay value cons: -learning curve is extremely steep -game becomes literally infested with hackers during sales -a lot more foreign players than u.s. players (not an issue to foreign players, of course) -unforgiving realism makes it very challenging -community isnt particularly the best one out there, but its decent verdict: between this, call of duty, battlefield, and any other fps out there (well, minus tf2), id go with this. writing this review is kind of hard because being victorious in a 1v5 situation is something that cannot be described, only experienced. counter-strike as a franchise used to be one of the biggest out there, and hopefully it regains its turf someday.",244.0
"counter strike: global offensive is greatest mixture of strategy and first person shooting since its predecessor counter strike: source. starting out as just a mod, counter strike became the game which spread out branches making todays fps . put simply, the complete counter strike genre has always been the best fps/tactical shooter ever created.",1206.1
"very fun game, takes skill and hard effort and time to get anywhere but its great to play especially with friends. would recommend 10/10",431.5
"after playing over 190 hours of this game i suppose id better give a review for it. the gameplay of this game is extraordinary - the whole game is, like all counter-strike games, completely multi-player, meaning that the valve team can spend 100% of their time working on the game and making it run fine, instead of faffing around with a single-player campaign 5% of players will bother to play past the first level. the community, however... its terrible. but if you just realise that this is a $15us game, dont really take any offense to the little kids, theyre everywhere (but more so on call of duty). to summarize, this games excellent, buy it. now.",657.5
"ever get mad at a game and throw a fit of frustration yelling into your mic at how much your team sucks or that the guy that shot you through some walls across the map is a hacker? if not, welcome to counter strike. 10/10 would break keyboard again.",179.3
"well, this is the only fps game that i continued to play since the early versions of counter-strike. i can only comment on the classic competitive mode since that is my favorite and most played mode. many might think that cs is just a simple game where terrorist plants a bomb and counter-terrorist defuse the bomb. simple? i recommended to re-think that thought. cs is not a single player tactical game but a team tactical game. simple game mechanics does not necessarily mean an easy and boring game. be paired with noobs like myself and fight against veteran players with good aim; you and the team you belong to gets pummeled. being a lone player instead of a team player will result in losing the match(es). in cs, you have to be a team player, have an initiative, and situational awareness; add to that a good decision making skill whether to do it or not.",81.9
"i used to play cs, for a long time actually. i think this new entry in the series is actually getting better by the minute, especially with the new hud and competitive options, it stands to be the most competitive fps game in the scene, again. right where it deserves.",167.9
"probably the greatest 5v5 first person shooter there is.",1025.4
"first time i played this game, shot some bad guys, booya yeeha",20.4
"i have put 375 hours into this game and havent reggretted any of it its awesome",778.5
"starting to get hook up onto this game, addicting and very price worthy when u get in-game... community of csgo is also very kind and helpful, i love this game. i hope i get a knife tho. :)",486.9
"super duper competitive, but fun it was alright 8/10 -ign",98.6
"wow much funny, really killing people, much headshot",768.9
"very good and fun game if this is still being added to this is going to awsome",461.5
"theres still no dogs in this game... and i still cant watch them. also, i find it a little hard to move around and get supr pr0 h@3dsh0tttzzzz becus u hav 2 stand stil, whihc is stupid. valv3, y no ads? no, but seriously. buy this game. if youre looking for a competitive game thats not mmo, this is your game. its delightfully evil in its recoil patterns, and over 200 hours in this game and i still have trouble with recoil. not that its hard to learn, its quite easy. im just woefully stubborn... sometimes i feel weaker when my hair hits the speaker sometimes i feel stronger when to make it long fear, it surrounds me kicks n snares no boundries when the love of the music- wait this isnt a lyric page? oh. yeah. counter strike: global offensive. hard. fun. buy it. now. pls. k thx by by bby",1693.2
"this is a hardcore game, one of the best, but. it is not for the casual gamer. it will destroy you if you are a casual. the only game worse in that regard is unreal tournament. on a positive note, it is one of the best games ever made. period. you will not regret purchase, i will promise you that.",1332.5
"this game is so much fun its always being updated making it better, and the skins! there just great.",989.2
"worst cs game ever dont buy it! i got 500 hours and i dislike this idiot game to many smurfers and hackers! volvo you need to try harder if you want me to pay for another cs title",547.5
"i r8 this game 8/8,soooo much better then pajama sam.play this game in a lake and you automatically win,thats how good it is",572.5
"fun game, really brings back memories of the goold ol cs days.",218.3
"lovely game, fun to play alone and with friends. the community is maybe okey if you are a boy, but as a girl it can be to much sometimes. i do recommend the game!",720.6
"bought this game, played online, learned fluent russian 2 weeks later.",76.6
"search for inferno, assault, nuke, mirage, cache, ali, rush, black gold... whatever. youll play dust 2. a perfect dust 2 simulator. 11/10",609.9
"its a very nice game if you dont know it i think you should buy it because its good and you can hook up whit your teammates and friends and play togeter there are mutch game modes that i can talk about for about an hour so i think you just have to try it out on your own !",166.1
"saw a persons forehead, got headshotted by him. 10/10",472.2
"this is a very fun game to play, the best thing i like to play is compevetive becuase its really fun to play with a smal team of players and also to get items and win of course. i would of rate it 5 out of 5 if you are in to shooting games.",120.8
"amazing game. suberb graphics,realistic battleground, and challegeing. its pretty hot.",14.6
"i recommend this game because is so cool and sukar",1750.0
"good game besides the russian people you sometimes have to play with.",226.1
"i gambled away 100$ on cases and keys only to get a skin of 5 dollars in return and no knives 10/10 will gamble again :d",445.1
"the ultimate competitive shooter. steep learning curve and a gigantic amount of fun. 1.6 was a classic. source was magnificent. and this. well, lets just say it is a mix between those two. 9/10",1116.3
"this game isnt for light gamers but its great fun when im not smashing the keyboard against the wall.",91.5
"this game is really nice :) better to play with friends tho!",1080.3
"this game is amazing, i would recommend that anyone and everyone should get it and have a play especially fun with friends",637.0
"basicly, there are good players, bad players and hackers. the good players get called hackers, the bad players get kicked from all games because you know... they suck, then the hackers most of the time get away with hacking. only thing i dislike is that when you get shot in mid air or not you slooooooow down alot!",805.6
"great shooting game, its like youre in the military or doing a terrorist attack. there are arcade games and competitive matches like you are in a league tournament",360.1
"a brilliant game with tense games, hectic deatmatches and a massive weapon selection 10/10.",78.2
"this game is great fun for some relaxing gameplay but will start to bore after longer sessions. another good thing about this game is you can expend the pare pennies in your wallet on custon skins for guns. it can easily run on minimum settings on even integrated graphics making it great for playing with friends without gaming pcs/laptops like me.",93.4

"csgo continues the brutal, infuriating, and wonderful counter-strike series that taunts you to be a better player with every game. i was somewhat skeptical during the beta before the addition of the casual mode, but the continuous updates and gameplay additions makes it the new tf2 in my mind. the bifurcation of competitive from casual and gungame does a good job grouping players with like minds. this title is endlessly playable with a vibrant community that is quite a bit more mature than the cod (fish?) players that slime around the net. the map system and continued mod extensibility makes it a premiere title on steam. my lame complaints (no more tmp) (mp7/ump are too awful) (aimpunch kinda broken) dont really detract from the goodness to be had. graphics got a very nice upgrade over source and most of the maps got carried over. 9/10 for my next obsession.",947.1

"death is a great teacher. failure in counter-strike: global offensive is, as it always has been for this series, the greatest way to learn where you should have gone, what you shouldnt have done, and how you could have done better. counter-strike players spend a lot of time learning -- consequently, they are always getting better. growth is an important factor in global offensive, especially if youre coming into counter-strike fresh or after a sabbatical. this is an extremely hardcore, skill-based first-person shooter, and it forces you to think differently than other modern shooters. if youre a call of duty player, youre going to need to change your play style to succeed here. counter-strike also tries developing into something new here as well, despite doing little to push itself beyond what its always done best. global offensive modifies old maps to keep veterans on their toes, and introduces official new modes that encourage different play styles for the first time in almost 15 years.",500.3

"if you are into heavy fps games. you will found counter strike global offensive one of the few games where everything works in them. in counter strike global offensive most of the servers are running with 64-128 tickrate, and that means that your movement will update faster then other fpss. if you take battlefield 4 for a example most of the server on battlefield 4 is running 30 tickrate, so there you can see that your movement will update faster on counter strike global offensive than on battlefield 4. the number 1 thing about counter strike global offensive is teamwork. if you play competitive you will see that many of the people playing competitive will communicate over voip. so i will recommend counter strike global offensive to all people because its a good game, you can play with friends, you can make money of it, you can see what skill level you are my the in-game ranking system that goes from sliver to global elite. so i will give counter strike global offensive 10/10",1285.8

"this is a very good game. challenging, but its entertaining. its a bit annoying when it comes to going competitive mode since you have to deal with random people that you have never met and very hard to co-operate. very suggested to create a team and all within your team to improve on aiming, recoil, and spray pattern techniques. anyways, its very good when it comes to muscle memories etc. because of this game. ive managed to not break a glass on the floor because of my quick reaction. anyways, i recommend this to people who enjoys fps games!",453.5
"i am going to give a few pros and cons.. pros -really fun to play with friends, who has mics, who you make a full team of 5 in competeive -you can meet really nice people in game -this game will still be alive for many years to come -game is really hard to master. why is that good you might ask? cause you will keep playing this game for many hours just to get the basics down. cons -there is trollers/mean crude people in the game, who are far better than you. -hackers (this is a big one later in the game of competeive play) you will come across them very often in high skilled level games. -complainers who just gives you complete negetivity in the game. like wow how the  did you not get the kill you ing scrub? -csgo skins (yes i have csgo skins blahaha) i am going to go with a postive review on this as a like. this is the type of a game i really like.

"i recommend this game only on certain parameters. if youre looking for a story, theres none i could find. theres pratically an economy on this game as in people will spend outrageous amounts of actual money on such as gun skins. it has....interesting shooting mechanics to say the least, not your standard shooter, but thats what makes it funner. like shooting people in the face(ak only)? this is probably the game for you and probably already in your library somewhere.",189.8
"this has to be my favourite pc shooter. it can be fun to play casually or competetivley, and is also quite easy to get into. although the tutorial kinda sucks, if you have a friend that plays they should be able to teach you, and before you know it you will be master guardian.",375.2

"i dont get it. everyone says this game (or cs in general) is amazing. i always see my friends play it, so i decided to try it. there is no reward for completing a match or any progression where you unlock new weapons, etc. the only thing you can really unlock is weapon skins, with your real money. every game it is just rinse and repeat, kill, round over, respawn, no reward. i guess people like it that way, but it is not for me. i have to admit the gameplay is pretty fun and when you kill its pretty rewarding too. p.s. there is a huge learning curve",57.6

"a really good first person tactical shooter which is the most fun in competitive games. buuuuut the game has a couple (lol, way 2 many) negative sideffects, such as: -paranoia -after 2 days of playing competitive you will hate russians for the rest of your life. all russians gotta be exterminated (no racist) -youll also hate little french kids. -an empty wallet, but a weapon which is made out of gold and counts kills. isnt that cool? ---and many more negative effects---",353.2
"new cs after 12 years? doesnt get better than this.",6.4
"its a pretty fun game. you just have to learn how to play it first. you cant play it like cod or bf and just run n gun most of the time since you only have 1 life in most gamemodes. most fun youll every have in this game is playing competetive with some friends and even when you suck you have fun doing it. also micro transactions make the gaming world go round.",435.5
"i love this game, i recommend to buy this because there are skins, ranking, original valve servers with deathmatch, gungame (armsrace), casual (the normal game), competitive (i love this one), deconstruction and more. there are pub servers also. better than cs 1.6 and better than cs:ss aswell :). and the most important thing is low count of hackers !",1383.3
"this is a great game, but it takes a lot of skill. if you dont have the patience to climb up this games steep learning curve, i would suggest not buying. otherwise, it is worth the price completely.",1105.6
"being that i have only played this game for less then 50 hours and can already jump into the competetive gamemode and play with other people around the world to earn ranks is a great thing to have added to a game. i have played many first person shooters and this one by far caught my interest because in most fpss you can ads but in this game it was all about hip fire and controlling your spray, with the occasional weapons that can ads. i highly recomend this game to everyone that can afford the $15 price. if you cant wait for a sale! everything goes on sale eventually, and this is definetly worth the wait!",206.4
"amazing game, one of the best game ive ever played :d (y)",105.6

"i played my first match of casual cs:go and straight away realised this is alot like garrys mod, so i tried to noclip and was shot... i then play my first competitive match and wondered why everyone had gold stars and aks so i went into paint and drew one to use as my profile picture. then finally i was walking around office slighty more experienced at the game in genral, learning grenade tactics and peaking ect, i then came to realise that i had killed quite alot of people that round and began to be called a hacker/smurf which obviously wasnt true considering i have 1 account and at the time about 5 hours game time, so thats somthing to keep in mind, note to self: (eveyone, when they rage call others hackers). and finally chickens, i knifed one, got hungry, went downstairs, made chicken sandwhich, came back upstairs, 30 minute ban. 10/10 would knife again.",595.6

"counter strike: global offensive (otherwise known as cs:go) is the newest game in the counter strike series. since ive already done a review of counter strike: source, im just going to talk about the many gameplay changes that go introduces to the series. firstly, the guns all have more kick to them, making run-n-gun players hugely greivanced. the guns all feel authentic and sound amazing, but i personally dont enjoy using the snipers and i cant stand the heavy weapons (i.e. miniguns). the weight of each gun has been pretty drastically increased, leaving slower and more methodical gameplay in its path. if you remember cs:s, there a probably 2 things you noticed: 1. there were very few shotguns, and 2. there were only two grenade types. well, in go, there are now 5 types of shotgun, and 4 different types of grenades! i personally believe is the best game in the counter strike series, and its methodical gameplay makes for a difficult experience, for both newcomers, and seasoned veterans.",15.2

"always been a counter-strike fan, played them all and this is my favorite one by so far and this brought me back to the series after a long break. absolutely love the competetive matchmaking to find players to almost equal skill level as you and the feature to party up with your friends and play a game (casual or competetive) with them. and the new game modes are also fun and the fact that you can search official cs servers and the community made ones. the game is good, but they need to buff the shotties a little bit (except the mag-7) cause im tired of getting 80-98 damage point blank (espacially with the nova)! shotties are made to kill with one shot or medium damage with fast followup shots. :c (okay rant part is over) summary: i love this game alrdy even tho only 70 hours in the bank, but it has its problems like every game out there. if you like fps games and/or counter-strike give this game a try and be brave and try out the competetive matchmaking too! :3",714.3

"played cs games since cs 1.0. loved it then... hate it now. but why shouldnt you buy this specific iteration in the series? 1. same graphics. nothing to get excited about at all. if you have css, you pretty much have this. 2. same maps. 20 years later, de_dust is still boring and yet still wins every map vote. 3. the game is well balanced and fun. enter awp. again. hurr lets just add this 1 hit kill gun so nobody wants to use anything else ever unless the server forces them and the game becomes a ridiculous cluster of unrealistic, window-camping snipers 4. no iron sights? its 2014. the aimpoint scopes on guns that traditionally had scopes of some kind, are nice. but its still awful to not be able to aim most of your guns. in 2014. in conclusion, i bought this in a sale for about $4 and im still disappointed. i no longer consider myself a counter-strike fan.",44.8

"yeah, lets write this review of cs:go shall we. good game, allright graphics, nothing spectacular, but the reason i dont like this game what so *ing* ever is the same reason as with why i stopped playing cs altogether so many years ago. the games community sucks and theres a hell of a lot of cheating. it is counter-strike alright, nothing more, perhaps a bit less. on a scale from 1-10, 8 for the game itself with the enhanced graphics, sounds, purchasing system and what not, 1 for gamingpleasure. do. not. buy. this. game. its not worth the price, since youre probably gonna ragequit in 30 minutes into the game anyway.",18.2

"dont turn a blind eye on this one just because it looks more casual. cs:go still contain all flavors of brutal consequence , fantastic gunplay and just simply pump you up with loads of adrenaline everytime you play it. however , its highly competitive nature of the game might put new players off. but to be fair , the game does the decent job of introducing guns feeling and patterns through more faster paced mode like arms race and demolition. buy it or not? i am not gonna lie that this game might get a glimpse of becoming f2p from latest guns skin market update. but dont let this discourage you. it still shine among the pile of games with the same price and even the same genre.",164.0

"good fun. spent far too long on it... one of my all time favourite games. easy to get into for beginners, with more polish and more forgiving gamemodes than previous titles in the series. and of course, the competitive scene is vast and has great depth. pulling off headshots and winning the round is amazing.",1173.8

"great game in general. the learning curve is much steeper than other games that are newer and is satisfying to play. just a blast to play so far. although so many other people are incredibly skilled, keep at it and get gud skrub. one of the most fun fps out there in the gaming world. i would recommend this game to all fps lovers. also a very competitive game, but the matchmaking system makes sure that similar skill levels play each other and not global elite professionals. i think that its an excellent continuation of the counter-strike series.",120.1
"best fps game ive ever played really fun to play whit friends",784.6
"counterstrike really struck gold since its launch in 2012. not only the game on its own is nice looking and plays very well, the workshop offers a place for the community to put their own designed skins for the guns. this is probably the reason why valve also makes allot of money off of this game. it is pretty cheap at around 5-7 dollars/euros, but the selling of skins on the market, even though they only get a couple of cents for each,really gets in the money. not to mention the cases; these are boxes filled with a variety of gun skins ranging from ordinary (blue) to extremely rare (red), if you get really lucky and strike a knife you are instantly guaranteed around 50+ dollars (at the moment). ofcourse it is very prestigious to own a knife so most people like to show it around. lastly, recently a tournament in germany attracted the attention of over 400,000 people on twitch at once! this is huge, making cs:go one of the best shooters of this moment.",374.9

"a fresh perspective on the modern shooter. the casual play of this game is average and entertaining with several community produced game modes, varying from a mini-games based server to a server where you surf and slide down large ramps all the meanwhile fighting off opponents. the competitive play is what sets this game aside from any other shooter i have played. in the competitive mode there is an air of intensity and focus each time i play, with a need to rise in rank you do all you can to communicate to youre team effectively in order to secure a win. the sheer amount of effectiveness in strategy and tactics a team can deploy eclipses that of what 1 team member can do. the game also forces you and youre team to emrace the economic factors of the in game play, this is unique to the counter strike series and creates a whole new branch of possiblities in strategy. the 15 bucks for this game was more than well spent, i can imagine myself playing for atleast another 100 hours. 9.5/10",262.0

"dead, once again, but you get used to it in counter strike. any longtime fan will tell you to never run through smoke and to always check your corners. sound a little intense? it is, but appropriatly so considering that this game has million dollar tournaments and one of the most competitive communities in the world. the game only has five game modes i believe and no single player (besides offline with bots) and there are only two main online mode. moving on however these modes have incredible replay value. i will assume that you know the basics - planting the bomb, defusing the bomb, protecting the hostages, saving the hostages...but hours upon hours you will sink into this game memorizing the maps and spray patterns and then boom headshotting people. buy the game now, unless you have a life because this game will take it with its one more round addictiveness and a brilliant although divided counter strike community will guide you through your journey into terrorism and counter terrorism.",110.8

"its like tf2 with gun skins instead of hats bought this game for like 2 keys, then i ended up getting up turning this game into a money maker. with all the things i got from this game, i managed to buy a copy of goat simulator (amazing game), and have some keys to blow off and unbox, and have some nice  stattraks to play around with. i turned those 2 keys into at least over $50 in total. making skins in this game is a fun thing to do also, hopefully one day one of my skins will be accepted into the game",148.1

"wow. this game is great. at first, you will get your  handed to you like a scrub. unless you played counter strike and counter strike source. in which case, you should be fine. this game can only be played well, with good internet. and you need to not rage. trust me, its hard not to, but its way more fun to have fun. (makes sense, right? xd) anyways, this game is a money grabber, and can bag you dollars as well. with the case system, your chances of getting rare weapons are slim, but when you do get one, you feel amazing. (espically that damn butterfly knife) i extremely recommend this game to anyone looking for an fps. even cod players could play this game. granted that they know the game controls. and dont ask, how does one aim down sights. because you cant. never. bottom-line good game. buy it.",444.2
"valve,you beautiful watermelon loving,3 declining butterflies. counter strike: global offensive feels like a very fresh,new game after playing cs 1.6 or cs:source. theyve changed many things and visuals are just the start of it. the game is very balanced and takes good skill for you to win. the new competitive mode and matchmaking style is very similiar to dota 2 and that is great seeing as dota 2s system works great! those who are not a fan of it can always play unranked matches by using the good ol source server browser. other than that,cs:go had an update not too long ago that adds a bunch of weapon skins that can be acquired by simply playing the game. so it follows the style of dota 2 (and a lil bit of tf2) yet it doesnt ruin the balance. valve has also remade the classic maps from the older counter strike games and with that added new ones. this is definitely a game any fps lover should get!",336.4
"great game! if you would like to have fun with some friends, its great!!! you learn to trust your friends more, as you go through tactics and ideas in which would help your team win!! if not, you can go offline and play with bots, you can choose easy, medum or hard!! with this, you get to practice while your friends dont and you can surprise them with your understanding or how the map or game mode works!! if you would like a fun, action packed game, pick this one!!! however!!! the baning system on this game is stupid!! my game crashed before a competative match and now i have a 7 day ban!!! i mean, wtf???

"very immersive experience. great visual effects and graphics. stunning performance when it comes to highly action-packed moments: the game has no stutters whatsoever and always runs smoothly. neat variety of gamemodes to choose from, along with competitive matches, which represent a great feature of the game itself. they are complex, yet very understandable, which is good. only slight drawback is the community, or at least a big part of it. many people, unfortunately even in competitive matches, do not show any interest in the game itself by cheating and hacking, or simply by throwing the match and dragging the whole team down. overall very well made game. all it takes to master it is practice. everything else is already taken care of.",730.7
"a new entry to the counter-strike family that does more than just upgrading the graphics. the new matchmaking for competitive has made the game easier to approah for new-comers and more challenging for veterans; as you face enemies who are close to your skill level. i reccomend this old-school tactical fps for anyone who wants a new rebalanced feel on an old shooter formula.",656.6

"definitely a great game. competetive is the only mode to play though. it is a 5v5, best out of 30 (first to 16). play to win skins, play ranked matches, a league of legends type ranking system. world wide ranking system, extremely fun to play with friends.",1011.8

"feels very much like source should have been. like the original with some updated graphics and new weapons. positives: -very similar play to 1.6 in terms of recoil and play -new weapons -new skins -new maps -cheap @ under $15 my gripes: -no servers in my area so i cant play with less than 70ms in competitive. -only competitive allows for map selection, god i would love to take de_dust ii off of my map rotation list for dm warmup. -smurfs running in all ranks are potentially fun ruining and there is no option to surrender or leave unless someone else abandons and cops a 1hour or upto 1 week penalty. -buy menu sucks, way too big and clunky - honestly prefer the old cs 1.6 classic menu to this. overall totally worth the $14.99 and a definite pickup on steam sales, most of my gripes wont affect everyone but are just my personal view of what issues that the game has.",491.5
"simply a awesome game.... it gives you that classic fps feel made by valve (the guys from steam). so the game involves everything steam has to offer. good examples would be the voice over ip, the integrated market system and etc. and with market system, i mean that you can actually earn money by the items you earn through the game :) the cons however would be the same as every other arena/competitive shooter.... although i must say, that the beta system in place called overwatch. somewhat involves the community in countering some of the cons.",582.6

"the game is great for those who have played the previous ones. if youve played source then youll feel right at home. the best part about this game is that it seperates itself from other first person shooters like battlefield or call of duty. cs:go has a much higher learning curve than any fps out there, but once you learn how to aim and shoot, cause you cant just hold it down like cod, youll start to become a master at it. although there are some problems with competitive(*cough*) hackers, its still an amazing game. and even if you suspect of there being a hacker, although its not often, you can always go back and watch your match again and spectate the person who you have suspicion on. overall, in my opinion, the game deserves a solid 9/10",340.7

"cs go... where to start... this game has a lot of great and a lot of bad stuff. i will not deny any of the problems cs go has... for example the tick rates and bad community. but the game has a lot of good stuff aswell and tries somewhat to keep the old cs running. i would rather play cs:s tho but cs go has better popularity and competative match making. this game is like 50/50 when it comes to skill and luck. if you keep your crosshair on someones head from a long distance and just one taps theres a 50/50 that you hit or miss because the game did not register the shot. 128 tick might make this like 80/20 or 90/10 that you will hit but still  when you compare to the older versions of cs history. i think this game is worth it tho. you can play this game for days without end and still have lots of fun if you play with your friends. i recommend you to get a team of some sort and play your way up in ranks.. best way.",916.9

"valve really delivered with this latest counter-strike game! its got a wonderful built in queueing for competive matches that places you with similar skilled players, a giant playerbase including mappers and community built servers with custom playermade content, and custom gun models that just drop from playing the game so you can show off all your cool looking skins to the other ~9 players trying to murder you. you can also sell ingame drops for more steam games or other skins! the quick competive queue option has made my love of counter-strike renewed and the constant updates are always fixing the issues that do arise and balance the game rather nicely. 10/10, if you like a simple, easy, reaction based shooter then youll love this game!",433.2

"this is a great franchise which started 10+ years ago. this game starts off with a cheap price even though it wasnt hit by a great steam sale. it is one of the best competitive games, but the elo system is a bit odd and doesnt have an indicator to when you are going to rank making you guess it out. overall most computers are able to run them; even the cheap $300 dollar dell you just bought from best buy. my biggest complaint with the game is the audio settings as you cannot adjust the output volume or incoming volume, and many other audio issues. not much hackers now a days but you will see a few lingering hackers. i give it a 8/10 since there is no default single player for those loving single player campaigns and stuff.",550.1

"this game is so fun to play if youve played css (counter strike source) then you will love cs:go with the awesome graphics which make the game fun and the slight realism towards the game by contrast, cs is totally egalitarian. everyone has access to the same items, and players arent ranked. nobody cares if you play four hours a day, seven days a week. all that matters is how well you negotiate the next firefight. you might take out half of the enemy team... but then again, a much less skilled player might blind you with a flashbang grenade and unload his top-of-the-line shotgun into your skull. its not unusual to see a good player climb to the top of the scoreboard only to decline back into mediocrity. in cs, skill and alertness are your primary weaponsand when you get tired, there are no unlockables to help you keep your edge.",131.7

"an incredibly fun fps that is well worth the price. however, keep in mind that this fps is completely different from other shooters like cod or battlefield. if youre going to treat cs:go like such, youre going to have a bad time. imo, cs:go has a much higher learning curve compared to these fpses ive mentioned and youre probably going suck when you first start. however, once you pass this learning curve, getting kills will be much more satisfying in this game compared to getting kills in cod/bf. 10 chickens/10 would recommend.",78.8
"this is a great game in many ways it is more accessible then the 1.6 version (which was already very accessible). but new players are able to learn how to play very fast and their enjoyment is greater then the one they would have had at the start of 1.6 or cs source. but on the other hand there is one little gripe i have and it is that i balive they made it to simmple, and when i say little i mean tiny, so the gripe is only personal i believe and it shouldnt effect your gameplay. enjoy the game :)",589.7

"counter-strike: global offensive is a upgrarded version of source,which means new weapons, new maps and some changes in the gameplay.for instance , when you move and looking from a sniper scope the image blurres which prevents player quickscopping.the new weapons are far more balanced from the previous ones and the player has a greater motive to buy the cheap ones because of the dfferent kill rewards each individual weapon offers(the cheaper the bigger money reaward).also some changes in the classic maps have been made,for example the dust map has a new entrance under the tunnel which leads to the bridge.from technicall view the cs:go has better graphics from cs:source.in conclusion i would recommend this game not only to the cs fans-veterans but also to a fps gamer who wants to try something different.",755.3

"what can i say about cs:go? if you have ever played any of the cs games before then you need no review. it is pretty much the same as the others. this is what makes it a great game. they stuck to the core of what their games were. they added some new weapons and game types. my only suggestion would be that if the terrorst plant the bomb the last terrorist has a dead man switch so if you kill him it blows and you have to defuse it. i think that would make a great game option. i know the terrorists could just camp on the bomb then so it would have to be a proximity thing...... anyway great game get it and hit me up.",362.6

"i used to be super into good graphics and fancy new innovations in shooters, however, cs:go is a breath of fresh air in comparison to a lot of fps games on the market today. i played a tiny bit of source, but never really got into counter strike until now. the main thing i love about this game is actually its integration with the steam market place. the steam market makes the game more three dimensional, because it adds skins to your guns. you can buy and sell skins on the steam marketplace, and the entire system functions as its own economy. the steam workshop is also a cool feature, because after a few months pass, valve takes some designs from the community workshop and integrates them into the game. external websites also make cs go fun, because there are sites to bet on professional games and also trade with others. 9.5/10",958.7

"if you need a nice change from run & gun call of duty or battlefield, perhaps you dont need a change at all. counter strike has maintained the same basic principles for over a decade. positioning is everything. both positioning on the map, and of your crosshair. while correct positioning on the map provides great advantages, the end-all factor is aiming. aiming not only guns, but grenades. a well placed grenade that barely fits in a crack and completely blinds the enemy team can be the deciding factor in a close game. it requires many hours of play to understand each facet of cs:go. many games are easy to learn and hard to master. cs:go is hard to learn and master. the challenge is what makes victory so much better.",474.3

"counter-strike: global offensive raises the bar for tactical first person shooters. this game is finely tuned and balanced not only in gameplay but with map design as well, to create an even fight for both teams. this pushes players to not simply hope for lucky shots and instead think more strategically about their every move. the introduction of weapon skins gives people a cosmetic incentive to strive for, as there are different weapon skins to fit the individual style of every player. this combination of pristine gameplay and in-game economy makes this one of my favorite first person shooters to date and it will likely never be overshadowed by another.",843.0
"this game is great, its good for playing a match to kill time or playing competitive. just make sure to have a lot of experience and practice matches in causal matches before you play competitive because of the s call you a ing  or whatever the dickwards say. i highy recommend it for fps lovers and for competitive players.",215.8

"what amazes me about this game is the special ambience the player lives while playing the game consciously. its not just a random fps game thats about shooting the adversaries randomly, as it requires subliminal reactions and reflexes. the simplicity of the game makes the gamer focus more on the precision of his shots and actions than on the graphics (although the graphics are acceptable) and on the rest of the petty details. blatantly, the game was thoughtfully developed by the brave developers, who are still working on the game till nowadays, and are still considering the complaints of players and working on improving the gameplay to satisfy everybody. this game is a great successful accomplishment to the developers of valve. *proto tips the hat* overall: fascinating game.",902.3

"this version is a shame to the counter strike franchise, terrible map design where all ways to the bombsites are extremely claustrophobic and makes the game extremely ct sided together with powerfull smokes and fire grenades, not to mention useless flashbangs dont help the t side at all, bullet spread is completely wrong and overdone, you can spray 30 bullets into an opponent and only hit 1 or 2 bullets and skilled players are no longer able to clutch 1 vs x situations compared to cs 1.6, unbalanced weapons like mag7 and p90, wallbanging was for the most part removed, and sound positioning is terrible too. there are just too many wrong things with this game, if it wasnt for the skins and market system and valve spending money on tournaments this game would have never become popular. hope this game stops being supported and valve releases a new proper version with help of the competitive community.",225.9

(4)not good at cs games, bad aim? -blame the lag. tell me if i forgot something, also let me show you some types of people you will handle in this lovely game: (type1) those who just play normally, dont care about the chat or anyone else. (type2) those kind of people who dont play this game seriously, they do their best to troll / be funny. (type3)  got real, they play like its their last game! (type4) afk people, they join a game just to be afk.. (type5) mic spammers, mute everything on your settings before your headphones blow up! *mostly russians* (type6) they have no idea whats going on, its like an adventure game for them. this game is full of adventure, its sometimes a pain in the  however im fully recommending it.",301.9

"this is a great addition to the cs series. the maps look fresh, the models are great, and the gameplay is as tight as ever. the competitive mode offers a very quick way to find (relatively) balanced matches. one drawback though is the frame-rate issues the arms deal update has introduced, which many are experiencing and valve dont really seem to be looking to fix any time soon.",645.8
"this game is definitely a more strategically minded game than many fps games, notably cod and bf franchises. however the one lacking element of cs:go is the hit registration. it is just appalling and really lets down cs. overall however, it has opened my mind from the fast paced fps of cod and bf and my in game tactical knowledge has benefited from the slow pace of this game.",555.2

"unlike the previous counter strike games this one has more flavour added into it therefore making it a lot funner and less boring. the maps are a lot more detailed and designed making you feel like your in a real place not just some boring map with a few crates and 1 texture. the tactics are very well done. not like call of duty where you can just run out shooting and get shot multiple times and not die. if you do that on this game then may as well rage quit before thinking of buying this game. graphics are very good considering this is a source game. buy it. its worth it!",22.8
"cs:go is a great multiplayer online shooter. even though you cant ads that doesnt matter, also its a valve game that should be expected. ive put a lot of time into this game and i dont plan on stopping any time soon. the community only seems to grow and playing competitive is a lot of fun since you dont really ever get teammates that troll (from my experience so far). overall its the best online shooter i have ever played since cs:s.",92.3

"its a good game. its much harder to pick up than any other shooter because of its mechanics. this isnt really a bad thing, as youll get used to it eventually and it makes it even more fun to get kills (especially headshots) because of its difficulty. the community in this game isnt really the best, as most of the players playing in competetive are people who wont cooperate and russians. this makes it really heard to communicate with your team you might have been matched with in the competetive gamemode. so having somebody you know to play competetive with is much better and easier as teamwork is necessary for winning this game. other than that i must say that most weapons here are very well balanced because of how the money system works. if i would have the option to change one thing in this game it would be to make competetive (or just generally all valve servers) 128 tick, as it would make the game more based on how well you play and less on whos the most lucky in a gunfight.",1461.9
"counter-strike: global offensive (csgo), in a nutshell, is a fun fps with an awesome community. sure the gameplay is different than other fpss, but thats because valve listens to their customers. counter-strike has been around for a long time, and its gameplay has barely changed since it was released. games like call of duty and battlefield are constantly changing, so what happens is they loose their old fans, and gain new ones. counter-strike has always kept their gameplay remotely the same, so they keep their old players, and gain some new ones. for example, in call of duty you aim down your sights in order to be more accurate, in counter-strike, you crouch. yes i know aiming down your sights makes more sense, but valve doesnt care, because they know that their players dont care. i know this was a short review, and i focused more on gameplay than anything, but if you are into fpss, put this game on your wishlist and buy it when its on sale. you wont regret it, valve knows what theyre doing.",339.8

"as an ex call of duty player this game was more than an average change in tone from your regular fps. despite not having jaw dropping graphical fidelity and advanced texture tessalation like some of the next gen games do, and not having as many features as other aaa fps games do. cs:go makes for a unique take and updated version of a mod-born fps franchise that exceeds quailty over quanity. while it may seem lacking in basic things that fps games have become accustomed to like leveling up, you quickly begin to appriciate that go is a game that wants to stand out as something different. every different feature gives go an inch and when you start to add those features and differences together you start to find that cs is slowly taking over the fps stage. 1 inch at at time. for all time fps fans this game will keep you playing until you look at your watch thinking what felt like an hour, turned into six. thats the mark of a great game. personal rating (my oppinion): 9/10",49.5

"its a must if you are into fps. it is a perfect opportunity if you have not got into counter-strike games yet. if youve played previous for a long time there are things changed that you might not be as happy about. in general it is very easy to navigate from simple deathmatch/arm race(gun game) games to casual and competitive games. ranks are really good to see how good that player is(unless its a lwo rank hacker that will ruin your rank, but i havent seen a single hacker in competitive yet). in other words its the game ive played the most on my account and still loving it. must get!",1066.6
"i love this game because its not only about running and shooting, its a more tactical shooter and more skill and team play based than all other games i know. its great to play with friends in a team but also allone its still good to play. another big advantage is the price, its a brilliant game and comparable to bf or cod but it costs only 13.99 euro in steam, and you never get tired playing.but the big advantage of the price is the biggest disadvantage as well because many hackers are online and only their steam account gets banned from cs, not their ip or pc and buying a new game for 13.99 is not a big deal.",1514.7
"counter strike global offensive offers something unique (and competitive) to the shooter scene and should not be taken lightly. the fights are quick and intense. rounds are short and every life counts. just remember that practice makes perfect and youll get the hang of it in no time! if you are interested in testing the waters so to speak, i recommend you play the game somewhere before buying because its not a game for everyone. this fact however does not diminish its value whatsoever so dont be discouraged if you want to buy it anyway. you might just have a blast playing.",18.4

(counter-source is my most played games by like 100 hours btw.) we were playing arms race and demolition and casual mode. arms race is stupid but so much fun. demolition is a fun quick version of defuse where you get new guns every time you kill someone. those stupid bots? well you can take over them if you die. very fun with friends, not great own your own but arms race is quite addicting and allows you to play on your own if you want. i like this game, source will always be my favourite shooter game, but this one is really good too.",50.1
"dear santa, for christmas, i would like for cs:go to receive an ai overhaul. you see, when i play a game, and a teammate gets grumpy, they wind up leaving. that leaves me and my friends with a bot. this bot is not very bright and will often run out into anything, whether it be a smoke, an incendiary grenade, an awp, or a five man rush of p90s and tec-9s. at the very least, i would love for the ai to be able to sit down in a corner as though it were a chick hatching an egg everytime it was asked to stay here team. sincerely kim jung-un p.s. ive been very good at using my cs:go betting money to feed the people of north korea. it makes up 30% of our gdp.",202.9
"cs:go is definitely a huge development from source. its more realistic than before and the weapons+maps are well updated, however it lost its dusty/grungy feel to it. i think it sort of gravitated towards the call of duty futuristic look and im glad that they kept their game style of waiting until either team won, its more realistic that way. i prefer source over go but i still recommend this game",117.1

"the only reason this game is not being recommended is because of the matchmaking. on multiple occasions i have been matched with players who have 0.1 - 10 hours on the game, they have no idea where to look, they dont know positions nor how to shoot properly. i think valve need to step up their game with this because i would like to play with/against players at my skill level. another reason i am writing this review is smurfs, there are so many smurfs on this game its not funny, their aim of the game is to completely destroy you and make your cs:go experience a nightmare they do this for fun which i dont agree with smurfing is practically impossible to stop. besides from all the matchmaking problems the actual game itself is great, its a very strategic shooter, gunplay is nice and the graphics arent too bad either, if the matchmaking is fixed i will edit this review and recommend it, but for now its not recommended. 6/10 - fix the matchmaking!",667.6

"believe the hype and history: cs: go is the continuation of perhaps the best competitive fps of all time. while there is still room for improvement in a few spots to be more competitive (64 tick servers need an upgrade for starters, and hacking can be a huge problem in the upper ranks), and the game is far from perfect, when it comes down to it there are few gaming experiences that are this addictive and this competitively rewarding. nothing beats trying to clutch while your entire team is watching with (hopefully) bated breath. puchasing skins, while a vain money pit, adds a lot of personalization and (as oxymoronic as it sounds) shallow, vain depth. ez skinz ez lyfe. do yourself a favor, pick this up when it inevitably goes on sale on the summer sale this year (and subsequent years), conquer the steep learning curve, and get into the amazing esport that is counter-strike.",1047.5

"this is a great team game. if you have four friends, and you want something to do to pass 30-60 minutes, then go play competitive mode, which will put you with people of similar skill level using a ranking system. it has better graphics(which i doubt anyone really cares about but its nice,) it has new weapons from cs:s, it keep bunnyhopping, (but its much more difficult) and its an all around great team game. i definitely recommend it as it has stolen 800 hours from my life as of writing this. edit: at 1,200 hours taken away from me, its amazing ;w; edit 2: my friend killled the last guy, he found an awp, i tkd him because i wanted it, the whole time he was screaming nonononono and i picked it up and he yelled whyyyyyyy and i said i wanted it and then he asked for it back and i walked to my site to watch and he tked me and got banned, i swapped to the bot to find the awp, my other friend went to go get it, i killed him and got banned rip 1.5k hours",1560.2

"this is way better than 1.6 or source. both 1.6 and source are full of hackers, this one has too, but less. go also adds molotovs and decoys which is pretty cool. this version also has much better graphics and improved maps, which keeps me playing even more, because graphics do matter. gameplay stays faithful to the original 1.6, which is really great because theres lots of 1.6 players that moved on to this version. it also runs great on old hardware. rating: 9/10 if there were less hackers, it would be 10.

"cs:go is probably the best shooter out there. there are so many aaa shooters out there for example battlefield or call of duty. every year there is a new aaa game like this and you have to spend 30-60$ for this games. for cs:go you only have to spend 10-15$, and a new counter strike game comes only all 8-12 years. but you shouldnt start playing this game alone, tell your friends and play with them. so why should you buy the game? -it is very cheap -you can play it with your friends -you can earn money with it (creating weapon skins, bet on pro teams with skins or real money) -the cs:go community is the probably biggest and best community there is out there :) thanks for reading, i hope you enjoyed my review :).

"great game, nice skins overall and the game is pretty fun but there is one thing that i have to complain about and thats server tick. competitive servers use 64 tick servers and esports use 128 tick servers. this causes more lag and a slightly difference in aiming. 64 tick servers seem to be off (for me) my cursor is on them and the shots do not connect (ping is fine and under 50). i would still recommend this game to friend. p.s - stop putting this game on sale its the cause of mass hackers and smurds (not a typo) smurfing nerds. <3 pros: - nice gun skins - in game voice chat - in game item drops - competitive scene cons: - on sale often (allows more cheater and smurf accounts) - server tick 64 (could be 128 and valve has the money)",1157.5

"by looking at the amount of positive and negative reviews you can come to several conclusions. 1. (and most obvious one) this game is pretty good. 2. a lot of people play it. 3. you will be addicted to the game, after playing several hours! why? because this game may not be the fastest paced game, may not have the best graphics, may cause you to be jealous of others, because they have paints on their guns (also called skins) in the value of more hundred euros, it may even cause you to sabotage your pc by raging, but the satysfaction shooting others while using teamwork, finesse and map knowledge and killing them is so satisfying, like in no other game!",631.3

"great game, until you start playing it for real. in competetive you run into people who are many ranks higher than yourself, or people who got another steam account, then bought the game again, in order to kill nubblets. it is also not too rare to run into hackers or people that should not of been placed in the rank they currently are. then in casual, the same thing happens. this games matchmaking is horrid and needs a complete revamp.",762.6

"a much-refined first person shooter which recieves frequent balancing updates. while easier to get into than other competitive games (such as dota 2), the community can still be harsh if you underperform in the competitive mode (which comes with a decent, but not-yet-perfect ranking system). it features a few game modes appealing to all skill levels, and custom made privately run servers as well as officially run valve servers. all in all, i have very much enjoyed my time playing the game, and definitely got my moneys worth preordering it. as an added bonus, it features a very active community market, where you can sell and buy weapon skins and stickers. if you play your cards right, you can easily make back the money you spent on this game (especially if you buy it during a sale) in steam wallet funds.",590.4

(#n00bstatus) but i decided hey i wasted money on this game so im going to try it out. after i won my first competitive match i was amazed! not because i did well, but because ive never really played a game as a team with other people. im used to playing a lot of tdm on cod and that requires no skill and no communication to your fellow team mates. at first ill admit i was a bit timid to speak to everyone else but when i started to, they actually listened. so to those new pc players thinking about getting this game i would reccomend this hell, not just to them but to everyone else as well.",821.0

"i have many feeling for this game, i love it but yet hate it. i will start off with the hates, one of the main things about this game are the prices of in-game items. such as keys for example. i personally think that these keys are way too much. really? $2.50 a piece? that crazy, now the cases, those are different story. cases are pretty decently even with price wise. 10 cents to around 50 cents at the max. but keys, its like paying for a gallon of a gas a key. now for the good side of what i think of this game. i love this first person shooter/ competive/team work game. its action packed, gets your heart pumping, and is alot of fun. but one thing i do wish valve does in the future is that they decrease the price of their items. its insane, my rating: 9/10",1092.7
"cons - terrible community people complaing about weapons in game , if you use some weapons you will be cursed and called noob competitive bans - i got banned (30 minutes) because i kicked too many people (even if you didnt call the vote, only voted yes) even if you kick hackers, griefers or afkers several people play competitive and leave if they are losing games like 3 x 0 50% of the servers play only dust 2 people are very rude recoil is stupid and havent changed since cs 1.6 pros - weapon and boxes will drop and earn you steam wallet income trough market funny with friends",324.1

"cs:go is the latest game in the famous counter-strike series and contains a mix of many of the original features from counter-strike 1.6 as well as some features from counter-strike: source, all with newer graphics and a couple of new weapons, all balanced close to near perfection. one of the later patches also added collective skins for the weapons, which, while not too far from the system in team fortress 2, doesnt impact gameplay and is purely cosmetical. there has also been added an workshop for maps (so you can easily get custom maps) and skins (so you can submit your own). i can easily recommend this game and guarantee it will bring you many hours of good fun, provided you liked 1.6 or source.",492.1

"counter strike: global offensive, or cs:go, is a fast paced shooter. most guns do not have a zoom feature so it isnt like call of duty if that is what you are wondering. you have to have a base understading in order to get really good. now that doesnt mean the game is not fun. there are many game mods for all types of players. they range from rescue the hostage, to plant the bomb, to your basic team deathmatch. there is also a competitive playlist if you are into that hardcore stuff as well. most of the maps are really well made and dont get old, if you do happen to get old of the standard maps then just buy the $3 map pack, or make a friend that has it since you can just join his lobby and play with em, that gives you this cool badge. this is a great game if you want something you can jump in and have fun.",795.1

(apart from the trolls here and there, but hey this is the internet.) 80 hours + and rising (at the time of writing this.) i recommend this game with all of my arm strength, waving at you with a fist full of money and screaming shut the hell up and buy this game already. its got many 10/10s from me already. but in total.... 12/10 would buy again.",296.1

"i really enjoy cs go it is one of my favorite games i love unlike the xbox 360 version you can get cool weapon skins and diffrent kinds of knives you can open cases i really recommend this game to everybody",229.6
"alright, so here it is... counter-strike: a game where you shoot people. counter-strike condition zero: a game where you shoot people, but this time it has a single-player option. counter-strike source: a game where you shoot people, but with a slight graphical update and ragdoll physics. and counter-strike global offensive: a game where you shoot people, has a graphical update and ragdoll physics, and doesnt suck! 4 rootin tootin mclovins out of 5",6.1

"counter-strike: global offensive delivers something rarely seen in modern shooters. it brings us back to a time of simpler multiplayer action. in this war, you dont need to call in screaming jets, there are no pointless tchotchkes to unlock, and a stray bullet could mean plotting your revenge for minutes rather than seconds. modern shooters do their job well, but counter-strike is the series that helped build the scene. at 1o euros, global offensive is a great extension to that legacy.",119.8
"awesome game...if you want a classic shooter, counter strike is the right choice.",950.4
"good decent game, gameplay system and pretty much of the gameplay content is good but by good gameplay system means that this game lack of the freedom to control the settings, bots, weapons and such; which past counter-strike series once have. great graphics, lightning and environmenting which is visual pleasure that doesnt hurt your eyes like some of the other modern fps game.",113.9

"one of my all-time favorite games, and my favorite fps to date. very basic ideas, but the gameplay stays fun, even though there are only 5 gamemodes, its still one of my favorites. the weapon skins within the game also add to the overall enjoyment. these are used to trade and can earn you some extra steam wallet cash. overall, a very fun and somewhat competitive game that is great to play with friends. overall rating: 9.25/10",324.0
"i have played a lot of call of duty (until bops 2) and battlefield fps shooters, but this one takes the cake. with all of the issues with bf4 at launch, i wanted to try cs as ive heard a lot of positive buzz about it. wow...the map designs are great, no netcode or lag issues (that ive seen), people are helpful in the game (as a newb i need a lot of advice), and the graphics are really good. i would definitely recommend this game - especially when you can get it on sale. its a lot of fun and very challenging.",190.2

"good game. requires tactics and knowing the right time to do certain things. many things come into play like recoil or accuracy when moving. would reccomend it to anyone who wants to play a shooting game but a tad more slow-paced and more tactical. if you want just a quick game you can do a casual or deathmatch. the competitive scene for this game is great and really expresses the tactics and teamwork of this game. without that your just a bunch of idiots with guns! 10/10",392.9

"if you plan on playing cs:go, i would wait for it to go on sale solely because the game is almost always on sale for 75% off, but is still worth the full original price. if youre a source player expecting source 2.0 dont buy into it, its similar in ways but it is also its own game in way more. the game physics are different, quick scoping is different, you can jump scout. yes. you can jump straight standing still and shoot accurate with the scout. i bought the game for the comp play because scrims are a dying breed in source. its aggravating when you get an absolute garbage teamate that just trolls your game, but its a video game and thats expected. run-on sentence over. overall, great game.",606.1

"counter strike global offensive (csgo) is a game about a battle between two sides; terrorists who must plant the bomb on one of the two bombs sites located on the map and counter-terrorists who must stop them from doing so. on the surface the premiss of the game is quite simple but in reality this is far from the case. csgo is a scoial commentary about the negative effects of capatilism in our society. this is demonstrated by the name of the two teams themselves. the terrorists are labeled as such because they fight against capatilism, in reality these so called terrorists could be freedom fighters trying to defend their country. also the terrorists arsenal of weapons all cost less then the counter-terrorists while preforming at a higher standard (m4 vs ak). this shows that capatilism has traded the well being of their consumers for the sake of just making more money. im not even going to trend on the subject of weapon skins introduced to the game after its release which just work to further prove my point.",50.7
"wow...this game is very repetitive! i havent put alot of hours into it but from those hours that ive been playing, this game is very hard. its not a bad game at all. its just the people that play it. theres some people withover 1000hrs on it and then theres me. only a few hours into the game. back to my point, this game is good but its just very fast-paced and sometimes.... unrealistic. you will get mad alot in this game. i repeat, you will get mad in this game.... alot!! overall, this game is great! you just have to know what youre doing. id give it a 10/10 but with all the rage that has happened, id give it an 8.5/10",251.7

"counter-strike. the game that lives up to its name. so simple, yet so much fun. it could be considered the game that began competitive first-person shooters... or at least to my knowledge, it is. and compared to the other counter-strike games, i gotta say... cs:go was okay. graphics are nice, old-school maps, and the new item drop system is a nice addition. but, now, the only reason i play it is because im playing it with a friend, or i just want a drop that i could sell, no matter how pathetic it would be, or i just wanna waste time. you would find it awesome at first. but, at some point, it didnt give me something cs 1.6 gave me, and still gives today - thrill. i wont say its bad. but, then again, your moneys probably well-spent on this game on sale... or well-spent on something else.",210.3
