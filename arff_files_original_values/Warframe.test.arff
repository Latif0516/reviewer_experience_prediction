"friendly and fun f2p (p2w) game. p.d. its funnier with dualshock 4",3.4
"ninjas in space. that is basically the premise of this game. it also involves a lot of grinding and such but is completely free to play and you can get everything (less a few cosmetic items) by simply playing...which is pretty cool imo. also ninjas. inspace.",385.6
"awesome game. i definitely recommend downloading it.",453.9
"best war game i have ever played! - blaze from mccreatorco",290.2
"i have spent so much time in this game, it is so much fun and really feels rewarding.",752.8
"my gameplay time speaks for itself. only downside is that to progress at a reasonable rate buying in game currency is necessary, other than that an awesome game.",1305.7
"warframe, i played since beta, took a break as my pc at the time couldnt handle it... played it with my father... made things glitch (silly small ones that made us laugh our pants off.) what happens when you mix futuristic action combat ninja pirate merc shananagians?... well warframe... this does get repetitive but with all the systems and content out there you can go far. almost anything you can buy you get playing the game for free.. honestly paying a bit to get a setup you like can save you time. vs mode isnt really there yet from the last time i played it. i do recommend playing this game if you like choping up your enemies into small pieces.",470.6
"what its cool about it, that its free and well graphices and fun game play",561.8
"this game is awesome! it puts you right in the action with and epic third person shooter experience with a wide range of abilities along with a simple but good story. 9.99/10",51.3
"one of the best free games ever..good controlling...good feelings",4.2

"this game has changed a-lot (for the better) from when i last played it. it is now in my top 5 favorite games, instead of my top 5 worst games. 12/10 dolphins.",50.7
"i would recommend this game if you want to spend hours upon end trying to get past the endless amount of glitches and exploits this game has to offer. i have been playing this game for about a year now, on and off, and glitches are fixed and return on countless occassions. the game itself is good, but there are times where you will spend an hour farming and get some really good stuff, then find you cant complete the mission and get that stuff due to a glitch where a door wont open, or a boss has fallen out of the map and become invincible etc.",582.0
"very promising game, very satisfying, space missions i always wanted to play, very good game",7.1

"ratting: 8/10 graphix: good gameplay: awesome story: good multiplayer: good customization: amazing this game is really fun and its worth giving a try.this is my favorite free to play game so far. i recommend this game to people who like [3rd person] games.",134.1
"warframe is a sci-fi ninja action game. it gives you the thrill of a assassins creed and futuristic starwars skill game. in my opinion it is awesome. there are added features of character customisation and special abilities that you can use to over power you oponent. it also has an exiting speed up multiplayer feature where you and some friends can complete levels together.",10.3
"this game is alright but the cost of  is extremely ing gay",23.6
"warframe is the absolute best video game i have ever played! i advise everyone in the world to play warframe!",130.8
"genius......a combination of the things i love ninjas and guns.............i later found myself scratching my neck wondering the next time i could play updated: i cant go a day without playing this game and im starting to think i have a serious problem lbvs",311.6
"my game launcher would not download the newest update.",1.5
"such a simple game yet so fun to play over and over. i find myself always coming back to warframe when all other games fail me, even if its for an event or for a new weapon. the game dose get repetitive in a sence but their always updating so it practicly never gets old or boring. player design 9.8/10 frost prime need more gold. level design 8.7/10 randomly generated levels of said types. ordis annoying the  outtah you when trying to be afk at liset, 2/10 seriously his jokes suck.",843.7
"a free to play game, with ninja like beings whom utilize almost telekinetic abilities? definitely a yes. this game is beautiful, and so fun to play.",3.7
"love this game. so many options! male and female warframes, weapons, accessories, and companions, and so much more. i love how you can customize just about everything color-wise, if you can buy the color pallettes. my only hang up is that platinum (the currency you can pay actual cash for.) is pretty expensive. but you can wait and see if you get a discount on it in your daily bonus, or you can trade prime parts for it, so it isnt too big a deal, just takes longer that way. its pretty amazing to play with other people and friends as well, jokes galore and you can mess with your friends. theres also some funny glitches that happen... like falling out of the map, getting stuck in walls and things and so on. the glitches dont happen often though and it only happens usually when the player is doing something they probably shouldnt do... like run at a wall full speed or jump up the elevator shaft while its moving and go through the ceiling. good game. 10/10",245.5
"a very good game, with excellent co-op and gameplay, though it feels a bit copy/paste, grindish, and has plenty of pay to get stuff elements, i still find this game to be enjoyable.",1185.5
"good game. looks great for a free to play, and is very addictive. its worth getting.",72.1
"warframe provides an easy to learn, third person shooter with some minor roleplaying abilities. the game excels at providing quick missions to pass the time, or longer missions with a squad to level and grab new gear. the game centers around tenno, an elite group of warriors. these warriors are masters with several types of weapons, such as assault rifles, shotguns, lasers, or poison blob launchers. however, it can also be effectively played with the melee weapons in the game; they range from large axes and hammers, to dual wielded daggers and specialty items. overall, the game is quite an enjoyable experience. the main drawback is the time it takes to build items. a new warframe, which is similar to classes in other games, will generally take ~3.5 days to build, unless platinum is spent on it (the purchaseable in-game currency). with patience, and plenty of weapons, there are many bad guys to exterminate while waiting.",337.8
"i was skeptical about playing ths game at first seeing as i dont normally get in to the whole mmo/ pay to play scene. but this game is awesome. i now have almost 8hrs logged into this game and only been playing since yesterday. even though yu hav to pay real money for the most important in-game currency, you still earn credits that can be spent towards upgrading your character when it comes to there power, health and shields. i also really enjoy fusing and uprgrading the mods in this game which are ued toward you characters abilities. overall this game is def worth it! try it out especially if you like ninja or just fast paced 3rd person shooters.",22.4
"awesome game if you have the patience/money to craft all the stuff you want (and theres a lot of those).",158.8
"though it has its bugs and glitches, this game is incredible. ive always liked ninja-introduced games, and this is one has proved its self to me. pros 1. kurbows: these mutant dog-like creatures may attack you when untamed but when you destroy a kurbow nest to get an egg (i dont know the logic in that.) you have a chance of getting your own companion. though i like primes as well. 2. good surplus weapon arsenal: some games dont have many weapons for you to choose from, but warframe does indeed. going from a sword and shield to a nice shotgun, warframe keeps providing weapons for even the stealthiest of volts. 3. plenty of warframes to buy and choose from: most games say: once you choose this character you will stay as that one forever. well, some of them do. though it cost lots of platinum to buy them, its worth it for me to test out the others. cons 1. constant control glitching: i found this to be a real nips twister. on an obstacle course i was half-way there when i needed to wallrun and wallclimb at once. i cant tell you how many time ive dealt with the controls bugging out on me. 2. platinum. all the damn time.: youd basically need platinum for most of the stuff you buy. you wouldve thought theyd cut you some slack and make that low priced too since its hard to earn platinum other than the common way, buying it. im not being greedy, i just think you should be able to buy more things with credits. overall, the game is good, but some major patches are needed.",96.5
"i have nothing bad say on this game very good gameplay,grafic is the most beatiful in f2p game i have ever seen if you play single then you will quickly start boring",53.9
"buy this ftp game you ing loser you have no excuse",160.4
"one of the only games that i can name that makes grinding fun and interesting. for the first week we were so addicted my friend actually flipped his internal sleep schedule by playing through the entire night too many times. hes in warframe rehab now. still worth it.",230.1
"a game that gets fun once you put in the time sync. this game works around taking time to craft items and getting drops from enemies to craft those items. the game can start out slow for some but i enjoyed it the whole way and once you get to the lategame segments of you maxing out your weapons to the fullest and having your favorite warframe equipped is well worth the time sync and is worth money to put into if you like the game enough.",404.3
"the free to play portion is an absolute bore and a chore. tad repetative all around though.",10.1
"if this was a moba but with only the melee damn son but its still good and fun with friends (wich i dont have :| )",3.2
"awesome game and is very fun you have to download it its very addicting.",19.6
"warframe is a parkour/ ninja type game (hence the ninjas play free) where you play as a race called the tenno. tennos are equiped with special suits called warframes that allow players to use powers to help conquere the battlefield. enough with the intro stuff. warframe is a great game in my opinion. although it may be a slight buggy at times... basically its an awesome game with a space ninja twist. all in all, play it. all i gotta say. :d (though it took me alot of sentences to say it)",1214.2
"i like this game the only downside i see is that you can get blur when shiftting screens.",11.9
"easy to find games. its a pretty fun tps co-op game. and its free, and not that large in size. graphics are great. tons and tons of different levels. leveling system also in the game as well as plenty of equipment. i dont know how easy it is to obtain the equipment yet, i assume not too easy. but i havent heard anything about this game being p2w. im having fun with it so far though.",1.8
"its like destiny if it were good. the game is extremely diverse and has so much to offer. get this game if you enjoy a game that you will never be done with because they are always adding new things.",66.4
"i have only played this game for about a week but i keep commign back, it can get a bit repetative but rng what do you expect still cant wait to try out everything so far its great ! love it sept for the ocasional fal;ong through the floor when you have no revives y^y no loot for jew haha",97.3
"friend speaks highly of it so giving it a try. looks really cool so far tho, im excited",1.0
"the best third-person game played, but somtimes it becomes boring (because of farming resources). every big update returns player back to game. its just beta. ninjas play free.",945.2
"my experience this far: start cool prologue grind grind grind new weapon wait 24 hours grind grind grind new frame wait 72 hours grind grind grind and repeat. 10/10 would grind again",65.5
"this game is like a rain drop from heaven! #bestgameever!!!",399.0
"cant say i hate it. fun game overall, usual online players, but its another one of those to unlock all this game has to offer, spend cash or do  on our facebook and website page! and i am getting really tired of those games. still, its free and worth playing if you have friends or the feeling of addventure.",5.1
"space robot ninjas fighting dirty racist illuminati trade federation mercenaries clones with zombies using swords and guns and bows and stuff. highly recommended",1254.6
"very cooperating game and players really do help each others.",722.1
"you ninja things and sometimes win sometimes lose but you lose less when you win and get better and less scrubby, and crafting takes a long  time unless you pay monnies you rich person what do you think because you have money youre better than other space zombie ninjas? jerk. this has been a professional review by me. final review score; 9/10 i guess this game is okay.",811.6
"fun game with big updates, lots of different weapons with some different functions, interesting play style, lots of thing to modify, time consuming, relys mostly on internet and some of it on friends to help you out, managed to solo quite a bit, pets , appearance, helpful... ness etc. basicly its pretty good",673.4
"i have played this game since day one of open beta. the only issue is that it can be boring if you dont like the system it has for leveling your gear. i highly recomend it for anyone who enjoys a fast paced action game, just give it a shot!",1.5
"immersive and constantly developing game. experiencing this may make you remember mass effect at its full glory with some little but really fun and additions. in this game everyone will find something they thrive for, want to be an aegis of your team that breaks through waves of enemies? go for it! want to be a sneaky trickster or a lighting? that is also available to you. through my more than year long experience in this game i found myself never tired of this game as there is always something more to explore.",1114.1
"who doesnt want to be a space ninja with magic powers?!",171.2
"its a good game and very fun to pplay. love the slidey slidey thing. it does however get repetetive after a while.",14.6
"this is a must play game; its super fun and action packed!",623.4
"takes some investment to get into it, but when you do; the ride never ends. great game.",1160.1
"the developer of this game, put so much effort into making this game and though its free! i recommend this game to all of the halo fans out there though its not like halo but of course look alike, play alike and good alike, this game involves futuristic sci fi and third person shooting assault, a very good game indeed it is",18.2
"great game, constantly updated with new content. gives increasing difficulty to keep it from getting boring. but loses its playablity over time as most o the things in the game are repeated.",188.3
"its fun. there have been a few changes that im not fond of, but adapt and overcome, and its really really really fun with a group of friends.",620.7
"so, this game is nice. good graphics, good gameplay, decent balancing(?) i personally would recommend it to anyone who has extra time. this game requires you to replay or farm levels for certain resources. for instance, at some point, your weapons are too old to use them against newer, stronger enemies, so you set out to craft new ones. however, the amount of time, and work you must put into getting weapons that will carry you farther into the game is overwhelming. not only weapons, but warframes also require too much to craft. tkes me a day to get materials, or more, and 3 days to craft the actual warframe. now, you may choose to use stock weapons bought with credits, the games main currency, but the game insists you either buy platinum to get new weapons and warframes and whatnot, or craft them yourself, which takes a bit of time to do. though, judging from the majority of people on steam, i doubt time will be a problem. so, go ahead and play this game, if you want. its free anyway, what is there to lose?",60.5
"if you want to grind  this piece of  is the  for you. casual jufrows not intended.",485.4
"awsome game but sometimes allot of bugs on the game... but still its space ninjas for crying out loud :d",175.3
"warbros #1 now and forever. coding can be a bit sleek at times and its behind a whole kind thingy grindwall. its not pay2win, its pay2notgrind4fiveyears",538.7
"rage simulator 2015 10/10 would slash aleins again",3.8
"best game i ever played. have 650 hours of gameplay and im love it",1070.6
"this game is amazing with friends. if you are thinking of playing this game do it with friends. its great! even when i get bored i still end up playing this game again....and again :d",47.9
"this game is what its worth. and guess what? its free. 10/10 would buy free games with ugly-ninjas again.",49.2
"its like l4d but ninjas. it relates to a lot of good games like mass effect and gears of war. just a good tps!",2.7
"the game is fun to play, i can enjoy it and do something, but since update 16 there has been some bugs, e.g matchamking is down, you cant play with anybody becuase the chat is stuck on loading, but other then that i love it <3",330.3
"mass effect gameplay with more creation and less plot based aspects",305.4
"it is a pretty awesome game. must say, it blew my mind. but the only bad part is that you need a very smooth computer to play it. lag is dangerous for a game like that.",10.1
"this is a fun game that you can play with your friends. i havent seen a game in a while like this. its so addictive and fun.",135.9
"soooo boring, even with friends. its all a looong grind, each mission being the same as the previous.",5.2
"if your thinking of wasting some time in your life, but then want the game to be a normal part of your life? this is the game",52.0
"the game didnt work at all! it just keep saying login error check youre info i decided to delete the game because its usless now and i dont need it when u fix that problem i might think of redownloading the game again",0.9
"it is an amazing game fairly unique in its genre and free to play to boot almost everything that is available in the cash-shop is attainable through playing the game itself as well",127.1
"i enjoy the game in an overall sense, but i think it would be better as an fps instead.",2.5
"its a great game that has fun, fast paced shotter action. the missions are fun ( although not diverce) and the weapon and charextor levelinbg is relatively ok. the big fall offs from this game for me is the lack of a real story and the lack of super late game content. overall an amazing game that is free to play and well worth picking up. 8.5/10",712.8
"you are a cybernetic ninja fighting against an empire with a lust for war; a high-tech race of advanced cyborgs, robots, and powerful corporate conglomerates; and a scourge that threatens to wipe out and corrupt all life. also, you are an alien. those warmongers i mentioned? those guys are from earth. those robot dudes? experts at technological warfare and cybernetic manipulation. the scourge? its a  zerg infestation (fyi its actually called the infestation) the best part is that your ninja isnt so crass as to be just a cybernetic alien ninja, you can have a psychic cybernetic alien ninja, a cybernetic alien ninja pyromancer, you can have a complete-screwball-who-murderapes-everything-in-his-path cybernetic alien ninja, i think you get the point. if you enjoy free running, combined with well-designed maps and environments, combined with awesome enemies and bosses, combined with powerful and badass guns, combined with uberbadass melee weapons, combined with super cybernetic alien ninja powers, then this game is for you and anyone who enjoys good games.",393.0
"wow, amazing gameplay! great to pass by hours of boredom! :)",28.7
"absolute gameplay, great graphic, and its free to play!",1300.8
"8/8 the grind is real. i have ~500 hours in-game and as of me writing this i am mastery rank 14, going on 15. this game is awesome, but de tends to make a lot of fixes and patches for stuff which affect everyone, when aimed at a specific group. the recent afk rules are a good example of this. after 2 minutes of standing still(moving mouse and moving a short count as staying still), you wont be able to pick up items, get energy or affinity. this was because of the egate-gate and draco afkers. i recommend this game, 7.5/10.",489.1
"space robot ninjas fighting dirty racist illuminati trade federation mercenaries clones with zombies using swords and guns and bows and stuff. highly recommended",1254.6
"awesome game! thumbs up. store items do cost a little too much for me, but if you play well you can become very good without buying stuff from store.",552.2
"its a free fully customizable third person shooter, although there are microtransactions its still optional. the game keeps regularly updating and its still officially a beta. i also like the lore, they even have a optional lore hunting game if you are interested.",179.7
"grind + reskins + microtransactions + overbearing devs and pr = this game",204.0
"its really good, so many things to unlock and alot of updates too.",109.2
"this game is fantastic! it has some of the most incredible gameplay from a free-to-play game ive ever seen! i would highly recommend it to anyone and everyone!",71.5
"this game is wonderful in the sense you can commit hilariously epic carnage on the enemy types in warframe. this game is also wonderfully frustrating because of the multiple layers of rng (randomly generated rewards basically) and it is a very long grind to get to the highest rank if that is your goal. i would have to recommend this game to people who like dark sector and its pretty bad ai where enemies are moving to cover and stand in front of it before starting to shoot at you.",672.8
"this is my first video game ever played and its the game i play the most on my free time. i absolutely love this game! its my favourite! i would highly recommend it!",477.8
"this game is a good 3rd person shooter. it has good graphics and it has good game mechanics. warframe is fun to play with friends . in warframe you get to become part of this clan of space ninjas and you get to pick wich ninja you wanna be. in my opinion ill give it an 80/100 .",2.1
"its a very nice futuristic game. the appearance of the warframes looks cool. the mod system is very awesome and there are so many weapons to choose from. :dd",84.9
"really fun game its a bit boring at the start but it gets better really recommend it 9/10 sad about the 60fps frame cap also amazing graphics",164.1
"outstanding game. this game is just so open it allows so many ways to play the game. not the mention the modding system and the variety of warframes you can play as. these developers (digital extremes) deserve a thumbs up and some support because the more u help them the more u get content!",459.4

"takes a long time and can sometimes seem repetitive, but the challenges it presents will keep you coming back. if you end up getting this game or already have it and are not in a clan. let me know. i will invite you to join mine and give you some gear.",65.6
"warframe is very good game.you can shooting or use your melee attack in this game. 8 out of 10 for this game",324.5
"dont play this game cause you will have to not play it for a week to get a discount and that is so annoying so you will have to unistall the game 0/10",198.0
"do not buy this game its a great concept with good game mechanics but it is completely ruined by pay to play and more or less all of the interesting items you will never get because the grinding is stupidly tedious, also you have this 4 revive a day system so you cannot even grind for long periods of time. this game is great but yet another game ruined by micro transactions",112.6
"a great co-op game and a great looking one at that, while the game is very buggy its still worth the purches and its free.",14.1
"this game is the best thirdperson shooter i watched my friend play it",18.3
"sooooooooooooooooo much free fun and killing!!!! youre a freakin m.f.ing space ninja. whats not to freaking like.",740.7
"the absolute proof that co-op can be pay to win. with good graphics, repetitive gameplay and forgettable maps, you will find yourself doing the same brainless thing over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over again just to get that one thing you need to craft something, then start all over again. all this is pointlles and i do not understand why this game even exist.",10.4
"i wasnt impressed with the trailers., but its free to play, so i figured why not give it a shot. i have to say warframe is fast becoming one of my favorite games now. it is probably going to become my new main game. thats saying something. give it a try! character leveling, skill and weapon mods, crafting - if these are game features that appeal to you then you owe it to yourself...",1277.1
"very well designed game. definatly does not feel like a free to play game because of how good it is. this was the first game ive ever spent money on even though its free, and thats saying a lot. its free just download it!",198.5

"too much updates. but it is still an ok-ish game 5/10",1.0
"now this game for free is totaly awesome! not sure id spend the hudreds that you could to be invinceable, but, you can progress and rank up with a litttle help from other warframes, the maps and missions are endless! you could probly spend an unimaginable amount of hours on this game alone, i recomend it to anyone who loves the fast pace, shoot em up, coop and deathmatch type of alien crazy i mean forever mods weapons, and customizability type of game, how it got a 68 is beyond me! free is 50 and a game that works good is atleast another 25 in my book, with the anount of updates, i mean like everyday, these dudes got there #$%^& together, i love it for a free game.",35.9
"incoming security force detected - its the grineer.",616.5
"fun co-op mp game. movement is really solid, gunplay is good and its pretty entertaining. game is free to play, so im not going too judge it to harshely. only negative ive encountered are some glitches where my character will get stuck, and some lag. wish there was server browser as well.",35.8

"amazing graphics best shooter?action i have played in a long time!",9.2
"good if you want to waste some time, but a warning : it really depends on its premium currency.",261.6
"lots of fun. its sorta like diablo as a third-person shooter with wallrunning and no garbage loot. and you can do everything for free; paying money just means you dont need to play as much to get what you want. i highly recommend it.",528.6
"i loved it... i have to say this is one of the best free games on steam to date... its graphics are amazing, gameplay is fun, customization and upgrades are hard to achieve, but thats what makes the game a whole lot more fun!",517.5
"warframe is a fast paced third person game set in our solar system in what seems to be the distant future. you play as a tenno, from what i can see are a group of highly advanced space ninjas, set to eliminate hostile species in the solar system. while its a fun game, the levels just keep repeating, like angry birds go. the levels are just :destroy the core! or find the hostage! or take out that guy! each gamemode has a different map but that map keeps repeating. each planet has a different mas though. now the maps repeat over and over again but this game just keeps getting so addicting! with a wide variety of weapons which of course, youll need to pay for them, make this game like tf2 with the weapon system except you dont really get weapons randomly like tf2. warframe is a f2p that is only available on pc, but now there is a version the the ps4 which isnt a f2p and i believe costs 60 bucks. id say just buy the game, but youll also need to create an account. be wise when choosing your tenno as each one is different. for new people, i suggest getting the balaned excalibur class. every class has a melee weapon, which you can buy different melee weapons. you start off with a sick katana which you can slice enemies with, or if you wanna go complete mafia mode you can get the electric knuckles! if you want my rating i rate this 7/10! install this!",8.3
"worst visual experience ever. mouse lags so bad. motion blur makes me think im actually blind. the first half an hour i didnt know how to play and i was looking at planets because the menus didnt appear until i reset my game. really micro-transaction based. cannot upgrade anything even buy putting in the hours into the game. if the currency for the game was cheaper id think about buying some points, but its not worth it because everything that requires it is also overpriced",2.8
"you can call me tennou ... cause i spend ten ours of my day on this 10/10",374.0

"this game is by far the most detailed free game to play. truly remarkable graphics and with each update, it only gets. better. but there two aspects i would like to bring to the players who would like to play warframe: 1. the game severly punishes you if you truly wish to enjoy the game, as it will force you to play for many many hours to get new warframe and weapons. 2. although a game that does force you to play a long time, i must say the player community is the most helpful and fun than that i have experienced in any game yet. so making friends to help you gather the stronger weapons can be much more fun, eventually ending up with something more valuable than those top tier weapons. a friend x3 anyway, i hope you enjoy the game. the game of warframe.",23.9

"so now that i know a bit more, ill go more in-depth. gameplay is varied enough, with abilities, melee, and stealth if you can keep your party in control. grind appears very short compared to other games i have played. while crafting does have those stupid wait timers, it is compensated by the few materials needed to craft items. i havent yet delved into the part of the game which relies on random drops from mission rewards, though. there are many weapons, most of which are pretty unique and interesting. augmenting weapons with mods is not tedious. movement system is okay. you can navigate very well in theory, but a bad connection will make it clunky. enemies within the same faction are somewhat bland, but across factions there is enough variety. tons of customization; almost every color of every piece of equipment you have can be changed, but you are limited to a very small palette of slightly bland colors unless you play $5 or wait for a free event-themed palette to come out. graphics are great but framerate is heavily influenced by your connection to the host. extreme amounts of mouse acceleration take a bit to get used to, but its not that bad after the first hour. overall a positive experience. i will be playing this for months to come.",825.8
"farm frost prime right before they remove it from the game, then sell it for 600 platinums. best f2p game ever 11/10. i only spend a few euros ~5. and those euros came from cs:go cases and skins. but yeah if you want to go deep into the game you may not have to spend real money to buy platinum, but you have to farm hard. yes very hard. and deeper you go, more deeper you will want to get. i started with 1 frame during the beta (excalibur) and when the beta was over ive just stoped playing this game. but a few months a friend of mine just say me hey, you wanna play some warframe with us. and here im with ~250hours(in steam) plus a 50 or more durring the beta. now im with 12,almost 13 frames(1 prime), dozen of guns and only spend ~5. game its not pay 2 win, but farm 2 win. if you are enough patience to spend a few hours a day you will progress fast. but as i said - deeper you go into the game, more deeper you will want to go. and yeah advice from me - if youre going to farm but have some platinum, spend it on slots, because more or less other stuff is kinda useless because you can farm it(and again if you are patience enough)",365.3

"now, lets talk a little bit about warframe.... first off, my opinions about this game are that it is completely worth the time spent, and possibly if you want to spend money on the game, it is well spent. i have put almost 1000 hours into this game, and i have full intent on putting another 1000 in. now, just a little thing, i have this problem where i cant connect to any multiplayer games, but it is being fixed. anyways, lets get to the pros and cons. pros: flashy graphics fluid movement and combat. free to play everything can be obtained without the use of microtransactions (besides cosmetics which have no use) large frequent updates extremely friendly and helpful community cons: if you dont have a lot of time on your hands, then you may have to consider microtransactions fairly beefy graphics card and decent amount of ram the grinding can be a wee bit repetitive, but there are microtransactions if you are impatient eats your social life (which i have none) i rate this game 10 false igns out of 10 false igns. (but seriously, get this game. now. what are you waiting for? get it already!)",994.7
"the first dx11, 64-bit game i found that runs at 60 fps without effort. smooth, beautiful, and fun gameplay at its roots. beware the grind. this is equivalent to an arcade game of olde with how much money youre liable to spend just to get that shiny new warframe. cant recommend this game with the new update. too disorienting and difficult to navigate. gameplay hasnt changed, in fact its improved, but the ui is where most of your time is spent and now its more or less miserable (nauseating sometimes too).",211.0

"this game is a very special game it is a game where you grind 60% of the time, if that turns you off this game is not for you, if youre still here then i would fully recommend this game it starts off on earth and moves out you are fighting against humans and robots with a boss at the end of each system, it doesnt shove microstransaction in your face and you can definitely get through without microtransactions. i love this game i hope you will to.",22.1
"its a really good game considering its free to play. i would definitly recommend it to people if they asked me, there is alot of action intense gameplay as you progress and lots of great characters to choose from. at first it seems a little slow and grindy but when you work hard for what your aiming for it really makes it seem worth while, where as some games just hand you the best stuff in a day. definitly a good time killer when you get bored, or you can always play it in between games.",231.5

(to counteract the first 2 cons, farm for most stuff.) choice of stealth or run & gun / sword. cons : pay 2 win, pay 4 everything. time locks - construction, assembling gear, ranking up (to unlock more stuff) all take real time hours (various). 4 knockouts daily, after 4 used instant fail mission (solo).",288.0

"very fun to play with friends. though, some maps look and have the same feel to them.",97.6
"its a really entertaining system where it really rewards those who dedicate some time to it. sure, grinding is a really fundamental part of the game but it really makes time pass really quickly if youre in a competent squad or clan. get the bow though, tons of fun to use. :od",51.4
"ninjas in space what can be better this is more fun than iv had in my whole life gaming new updates almost every month with new weapons warframes bosses and more dont miss out it is stupendious",160.4
"its a great game that has fun, fast paced shotter action. the missions are fun ( although not diverce) and the weapon and charextor levelinbg is relatively ok. the big fall offs from this game for me is the lack of a real story and the lack of super late game content. overall an amazing game that is free to play and well worth picking up. 8.5/10",712.8
"one of the best looking ftp games. also, almost anything in the game (except some cosmetics) can be earned for free, so its not pay to win in the least",128.5
"surprisingly good game with co-op. sort of like the mass effect 3 multiplayer, but good, and with free-running space ninjas. there is almost no pvp in this game, which is wonderful for all of us sick of wonderful pve games being ruined by devs focusing solely on pvp, but if youre too much of a  little gremlin to play cooperatively with other people youre not going to like it very much. as someone whos dumped a lot of time into this game already, i should point out two things going in: it takes about 10-20 hours before youll get the hang of all of the craziness (so read up on the wiki), and it *is* primarily designed to be a cooperative game (so find a group to play with, because itll go much faster and be more reliable than playing with players from matchmaking).",732.6

"amazing as it may sound, this game is better than many many other retail titles in so many many ways. graphics, mechanics, cool ninja moves, stealth action and high customization are just the tip of the iceberg, as the cooperative play is teh real blast you can get from warframe. playing coop will make your enemies tougher, and theyll use attacks that will require your companions to free or wake you up to not get owned. a simple and not too various (were still in the beta section though) ai director changes the structure of the levels every time you play them, taking away the predictability of enemy positions. same goes for loots and treasure chests. a real great game, for no price: its christmas early this year buddies, enjoy!",181.6
"my computer doesnt run this very well as its a huge game to even download alone, but i do play it on ps4 and i could recommend it to most patient players, however i could say its not for impatient people unless youre willing to blow through a bit of cash to get your head start a little quicker than others. cool game about a 7.5/10. (alot of glitches, then again its still beta).",0.4
"this game is fun when it comes to third person adventures. if you have a good pc that can run smooth graphics, this game is for you. the controls are not too hard to learn and the gameplay is very intriguing. being that it can also be played on a ps4, do yourself a favor and try out both the ps4 version and the pc version. i have played both and i enjoyed the pc version more because the control scheme is better outfitted for this game. if you have a powerful enough pc, this game is glorious. a great suggestion for the new generation gamers out there.",22.2
"this game is awesome. well thought out, and i love the parkour & badassness of the game. the only thing i dont like is that the mission layout is kinda annoying & confusing at first & maybe a bit more variety in character creation. overall, great game",8.3
"i feel like this falls under the category of overhyped; i got bored with the combat and mission grinding not even 4 hours into the game. i mean, dont get me wrong; the concept is great. i love the whole idea of this game. ive seen the classes in action and i love it all. but its once again, one of those games where you can just dump your money all over it and already have everything in the damn game. you get a small selection of classes at the start of your playthrough, and youll quickly want to try out the new classes. however, getting the materials necessary for getting another class in the game requires a massive amount of work and time; i had to buy a blueprint for a blueprint so i could make the blueprint just for another frickin class to play! then getting the right material to make this one blueprint required fighting a boss that spawned on one world, and it had like a 3% chance of dropping. then crafting the actual crap together would literally take days in real time. whereas i couldve just dropped about a hundred bucks and already have that class and a load of weapons/items for it in no time at all! a shameless cash grab! i literally got into a game where two other players who already had everything rushed through a mission in less than two minutes and killed everything in the level with the  they just bought. really now? some open beta this game is. dont waste your time on this crap.",8.8

"i left the game nearly 2 years ago when the founders pack was being sold. came back at the end of december and to this very day i find myself playing this non-stop. part of me regrets not buying that founders pack because this game is pretty fun. it improvised a lot and it keeps getting better everyday.",878.6
"online co-op halo game with magic. fantastic game, well optimized, great graphics, and fluid gameplay aside from melee. my only gripe is there are a few warframes that shine above the rest, my nova can destroy the entire screen instantly on everything but the hardest content, while my nyx is much...much slower. my rhino can solo everything in the game by just surviving through it all, but my excalibur dies very easily and isnt even as powerful offense wise as my rhino. the game is not pay to win at all - you can make warframes by crafting them in 3 days, and weapons in 1 day. the materials are easy to get and its mostly just the time spent crafting that is the hassle. now - if you are going to play 100% free just know that you should stick to 1-3 warframes, because you wont have enough inventory space for any more - its still great fun though. i still fully recommend this game to anyone, as it will provide at the very least 100 hours of gameplay.",188.3
"beautiful game that should set itself as an example of whats to come into the future of first-person shooter mmorpgs, warframe blends superb graphics, great controls, a startling concept with an interesting backstory, and hella rad gameplay to provide a good time-sink and good game for all. try it, and you will not regret a single thing. also: did i mention its a free-to-play with minimal forcefulness in microtransactions?",23.5

"if you ever had played mass effect 3 co-op then youll never prefer this pile of garbage. the shooting is completely unsatisfying and the graphical design is horrible. the whole f2p aspect of the game makes you grind for weapons and characters and still, some of them (glaive) can only be bought for money. when in me3 co-op you can unlock everything easily and the gameplay is very satisfying (you can even create a character build that only uses powers and nothing else), here you stuck with the same items forever. or you can craft them but it literally take days even if you have grinded for resources needed. even this game being free doesnt justify all that - you better off buying heavily discounted origin key for me3 (all co-op dlc there are free) than wasting any money on this train wreck of a game.",390.3

"one of the best free to plays i think i have ever played including demos and mods. and to those who say its pay to win. dont listen to them they are just trolling the review its actually quite balanced. first 3 free classes are some of the most powerful ones. now if you want to spend $10 usd than go ahead get a new class. but all you are buying is a completly diffrent skill set. all classes have their own uniqe play style so do youre homework and look them up on the warframe website.",881.0

"dont get me wrong, i love this game. the only thing that bothers me is the fact that there are only few maps, the rest of the levels are the same map, with a different objective or a few different doors open. still, 11/10",97.2
"warfrmae is a game ive been following since alpha and like many other games i never loose intrest in playing it, yes this game isnt for those who just want it all now an not wait but i think that the grind and trial to obtain warframes without using real money makes the warframe that more rewardable, the game just amazes me every day, its one of the only games that actually feel like a living breathing world every weekend has a new global event where the developers have us go up against a grineer vs corpus rivalry or a sneaky corpus tradesmans escort. every warframe adds a new field to play with within the randomly generated levels and i love all the customization and loadouts that are avaliable you can play how you want to play; be a tanky rhino and destroy the fron lines or a nova who assists the whole team in a damage amplifier or be a sneaky assasin like loki or ash and stealth an entire mission. oh and dont get me started on u11, in the lastest update they have added more amazing rooms and decoration to the clan built dojos. alot of the content in warframe is not visble at first glance but if more people gave this game a chance i promise they would love it. plus its free!!

"it was a good game with cool concepts but all the micro-transactions it requires to get into the game is not worth the price",6.3
"best 3d coop shooter on steam to date. gameplay mechanics are smooth and graphics are gorgeous. team work is very important in this game so make sure you grab your friends and be part of the tenno badassery. it gets progressively harder and more rewarding as you keep going. it is definitely not your run of the mill generic shooter. and now with clan system (guilds), clan housing and dueling the social aspect of this game is much better as well. digital extremes is doing a really good job polishing and improving this game with each patch. the only downside of the game ive seen so far is that it needs a lot more pve content for those who already beat all the planets (which is plenty so far but not enough) and some more variety andmaybe open world maps (less corridors) would be a lot of fun too. still i highly recommend it.",478.4

"fun game and all but im not too keen on have to wait 24 hours to rank up my tenno once. plus making your character counts as part of the that time. everything else is fine. its like a 3rd person objective based moba. im only going to recommend the game because i hope they fix that issue about ranking up only once daily.",27.3

"the game allows for lots of custmizations and is very intuitive with motion, graphics, and combat. its a definite reccomendation from me.",177.2
"ive been a part of this game since the closed beta. ive seen a ton of changes and dont let steam fool you. ive logged in more than 400 hours on this baby right here. you play as a tenno. a master of the warframe armor. the universe is set years and years after dark sector (de confirmed that hayden tenno was indeed the o.g. tenno.) where the tenno are at war with 2 factions: the corpus and the grineer. both of which are at war with each other and the result is an imbalance in the system which the tenno are tasked with balancing. there is a fourth faction, the sentient infected. the technocyte ravaged beings twisted into monsters after years of dividing and acquiring biomass, they pose a threat to everyone in the universe. the game itself has quite a learning curve but the community makes it so easy to learn. there are a ton of events and rare items as well as alert missions that allow you to take certain rare items or platinum items that you could buy in-game with microtransactions but the game allows you to get them for free. you dont need to spend unless you want to. prime frames are the same. (you grind for them to get em for free) i personally spent money into this game and am a founder and have not regretted spending money on this game. it has given me so much fun and joy and i just love being a space ninja. 10/10 easily one of the best games i have ever played.",818.1

"warframe is a refreshing take on the squad based 3rd person shooter, in its over all game play and especially its art design. while not every gamers taste, i find warframe to be a refreshing take on design. the characters and aliens are unique, very inspired and striking. my compliments to the art direction and the whole team. the gameplay is tight, responsive and franciticly exciting giving the player the experience of feeling like theyre a true space ninja. youll be parkouring over obstacles, climbing on walls, hacking apart enemies and sliding across floors while going all john woo on anyone that stands between your teams and your objective, ninja. ive found myself coming back to this game over and over again ever since a friend got me into it way back in june 13. as of today, ive already spend hundreds of hours in warframes. game sessions can be as pick up and play as a half hour or turn into longer survival and raids. its one of the most open to all ftps out there. paying players dont overwhelm the f2p players in the gameplay department. they just dont have to spend the time gathering and crafting those items. all of which can be easily found in the game and created with miniumal grind time compared to how many other f2ps work. digital extremes really did this game right, give it a try and you wont be disappointed.",1057.9

"pretty interesting premise, mixing the matrix with borderlands and gears of war, very complex customisation, very fun gameplay, buggy as all hell, game crashes sometimes which sucks, but oh well. give it a try you wont be dissapointed, partying up is alot more fun than solo, find a good clan! edit: the biggest case of failed potential ive ever seen, the devs made a great, but extremely buggy, base game, but all proceeding updates are either cash grab store weapons, bugged out community events, and new features nobody likes. play until you get a nice set of endgame weapons, frames and mods, and never log in again, because theres nothing fun worth doing.",391.0
"honestly, this is one of the best video games i have ever played. if you are a fan of mass effect than you will have a great time with this game. everything from the graphics to the market, to the battle mechanics of the game, are all well developed. at first glance, i saw that they provided a tutorial for this game which blew my mind away, usually i have to figure out controls on my own with games, but this game ensured that everyone will know the basic mechanics of the game and how to keep up with the players online.",115.8
"one of the the best f2p games and my favourite so far",311.8
"this game is pretty fun, but their switching you from the easily killed grineer to the not-affected-by-punture-damage-deal-with-it corpus crewmen can be a shock for new players. there are a couple more problems i have with the game, such as the flawed stealth system. enemies are comically dumb, but they more than make up for it with their apparently psychic abilities. as soon as you fail to kill one enemy with a shot from the paris, they all know your exaclt location, and know where you are everywhere and at any time until you kill all of them.",28.8
"awesome, free, and fun. using super-alien-jedi-space-ninja-soldiers to shoot, slash, and blow up enemies, really if you arent sure, at least try it, cuz its free. progressing is a bit slow without platinum (premium currency), but youll get it.",88.8

"i play this on the ps4 and just wanted to leave a review on here. in short, yes it is a grind if you want to keep playing for free and still get good items, but it is highly addictive. where destiny was limited, short, sometimes too difficult and not that much fun for me, warframe makes up for it. warframe is basically a more feature rich version of destiny. however be warned, if you dont want to play for free, it is very expensive. some of the packages cost double that of a normal game, and buying in game credits is obscene. but, that hasnt mattered for me. ive won enough items and levels through grinding on free play to keep me interested. highly recommend.",0.1

"i started playing this game long before it made its way onto steam. it was great fun for a while, especially in co-op with a friend or three. but i stopped playing. however, as of now (update 14.8) ive revisited the game and played for about a month. and i love it! the game can get repetitive but its modding system (character progression and weapon progression) is great, there are lots of warframes (characters) to choose from with different abilities and roles. there are tanks, dps, supports, healers and more. though only three are available from the start you can get all warframes and all weapons in-game - without paying a single cent. even warframes that otherwise costs $50 you can get in-game by either trading or completing missions. the only thing that has to be paid for with real money are cosmetics, everything else is obtainable by playing the game.",40.9

"this game is an example of free to play done (mostly) right, which is very rare. you, a member of the tenno race, are equiped with suits known as warframes, each with unique stats and powers. it is your mission to aid in the war between the tenno, grineer, corpus, and infested. admitadly, the game plays like a standard third person shooter, where it really shines is all of the different weapons and mods just waiting to be discovered, like bows to assault rifles, health increases to abilities. its not without its problems, though. the game is littered with microtransactions, and while optional, grinding isnt fun unless you have friends. oh yeah, this game has a standard 4 player co-op system too, which it is usually designed around. overall, i would suggest getting this game with a very open mindset.",700.5

"great runngun, 3rd person ninja in space action game. like any mmo style game, it does get repetitive, but constant content updates and fixes make the game worth playing. ive clocked nearly 500 hours on this game since i started, and opened up my pocketbook for founders packages and other goodies--and it has all been worth it. nearly every item available for purchase with real money is also available for acquisition within the game itself, making it a truly rare mmo style game.",484.1
"an extremely addicting game to jump into at first. it makes you feel like a badass ninja who can jump around and well, be awesome. the thing i have against it is that it takes a long time to actually get decent weapons and swords to fight with. and at first you really feel jealous of how other people who have much more amazing stuff and who are more powerful are way better than you. its pretty much just grinding and showing off. theres a few glitches here and there but you must keep in mind that the game is in beta. it has great potential and at the moment is amazing. overall great game.",205.4
"this is one of the better hack and slash games that i have played. i definately like the storyline in it, although its too much action; i wish that the developers would make a more distinct storyline and have more cutscenes. im not asking them to change anything (thats rude.) im just saying what i see potential for in this game",21.5
"casual enough for a quick run whenever theres time but with unexpected depth in terms of customization and crafting. pugging with strangers is perfectly feasible (other than with, say, payday2 where i consider voice comms essential). its definitely not pay2win as you get most items with credits earned by playing the game. only certain weapons seem to be real-money exclusive. as are slots for additional warframes, but the initial 50 platinum will buy you 2 free slots already, for a total of 4 warframes. pretty good package, gorgeous graphics and level design and immense amounts of fun. 10/10",190.8

"whilst not incredibly impressive if taken at surface value, warframe has many, many hidden layers. the lore and backstory is hidden behind so much secrecy put out by the developers. however, if you play it for long enough, realise just enough, you will work it out eventually. with such a rich and still debated backstory, theres not much not to love. the gameplay is also smooth, but far from being its best feature; bugs and glitches do feature prominently in this game but do get fixed regularly. theres regular content updates and events to do, and the combat is reasonably smooth. not the best game ive ever played, but for free, its definitely worth it.",708.3

"great game, strongly recommended. graphics are impressive and fighitng is tons of fun. many types of missions, played in groups in up to 4, many types of weapons powers and their modification , so there is much room for creativity. game community is one of the best out there, as most players are really friendly and open to chat and collaborate. the only drawback is that the game has no end. you play the same missions over and over on various difficulties, so you can farm resourses over and over so you can craft new weapons and tools over and over so you can play higher level missions... over and over. and that takes much time, or money, if you wish to speed up the proccess. there are examples of players investing much money then just quit. still, it is worth playing, even if it is once in a while just for a thrill of a fight, killing or destroying endless waves of mobs.",222.1
"i shouldve reviewed this a long time ago but i forgot okay guys! anyway... addicting. very addicting. everything on the table. graphics are great, though style is a little dark/moody and might not be for everyone. gameplay. is. amazing. the mechanics work so well in sync to bring an enjoyable experience of kicken royally kicken  (until end game that is). youre a space ninja that can run on walls while pinning someone to a lamp post with space bow, or annihilating swarms of enemies with a grenade launcher while soaring through the air menacingly. the special ninja movement skills like wall running and sliding all trigger really smoothly (some more then others but whatevs :p), and the community is really great for a current f2p. the team stays really active within it, for instance prime time, their weekly thursday night live stream talking about current happenings. honestly i totally support the community. theres also a decent amount of gear customization with their modding system. oh also for an f2p its not even pay to win because all of the best gear isnt even available for the real money currency, platinum. however i will say sometimes it feels like theres a little too much farming. also ive spent too much money on this for a f2p title. just saying its fun and addictive. so go play it why are you still reading this rediculous review!",354.6

"- story - they were called tenno. warriors of blade and gun: masters of the warframe armor. those that survived the old war were left drifting among the ruins. now they are needed once more. the grineer, with their vast armies, are spreading throughout the solar system. a call echoes across the stars summoning the tenno to an ancient place. they summon you. allow the lotus to guide you. she has rescued you from your cryostasis chamber and given you a chance to survive. the grineer will find you; you must be prepared. the lotus will teach you the ways of the warframes and the secrets to unlocking their powers. come tenno, you must join the war. i think in my opinion is one of the best f2p games i ever played.it has: weapons, space ninjas, archwing, character costumization, santinels, your very own pet (called kubrow) and more. the best advice i can give you is: take your time and dont buy everything you see on market.almost everything you see there can be created/optained through hard wark and patience. i definitely recommend this game to anyone that is looking for this kind of games...thats it, now excusie me, i need to get back and save the humanity.",675.0

"absolutely fantastic game! everybody kept telling me to play it and i finally go around to it. i wish i had start playing earlier! it plays a lot like destiny, but im actually liking it a lot more than destiny. its free to play, and has options in game to pay for materials or frame/weapon slots. but its not play to win, which is what really matters! and you are able to trade the real world money to other players, so you can get everything in the game without paying a penny (with some rare exceptions). i recommend getting a bunch of friends to play this with you. its a lot better than trying to find pugs.",201.5
"you either really love it or really hate it, its kinda like marmalade, even though i dont love marmalade i do love this game, you really do need to put in alot of time into this game before it starts to get fun, but with friends, it really is a fun game 9.7/10",255.8

"this game in one word is addicting. very addicting. i started playing it and they i eventually found it hard to stop, in fact the only reason i took a break is because i was tired. this game is an mmorpg that you do not want to pass up. especially since it is free! in this game you can purchase things in game so that you have the tools you need to be the best tenno that you can be. the first couple missions warm you up and tap into that killer that lies dormant inside of you. you progress and as you progress you can purchase new things and become a better tenno. all in all i think this game is great and i have not even finished it yet. i liked this game and i think most people would too, so just give it a try and who knows maybe you will like it. i give it a big thumbs up and a huge five out of five stars.",17.3

"coop experience is great! without teamwork you are sure to loose. the random mission system is cool too knowing that you wont be playing the same objectives when you replay a mission. most of all i gotta say the optimizations in this game are amazing... my weak pc could run it at 30+ fps. i was astonished on how smoothly it ran. this is the game for you if you like coop and have a weak pc.

"i find this game creative by the way each map is created, and the animation they put on and within the characters. the most part i really right about warframe, is the abilities each class or different ninja is made. thats how i much i like warframe. most importantly i mostly find this game really eotically fun! and if you like my review a give a thumbs up and start playing warframe, for allt he ninjas out there! p.s:i advise to ahve a good pc while playing since this is 3d game",49.1

"after playing warframe for 1000 hours ill say it definetely was a blast and still is. it never ceases to fail me that it always made me and my friends feel like were badasses. one shotting things and wiping rooms in mere seconds made me feel like a god almost. when ever it came to the hard stuff it was a bunch a teamwork and skill to output such great results whether it be survival or defense missions. although this game is not perfect with its few glitches and grindfests (freaking rng >_<), i feel it has come along way and from its beta till now. this game is about the journey not the quest (sometimes :3).",1081.8

"rating: 8/10 overall a fun game, but for new players it can be difficult to get into. for the first couple hours of the game, you will be using the same boring weapons until you buy/craft a new weapon using blueprints. you can run on walls, fly kick, slide, and perform devastating melee combos. fun game to play coop with friends!",68.6

"sorry to the fans of this game but i dont like it. first of all its a gridfest which is one thing that they should change. the game is not exactly begginer friendly, confusing objectives, most people ignore the objective in a mission and run to the escaping point ruining and wasting your time. the game weapons are quite hard to use and is hard to hit anything. to me the story makes no sense what so ever. the campain map is not explained at all in the tutorials. blurr effects ruin your vision although the effect is good it ruins your sight of players an enemys while sprinting to cover.",2.0

"this game is pretty great. i enjoy the gameplay. it is a little difficult most of the time to solo missions although they start to get easier after progressing through some of the levels. i like the weapon/pet aspect. overall a very fun endless game. that is unless you spend a lot of money on platinum which then its probably pretty easy.",322.1
"the free version of destiny. still able to earn the game currency platinum and its tradeable. so, you can stay a true free to play player. the lore is something i dont normally get into with games, but its really interesting with this game. you can start up some really cool conversations with the community. if you are looking for a shooter game that you can enjoy, and not run out of things to do, and that has a good community bases, this is the game to try!",607.2

"mediocre. that is what this is. the games shooting is boring, but the swordplay is pretty cool. since this is only a campaign, i am sure it will get boring soon, but it is free, so who cares? maybe they will add something new since it is in beta. either way, we alredy know what the best f2p game is, and that is tf2. i will recommend it, but it honestly sint the best.",1.4

"just another pay-to-win wrapped in a pretty package. the main character(s)/playstyle is a complete ripoff of the ninja cyborg characters from the metal gear solid series. the missions are mind-bogglingly repetitive, resulting in a continuous grindfest. and ultimately (as expected with almost every f2p out there), if you want the best and coolest gear, you have to pay. but youll keep on grinding - no escape from that.",8.5

"this game is great in many ways. it has many guns, swords, warframes (a suit), and many more. but i must say this game to get a bit farmy so get ready but he has its ups and downs or give it a try you will love it.",202.4
"this is a really fun shooter. at the moment it is completely free, sure if you want some color customizations you need platinum (the cashable currencey) but that platinum can be farmed by selling mods or blueprints. anyway, the game is nice and well paced. the controls need a bit getting used to but otherwise its a borderlands-halo mashup with some extra mobility and less humor. the different warframes give you various playstyles. from tank to ninja everything is in there. if you like good shooters with lots of different weapons and mods and you dont mind serious grinding, then youll enjoy this. if youre not a big fan of grinding you probably wont like this game unless you want to invest real money, since your base weapons arent all that great, like in any game youve played you have to put some effort in it to get the good stuff. if you have to break it up into pros and cons it would probably look a bit like this; pros: - good shooter - large variety of modifications for warframe and weapon - multiple playstyles possible - free to play design well made - nice graphics cons: - controls need getting used to neutral - grind heavy - fast paced to sum it up short its pretty much space ninja grinding asap.",888.4

"this game is absolutely horrid when nobody wants to play with you.",160.6
"a cool game with good graphics and suprisingly low requirements. the missions quite repeats themselves, but fun nonetheless. however, it could have been a much better game if you could earn platinum without the use of real-world-currency (besides the trading system and the honor of the lotus login reward which are good too). but overall this is a very good free-to-play, probably the best on steam.",629.7
"to be honest warframe is a good game with potential but de are making too many mistakes. yea its a game where you can slice and guy then u burn him then u watch him fall to the ground but there is only so far that ccan get you. once you get into the game the game get repetitive. although i personally dont mind but at times farming items can get annoying. in conclusion this willl be a great game some day but for now it needs more input from the community.",537.3

"you know destiny? this is the game it wanted to be... warframe is a hack and slash shooter with free flowing movement and shooting with some annoying f2p tricks and moba tip bits. pros: the guns are various, good or bad - it depends on your mods and how you play the free flowing movement system is good and can slide in and hack people up 3 factions that offer good varation but the grinner are annoying with there armor the mods are a mixed bag as rng decides your loot some of the weapons and suits require you to be in a clan to get them it takes time to get good guns the suits or frames is good but be careful when you upgrade mods and there suit the crafting system is abit weird and has some pay to go tricks overall fun --- updates very often cons: dont finish the galaxy quickly, it gets boring the bosses are often gimmicky with weakspots the grinner can cause a bleeding proc that wrecks some frames and exposlives the infested arent scary but the elders can wreck you clans are needed for some of the cool guns the market often has cool guns that you either buy with real money or take a week to grind from them and build them most often the missions repeat. the ship and ui was better when it was menu based but that is me i recommend this game, it pretty and unique just remember it takes awhile to get used too.",350.2

"+not pay-to-win +every character and weapon can be earned without paying actual money +probably will end up buying some cosmetics with money anyway, just like lol or tf2 -i feel it requires joining an active clan or a group of friends to play with for the fun to keep going past end game",801.3

"warframe is a very good f2p tps and has a wonderful community of gamers that are easy to get a long with. the game play is smooth and nice graphics but the only problem is there are a lot of maps that seem like you have seen before, meaning it seems like there are maps that they used before but just put a few new things in it. also you can drop a lot of money in the game if you get into it because of different customization for warframs and sentinels. you can also buy weapons with your plat but for the player that just wants have a fun game with not droping a dime there is goos news for you. almost everything you see in the store you can build in game with no real money charges it just takes longer to obtain that item. so i give warframe 8.5/10 and recommend you give it a try!",7.3

"well let us start off by saying i am bad at writing reviews. as i was beggining to write this i tried to come up with some cons about warframe, but i could not do so. i gave it about thirty minutes and not even a hint of a con appeared in my mind. i would like to share my opinion on waframe before i list any pros. my opinion being that warframe is a truly amazing game. i did not think i would ever end up where i was in this game. at first i despised the idea of it, but i gave it a try. now everyday is a day of wanting to play warframe, playing warframe, and thinking about playing warframe tomorrow. people will always text me and ask me to hangout but i always say i am working or i am busy. however, i made new friends, perhaps even a family. it feels as if i have another life, a place to escape to. if that does not tell you that i love this game my current 851.3 hours will ( which will certainly be increasing ;d ). well since warframe is nothing but pros i will just settle by spitting out the larger, more positive attributes. some pros being: +great community +amazing graphics +phenomenal customization in both modding and physical appearances +certainly not a pay to win +perfect mechanics +always new stuff and fixes +joyful gameplay there is far too many pros to list, in my opinion. if you give it a real try you will probably become addicted. be ready to abandon your social life.

"not exactly a co-op game. game is typically played in teams: yes. but players all charge on ahead solo to try to grab kills. most of the game is spent chasing down other team members who kill so fast that theres nothing for you to do, or if you get ahead, you kill everything and everyone chases you....",1.9

"the life of a warframe player -gets game. -plays for 30 hours . -starts noticing the paywall. (dont you dare say there isnt. you need a catalyst/reactor to make your frame/ weapons do damage to anything over lvl 30. yes they drop in alerts but unless you want to wait a fortnight at a time at the chance of getting one you will end up putting money into it) -puts money into the game and it feels like a whole other game. -starts the farm for prime parts. -hits 600 hours and has all prime frames and weapons. -just sits there wondering why the  they just did all of that. ok for all of you saying there is no paywall they drop in alerts. you do realise they drop once a bloody fortnight. for a non casual player playing this that drop rate is too bloody small. you will gain more weapons in one week that you want to catalyst than the amount of catalysts drop in a whole damn year. next time read the damn review before you say they drop in alerts!",833.6

"the game is beautiful, im not one to like shooters like this, and i love it, cant have a day i dont play an hour or 2 if i can get away with more, but in a fairly big issue is the game needs a dedicated server, the shenanigans i have to do for multiplayer to work is very unpleasant some days it can take 4 hours for a scheduled meet to work out and others we give up and solo what we can. all in all this minus dwarfs more the pluses but regardless i am actively recommending my friends this game, though im not using the ingame recruitment option.",134.4

"this is a great very pretty looking co-op game. all i can say is sliding, flipping, wall running space ninjas for the win. the game can get a little repetative for right now with the grinding, but i beleive that more content and maps/missions will change this. over all the game is very well done and outstandingly free.",67.2
"i really enjoy the combat, everytime i play i learn something new or some new combo move. sure you can be the guy who sits in the back and shoots things, but you are missing a core part of the game and that involves being the matrix without bullettime. my only problem with the game is that it doesnt really explain how to play it; you just wake up, some creepy guy rubs your leg and then the game is just like now kill everyone and deflect this guys laser beams while defedning your ship and dozens of men with automatic weapons fire at you.",12.1

"as others put it so very well. ninjas...in space. this exciting fast paced shoot-em up run-and-gun styled, third person squad ( or solo and anywhere inbetween) parkcour simulator will leave you with your wrist stinging from playing several hours longer then you intended. and beileve me, if you get into this you will play it untill you drop. the hours ive spent in-game were well spent. doubley with friends. it can get grindy. espeically for good weapons and warframes ( new playable characters ) but the time spent normally passes quickly ( again with friends ) and the rewards are actually worth it. my reveiw is a doubled handed thumbs up. i found the game to be action packed and intense, albeit a tad glitchy at times. but thats where the funny, funked up magic happens ( fallout players will know what i mean ) but by far, the very best part of the game that i like, is the very thing the game advertises  ninjas play free. all weapons, warframes, mods, and as you play through a year customization options are all avalible for absolutly free. the option s there however to buy it, and get it without trying. but cmon now who has fun pushing the a button to win? so in conculsion. warframe is a ninja game. a free tp play. non-pay-to-win, ninjas flipping in space action packed splosion festivel anygamer can enjoy.",514.5

"ok, pros: fast paced shooting mechanics, decent sword mechanics. good mobility, customization not that good but workable. teamwork, can still play solo however. and a stealth and free-run mechanic. nvidia graphics and physics! cons: you will never get into pvp becuase of your inventory ### doesnt meet the requirements. unfair, if not almost cheating ai. cash store always dangled in front of your face. when the game adds a new playable warframe, it feels like you must pay. in order to play it. feels unrewarding. buggy beyond beleif, but thats because its an mmo. near impossible to join a guild/clan. notorius time waster. lotus voice. overall: i enjoyed this game for a few days, but between drm, lack of commmunication with other players, and cash store ads. i reached my pain; enjoyment thresh hold. it just seems like a time waster, and you never feel like you accomplish anything, unless you sink in $$$ of course. if you need to waste a few hours go ahead, but it just felt to as if there was no point to doing all of the same repeating missions over and over again. its up to you.",15.2
"i loved this game look at my f#king hours! but in all seriousness its pretty damn awesome excluding the slight repetitiveness but you can oversee that while youre hacking and slashing or if youre a normal person shooting is good too. not to mention the game is not a p2w you can get everything excluding cosmetic and slots but that shouldnt stop you go download this game right now.",743.6

(space potatoes, anyone?) you can sink some real world money into this game, but it is far from required in order to progress. there are server errors from time to time and occasional disconnection issues. coming form a game in open beta though, warframe does a great job of offering what could very well be a finished project. sensors show a security force coming your way. its the grineer...",644.1
"i only played this game for a little while, before this last patch, and the gameplay was fun. the only problem was that it was kind of odd and clunky to navigate around. this new patch fixed that and the ux and ui are brilliantly redone. it really doesnt feel like a free-to-play game now. the gameplay is still really fun, its running, gunning, and grinding. id recommend this game for anyone who likes a fun game that has a lot of gameplay, unlockables, and grinding (although that is optional, but not p2w).",93.7
"i love fast paced action games, but never liked shooters. im more comfortable with melee combat. but with this game its a mixture of both melee and guns. the combat is so smooth and fluid i actually liked pulling out my hand gun and shoot a few grineers while wall running, sliding across the floor past a horde, or in mid-air after a high leap. this is by far my most favorite action game that i can just hop into and go ninja... with a gun.",21.1
"for free this game is really good thats all im saying",3.6
"highly recommend it, definitely the best free to play game ive played so far. its hard to imagine them not charging people for this game. the co-op play is a bit lackluster compared to the single player experience though because the quality of gameplay depends on which user is hosting. so if the user has a very slow upload speed, you could be thrown out of the game or fail the mission because of that. game levels go by very quickly in co-op, but for a very scary and intense immersive experience, i highly recommend just changing the game mode to single player.",1244.9

"this game is awesome, played it a ton. although after 70-100 plus hours (yep) it can get pretty repitive. although, the team behind this game updates it frequently so it adds a bunch so you never really run out of stuff to farm for, but this game is farming. that is all it mostly consists of. so if you do not like farming and the occasional boss fight iwould reccomend but if you do enjoy that kind of thing like myself give it a shot :d",87.5
"really fun, fun to farm, but once you are done farming, got all weapons you want, it starts to get boring really fast.",127.0
"its really fun but after youve dsicovered every feature, the gameplay gets repetative and all you do is grind for new weapons that are fun, and once you use that new weapon for so long it gets boring. since they are constantly updating the game since it is in beta, it has alot of potential to be some sort of rpg and if they created a story based off of the warframe universe, i think it would make the game a whole lot more.",339.7
"crappy support i asked why i got my trade toggled off and they suspended my support account, so lazy and bad to communicate. if you dont like the feel of getting banned for minor reasons dont try this crap..",230.2
"the most fun i have with this game is the very natural feel in which different movements come together smoothly to create crazy actions, like flying kicks and diving through doors all guns blazing. the combat feels very fluid and nice, a game system i would definitely love to see made into a longer game on the scale of a mass effect. as it stands, it is a great game to hop on with friends every now and then to slice, stab, shoot, and kick your way through hoards of enemies. the one down side is the fairly obvious lack of content. you can claim to have as many missions as you want, but that doesnt mean a whole lot when each one is just a copy paste of the last.",90.2
"diablo + crysis + space + ninjas = warframe. give it a shot, as its completely free (aside from cosmetics). grinding and repetitiveness plague it, but if you like dungeon-crawling-loot-hunting-monster-slaying-pseudo-rpgs, it comes with the territory.",375.5

"warframe is an absolutely amazing game that is so riveting and exciting. the co-op mission are a blast to play and the lore is detailed and inticate. the amount of visual detail for an open beta is mind blowing and the game is just gorgeous. the environments and enemies all look appropriate for the alien esque theme that warframe is trying to acheive. the variety of weapons is immense and can suit any play style from stealth to running in guns blazing. overall, warframe is an excellent game and it is free-to-play, so there is no reason not to check this title out.",11.1
"probably the greatest f2p game ive ever played. this game gets a 10/10 for the simple fact that anything you can spend premium currency on - you can also obtain without spending a single penny if you put a bit of time in. which is great but then if you want to buy all the super amazing equipment your gonna be spending a decent amount of coin - gotta respect that. other than that, the actual gameplay is nothing revolutionary - just a very smooth mixture of shooting/mellee combat. then you throw in the hundreds of modifications for each piece of equipment and you have an incredibly addictive f2p shooter!",58.3
"very fun for online and offline play with great graphics and very fun gameplay",5.0
"warframe is a very fun and addictive game,but it has a few problems. ill go over what i like about it first, and then the bad will be next. the good: this game shines no matter what graphical setting its on. the gunplay is fantastic. all classes a.k.a frames are unique. you dont haft to spend money to get what you want, just find them and build them in a r&d lab. very active player base. the dojo is the coolest concept ive seen for guild hideouts. dojos are like small building with pvp and stores in it, and its pretty easy to get lost in one. co-op is fun! the bad: very repetitive. some frames will out class others in endgame content. because you dont haft to buy things, it can take days to finish items you find in the research lab. some weapons are user level locked;meaning you haft to level your account to get certain weapons. random players who try to rush maps. hard to solo. and thats about it. if you enjoy games like borderlands and monster hunter, then this will be enjoyable to you. ive put in over 300+ hrs before i got burnt out, but in that time i enjoyed my experience. 3/5",621.7

"great atmosphere for any shooter gamer, it fast, quick and changes levels everytime you play, its like mass effect had a child and this is the result! great game!",126.4
"amazing game here. its primairly aimed at people who like collecting loot as the gameplay, while fast paced and very fun, is a little repetitive after a while. its got a real slow start to it, but once you get into the meat of the game and have a couple warframes to switch between things really get rolling. its completely playable without ever having to give over any money, but if you get the discount as your sign-in bonus you should go ahead and throw some money their way. its a great game and spending just $5 with the 75% discount can get you a new color palette to use for customization, and some extra slots to keep more warframes and weapons. dont bother buying weapons or warframes with platinum unless youre really impatient or just have lots of money to throw around though as everything can be unlocked for free with enough effort put into the game, and playing them is kind of the point of games anyway. overall you have no reason to not give this game a shot if you play shooters, which these days basically means everyone should at least try this game. i mean, its free to play, looks great, is a blast to play, and isnt going to nag you 24/7 to throw hundreds of dollars at it.",1.6
"ever wanted to be a space sci-fi ninja parkour melee sneakthief slidng running shooting badass? then download warframe! the story isnt the best thing ever but its still engaging and doesnt bore really quick. the controls are smooth as is the fighting. the feeling of chopping a grineer in half or blowing out the side of an enemy never gets old. plenty of weapons, upgrades, warframes, abilities, and other intersting things to keep any 3rd person shooter interested in for many hours. some levels are a bit easy, but it gets tougher. i havent played a ton of warframe but out of the 18.2 hours ive played, ive enjoyed all of it. 10/10 would recommend.",24.3

"ok... game sucks... thats all, glitches like falling through walls, the mods in chat are either drunk or they are bots, so saying anything with wts, wtt, or wtb in front in region chat will kick you. the game is unclear, it almost forces you to buy stuff, since everything takes alot of time to make, and it just sucks... dislike this as much as you want, i dont care... dont get this game...",283.9

"i have only been playing this game since april 2014, but i am addicted enough to spend hundred hours (probably will until thousands) and experience almost all the characters, weapons, and companions! the design of the factions are pretty cool and ability to modify your appearances really add a lot to the game, not to mention all those actions you get in-game with your mod-customized primary, secondary, and melee weapons together with your parties. i am hoping in the near future there will be more to the lore / storyline! thumbs up. recommended.",82.0

(p.s.:if you havent played this game yet, then you have to give a chance to this game.)",191.2
"im going to sum up this game as simply as possible. it is a repetitive, grindy game. you should know this going in. do not expect a massive variation in what you do. now the fun stuff a parkour system - wallrunning, sliding, flips, vaulting, all that cool stuff while firing guns 4-player co-op (its not an mmo.) a good f2p model (only stuff that you have to spend real money on are cosmetics - weapons can be crafted using resources gained from missions and blueprints bought from the market for credits.) gun modding and stuff (customise your gun to make it more effective against specific enemies, or just make it set people on fire. clans (guilds, armies, whatever you want to call it. you share a dojo, a communal map that you all build which allows you to unlock exclusive clan-tech weapons. adorable sentinels (they fly around above your shoulder and shoot stuff. they are adorable.) 9.6/10 - not bad (ign) goty",681.4
"nice graphics but to me focuses too much on flashy fighting and not so much on gameplay. also the levelling is just plain annoying and the game feels too much like borderlands, mass effect and spiral knights mixed together.",4.0
"a great game, graphics are beautiful and the gameplay is smooth",9.1
"this is not a game to be played alone. that being said its a lot of grinding and frame building. archwing is amazing and a whole other set of challenges on the game since it is so different from the rest of it. this is a game that will take time and passion to get into. it is well worth it. the trade systems in the game are pretty good but depend on other people who play the game. it can cost a lot of money to play unless you have the willpower to resist lol. though you dont need to spend money on it till later on. i recommend using the platnum that you get when you first start on slots for frames and weapons. it will save you a lot of time and trouble once you start lvling up and getting new gear. i recommend also choosing a syndacte that will do you the most good after you learn your play style and the most common frames you use. they also take a lot of time to build reputation with but the rewards they give you are astonishing and can often be traded for good platinum if you do that i recommend keeping one and saving up to get another to trade. msg me if you have further questions this is the most frequent game i play..and im deffinitly not ending anytime soon.",527.7

"quick review: if you like skill based mmos then you should try this. lengthy review: as of writing this review, i spent around $35 on cosmetic equipment only. you can buy certain things for cheap and i bought a lot of cheap things. that being said, you can pretty much get everything in this game without having to pay any moeny. this is a great game. the free to play aspect of it is great and it is done right. it forces you to buy colors if you have an obsession with accessorizing like me so be weary of that. this is mostly skill based and im sure if you paid enough money, you could get the best equipment, but youd still need skill to use those items effectively. note: if you are lazy like me and dont like to use a mouse and keyboard (blasphamy!) there is controller support; you may have to tweak some things. pros: -great gameplay -visuals can be great if your computer can handle it -almost everything can be obtained without paying $$$ -there is a warframe for almost every players play style -there are tons of missions with a lot of variety and difficulties cons: -can be time consuming to get some things -some items, mainly colors have to be bought -some minor glitches can occassionally happen but arent usually harmful",72.2

"this is possibly the worst game i have ever played. the reason i say this is, it will not even launch properly, something about the http or something, i have put a couple hours into fixing it, and none of the things i have done has fixed it. so because i cant even play the game, i must say this is the worst game i have even tried. sorry if you love the game, but its not my fault, it wont launch. it seems it is actually a reoccuring error, i hope it fixes though. my friend loves the game though. its just not my thing to sit hours on end to try to fix a game, but yeah i gotta give it a thumbs down. sorry to all the fans of warframe.",1.1

"definitely my favorite third-person fantasy shooter. great customization options, brilliant graphics, and challenging gameplay. certain aspects of the game require you to have other people be in a party with you, so there is also a wealthy amount of multiplayer aspects in warframe that compliment all the single player action one can experience.",157.6
"warframe is one of the best games i have ever played hands-down. the game is gorgeous, the gameplay gets you addicted in the first hour, and the storyline keeps you guessing. this game is not pay-to-win. you can craft any gun or tenno in the game without paying real currency. tons of mods to custimize the gameplay to your preference. 10/10 download the game while you have the chance! fyi: to those of you who do not have an intel core i5 or higher, and a graphics card equal to or above the nvidia geforce gtx 8600 series, you will experience some lag, and rendering will not be amazing, but the game will play. fyi 2: for those of you who have a crash report when they hit the play button on the game, please read on! when you launch the game from steam, and the launcher pops up, go to the little gear in the top right hand corner. ( directly to the left of the minimization button.) click on it, and a window with a set of check boxes should pop up. uncheck directx10 and directx 11. click ok or save and click the play button again. the game should launch normally. hope this helps!",131.7
"warframe is the bomb. no joke you guys. so much fun, and i just started a few days ago. the melee system is a little on the rough side in my opinion, but i dont care. the vast variety mods make the vast variety of weapons more enjoyable with one-hit kills. and dont forget the sentinals! overall, i rate this game 10/10 crowbars. stop reading this review and go play the game!",34.0

"this is a great game but the developers dont listen to, acknowledge or respond to their community. its like they have taken a great concept, then focused on aggressively creating situations for players to pay as much money as possible. this is f2p tactics obviously, but digital extremes take it to the extremes... : generally f2p games have some level of balance, and a great example of this would be planetside 2. this and ps2 arent pay2win games as people complain, but they are pay 4 convenience. the issue is that de focus on making this game as inconvenient as possible, and the only way to avoid any inconvenience is to pay money continuously and forever. the more you progress into this game, the more inconvenient it gets (youd think the opposite). the aggressiveness of the push to spend money by de is not really apparent until around the 100 hours mark of playing. i beleive the push to make you spend is becuase there is no end game. what you do at the start is the same at the end. if your only a casual player, then this game is a lot of fun and especially so with friends. if you get invested in games then this will likely become compulsion, rather than fun. its such a shame, because its a great game. but the unethical business model and a clear lack of direction ruins it. in the end, this game punishes you for player more of it.",309.4

"other key elements - create an avatar, characters speak english, have your own ship hub- can go to town hub later on if you wish or leave at you leisure, faction selection later on, class selection - 3 choices from the start, daily log in rewards, make the graphics higher or lower to let lower cpu play game, make new job classes or new weapons with blue prints with ingame money, 360 wired controller compatible, replayable missions and pvp the gameplay its a 3d realistic looking scifi thrid person shooter/mmorpg. the more you party with people, the more chance you have to survive the levels. the game will send legions of enemies at you ment for 4 people. you can solo the game but have a tougher time advancing. you can pay real cash to get items instant or use ingame money to buy blue prints to make them with parts you find in levels. you also have slots on weapons/on self to equiped abilities-lvl up to gain more points to better things. the weapon you kill enemies with gains the most experince points. the bad the only bad thing i could think of is the no skip on story cutscenes when characters start to talk, there no skip button i found to stop the replay if you failed a campaign quest. cannot do anything til characters stop talking storyline. maybe a update will erase this problem. update as i play more of the game",22.1

"warframe was fun for a while and running around as a space ninja is very cool, but it ended up being very repetitive after a time. having only 3 factions to fight in the same boring corridors got old very quick. in addition, the way the mod system is designed mean that weapon and warframe upgrading essentially becomes dependent on the games random number generator meaning that just playing for a long time does not guarantee any sort of improvement in a players stats. it eventualy felt like a grind to just find the right mods and it causes players to rush through levels just to reach the end instead of having fun fighting. the game is also very pushy about microtransactions by making some items completely unobtainable unless you purchase them with ingame money (platinum) and by making the creating of some items (namely, warframes) very tedious to do on your own by requiring you to posess the blueprints for 3 different parts, craft them each, then craft the final warframe with yet another bluerpint. by comparison, you can purchase the completed frame along with a pre-installed catalyst (an item that improves the mod capacity of a warframe) for a few bucks. i feel like ive had my fill of this game for now. perhaps i will come back later if some serious changes are made to the progression system.",149.2

"basically this game is awesome, if you liked borderlands you should like this game too! i love borderlands 2 ive said it is my favorite game when asked what is your favorite game? by others. this game has grinding like in borderlands and has multiple characters aswell, theyre called warframes, and theyre is around 20 of them you can buy them with platinum (the games in game currency) or grind for theyre parts. all in all warframe is a great game that you should try out because it is free so youre not losing any money if you dont like it, while sometimes the game can get a little repetetive it is because either your playing too much (like me) or you just dont like it. im very happy with this game and decided to give it a 9/10 because it can get glitchy sometimes. hope you enjoyed my review of, warframe.",5.8

"everyone looks like a chinese bootleg version of zer0",4.2
"probably my favorite free game our there right now, others include path of exile, ghost recon online, league of legends, and loadout. this is a great example of how the business model in a f2p game should be. any item that you can buy for real money, you can easily get for free. anything that you cant get for free is purely cosmetic. graphics are great for a free game, and crafting a new gun or warfame just never seems to get boring. it is kind of a grindfest though, and after spending almost 200 hours into this, im starting to get burnt out... its still in beta and ive heard that the devs are gonna start to change things a bit, make it more interesting. as it stands now its a must play. its free, so theres nothing to lose :).",470.6

"great game. co-op multiplayer is extremely fun. the variety of warframes to play are extensive and unique. the weapons all seem great so far. looking forward to more and more content.",50.4
"its f2p so expect grinding, but the gameplay is why this game still strives. it makes you love grinding and want to grind just for that one item and if you cannot seem to get it, there is trading in this game aswell. space ninja pve, with recent pvp gamemodes, gameplay is unique and addicting. different variations of enemies, traps, and bosses to keep gameplay interesting. 1 point i want to make is do not grind when you start. just go around to planets and play the game. going straight into grinding will ruin the experience for most people. only thing that people reccomend paying real money for is additional warframe/ weapon slots, but the game starts you off with enough platnium(pay for currency) to buy 1 extra warframe slot and 4 extra weapon slots.",410.1
"fast pace combination of 3ps with a mmo that includes a nice dose of meele combat , a bit grindy for gear upgrades but most content is available without spending a dime on it, nice overall power progression and mission variation with the addition of the perk/card upgrade systems make this one of the top free to play games. mechanic and content wise it is what destiny should have been.",139.3
"i have played this game for a very long time, and it has come a long way. a year ago today the mercury tile set was the only tile set, and now they have antire planets! i love this game, and i will follow it untill the multiplayer servers are no longer officaly hosted and then some. keep up the good work digital extremes, and thanks for this amazing game. `big-head hancho",340.0
"it shouldnt be this difficult to do something as basic as log out of the game!? wtf. i have played a ton of games and maybe i am missing the obvious, but i see no way to log out or quit the game besides force-quit. life is too short and this is free. sianara.",2.2
"i be very suprised when i watch this free to play game,its so good and i hope this game be better with more dlcs.",1.8
"one of the best co-op games i ever played and without a doubt the second best f2p game on steam. ive read some people complain about the pay 2 win and i can say, thats bs. you can get every item on the game, even the ones you can only get with platinum (only vanity items and extra slots for guns and warframes) without ever paying a cent, thanks to the trading mechanics. the only thing about this game that you may dislike, is that there is quite a lot of farming. you have to farm for credits, materials, experience, mods (cards that let you modify your warframes and weapons, and which you can then sell for platinum), warframe parts and prime parts (which you can also sell for platinum). personally, i have to say that i love it, and it can get you a lot of hours of gameplay. but again, if you hate farming or grinding, this is not the game that you should be playing. edit: i only have around 15 hours registered because i was playing the standalone version, without steam. im mastery rank 7.",79.3
"i do not reccomend this game only because i expected more out of it the customization is low and the gameplay is repetitive",1.0
"any free to play game is fun, but this keeps you occupied with its crafting system and difficulty. the only down side is the endless grinding and farming for recorces and blueprints to build what you want. it also gives you a choice to buy the item, but it could cost up to 20 bucks for a new warframe, but its free to play, what can you expect.",292.6
"this game got me hooked right at the trailer, i cant believe i havent been playing this the last two years... its everything it promises and has a huge variety of customization. its free to play and once youre one hour into it you will lose yourself in it... fantastic setting and graphics, and sooooo much custumization!!! love it!!! lotus ftw",121.1

"warframe, where do i start? with all of its grindiness, it can get repititve at times. however with its unique custimization options, variety of missions and warframes. it all makes up for it, the amount of time the creators of this game is noticeable, with balance changes, new weapons, etc. warframe is defiantly a fun time, playing solo, or with friends. so defiantly try this game out, grab a few friends as well, start a clan! the platinum prices however could be alittle lower, my wallet is in pain.",234.1
"yet another hack-and-slash rpg. unoriginal, yet somehow fresh. warframe combines standard shooting with hack-and-slash gameplay for a familiar, yet new experience. the basics are simple: you have your suit, your sword, and your guns. now go kill stuff. mindless yet attention-keeping, while at the same time testing your ability to adapt to a new situation. the game is riddled with environmental hazards and enemies of increasing strength. from the hideous grineer to the scavenger race corpus, you will never have a dull moment. that is... until the fps starts to tank. for some reason, this game has horrible fps issues, to the point that some have nicknamed it warframe-rate-drop. the devs are continuously figuring ways to make the experience less of a pain, however. i would at least pick it up, if you like hack-and-slash games. dont worry about lag, as you dont have to play online. you can go it alone, or go with up to three buddies, or if youre feeling adventurous, three completely-random-people-you-found-in-chat. have fun!",38.6

"in most cases i look down on many, many free-to-plays so when i first got this it was simply because it was free, and well, i just felt getting more games in my library. from the trailer it looked slightly interesting to me so... i got it. little did i know how stunning the graphics were for a free-to-play and little did know how emmersive this game is. with many in-game attributes to your character and its customization (which im a big fan of in games) i was instantly hooked. although there are some ridiculously priced dlcs and some in-game purchases, it doesnt affect gameplay because its not pay-to-win. if you can, by all means give this game a try, it may not suit you as it did me but... who doesnt want to be a freekin space ninja! -8/10",11.0
"huge respect for digital extremes, for making a aaa game and give it to us for free. if some money-whoring game companies made a game with quality like this, im sure theyll put $99 for the price. the graphics are outstanding. it runs smoothly on my laptop when other games with worse graphic quality cant even run 30 fps on very low settings. the movements and effects were so beautifully rendered, sometimes i wonder if its really free. my first 4 hours of gameplay was interesting. i didnt explore much at this point, so im gonna say its good enough. the premium item system is quite balanced. half of it was cosmetics, and its not to gamebreaking. another respect for the developers for not using pay2win way. play it. its worth your time.",17.0

"incredibly fun, like a mix space, and ninjas. dare i say, space ninjas. you are the tenno, a race of organisms that have been in cryosleep for a long time. when the factions of the grinneer, the corpus, and the infested start to overtake the solar system and its outlying planets the tenno have been awakened by the lotus, the mainframe for tenno communication and status, to stop them in their tracks. for a free to play game, unlike many that have tons of microtransactions, this game has 0% of pay to win. all items in this game can be acquired through effort and playtime, and yes, some grinding. it has a fun playstyle and its playerbase is incredibly helpful and supportive of new players. its environment gets slightly boring in a short time, but you get a small respite in certain planets, like earth. along with void missions, derelict missions, nightmare mode, and invasions/alerts. this game definitely has replayability. if you are a player who loves getting achievements and 100% a game then this game will not be for you unless you have the apt amount of time to give it. it does take a long time to get certain things, and some of the items you get are completely random to the point where you will need other player help, but based on the solo difficulty the game was obviously never meant to be played 100% solo.",203.9
"warframe is a free 2 play gold mine of nonstop infinite fun, shadowed only by its seemingly repetitive grinding which will likely never be taken away. however, if you enjoy the simplicity of what warframe has to offer then the endless hours of griding, oftentimes to make the most basic of necessary resources, would only be a slight obstacle for the otherwise brilliant and captivating gameplay. warframe certainly has its many downsides, including but not limited to poor design choices by its developers, however i cannot personally vouch if they would deter your entertainmnt of the game. the game is potentially hit or miss for many players. this game gets my personal thumbs up. warframe is one of the best free 2 play games on steam (and anywhere else for that matter) and rivals many other aaa games from the already faltering action genre.",278.8

"interesting concept, stunning visuals, good gameplay. the background music sets a cliche samurai-faceoff mood (not that its bad). the best part has got to be its co-op play and clan support, such as the dojo. the sad thing about the game, is how it forces players to go though micro-transactions to progress in the game, such as the restriction of warframe/weapon slots. even if that is not the case, the level-scaling for the game is broken to a level such that over 90% of the weapons become near-obselete at higher level missions. and for a game based on ninjas, there is surprisingly no proper stealth mechanics set in place for any stealth gameplay. the game is too focused on gun-blazing action and flashy skills. regardless, it is still a great game worth playing.",357.2

"it is a very fast paced game that does take some considerable pc skills. learn it well and it becomes great fun for probably years, the start may seem tough but as you progress the more amzing things get. one of my favourite things about it is the fac that everything in the game that aids progression can be done without paying a single penny due to the crafting system. it is very much a team game and if you have friends to play with then hop along because some missions you cant do on your own. there is pretty much a warframe for all playstyles and it mixes gunplay, ability use and parkour to create an amazing 3rd person action game. my only warning is that make sure you have a comr that can run it well bacause fps lag can really ruin your day. on a side note if your mouse seems to float when you move it try turning down the resolution (helped me and my friends!).",280.8

"warframe is a very good game. you could make all of the warframes characters without speding any real money. the mission are not the same, there are all different. ninga kicks and flying kicks are cool in this game. there are lots of weapons and melle weapons to choose from which is cool.",197.8
"its a amazing and wonderful game, full of action, adventure, and that splash of violence that just makes it great. though in the first few days or months (depending how much you play) it is difficult, mainly in money and resources, but that will soon end, and best of all, you dont have to worry that much about upgrading, since all warframes have unique abilities and traits to decide on! so i would definitly recomend this game, but for people who dont like 3rd-person view, space travel guns, lazers, swords, bows, robots, and ninjas!!!, turn your head and find a different game.",131.4

"the best third person shooter rpg out there, just absolutly amazing!",322.6
"the frame rate of this game is terrible, good graphics looks fun to play but horrible frame rate",1.0
"the game itself is a good example of how f2p should work...everything in the game, from weapons, warframes or even items can be made by yourself using in-game credits and resources you find while playing, you can pay real money if you want to get whatever you want early but is not really necessary so you can fully experience the game without paying anything. sadly that doesnt mean the game itself is really good, there are just a few maps that you will see over and over and there is no real point in playing the game since there is basically no plot, even though the game is full with lore and no end game content, once you reach the last planet and do all missions in it, there is nothing else to do but to keep buying new equipment and level them up and sadly that was my experience, in less than 48 hours i made one new warframe that had one skill that was really powerfull, one sword with a charged attack that could pretty much insta-kill everything (except bosses) so i didnt really need new equipment after that so it didnt take long before i reached the final planet and finish the last mission and after that....nothing, so i just uninstalled it",52.1
"this game of amazing humaniods is a fun and adventurous exploration that takes place through the solar system. warframe allows the player to choose places to go and gives them objectives to complete at these locations. leveling up your weapons or your tenno will keep you in the game. you can likely find yourself spending hours upon hours exploring the great and wonderous world of warframe.",150.4
"this game has dynamic movement controls allowing for fast paced game play or fast silent gameplay. the characters are adaptable to different play styles of first person shooter with a side arm, or swordplay. the third person view keeps you locked into the sci-fi setting by allowing you to see your warframe kick . it has the option to play solo, exclusively with friends, or online with a public lobby for each mission. drop-in games are usually successful and team work is commonplace. overall this game is a refreshing change to your first person shooter sci-fi action games. the storyline is interesting, and although i wont go into to detail, there could be more interaction. this is not an rpg, this is a mission oriented team play third person shooter. weapons are able to be modded for better efficiency, though it would be nice to see those mods change the physical appearance. a downside i have found is the difficulty to gain special currency for new warframes, and new gear. fantastic game, addictive as well - my husband now plays the game with me after only watching me play.",67.6
"i have seen the many changes throughout the close beta in which by far the developers of this game (de) did a tremendous job of keeping a game at a high quality pace within the free to play industry. i have supported the dvelopers since update 9 and have been really happy on their progress of developing this game. even though there were controversies between de and perfect world entertainment, it was only an investment run in which perfect world entertainment want to see them success in the f2p market industry. and so i highly recommend this game to new players who wants to play an action third person gun and blade mmo since they have updated and refined the tutorial section in which also has tonnes and tonnes of lore in which more are coming out in future major updates. also this game keeps its true free to play genre title since most of the cash items are just asthetics and not a pay to win situation (in which this game is mostly a cooperative game rather than a player vs player base).",1108.3

"endless enjoyment. theres so much that you can do in warframe, so many ways to costumize your play style, and there are always new weapons to master - not just in rank, but in unique skills needed to use them effectively. at points it tends to grind, and being part of a clan opens up a lot of the game thats otherwise locked away, but this is one free to pay that is definitely worth the time, and even a bit of scratch if you can get into it. space-ninja-robot-assassins forever!",195.7

"first impressions: i am only a few missions in to the game but their are a few things i would like to comment on. firstly, the game looks very good. i have a 2 year old acer aspire with low system specs and warframe runs well on low settings. i like the combat in the game but i do have a few complaints. firstly, the ai is really bad. they cover from you with half their bodies exposed to your bullets and sometimes run around like chickens with their heads cut off when they cant find cover. i think that the devs try to compinsate for this problem by having enemies spawn right in areas you just cleared and shoot you while your covering. luckaly, you have a lot of health and a regenerating sheild. warframe has a seperate button for hitting people with your sword which makes it a viable wepon in close quarters (i like that a lot) and quite nice shooting. the menu system, however is difficult to navigate and is poorly explaned. the plot is also not easy to follow as it throws a bunch of made up words at you with no background on the setting. i assume all this will be explaned later, but still... overall, i think warframe ( so far) is a good game. i will update this review as i play the game more.",10.1
"love this game. always come back to it. easy to get into - fun and light.",419.5

"understandable how this is still beta and all but...  those crashes. i crash like 2 times a day, and sometimes, the crashes are so bad, i cant even exit the application itself, leaving me a white screen where i do  hole. i seriously do not recommend it until these major issues are fixed but if your willing to put up with it, go ahead.",40.9

"i really wanted to like this game because the graphics are interesting but i found the controls to be frustrating and for a beginning player. there was a lot to try to remember and it just felt like it wasnt fluid. mind you, im used to left4dead2 so theres a lot of difference there and my issues with warframe might be irrelevant to someone more skilled than myself.",0.6
"this is one fun game. if you like cutting things up swords and shooting enemies with future weapons, and if you are a ninja, i suggest that you buy this game because all is included. it is free to play and pretty simple to master.",33.3
"its great for a free to play. the pay wall is a challenge but not impossible to over come, as long as you have time. most good gear can be gotten through paying for it of course, but if you have the time most items can also be made through the games crafting system, it just requires a lot of materials that take a long time to harvest. the combat is great fun though, it feels much faster and more fluid than many mmos. however it is an instance mmo, not open world. its just a mash of match after match. at this point and time id say warframe, hawken and tera are the best f2p games out there. with a tie between warframe and tera for the best. this is also quite fun on the ps4, but it doesnt handle as well, wall running is a real challenge with a controller.",22.1

"its a fun and beautiful game but the only problems are: its ftp which means micro transactions, said purchaseable items are needed for the more difficult levels as free items are weak or take forever to acquire, you need to level every new weapon you acquire, there will be areas or missions where you will need a full team. play when you have nothing else to play or do.",42.1

"warframe is an interesting take on the run and gun style of third person shooters. set somewhere in the future where technology is quite advanced and the known universe is governed by three different factions. the grinneer, corpus and the infected. you play exploring the different planets goverened by these factions in a warframe warframe does an excellent job blending in rpg elements with fast paced gameplay. each warframe has distinct abilities and purposes for different situations, i would even go as far as being to categorize them in different classes. the weapons system is also quite beautiful. consisting of being able to upgrade and customize your weapons in any way you want. warframe does have quite a grind which is evident later on, but if you just want a way to waste time with three other friends, then look no further than warframe.",441.9

"ok, ftp this is a damn good game. pros: fast action, combat is a blast flashy graphics is a good term for them especially liked the melee its a better first/third hybrid than firefall (where you also use warframes) cons: shallow--read, not an rpg, youre a combat drone flashy graphics are kind of stupid, characters are cool, enemies look clunky if you slip up early, you cant change things much without paying--wouldnt call it pay to win, but pay to change t what you really want. i really wish they had made it umm...something relevant like...cyberpunk maybe or...a zombie slayer or....something that makes some kind of sense rather than this weird tenno alien thing. but for fun, playable, combat video game...its pretty tight.",1.7
"ive played this game for a long time and im very impressed it has evolved alot from what it was origanally and its gameplay mixes classic third person controlls with good flowing parkour, interesting and diverse weapons and good melee combat add all this with the evolving universe and lore that is growing from the game. my only critism is that the game hassles you for money such as the kubrows, the kubrows make you have to log on every day or it loses health and if you put it in stasis it takes 3 hours to wake it up, the crafting is quite decent and reasnable but the exessive periods you have to wait are quite offputting. all in all this is a great game, as soon as my friend introduced me to this game i was hooked and now i love it and cant stop playing it. the graphics in this game are also fantastic as well and so is the music, it provides an interesting variety of game types and missions the enemys are also very diverse. one of the things that i personally like about this game is that the focus is taken away from pvp, the reason i like this is because so many free to play games are all just pvp focused. anyway to wrap this all up i recommend this game and think it is a great piece of work 10 out of 10",155.5

"awesome game! havent played it for long, but i quite like the concept. you fight trough the planets and moons of our solar system and fend off the grineer, corpus and infested. the only downside of this game is the grinding... you may have to fight a boss over and over again to get the right materials, or blueprints for just that warframe / weapon. but aside from that, fighting alongside other players in co-op, with various events thrown in here and there, i find this to be a really awesome game!",209.4
"game is hard to get into but if you hook onto it you can play it for hours without a break. if you enjoy grinding games this could be a great game for you. and it isnt really pay to win since most items can be farmed up quickly and the only use for platinum would be trading for prime parts or speeding up the crafting process.",155.0

"well, its a very well balanced game, great graphics, complex stat system. before i explain why the actual gameplay is great, you should know that it has a massive grindwall which can be avoided with money. the physics system is still new and buggy, but it is definitely a great engine. the game starts off very slow, and takes a bunch of time to get used to. after the first 2 weeks you will have done no more than what an experienced player could do in a few hours. if you arent a vivid everyday gamer - i dont recommend it. otherwise, if you dig gaming, with friends and randoms - its certainly worth a try. lots and lots of content, complex player systems. all sorts of unique guns, launchers, blades and skill trees. thousands of multiplayer combo stratagies, hundreds of one-man stratagies. gamestyle is up to you, mass killing & fast paced, or higher dps, slower & challenging games. many updates and exclusive events. one thing i must warn you about is the community. ive been on the forums a lot, and have seen it grow old and bitter over time. the great majority of players are not your friends.",658.0

"very fun game and engaging keeps me deep into the game",11.4
"this game is awesome. i really like the freedom to choose whether to go all out and rip up the mobs or complete the mission in stealth, nearly undetected. unlike a lot of games, this game has levels for each part of the equipment, and it is upgraded the more you play. moreover, there are a lot of rare items that you basically can loot, however it may be hard to find a specific one. the upgrading system is based on your decisions how to customize your character, and you can always recustomize it the way you like / the way thats most fit to your quest. once again, awesome game, highly recommended!",57.4

"you could spend a lot of time into this game grinding for cool stuff and hate rng mechanics like its the antichrist orrrrr you could buy your way to the top but that second option is not fun at all so the real fun in this game is going as far as possible without spending money. or just mooching off of your higher level buddies i know thats what im doing",75.9

"warframe is a grinding game but if you have ocd you will love it lol. i like the fact that you have to work hard to get stuff ingame, and that you can get everything that people pay for that adds any advantages in game for free by grinding. graphics are really nice and up to date. game is full of bugs. dx11 is bugged on my rig (apu). dx9 works great imo.game crashes alot and will just freeze rendomly. a good bit of the time you get dropped from games and lobbys for no reason. it can be a challenge somtimes to get in a game ive noticed after playing 180 + hours. the community is awesome and friendy. devs are always updating and active with the community so thats a good thing. overall this game is a blast when it works right and i highly recommend it. i plan on playing this game for a long time.",282.4
"an amazing game too good to be free to play, this game is too exciting, in a nutshell is more like: aliens - ninjas, sounds weird, but it is a great action game and a great shooter, if you want a unique experience of this kind of games, you have to have it. 10 / 10",4.6
"online reviews give it a mediocre score, but they are reviewing an older build of the game. the game isnt finished, and the developers are doing a fantastic job keeping this game updated. for a free to play game, its increibly well done. heaps of fun to play with a group of buddies. im very excited to see where this game goes in the coming months.",476.2

"amazing game, a little bit of a grind though, but thats what makes it fun for me, just waiting to get the frame or weapon is pretty exciting to me. then comes he combat system. oh boy, i just love it, and especially he idea of different types of melee weapons. overall, one of the best games ive played. *note* for ninjas only ;)",9.4
"i love the game but the connection is crap specially when you spend hours looking for a group then suddenly disconnects without a reason , cant connect properly with your friends over the net , trading sucks beecause of the network that is . but the game is great specially the fighting, network is crap they shouldreally fix it",820.9

"quite possibly one the greatest free-to-play games on the market, the community is decent, the graphics are dazzling, and the combat is explosive, however this game loses its appeal once the equipment and character acquisition grind come into play. all characters and weapons are craftable, however pay-to-win is a very viable option unfortunately, with crafting times varying from 1 day to 3 days for each piece, let alone the actual multiple piece item. the environments are recycled and lose their shine after a while, though it really doesnt detract from the game seeing as how it fits the clone/pirate/zombie storyline. overall a superb game, until you hit the equipment wall.",87.8

"warframe is a great grind game with an enjoyable grind style. you play as tenno (space ninjas!) and run around doing repetitive missions. though the missions do burn you out, the combat and manuevers just flow really well. throughout these missions you pick up mods (which give boosts/unique abilities to your equipment) and resources (used for crafting new equipment) and credits (the free in-game currency). though there is a cash shop (platinum) none of the weapons or warframes are locked behind it. in fact, the only items that are exclusive to the cash shop are cosmetics and grinding boosters (exp multipliers, resource multipliers, credit multipliers, etc). overall warframe is a great f2p game and will go for hundreds of hours of play.",779.2

"it was okay, but it gets repetitive after just a few missions.",10.7
"im sorry but once again warframe has failed me. why you might ask? well heres the thing:since my last review i said that it did some mayor improvements and it did. but then i came back to a mayor problem:getting bored of my weapons/warframe and trying to get new stuff,but not being able to buy/craft anything aka it costs way too much ingame money. first you have to spit up 20000 credits(which is one of the cheaper ones)and then you need to pay another 20000 credits to craft it. and all the materials arent even available yet in the beginning. so you might say:well then go do some frikkin grinding and progressing so you can get those materials. mayby,but i dont wanna spend the first 20 hours of gameplay on grinding. the phrase ninjas play free is wrong,for you to have fun in experimenting with different loadouts the best way is to just spend real money on it. ps.the game is laggy as  final opinion:the key moments of your game are at the start,so that way you can win a gamers heart and make them keep playing the game,this is not something these people got. i am sorry but you could not win over my heart once again,mayby in another year of updates whil you get it right.",16.4

"very entertaining, and graphics are absolutely outstanding. range of movement is very high with only a couple exceptions. the only thing i didnt like was how you are playing the same missions over and over again. very repetitive. characters are boss- wonderful. as an artist i like this game mostly for outstanding, unique ideas and art. but if you like a game that is constantly new and exciting...dont play this, you will be dissapointed. but, if you dont mind the constant repeating missions, go for it...and remember, ninjas play free.",119.1

"when i first tried this game around v7-ish, the ui was a fuster-cluck of stuff. i had no idea what to do, who goes where, why the warframes even, etc. so, sadly, i gave up. as well, a tubor of a pc was no help either. come a few weeks ago, it is up there, in my opinion, with good f2ps like team fortress 2. it follows a pattern where you have to work for stuff, and buying things is not necessary unless you want to shorten build times. i like that, it is a sense of progression that even few p2p games give. i really like that. as well, each warframe is varied, and unique in each power. some are pure tanks, others are butterflies-of-death, and 1 is basically a self-repairing/energy siphoning queen, and another is the best for defense missions. as well, each wep feels varied, and looks unique, and few need certain prerequisites to acquire them. higher mastery rank, gives you cooler weps, and clans/labs allow research into cooler weps. aside from the occasional bug, i really love this game.",210.6

"warframe is a great game because it has a little something for everyone. the games warframes supplement each possible playstyle. a few bugs are present, which should not deter players since it is in beta stage. warframe has crafting for the people who like to make cool stuff, small puzzles for geniuses, a looting mechanic, the ability to make any weapon a total beast, and a variety of weapons to fit any playstyle: the sprayer, the sniper, the heavy hitter, etc. the music is awesome at first, but gets a bit repetitive after a while, but gamemodes are fun and are challenging if given time, even the first stage has challenging levels. bosses are a bit overpowered but drop great items. warframe is incomparable with other third-person shooters, you could say its a different breed.",134.7

"this game, is perfect. you use space ninjas and so questionable space ninjas (cough rhino, valkyr, ember, frost, hydroidcough). this 3rd person shooter is epic, digital extremes actually listens to players. this game, is the perfection of 3rd person shooters. only thing its missing is a cover system, but god damn it does not need one",633.5

"grinding simultor 2014. a nice game all round with nice visual effects and customization options, but quite repetitive and boring towards mid/late game. pretty much grinding until you can find a new place to grind more often. purely grind to get items that enable you to grind more in the places that you unlocked by grinding. did i mention grinding? 2/10, would not install again.",105.5

"one of the most addicting and beautiful free-to-play games out there i highly recomend it. its kind of like a tps-mmo because of the powers you get on each warframe. the wepons are ok some of them are terrible,but on the bright side you can get great a huge longsword (galatine) and bladed boomarang (glave) sadly you can only get a glave by using platinum (real life money) and login rewards.so all in all i totaly recomended it",445.3

"this game....whoooo man its great! its so addicting and fun as h***! ive blown so many hours into this game and i just cant stop! one cool thing is that if your pc is slow orrr maybe you prefer a controller.. you can play this on the ps4 for free aswell! pretty much the only thing that annoys me is that there is a currency known as platinum and the only way to get it is to spend real money on it :/ if you dont plan on spending cash on this game then you can still obtain everything but it is going to take alot of time. well that pretty much wraps up my review! i give this.... 8 out of 10 and i reccomend this to any sci-fi lover like myself",4.1
"this game doesnt work properly for me. i keep redownloading it and either it fails downloading the game or the game itself starts when its still downloading which gives poor gameplay, missing textures, longer loading-screens.",15.5

"warframe has a lot of promise but not much when it comes to end game fun, and quite a few down sides that make it hard to want to continue once youve reached a point. the majority of the gameplay is spent in farming or waiting for things that you will have no big use for once you have them. also, there is a pretty big focus on smashing lots and lots of enemies rather than using intelligent gameplay. maybe in the future if they do a better job with updating the game i would recommend it, but for now no.",622.6

"warframe is a fast pace multiplayer first person shooter combining rpg and utilizing a parkour system that gets your heart pumping even faster. jump, wallrun, shoot, fly, slash, and climb your way to victory. their are only 2 downsides in this game in my opinion. weapon slots and crafting. for crafting, it takes 12 hours to craft a single weapon. the problem with weapon slots is that you cant buy them unless youre buying the weapon itself instead of craft them. leaving collectors with a limited amount of space. other then those, this is legitimately the most awesome game ill ever played.",987.3
"i shot an arrow at a guy, he flew back and killed all his teammates. 10/10 i mean, i love this game, down to the heart i cant let warframe go, sadly the game gets really old. after having played 260+ hours, i can easily tell you im not able, willing, or needingly gonna dump a single more hour into this game until it has undergone some serious updating. all good things must come to an end, then you make way for new good things. for me, warframes depot of good things is depleted, now they need to fill it up agian with a stack of updates before im gonna even touch this agian.",301.4

"currently played 45 hours and have 3 characters so by no means is this an in-depth review. this is a very fun action packed game, it can keep you entertained for hours however i do want to point out that it can be a grind fest and can get very boring very quick. level can repeat constantly with the only difference is having a different objective which can make it seem like youre playing the same mission again and again, but for some reason it didnt seem to bother me too much. trying out new characters different weapon and abilities keep the game feeling fresh. level 30 is the max level, however you can use forma to upgrade your warframe and then this causes your level to drop to 0/ unranked again. doing this allows you to add higher level/ more mods which allow your warframe to become stronger, now whats the problem? well this causes you to repeat missions over and over again which wouldnt be as bad if the mission were not already a repeats of the previous mission all in all this is a very good game, however there is a lot of repetitiveness!!!",57.0

"very fast paced fun. lots of ways you can play this game. can be a bit grindy but the combat is satisfying",399.0
"four words: cybernetic ninjas with guns. the game is a 4 of 5 or a 7 of 10. it has good graphics and great gameplay. the game is still is a work in progress and the new updates are polishing up an already well-built game. the co-op is the fondation of the game, but a bit of a let down when you are forced to race through a mission because your teammates decide to race to see who can kill the boss the fastest. this can be fixed by communication with the teammates or knowing your team, however it can be a time consuming to find people who operate like you do or will tolerate scavenging for resources (which is essential). the mod and upgrade menus are pretty straight forward and easy to use. i would recommend if you like the shooting of halo, the free-running of mirrors edge, and the sword play of dynasty warriors.",328.7
"conceptually, its neat. but ive played mmos long enough to tell you that youre gonna get pretty bored just shooting at nameless, faceless npcs all the time.",0.5
"for me, warframe is one of the best free-2-play games in steam. by the way, it is a sci-fi third person game which offers a lot of entertainment. not only featuring a lot of different missions it has also a unbelievable big number of different weapons. you dont even need to fight with guns, you can also use many different swords, bows, crossbows and a lot of other weapons. and as i said, its free-2-play, so take the time to have a look! 7/10",187.7
"i was a bit sceptical at first. you know, it being free to play and all. but then i realised that you can always get stuff for free, it had great gameplay and to put the cherry on top you can parkour.",34.0
"really great art style and backstory. its too bad the games missions are so repetative and adds nothing to the narrative of the interesting universe theyve created. the gameplay can be fun but youll be doing the same over and over. killing hundreds of grunt enemies and then the odd tougher boss.",74.8
"warframe is one of the few games out there that really impressed me. with its many places to go and many warframes to play as it definently has diversity with the amount of characters it has along with all the guns and other things you can have. the amount of things you will figure out in this game will amaze but you must realize that this is basically like borderlands or any other tough single player game. i would suggest having a few friends to play with because alone this game is nearly impossible with the massive amount of enemies it sends at you. it could use a little difficulty tweaking but all in all makes up for it by being one of the few games that lets you use parkour as most people call it otherwise known as being able to run on walls and other things like that. all in all an amazing diverse game that makes up for little story by having amazing gameplay mechanics.",541.3
"its a succubus in video game form. did i spell that right?",25.3
"firstly, this is not a p2w game like most of the f2p games out there, just pay2rush. all items can be bought with in-game currencies except cosmetics. second, it offers great graphics and even greater optimization that allows you to run the game smoothly everytime. third, lots of weapons and customizations. fourth, the developers are hardworking, expect multiple hotfixes and updates daily or weekly. if you care about the in-game and steam achievements thingy, its currently broken but who says it wont get fixed. lastly... just go and play it already!",58.8

"space ninjas! this game is really good. it has a nice fast pace,interesting story,atmosphere and characters and awesome gameplay. the guns and swords feel so good to use and it provides a nice challange to those looking for one. there are some issues that bother me since i last played (was a while ago) but leveling up and getting money takes forever and i feel that with the third person camera there should be a cover system of sorts. not to mention the few bugs here and there but that arent gamebreaking 9/10 it was okay -ign",41.3
"lens flares, aliens, futuristic technology... enough said",5.7
"have you ever wanted to be a space ninja guarding the solar system from evil and preventing the enemy from getting the upper hand? well you ,sir, have just found the right game. warframe offers the opportunity to slice, splat, shred, flatten, set fire to, electrify, melt, poison or blow up your enemy. you can grow, yes grow, your own dog that can make a pretty easy meal of anyone or anything and you can build your own clan fortress on the very edge of the system that can house up to 1000 of your fellow players or tenno as they are called. i not only like warframe because you can do all of the above but because unlike most games there are no items that you cant craft or find, so it does not force you to buy any in-game currency to get anything decent. so its good for players (like myself) that want a good game and dont want to have pay anything to get to the top of the food chain. i would extremely recomend this game! 9.5/10",710.3
"excellent potential and in development.. some bugs but theyre bbeing ironed out of course :) it just gets better!",22.9
"for the reason i dont know how to write the review",158.4
"i would definately recommend warframe to someone who does not have a whole lot of money in their steam wallet. the graphics are amazing, mainly because somehow i can get it to run on a higher setting than most of my other games, and you are basically a ninja with whatever weapon you can afford in-game. its pretty amazing being able to sprint, crawl, and flip your way across the room in a matter of seconds. not only can you purchase weapons and gear, but you can also craft your own if you have the materials for it. i would say that the only problem with it, though, is the fact that you level up pretty slowly (at least i do) and from what levels i am able to play it seems that the goal is more or less the same. it still has plenty of enemies to kill in any fashion you can, and you always have to make a quick escape afterwards. i still think that this game is pretty cool for something that costs absolutely nothing.",19.0

"another recommendation that took me far too long to write, warframe. like ive said before, and ill say it again, you can never go wrong with free, especially not when its got the amount of polish that warframe has. space ninjas, put plain and simple; with fast-paced action, some little puzzles here and there, and relatively bug-free overall. crafting systems are quite rewarding, and a clan system thats actually beneficial in some way rather than the traditional nametag added to your username. threatening bosses, procedural levels, and randomized obectives oh my! warframe, is the , that is all ladies and gentlemen, good evening. 8.5/10",748.6

"i have a right to review this with the amount of hours ive had on this game.... it was a fantastic experience, but its easy to get a mod maxed and just 1 shot everything.so no end game... i would download and play but dont spent loads of platnium like i did, spent your money on another game. $150 for max prime pack...  off d.e",758.5
"how to start... well, warframe is an action/fps/hack n slash game so addictive at the beginning, you will be surprised of the amazing and funny gameplay and method to obtain the stuff, its easy, its attractive, its fast, its cooperative, etc, you will be interested in being more powerfull with better mods/weapons/warframes, etc, later you will have a feel that its a bit repetitive the gameplay, then the absence of a decent vs multiplayer mode (like; capture the flag, deathmatch, control points, king of the hill, etc) will make you feel a void in your soul, then you will feel a lil disappointed when you realize wf in some cases is too p2w, and etc etc... afterall, seeing that wf is still on develop, you will say that is not that bad, when you have your mates there; its an amazing game to play and always it will make you go deep on it and having you playing more and more, obtaining what you want to obtain because its true, you can obtain the 90% of the stuff without pay (certainly, slots system is a bit abusive) and with all of this in mind you will say ok, lets try again to see if the boss finally drop the blueprint? :) and you will repeat this again and again... 9/10",838.0
"just drags on and on, bad matchmaking, childish control, and questionable visuals. would not download again.",5.2
"first week i thought this game was pay to win because thats exactly how its set up to look, turns out its not. you can trade players items for premium currency. pictures and videos do this game no justice at all. i woulda hated this game unless i played it which thankfully i did. no regrets so far. also the price tag is pretty nice too, cant argue with free.. sometimes waiting for gear to finish being crafted can be a bit brutal but if you dont mind being paitent then you are good.",170.8
"warframe is 10/10 it has a very slow start with a lot of grinding but once you get some stuff it is amazing",309.8
"i can only describe this game as one thing, space ninja farm simulator 3082 because the main thing you do in this game is to farm/grind certain missions on certain planets to obtain materials to craft better weapons to allow for more efficient farming. and to obtain new and better warframes you must go borderlands style and kill certain bosses to obtain one of three parts all of which have a random chance at spawning. normally i would not have a probelm with this if it werent for the fact that once you can craft your desired weapon or warframe you have to wait 12-72 hours in real life for them to complete crafting, or you could just spend money and have it instantly. in fact almost all of the weapons and warframes can be bought with actuall money which also kills the main purpose of this game which is to get better weapons and level up.",89.9
"great blend of sword and gun play, coupled with parkouring free-movement elements. definitely recommended.",35.3
"i really love the game and the diversity you can experience. although i do believe they should lower the time to make things. warframes take 3 days to make by themselves not to mention the 12 hours for each part. other than the building times this game is very fun and i hope it can bring alot more warframes into the mix even though it already has so many.",225.3
"i have played this game for a very long time, and it has come a long way. a year ago today the mercury tile set was the only tile set, and now they have antire planets! i love this game, and i will follow it untill the multiplayer servers are no longer officaly hosted and then some. keep up the good work digital extremes, and thanks for this amazing game. `big-head hancho",340.0
"great graphics and sound. seemed incredibly dull in the beginning, but after discovering how powerful and interesting the mod system is, i was hooked. the game is very repetitive and some items require considerable grind, but its definately a good distraction if you have a friend or two to coop with.",102.0
"set in the far reaches of outer space during a new dark age, warframe introduces the tenno, a race on the brink of extinction after being enslaved by the grineer for centuries. this game is very addicting, play as a space ninja running around throwing energy and running up walls. defend against a ton of different mobs, grind for hours and craft new weapons and frames. the community is awesome and the gameplay is amazing. i would highly recommend this and we havent even touched on the graphics. the only problem i can think off is that the dlc is overpriced, just my opinion. otherwise this game is 10/10!",80.6
"i love this game if you enjoy grinding and getting to feel like you got an awsome reward for that farming then this is your game if you keep up a fast pace and go like the ninja way you can kill every one. the mod are plenty i have been playing for almost 500 hours and you start to see that they put in some filler. if you put the game on ultra for the graphics it looks like your playing a future type tv movie. the lore is lacking but they have said that they may put in some more into it.when they make an update like for version 14,15 exc it always has somthing amazing to offer. the old tutorial is crap compared to the exclent one now for example you can get to chose your own guns and weapons insead of having the crap mk-1 braton,skana, but the lato was good. the mission and events make it so that you cant get bored and when you play void survival it feel like a battle to the death and your fighting and endless wave of enimes. the defense is a bit less then the survival but you have a less priority of caring for your life. the weapon selection is huge i want to try and make all the guns but i have only schratched the surface. the warframe make it so you can adapte to any situation. i recomend if you do get platinum you should save it either to get parts resouces or getting some stuff from the trade tab.i recomend fully that you get this game and even though your bored from farming just for a bit the reward after is the best thing you can get",776.5
"its one of those neverending betas. farming is the main concept of the game, and even if you enjoy the fantastic gameplay and the variety of weapons, it forces you to buy slots for them, and its very tedious, also there is nothing else to it, you finish every star system, some lame story arcs that serve the purpose of making you farm even more to unlock more features and thats it, the most outstanding feature of the game is the trading system, if you farm enough, you may get good stuff that you may sell for platinum (the currency you normally would have to pay for with real money) to buy the same stuff at a smaller price and resell it again, repeat this enough times and you will find yourself with enough platinum to buy a house. if you like this kind of game, go for it. i mean its not bad, its good, it feels good to kill stuff, it feels good to have friends killing stuff with you, it feels good to cut enemies, but i wouldnt recommend this game unless is just there to waste time.",1012.7
"mass effect-ish aesthetic + monster hunter crafting + ninja style parkour & movement + customizable weapons anad abilities = warframe. lots of farming and grinding, specialized frames with different abilities including healing, aoe, projectiles, stuns, confusion etc. plenty of different kind of guns, from rifles to shotguns, smgs and pewpew laser rifles, weird fleshy gas and needle guns, a huge variety of melee weapons; theres a lot of different ways to vary your combat. its free-to-play, and i wouldnt say that its pay-to-win, unless your idea of winning is just getting everything as fast as possible. you can pay nothing and attain much and more. you can never spend platinum on catalysts and reactors (because you can get several per month just through alerts and livestream game-wide giveaways) and still put up a fight, you can still participate in the void, you can actually contriute during events, during high level defense, survival, dark sectors etc. youve just got to be good. lastly, do not be fooled by its actiony display; this is as close to an mmorpg as a third person shooter can get, and expect to spend time learning and reading from the wiki and the forums. find a clan, get to know people, learn where to go to attain what you want, then spend hours shooting, killing and earning credits, items and crafting components. if all that sounds like fun, you have absolutely no reason not to be playing warframe.",1276.5
"i have only played this game for a few days, but i have to say i am pretty impressed. for a free 2 play game its very well done especially graphically, reminds me a bit of the borderlands loot mechanics, but instead of guns, its about mods. it has its glitches here and there, but again its free, and so far it does appear that the devs work out the kinks. if you liked borderlands / mass effect / crysis, this is a blend of all 3, it is free after all.",131.5
"this game is awesome, and its free. really, its free! you can get almost everything. all warframes, weapons, etc. (excluding new colours, some customization stuff) can be crafted.",309.7
"i feel warframe is the most refreshing multiplayer game i have played recently! the community is great, the developers are amazing! warframe and digital extremes have accomplished what most game developers should aspire to, work with and be a part of their community, the people actually playing their game and enjoying it because of the great support on the part of its developer. warframe is 10/10! keep it up digital extremes, the world is yours for the taking!",284.9

"this game is insanely fun. i recommend this game to anybody who likes sc-fi and cyber ninjas. this game is cool saying that you aquire the moves, mobility, and weapons of ninjas. this game is a good third person shooter and it is good for those who are hardcore ninjas. overall, good game and i recommend this.",155.0
"in my opinion this is a pretty good game. it kinda reminds me of destiny and its got decent graphics, especially considering this is a free to play game. overall this game has hours of bow sniping awesomeness to offer.",6.0
"the most fun ive ever had in such a grind-y game. go farm for  already. its fun, i swear.",785.7
"game is poorly optimized, graphics are a little dull. the game itself gets boring after playing the first 20 hours, theres nothing to do except play a level and get loot. levels are the same basically, the maps get boring. its hard to get certain materials to craft items. overall, if you really want to enjoy the game youre going to have to spend a lot of money on the game. i do not recommend this game and i am giving it a 3 out of 10 for its dull graphics, bad optimization and common server problems.",70.5

"one of my fevrit games and it keep geting better evry up date 5/5",0.7
"despite my username and avatar, i dont go in much for fpss. i still love this game. its a lot like mass effect multiplayer, with the addition of martial arts flick acrobatics. good balance so far in the freemium aspects -- new equipment comes along fast enough (particularly when playing with friends) that i dont feel screwed by not paying money for it. looking forward to how this game develops over time.",185.2
"okay the question that humanity has been asking itself over and over again(you aready know what it is off-course) is... wait for it... what happens if you mix 3rd person shooting and space ninjas. well you get warframe. its got over hundred randomly generated space station dungeons making every game different you have awesome ninja skills like wall running and kicking enemies in the face. and on top of everything, this...game...is...bloddy...free!!. now, to the seriuos review. the game is currently in beta, that means there will be bugs and glitches, i have never found any game breaking bugs though. there currently is 17 classes (warframes) to chose from. this includes healers, tank and mind controllers and all that fun stuff. you will find 3 factions to shoot in the face (sort of 5 but that doesnt matter) the controls feel pretty good to me. overall this game (in my opinion) is a very, very and yet another very good game",557.3
"i must say the game is excellent in almost every way if u enjoy sci-fi action but if u have time to waste as well it wuld be the perfect game for u, i may not have played as long as most but ive realised that this game is just a repetitive masterpiece. u spend hours trying to new equipment only to find that there is even stronger ones coming out later, which of cause u will and want and spend more hours farming to get it, so if u got nothing to do anymore and enjoy sci-fi action i would recommend because i have to admit this is a good game",143.1
"perfect world entertainment buys digital extremes, the developer of warframe. perfect world entertainment. please do not kill warframe. warframe is an amazing game just the way it is. do not change it. do not do anything to it. let digital extremes stay in charge. do not do to warframe what youve done to countless other games. please pwe, i beg of you. let warframe live.",19.0
"just when youre done farming over and over again... they pull you back in through constant new updates.",469.4
"an awesome space ninja simulator in which farming and grinding is actually fun. trust me it is. the graphics are just so awesome with little flashy and glowing lights and stuff. too bad the devs are updating the prime equipments looks for the sake of people with  pcs (a prime is an enhanced version or a weapon or character thats usually white or black with a gold trimming that normally was reflective and shiny, now it looks like cheap plastic.)",617.2

"a very good game indeed. a fantastic free to play game! there is one thing that i do not like though: updates almost everyday. i do not have a fast internet (mine is 115kbs at max) like most other people do so it is aggravating for me to constantly download those updates. try it out for yourself and i bet that you will not be dissapointed.",67.9
"yes - very worth while f2p - download and play a few hours",152.7
"its a fun coop game that you can play with your friends and it makes time fly, this game is my favorite freeto play game.",375.8
"so i played warframe a lot during the beta. maybe a little to much to where i out did my self on the game and then it just got boring. it started to get boring though when shotguns came into play and anyone who had one could whipe the floor of any mission. later on i come back and see they changed everything. while some is nice i hate most all of the changes made. not to mention the gameplay is still boring however all co op style games are boring and are even more so if one person is able to do all of the work for you. kinda like boarderlands 2 its dull as hell. i havent yet beat it because after the first 30 mins its just straight up boring to me. warframe is fun playing it alone though as a single player or sometimes with one other person if they do not have something overpowered. i got this one guy in my clan into the game...he is addicted. he has over 3k almost 4k hours into it.",172.5
"great game however when it updated i lost all my equiptment including a paris which took me 7 hours to get!!! can i have my stuff and loki back!!!",17.6
"amazing game, new content added all the time. the new melee system transform the game from a standard over the shoulder platform shooter to something different and unique on the market. the credit and platinum system is definately good and allows that even if you dont decide to put money into the game, that you can aquire >95% of the inventory. though my only concern would be the price it is to buy platinum and the effective use out of it. 10 of platinium does not get you far, and for the new frames trying to unlock them via the free route can be time consuming at times. if you are prepared to put a little extra time in the game then everything is worth it. the community side is great and very much almost too friendly. the only things i would ask/improve it this was my own game would be more plat for you buck and the cross play the ps4 users (though both most likey not going to happen due to the natures of both cirumstances. tl:dr? get the game, its free and fun with mates. the game is beautiful and there far too much content in comparions to simlar free games on the market.",337.7
"a fast-paced third person shooter. game best played with friends and using team speak to communicate. playing with random people can by okay, but usually you play with guys that are just farming resources, so its rush to the end. i burned me drive for this game when it was still in beta. the game just comes down to geting resources to build new wepons and warframes, if collecting stuff is your cup of tea, go for it, if your not up to grinding for hours then it is a skip.",166.7
"the game is a lot of fun but repetitive so it can get boring fast. its a lot more fun if you play with friends so that its less boring. at a certain point progressing does require you to pay for more weapon or frame slots. if you dont then you will have to trash , remake and lvl up what you already have to continue progressing your rank. lucky the slots arent expensive.",791.4
"dont know why people call this a grindfest when there isnt really a endgame or a objective. its only a grind if you make it one yourself, all the guns are well balanced and the game isnt that difficult. the main goal of the game is to have fun and enjoy the community.",624.8
"this is a halo meets parkour to me, but it is a very fun game with your friends. its a third person over the shoulder space game.",46.9
"downloaded a couple days ago still cant enter the game. 1/5 for this game.",55.2
"10/10. a 3rd person shooter with a story i am personally interested in, incredible gameplay, a few in game purchases (but with the recent free games thats almost a guranteed thing), several weapons, multiple characters each with their own unique abilities, and more that i havent even found yet.",13.8
"an interesting take on 3rd person shooting and an overall solid co-op experience. dont let the beta tag fool you, it feels and acts solidly. the two biggest weaknesses of the game are the grinding and the samey looking levels. the levels are procedurally generated and easy to get lost in.",23.3
"game modes from assasination to defense, offline and online, not to mention tons of power up cards to enchance your arsenal, a worthy game to spend my time on. though its not the best, but definitely in my approved list.",760.8

"great free to play game, would recomend to everyone :d",1.8
"its a fantastic next-gen free to play game. the micro-transactions arent anybodies cup of tea but premium items dont get in the way of pure skill at the end of the day. its multiplayer only for now but single player looks promising, the co-op aspect of this game is great with a mix between racing too the finish and helping teammates destroy enemies or claim objectives. no pvp yet but a not so popular duel-mode is currently in place. the mission layout is expansive and pretty good to navigate through and the graphics are a treat.",85.9
"i really didnt expect to enjoy this game as much as i did.the combat is fast paced and once you play into the game the difficulty definitly increases in a good way.the rpg elements have been implemented very well and the mod system seems very interesting. the only thing about the game i didnt enjoy is that for a new player i found it pretty difficult to figure out how to do certain things there are small tutorial hints in-game but i didnt find them as helpful as they could have been. overall i think everybody interested in an action/rpg/shooter hybrid should give warframe a try, and since its free to play that makes checking it out even easier. rating 8/10",693.9
"i have had problems with games that are too repetitive in the past. this is one such game and while it was fun the first few hours it has become much too repetitive after a while. i dont like to grind for hours at end and thats the one reason i have stopped playing the game. otherwise this game deserves at least a 9/10.",2.4

"warframe is a free-to-play shooter with, basically, exo-skeleton soldiers that have different powers and abilities. at heart, the game is as shooter as any other game youd play on the market, but, throw in the unique powers with each warframe, the customizablilty of the guns and gear with their mod system, the diverse spectrum of weapons, unique movement system... and a free tag on it? you cant beat it, for what youre paying. there is a cash shop that you can use, which supports the games funding, via platnium that you can buy in packages. in some cases, you can pay-to-win the game to death, buying everything in the store with real-life cash, if you wanted. however, that takes all the fun out of the game, considering half the fun of it is gathering the pieces and materials to create something new and impressive that youve worked for. and constant, free updates? you cant beat that. all in all, a really great game that id totally recommend you pick up, even if youre not a huge fan of shooters.",128.7

"warframe is a game where youre a robot ninja and you go around with 3 other robot ninjas and prepare to curbstomp the entire enemy opposition because of all the characters unique abilities. this game can also be described as metal gear rising meets halo meets dead space meets borderlands. you got the fast paced robot ninja action ala metal gear, the characters looking like halo and dead space, the infested feel like halo flood and the dead space necromorph, and the 4 player drop in drop out co-op and grinding is like borderlands. of course, the devs where smart when they designed the grinding aspect, as the map has a unique thingy that allows each and every time to be different so you dont get bored of running through the same place a million times to go fight this boss, which is where borderlands failed. the microtransactions are kinda weird though, but nothing too major unless you like to waste money buying items when its easier and cheaper to go find the components, build it, and then rush the item. the action is very fast and flowing, where you could go from jumping in the air shooting at people to sliding into people and insta gibbing them with your melee weapon. its all very fun, and id recommend it for anyone who likes fast paced ninja robot action tl;dr: this game is good get it you as shole.",1144.8

"at the beginning (maybe) youd like it. its entertaining once you get some new warframes to play and maximize (same with the weapons), and constructing a dojo is more like if youre lucky or not. however, is a bit frustrating when the pvp lacks some competivity or some rewards... in fact, practically no one enters there since theres nothing in return (no ranking system or something that makes you play more of this) at the end of the day, youll realize theres nothing interesting but to gather resources to buy some weapons to see how powerful you become... and for what? well, heres my realisation quote: is that it? i wasted my time id even go back to lineage 2. i do not recommend to play warframe, could be addictive but still frustrating afterwards. -arkl1te",220.6

"edit: this went from fun, to just a drag now. its the same old thing over and over, and now the events they run are boring as well. there is no real point to doing anything when you realize 90% of it is there to make it take forever. fun shootem up but the intro grind really sucks. once you get past that, the new market makes it much easier to get going. need a clan for some of the better weapons, but the blueprints in the market are good as well, if not a bit expensive starting out.",497.9

"certainly one of the best f2p games out there. despite a few bugs and glitches (which is what you would expect for a game that is still in open beta), the gameplay is unique, the graphics are fantastic, great-looking character and weapon models, well detailed maps, and its fun to play whether you put money in to it or not.",132.8

"great looking free to play, interesting mechanics such as sneaking, if you really dont want to fight you can sneak your way through a map. which i found very interesting. the game consists of suits that your character wears called warframes and each one carries special attributes, such as stealth extra abilities cloak, etc. but is free what could you lose by giving it a try?",52.7
"its a great game. not too easy, but also not too hard. its a simple and not complicated game. you go in missions, kill, loot, upgrade and tune your warframe. if you dont want an over complicated system of tuning, fun with friends and a great shooter with some melee counter-part, warframe is exactly that.",71.4
"not bad for the price. i mean considering most free-to-play games ive tried wont even run on my machine without game-breaking graphical glitches, its pretty good. i cant say that i really engaged with the dark-for-darks-sake backstory, and the combat isnt anything groundbreaking, but if you like the idea of slightly improved mass effect combat without the rpg, youre not wasting your time with this one.",5.9
"stupid ninja game that has quality but the controls are not user friendly and as for the first mission of the game they expectyou to know what to do from the start i mean come on at give us a decent tutorial instead if your gonna change the standard controls and as such that makes war frame a terrible game in my opinion personal rating 0/10",1.0

"extremely high value game. the melee, the shooting, even the parkour are all solid. and you can enjoy them all for free. and if you really get into warframe, the cheapest payment options (around $10) will do you fine. they allow you to buy a massive number of slots  used to store equipment that you assemble over days or months of frenetic, cooperative fighting. drawbacks at the time of this review (nov 2014): new features are often unavoidably buggy, but then again, at least warframe is always updating (sometimes adding whole new mechanics!). unfortunately, warframes navigation menu still makes it impossible to quickmatch and keep the action pace up. menu and upgrade mechanics can also be underexplained  with no click-for-help option, serious players may have to visit wiki sites. review summary, great action supported by an improving development team. try warframe.",232.0

"started like a year ago stopped because i was too busy playing tf2. came back a year later because my brother was playing it. accidently got 100 hours already.... if you dont have at least 40 hours after 1 month of this game, youre doing something wrong",160.2

"very fun and very addicting extremly fun fo those who like to murder things and are slighly psychotic but anyway 10/10 would recommend for anyone but it does kinda require a fair bit of actuall money to get a good experience!",792.9
"its like halo just mixed with cool, card-collecting upgrades that is better for the pc. it has a lot of potentiel as long as they keep the fixes constant.",173.7
"i have only one question, how can this game be free of charge?",1.9
"big recommendation: warframe is a bad- 3rd-person co-op shooter and hack & slash game offering an amazing (and refreshing) variety of play-styles, influential & fluid skill builds, challenging game mechanics, randomly generated levels, hordes of foes that will test your metal and spectacular graphics (surprisingly highly optimized). this game is literally an amalgam of the best elements of the fps and rpg genres, all in one tightly bound package. ffs who doesnt love space ninjas!!!",927.0
"i... love ... this game!!!! what more can i say, its free, its fast paced and its ninjas in space.... the controls are fluid whether using a keyboard or controller, and the community is very competitive and helpful. the clans that are in this game really do battle it out for control its amazing. it does require some hefty graphics card mumbo jumbo but even so its still great",38.6
"you need a pretty good computer to run this game smoothly",2.4
"amazing game, you can almost see it as a mix between daiblo + borderlands + masseffect + ninjas, devs are ambitious and push to evolve the game with every update and works with a very active community when adding new content. speaking of cummenity, very welcoming and helping ; all around, if you wanna lose countless hours deep into high action wall running head shotting invisible eviscarating gameplay, all wrapped around in a sci-fi space ninja universe, this is the game for you. 8.5 /10 must be played",945.4
"this is a very fun and adicting game with a fast pace and shooter aspect. fun for all types of gamers!",46.4
"this game is very fun and i love playing it. however, the graphics is a little bad for my taste, as i like higher megapixels per secong",3.6
"addicting and fun but maybe be boring after u have done everything.great game though :d",245.8
"warframe is a great game, it has so much to only be in beta. i cant wait to see what the devs have in store for us next.",165.2
"i was short on money and was looking for a game that was f2p and thats when i saw warframe. i thought it looked pretty cool and similar to destiny. ive only had the game for a week and have already spen 30+ hours playing it. the game has lots of options for playstyle with different warframes. only drawback is that it takes a while to farm the mats required to build them, as well as the blueprints. though you can also pay to get them (im just cheap). though there is a grind to it, the levels can be really quick so it makes it really easy to hop in and do something and not be there a long time.",86.4
"awesome game i like how it is but it seems glitchy to me",3.0
"beautiful and fast paced with the added effect of slaughtering hundreds of enemies without really having to think about it. its fun. the different frames give the game an added variety along with the weapons.",34.2
"fun little action-shooty-time waster with gorgeous graphics and awesome animation. entirely free to play, though with the quality of what the game offers i never felt ripped off buying slots for the killer badass weapons i was able to acquire. quite entertaining and worth the price of admission.",1236.0
"by now i have hundreds of hours in warframe and i can confidently say that it is a great game... if you dont mind grind. oh my god the grind. it isnt new spiral knights level grind, but it is not uncommon to run missions for hours for a single rare mod that drops from one type of enemy. but the gameplay is pretty solid, the game looks great, and the devs are more than willing to listen to the community about things that need changing or fixing. content is regularly being added and de does its best to keep the community involved and in the loop (including letting the fans compete to design weapons). overall, 8/10 because it just keeps pulling me back in.",1056.7
"fun game thats not your average run of the mill free to play,very fun.",64.4
"beautiful graphics. just make yourself a macro for the necessary grind. aside from that its good to grind. and more grind. also, there is grinding. plus numbers to grind. all the grinding you could want in a trippleeee aaa titleeee.",263.0
"recommend this game cause you can have plane like ufo and you can make item from blue print",50.4
"first ever online multi-player game that made me to play for hours. this game delivers smooth game-play with enjoyable game modes.",634.8
"great game, excellent graphics and gameplay, but theres one problem. what the  is going on?! the developers did an absolutely nightmare job on explaining what each thing does.",6.1
"you are a tenno. what is a tenno? nobody really knows. all they see is the suit. the warframe. beautiful and deadly. an instrument of war and destruction. you are awaken, weak and powerless, with no memory of who or what you are. vay hek, leader of the grineer, the genetically modified mechanically enhanced remnants of humanity, is after you. he wants to harness the power of your warframe to fuel his campaign for galaxy wide domination. you cannot defeat him. you must escape. if you somehow manage to elude vay hek, and escape into the depths of the dark and unforgiving galaxy, you might just encounter other lost and memoryless frames. perhaps your race has a chance for survival. as you explore the galaxy, you are guided by a mysteriously entity known only as lotus. for reasons unknown, lotus has taken an interest in the tenno, and appears to be on your side. for now. your mission: disrupt the three dominant powers of the galaxy through terrorist missions and guerrilla warfare. amass the most powerfull and exotic weapons and frames known to galactic life. discover the mysteries of the galaxy, and the secrets of the tenno race. if you can do all this, maybe there is hope after all. rating 10/10 and my favourite game",367.6

"very good game i would play it for countless hours if real life didnt barge in.",34.9
"this is the only game where i can run through a wall and die after falling 1000m. elevators work too.",295.9
"awesome gameplay. the items and weapons are a tad expensive, but its great for a free to play.",6.1
"awesome combat, good action.... steep price tag on all items. you cant buy anything with in game currency.",51.7
"not the biggest fan of multiplayers, mobas pvp and all that stuff.. but this game has mojo",148.2
"i can, without a doubt, certainly say, that warframe, is okay. better than most tps/co-op games out there, plus its f2p, so its worth it. but, its still only okay. great with friends, but otherwise... dont bother. get friends to play with you or dont play at all.",0.3
"great game. i used to play it early back in the day of its release year, and so much has changed since then. i find the game more fun now.",5.0
"this is a great game to play with friends co-op i like the way you can pretty much play the game in your own style but complete the same objective as your friend for example your friend can go trigger happy but you can go stealth and hide in the shadows",29.8
"absolutely raises the bar in the free to play category. graphics are smooth, contemporary and optimized. gameplay equally so. unlike most games in the f2p genre, this one is considerably generous. cosmetic add-ons aside, the game gives you everything you need - free. modifications, weapons, in-game currency, and even warframes. kudos to the developers, although they almost certainly still make a buttload of dough. nothing about this game forces players to pay-to-win. if youre willing to spend real cash, thats your choice. at least give it a go. itll cost you nothing but your time.",43.5
"a 3rd person shooter with melee elements, i highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys a good shooter/arpg hybrid.",261.3
"i went into warframe thinking itd just be another orion: dino horde. ...after about 6 hours of nonstop gameplay, a lack of a need to purchase in-game items with real money, jumping into bulletfest after bulletfest, and an utter addiction to being a proper freakin gun-and-sword-weilding space ninja, i said otherwise.",41.4
"awsome game get it soon!!! [loading times are slow but it makes sense!]",15.5
"quite good. i like and enjoy grinding as it hardly gets tiring and most of the time has you being forced to interact with other players. nice visual design too, but i think limbo with the top hat... i think thats going to far.",27.8
"they should add skateboards for all the grinding you do",523.3
"one of the greatest f2p games out there, especially if youre all about space.",2.4
"i literally hit a paywall. free to play my left  cheek. its only free to play if you have friends that can help you run through the hard missions early to get enough resources to start building weapons. if youre lucky. youll have to end up paying them for weapon and warframe slots unless you want hours upon hours of grinding to go to waste, so no, this isnt f2p, its pay to win, like everything else out there. as fun as this game is, youre gonna spend your life working towards a weapon that youll end up selling later anyway, so why bother? 8/10 would be so much better if there was no inventory slot paywall.",131.6
"i do really like this game first i thought you could only get weapons and new things if you payed but when i came further and further in the game i saw blueprints which you could make the stuff with other items you get from killing bosses / survivaling and i already came pretty far in the game and its really fun tho",41.4
"shocked that mt stock 3 year old pc can play this game. fun co-op",18.0
"is pretty fun actually, give it a go if you like them fast-paced shoot em up games",136.4
"lots of fun, and probably the only game where its fun to grind. great trade community also, with constant content updates. this game is not pay2win.",117.9
"ok so there was a person who only had 8-9 hours in this...just to clarify pros: graphics gameplay controls story voice acting mixture of shooting and melee combat feeling badass flipping off walls and chopping dudes up cons: not enough hours in the day to play might destroy relationship/marriage could cause loss of feeling in  might cause loss of friends 10/10",426.8
"warframe is a f2p game that, for once, is done well. you are tenno, one ancient sci-fi race or another, that gives you an excuse to bring an overlarge knife to a gunfight- and win. there is pvp, though most of your time will be spent pve, slaughtering hordes of enimies, shoot em up style. through this, you will gain xp to level up your guns, melee weapons and armour suit, as well as mods to further enhance them. paying money is not neccecary to win or progress, though you can use it if you so desire. graphically, the game looks pretty. its not going to blow you away, and id appreciate some more aa, but its great for what it is. and it also allows it to run on lower-tier pcs, which is always good. warframe is a great way to unwind after a stressful day, as you clear out an enture room by yourself.",47.9
"im sorry but once again warframe has failed me. why you might ask? well heres the thing:since my last review i said that it did some mayor improvements and it did. but then i came back to a mayor problem:getting bored of my weapons/warframe and trying to get new stuff,but not being able to buy/craft anything aka it costs way too much ingame money. first you have to spit up 20000 credits(which is one of the cheaper ones)and then you need to pay another 20000 credits to craft it. and all the materials arent even available yet in the beginning. so you might say:well then go do some frikkin grinding and progressing so you can get those materials. mayby,but i dont wanna spend the first 20 hours of gameplay on grinding. the phrase ninjas play free is wrong,for you to have fun in experimenting with different loadouts the best way is to just spend real money on it. ps.the game is laggy as  final opinion:the key moments of your game are at the start,so that way you can win a gamers heart and make them keep playing the game,this is not something these people got. i am sorry but you could not win over my heart once again,mayby in another year of updates whil you get it right.",16.4
"this game is awesome and everyone should at least give it a shot. it is free after all.",130.3
"similar to dead space type. much awesome such graphics so addicted  wow",44.4
"this game makes me want to yell: settlements! settlements! settlements!",165.5
"great idea. lots of different game styles combined into a bit darker masseffect-like sci fi action. unfortunately the fact that the game is for free is very obvious. not well optimized, lots of glitches, non-clear interface. a lot of potential but needs better code and a director which will intrigue players with some better story - its not very interesting.",6.4
"faming simulator with guns.. no quests, no goal, just grinding, crafting and waiting days for things to be done.",14.6
"i deeply enjoy the gameplay, being able to play with groups of players. but there is one problem bugging me this whole time ive been playing. im often the one inviting people to my games, rather than others inviting me in, which leads me to being the one always inviting them in. so the thing is, i often play with my bro alongside me.. and wed play together.. just not too frequently in the same matches now, due to one problem. me being unable to join his game, or even of those from other people, unless im going for the mission myself and am involved in the squad when i join it. you cant pick squads, and some areas are unable to be accessed cause my bro is hooked and hes of a max rank compared to me now, so he has more unlocked. and this results in this border where we stick to the lower levels if we wanted to play together. i dont know if this has occurred to anyone else but it seems to work fine for most. i just hope they fix it for me. i dont want my experience ruined cause of this.",170.9
"one of the more unique games on the pc. brings a lot of new concepts and ideas to have a player-friendly enviorment. it has some cool thoughts, and is executed in a great state! it is an amazing game. i say get it before it starts costing money. once it does cost money, i would still suggest buying it, however i wouldnt say go over 75$. its too good to be free, so get it before a price comes out. -ryan",166.2
"i could write essays about this game but instead ill go ahead and recommend it, its actually one of my best f2p games on steam(86/100)",72.8
"only played a very little amount of this game but already i know what happens if you mix mass effect with destiny. this game has been widely reviewed to be better than both so if you enjoyed either of those games, youll probably love this.",6.6
"warframe is essentially a grind-fest with fantastic gameplay and visuals. it borrows heavily from diablo-style loot drops, although none of this is explained in-game. i recommend using a wiki if you fall in love with this game, as it has a suprisingly deep character customization set, though dont expect to get much visual upgrades as most of the mods that drop function essentially like a mmo-talent tree. lots of fun, but bring friends if you plan on sticking around.",51.6
"two nincompoops made me play it but its an ok game though.",4.7
"very fun third person shooter! i have greatly enjoyed the game style. its perfect for playing with friends since it doesnt quite matter what missions youre on, you can always jump in and help your buddy, even if youre rediculously underleveled and only serves as a momentary distraction for the enemies. there has been some technical difficulties, but that comes with a game that is still in beta. also very great for people who want to play free. almost all content is accessible for free players but, of course, there are a couple perks for anyone willing to pay. all in all, a marvelous game!",521.3
"only worth playing if you have a full team (4 people) with you. otherwise, dont play it since you will die a lot.",3.3

"always getting black screen at startup :c someone please help also i will keep hating this game until i find a solution... edit:now the game fixed its awesome!!",75.3
"fast paced action or completely stealth. its up to you and thats what makes this game so wonderful. the degree of customization for your warframe allows for many of the same to exist and still be light years apart from one another. i recommend this game if youre into action packed games and have also dabbled into first person shooters.",27.1
"probably one of the best free to play games out right now. and those graphics! they are amazing. good work.",18.2
"i think this is a really good game, infact one of my top 5 list. my only advice if you want to get this game is dont leave it for too long because you will be left out quite alot",335.4
"overal this is a decent game but itdefinatly could use some work add me if you want to discuss it further in depth.",492.1
"awesomeness in its true form. the best f2p game ive ever played. i would not lie and say that it isnt a complex game, but it is its complexity and variety of possible ways to play that makes this game as beautiful as it is. not to mention these guys are the best devs ive ran into my entire life. keep up the good work, de",1051.5
"if you have a good gaming pc i recommend this game but in my opinion it is waste of time",16.5

"i loved this game look at my f#king hours! but in all seriousness its pretty damn awesome excluding the slight repetitiveness but you can oversee that while youre hacking and slashing or if youre a normal person shooting is good too. not to mention the game is not a p2w you can get everything excluding cosmetic and slots but that shouldnt stop you go download this game right now.",743.6
"you new update cause me to crash 10 times and i cant play",50.1
"beware that once you start playing youll get hooked. every warframe has its own unique abilities and powers. new content is always being added and which is why this game never gets boring, keep in mind that crafting weapons could take a long time if you dont want to spend money on purchasing platnium. for tougher missions its always best to have other friends help you out but overall its a great game.",121.5

"ive tried to play, but the game keeps freezing in the launcher... ive tried downloading it straight from the website, and it gave an error login failed. check your info. i tried making a new account, deleting the certificates and re-installing them, all the known fixes, but to no avail. i am downloading it now, off steam again, and hopefully it wont freeze at the launcher.",0.3

"this game has you playing as ****ing space ninjas with shotguns. is there anything left to say? i would think not.",60.8
"warframe is a great free to play third person shooter with back to back action, amazing graphics, and many hours of play time. there are three major races to battle against having many different types of enemies for each race. in warframe you will team up with other players and, fight together in battle. not a team player go solo and, wage your own war. no matter if you are a spy, soldier, or mercenary for hire, slash, cut and shoot your way through space. and always remember ninjas are awsome!",18.7
"ever since the mesa update, my warframe would not allow me to join any games with other people. everytime i join a game, it tells me that the  connection to the multiplayer host has been lost. all i am able to do is play games by myself. i recommend this game to eveybody but this is the only problem.",411.3
"its a fun actioner that you can play mindlessly if you want to blow off steam, but with plenty of crafing and levelling to keep me fiddling around! i definitely enjoy its co-op nature.",170.0
"why wouldnt you enjoy being a space ninja with guns that can slide in awesome ing poses?",22.0
"10/tenno would repeatedly die at the wall climbing tutorial again....",11.6
"a very enjoyable fast-paced shooter (when played with others). with the option of stealthy slow solo play as well. some repetitive maps and scenarios but still with enough variation to not feel grindy (until youre trying to get something specific to drop). can be played entirely free but a little cash injection certainly can boost the fun.",827.2
"too grindy. you have to wait a long time to get a vital thing, weapons, more characters and a lot of other things. plus, i hate third person shooters!",66.4
"a veary good and well made game but i have one thing to say. please bring stealth back. by this i mean the game seems veary un stealth like and the game is kind of inplementing the ninja so not tank like. there are only 2 classes that use acctualy stealth abllities and most weapons are realy tank like. its annoying when im trying to kill enimies undetected and my teamates are just running in gun-a-blazen. so please add more stealth like warframe and weapons.",157.5
"i swear i thought i made a review for this already. guess not.. anyways! this gem of a f2p is the most spectacular f2ps ive played in a really long time! 10/10 - graphics 10/10 - gameplay (not pvp) 10/10 - playerbase (most people are over 14) the devs push out a lot of content on a very regular basis.",267.0

"the monetization in the last few updates makes the game almost p2w (or pay 2 not play since grind = content). shallow gameplay, broken promises and horrendous decisions made by the developers make this game unbearable. avoid at all costs. the time i have put into this game is my poor attempt at trying to get value for money since i bought a founder package, still feel i have been ripped off.",600.6

"n!ce looking game, great graphics for a free to play game but as i always say free to play does not necessarily mean free as there is always a catch ie, buying dlc packs at a greater expense than a aaa top of the table game that you would on average pay 30.00 for. but there is always one free to play out of them all that will be worth installing and playing without actually purchasing all the expensive add-ons that one needs to win or play most of the time. this game is one of those free to play exemptions... worth downloading and playing even just for killing some time with nice graphics :)",2.4

"in terms of free to play, this game does an excellent job at it. the amount of time and effort they have put into making this game does pay it well. there is always stuff to do it, it is never a dull, the cooperative system is amazingly executed. the choice and variety of warframes, weapons and sentinels make it you can never get bored of it. the lore and the design of the enemy are amazing.",416.4

"finally feeling like a ninja with the melee overhaul. pros + good graphics (some low res textures here and there though) + lots of customization (even without $$$ as you can trade parts for premium money) + huge playerbase + lots of updates + quick loading times + melee is a real combat option! (feels like a different game) neutral * archwing is nice but needs more mixing with normal gameplay like in the first aw-mission. cons - only a few quests - unbalanced weapons and powers - still a huge grindfest - rng item farming warframe has lured me back with the new updates and i guess its a nice timesink. score: 70/100 improved a lot over the years.",241.5
"everyone is different, even our opinion. i really enjoy this game even if it could be titled as boring by others due the amount of grinding you will need to do to obtain a new weapon, warframe, upgrade your current one or get a mod and upgrade that. and the best thing in this game is if you just want to spend 10 minutes before you go out with your mates or wait for someone, then you can play for only 10 minutes but if you want to spend your whole day, you can play in this way as well and it will be rewarding if you do it well. the only problem with the game is the hosting issues. i havent got a bad internet at all, but im unable to host because everyone will have terrible lag and there is many disconnects and it can be really depressing when you spent 45 minutes in a t4 survival or you were at the 40th wave in odd (if you start to play, you will learn these thing quickly) and you will be dropped back to the menu (which is your ship and looks awesome) losing everything you were fighting for. except this thing, the warframe is a brilliant game. give it a try!",450.2

"after the update 14 the game has a few bugs, but im sure theyll fix it in 2.0. they need to fix it where uninstalling mods during fusion wont freeze the game. fixing the kubrow quest because even if you get an egg it doesnt allow you to hatch it, and you cant get another egg since you already have one. also the combat system for the kubrows since they suck, so they need to fix that too. other than that this game is quite nice, it is a fun game, and i think ill give it 8/10 maybe giving armor to the kubrows, and fixing those bugs and the combat system for the pets.",26.0
"alright, theres a lot to tell with this review. warframe is a good game. it has good lore and okay mechanics. the graphics are appealing and the design is good lookin. there are also downsides here however. the maps are very repetetive and can get boring. the games difficulty is too much for beginning players who havent mastered the game. the biggest problem though, are the paywall limitations. you start off extremely limited. only a few inventory slots and a few warframe slots until you pay. now of course, you can barter with otherf players for platinum piece by piece but that takes days just to get 5$ of platinum, unless you grind for hours. once you get good at warframe, its insanely fun though. 9/10, would pwn in space for hours at a time.",750.7
"warframe is simply one of the best games i have ever played. i dont know what else to say. there are always new things to learn about the universe and new items and mods (upgrades) to strive for! the devs update the game at least once a week, but on average there are two or three updates per week that add new content, bug fixes and adjustment. this game has a very shallow learning curve and is easy to get into, then the challenge is always great! 730 hours in and i only took two breaks from warframe that only lasted about a week each. not even starting to get bored of it yet! i love warframe and best of all: everything in it can be gotten with not a single payment . this is not pay to win, but the option to pay is always present as a time-saver.",1244.5

"warframe is game that makes other fps look inferior, its supposedly set in the future, where tenno soldiers fight grineer marines, for absolutely no unkown reason ; possibly the soverignity of the solar system. the game is also supported by microtransactions via steam. dlc from the game is ridiculous, the more you pay, the more stronger and better you are, but unless you actually put in time and effort to get the same results as the p2winners. overall, warframe can be naturally seen as a fps and p2w game, this game actually seemed more new, unlike the other modern-day fps like black ops. although the game can be seen as a p2w, rarely any time and effort needs to be put in to acquire better eqiupment since materials for blueprints are fairly easy to get. i rate this 7/10 or 70%",50.6

"with a great assortment of weapons and warframes to choose from warframe can certainly give you a lot of playtime as you explore the solar system. it was the first game i have ever played which made me want to spend the money on it rather than finding ways to wring it out of my pockets. the development teams is great but after having invested over 400 hours of fun gameplay you do tend to lose interest. overall a wonderful free to play game, definately worth your time to try. it does have a steep learning curve so bring a friend who knows or look at the wiki, that is being worked on but for the moment its your best friend.",1099.3

"feels like a third-person co-op a la kill all the enemies and win. left 4 dead comes to mind when thinking of ways to describe this, but thats immature, since im sure a lot of games before it and this one have done the same formula; the same can be said of all genres of video game. despite that, the designs are pretty neat, and the fact that the tenno suits are skin-tight give the females a very alluring look, coupled with random technological protrusions that sometimes scream fashion disaster. all-in-all, a fun online hack-n-slash for quick bursts, but suffers from the plague of microtransactions and dlc if you want to get into it seriously. cant really recommend it, unfortunately, but dont want to turn it down.",11.8

"this game is super fun and addictive the fisrt 100 hours. there is so much content its crazy for a f2p game. thats the reason i give it the thumbs up, it gave me an awesome experienc for so long. later though, i want to do more missions that are pretty deep in the maps. i cant do them alone and i the problem is that no one is doing them. its so frustrating not being able to do any missions that you need to do late in the game. its because there are so many missons to do on so many planets that finding a player doing the exact same mision at the exact sametime is nearly immpossible. its extremely awnnoying but it wont happen at first because all the new players are doing the missions you need to do.",335.5

"its a good game, and the model makes sense, but the biggest problem is the 24h wait time for mastery ranks. i went for my first test, and the game went to black screen with a big please wait circle for about 15 mins. i finally shut down the game and when i came back it said i have to wait 24h. the devs had no reason to add this game mechanic because its not as if you can even play cash to simply pass on the time and try again. its simply there to  with you. i give this game 5/10 for the simple fact that the devs are . very uncanadian of you.",101.7

"warframe has great graphics, good controls for doing lots of parkour, heaps of levels and tons of  to find. these things make it one of the best free to play games ive ever played. although.... it trys to prromote teamwork,but finding a group is can be a nightmare sometimes and then once you do there is hardly any co-ordination, communication or teamwork involved. it seems that you just go with other players to finish harder levels because their really hard solo. there is also an extreme variety of warframes each with its own play style and powers and lots of weapons with different stats. however almot all of these require premium credits which can almost never be found in the actual game, which makes it all seem pay2win and then buying the blueprints requires you to spend hours searching planets for all the parts and then extra time to actually craft the item.",0.6
"the upsides are simple: this games aesthetic is amazing; tenno look cool, everything they do looks cool, player actions and stuff are cool, and dome helmets. the story is ambiguous enough to be open to whatever players interpretive powers might allow and it doesnt get in the way. you have guns and you shoot things, you have swords and you hit things. navigation is almost never an issue and teamwork is smooth and easy. pace is generally pretty fast and thus things dont get stale as quickly. the downsides are also simple: buggy as hell. this being free to play, everything that isnt basic xy or z costs dollars or a lot of time, especially aesthetic stuff. grinding is not too bad but still present. networking can be awful at times, and occasionally nonexistant. teamwork is not a necessity, having a team is, as the game doesnt seem to be balanced even remotely for less than the typical complement of 4 players without being laughably easy.",104.5
"you can jump on walls make back flips and do some ninja  , its awesome!",181.7
"this game is fun and very action packed but lacks variety, most levels have you running around slicing bad guys and occasionaly a slightly stronger foe (a boss). i would say that this games strongest point is the co-op, you can have great fun with a couple or even one friend. the combat system is satisfying and bloody but can get a bit repetitive (shoot him, slice him, shoot him, slice him). there are plenty of collectables in this game but it is largely pay to win. however it is free to play and gave me plenty of enjoyable hours. overall i would give this game a 7/10",4.9

"i play this on the ps4 and just wanted to leave a review on here. in short, yes it is a grind if you want to keep playing for free and still get good items, but it is highly addictive. where destiny was limited, short, sometimes too difficult and not that much fun for me, warframe makes up for it. warframe is basically a more feature rich version of destiny. however be warned, if you dont want to play for free, it is very expensive. some of the packages cost double that of a normal game, and buying in game credits is obscene. but, that hasnt mattered for me. ive won enough items and levels through grinding on free play to keep me interested. highly recommend.",0.1
"the initial grind may seem unappealing for this game, but if you can endure it just a little then the many oppurtunities and customizations of the game can give many, many more hours of enjoyment. the clan system also works effectively when combined with dedicated players to add group driven research and progression that unlocks even more unique weapons. regular updates with new and unique weapons continue to add to the games huge variety, allowing you to customize your style and play the type of space ninja badass you want to play. gear up with a couple of friends and play this game!",410.9

"warframe is a 3rd-person, part parkour, shooter-rpg hybrid where the name of the game is level-grinding and getting your warframes (classes) to be the best. this game has been in free open beta for well over a year now (something pretty rare these days), and the devs show no signs of slowing down. the atmosphere is incredibly erie, the boss battles are serious challenges, and its great fun to just be a badass, gun-wielding, super-powered, alien space ninja. it rarely gets more awesome than this. theres also a wikia site that is chock full of info for beginners and veterans alike that will hold answers to all of your questions. however, despite trying to inject a story in here, the game just isnt quite ready for it, and you wont care for it after 2 hours of gameplay. theres no obvious track of continuity here, so whatever story elements there are, theyre all over the place and confusing at best. the game can also be a graphical strain for those with less-than perfect computers with all the patches its gotten over the years. the store was also fully functional before the most basic of texture pop-ins were resolved, but this has since been corrected. you want a fun way to pass the time and feel like youve earned your rewards? get this game and you wont regret it.",68.0

"the game offers more then alot of content for a free to play, the melee and ranged combat are stylishly combined and the randomly rearranged levels, bosses and random events makes the game maintain my attention for the long hours, you can join a clan for even more features but i will admit i had to spend money to keep my interest in the game but after the awesome space ninja combat fun i had with the game for 30 or so hours i felt like the game deserved my money. this game will be fun for you it is just up to you if you will take advantage of all that it offers (for free) that will determine how long it keeps you interested, the best way to play is with friends but the online co-op works well enough. update: its been a few updates since i played, the new content is very cool and the ship hub is a great system but once you have made it to the point in the game where you have rank 30 (max) gear the game does become a massive grind for mods, money and resources that being said you only reach that point after many hours of a fun great free to play and there is still plenty of content to explore. positives: great gameplay, mixture of melee and shooting, parkour and abilities many locations, mission types and randomized maps customization of all of your stuff negatives: mod system is still a headache at first grind gaming after a while",253.7

"in this game i liked almost everything but the thing who dodent make it 100/00 good for me is the price of platinium it is very expensive no like the other games like lol or wow.this is my opinion.",12.5
"one of the most boring and  games ever. its so grindy that it ought to be criminal, unless youre a millionare dont bother with this strictly pay2notgrind game. all the ninja feels go out the window, the tilesets and the enemies are all the sames, you literally have like 7 enemy models, the lore is almost non-existent, its not going to be any better because the majoriy share in de is chinese, and you know what penny pinchers they are.",336.4
"ive heard lots of good things about this game and i was dying to try it! but unfortunatley, some update content cant be downloaded from the servers! so yeah... i cant play the actual game which is fun all in itself! but i would hope other people have better luck.",1.2
"pretty slick 3rd person shooter. definitely worth the money ;p, but the grind is a bit much for me, but might be right for you. i really enjoyed leveling up my first mech/warframe, and i enjoyed leveling up my next one, but after that man it was like realzzzzzz",110.0
"very fun online co-op, very difficult for singleplayer. its alot more fun when youre playing with friends as opposed to strangers though. concept-wise/story-wise, its pretty unique and fascinating, as alot of the backstory is left for the player to interpret. gameplay wise, its a very cool third person shooter and thirdperson melee experience, with special abilities for each individual warframe. although it uses microtransactions, these are non-essential, and more or less just allow easier/faster access to items you could get through gameplay otherwise. ive been playing since closed beta, and ive watched the game grow and change but have yet to see a change i cannot stand. they seem to update frequently and patch as needed, and have yet to come up with a solid reason to be disappointed by the game or anything in it.",396.3
"this game looks fun, but, its not. number 1. laggy for people with macs, number 2. you have to push 1 2 3 and 4 to use powers. and you cannot change it. number 3. hard.",24.4
"warframe is fun, but not without strings attached. whether or not you enjoy yourself is entirely dependant on your circumstances. if you have the money to burn on platinum (and you will definitely need more than a few dollars), you can get right in the thick of things with a couple of different warframes, and some swagtastic weaponry. everything is priced extraordinarily high, but if you have the means, this is definitely the way you want to play. if, however, you think youll be able to fight the incredible grind without dropping real coin, theres fun to be had, but your time is most likely better spent elsewhere.",24.6
"do you like grinding and waiting? do you have enough money to buy a small island? then definatly download warframe, youll do nothing but grind for hours apon hours of you life away trying to get parts for blue prints for better weaponry, most of the time youll need to craft other resources with the resources you gathered. then and heres the best part /you have to wait 24 hours to get that item/ or maybe more. while you do all this youll need to join a clan too. whats that you dont like clans? tough , you want nice things you absolutly have to join a clan who will tax you, take your resources to build their dojo, and your hard earned cash. but dont worry, cyborg ninjas with clunky controls and crappy targeting from a 3rd person view will make it all worth while. dont get this game, it is a bigger black hole for money and time then team fortress 2 which is a ing achievement in of itself.",180.2
"magic, swords, guns and free running... oh and did i mention free to play? warframe is an intense third person shooter where you hack, slash and utterly destroy any opposition standing in your way. the squad based pve (player vs enemy) combat system is a refreshing take on the multiplayer third person shooter platform that pits you up against many formidable foes including the alien grineers, infected scourge and robotic fleets in objective based missions spanning from extermination to extraction. the only downside to the game however, as with most f2ps (free to play) is the missions can become a bit repetitive and 90% of the weapons and other upgrades must be purchase. so if youre looking for a game to blow off some steam with some epic sword waving, gun toting, action packed combat, then warframe is the game for you! oh the carnage! 7/10",30.5
"this truly is the best game i ever played. its a third-person shooter and very fun, because its not killing other people instead you kill a.i. in different levels and missions. the co-op oriented gameplay is very appealing to me and has many benefits to it, than the traditional pvp games. if you like something different and unique, i would recommend this game to these who do. this is a 10 out of 10 for me.",6.9
"a good game, and there is some real fun to be had however it is so buggy and unstable that it just ruins the experience. it becomes really annoying when you are getting higher levels and really need to finish a level and it glitches out all the damned time. so in its current state, i couldnt reccomend this game.",104.7
"didnt keep me hooked for long enough. and i will have you know for a picky and judgmental gamer like me, that is quite a bad sign. the long updates, the scific setting rip-off, the mediocre community ratings. convince me otherwise, but plenty of other fishes out in the sea to waste my time/energy/attention with.",4.1

"this is a great game with amazing graphics for a free game but its so hard to get a team member ;-; pros free game! (yass!) great graphics (i mean amazing!) great controls (wish you can change it thought :/ ) good theme (the story line is actual interesting) combat is fantastic (the system is pretty fair) its playable for the people who doesnt want to spend money. (not like other free games :) wish i can say the same for other free games ;-;) cons you play this game by yourselff most of the time becasue almost nobody will play with you and its really difficult to beat the level by yourself because its meant for co-op. (its makes me rage! because its overly difficult sometimes and i feel lonely ;-;) let there be a easier way to get platinum plz! (i spend my on a skin when i thought it was a weapon!)",39.3

"addictive gameplay, yet somewhat annoying if you decide to avoid platinum purchases and grind for recipes/components which could take a significant amount of time. other than that - beautiful picture (at least on my gtx670m), adrenaline action.",63.3
"an interesting game so far.its based on teamwork,which is crucial in this game.you cant simply go rambo on enemies like call of duty,cause you would get gangraped.you also need tactics,such as sneaking and covering behind objects.i reccomend it and wait more people to come play with me.",69.4
"overall, i highly recommend warframe. i like the whole space ninja aesthetic of this game. the developers did a good job of making something original. there are some valid criticisms to the complexity of the game, but at least there is a great wiki and good developer support. the developers are constantly adding new content, which can actually be a little bit overwhelming at times, but theres always new stuff to do. the developers are involved with the community, and are generally fast with the bug fixes. did i mention the bugs? theres new bugs with every update, but most of it is minor stuff that gets fixed quickly. platinum: you can spend large amounts of real world money on the premium currency and end up with very little to show for it. however, if you are smart about how you spend platinum, you can avoid some of the early-game grinding and get some fun cosmetic items as well. warframe is certainly not a pay-to-win game, but at some point youre really going to need some plat. if you dont want to spend real money, you can get all of the plat youll ever need through in-game trades. i have most of the cosmetic stuff, 90% of the weapons, and all of the warframes, but i only purchased $25 of plat when i first started playing.",779.7
"fantastic game, im absolutly addicted so much so that its causing problens, oh wait im supposed to be doing homwork right now ****. if you dont play this than i dont know what else your doing but you should be playing this instead.",528.8
"hell of a fun in co-op mode or even single player..public doesnt really work that well because most of the random players got a bad connection. you start from a space ship hub where you can unlock different planets to travel, new warframes, weapons or companions. on the planets you fight simple enemies in similar levels but hey, you can walljump and... chop enemies in two pieces while sliding 10/10!!!!! :d",18.2
"great game, especially for a f2p. you dont need spend money to enjoy or advance in this game, everythings pretty much available through plans to assemble items and mats are quite easily farmed in game. varied missions and goals, mobs, and boss fights. the addictive part is leveling your character and its weapons.",345.1
"this game can be lots of fun once you get past your initial warframe and have at least one orokin reactor and one orokin catalyst. it is free to play and anything can be made with a good clan dojo. you are a space ninja fighting in our solar system against the corpus the grineer and the infestation (much like the flood in halo). you have shields armor weapons and modifications to outfit yourself and goto town on the maps. good gear comes from the doing void missions and orokin derelict missions.",184.2

"a repetitive grind fest but yet still fun. a lot of different warframes classes and weapons seem to help keep it interesting. i would recommend it for some good mindless fun/killing.",61.8

"1 mission in, i was hooked. its the fastest game of its type that i have played. far faster than titan fall, far faster than vindictus. its fast. there are some bugs with the update 14, over 3/4 of which were fixed within 2 days of the release. i can see the devs care about the game, updates are coming fast and often, and the game is just beautiful to play, and beautiful to look at. in no other game, have i ever seen so much teamwork.",414.2

"this game is downright frustrating and boring. the gameplay is repetative, and after the prologue, there is no way or indication for you to know where youre supposed to go next. the only way i imagien this gam to be any fun is if you step in with your friends, and start at the same time. because any experienced player will just bombard you with information you dont understand, thanks to the system surrounding upgrades and leveling being so confusing. and not to mention my experience with random matchmaking. more often than not, i see two or three high-level blips on my radar, because i get to see them up close twice. once on level start as they run off, and once at the level exit, where they wait for me when they have murdered everything that moved. frustratingly complicated systems and no guidance or hint to what level mission to choose, as well as the pairing with high-level players make this game incredebly frustrating for now players. all in all, overly complicated game mechanics and a verry unclear dificulty curve surrounding a repetative core gameply, more resembling of grinding than a fast pace shooter, combine to make this a boring and frustrating game.",17.3

"good co-op 3rd person shooter. graphic is good enough for a free to play game. games mechanic is a bit hard to learn, but youll get the hang of it soon enough. the action during missions is often fast paced and some of them are a real challenge. i would eecommend this game to those who like dead space mixed with some mmorpg mechanics (farming loot, craft better equip, etc.) not recommended for those who dislike farming and crafting",120.4
"play this if you like running, gunning, swinging a weapon, doing flips, and using special powers warframe might fill the void. while the gamplay is fun it is definitly a freenium, you can work for a $5 dollar item by continously grounding for hours and some times days, then wait for hours to days for the item to be constructed. its only a shame when you done this work for a sub-par machine gun or a frame you arent particulary fond of so i reccomend looking up what thing does what. levels/enivoronments look nice and rooms are randomly generated so youll start to see the same environments after awhile. while the bosses are varied and vary in terms of annoyance, enemy types are few inbetween with gun guys and melee guys and robots. despite some of those issues you can have fun without spending a dime. it is especially fun, and in some casses neccessary to have a friend(s) to tag along on missions depending on what frame you/they are using. i played significantly less on account of the endless grinding and me being satisfied with the weapon/frame i already have but it was fun little distraction that is free to play while it lasted.",89.3

"i remember trying this game a while ago and not finding it my type of game. something about it just didnt click (possibly the weird art style). then my friend told me to give it another try, and with this second try i got hooked. at first glance it looks like a simple run n gun game, but it is much more than that. one of my favorite parts of this game is how modding works. many weapons seem average at first but once you know how to mod them correctly, they become unstoppable. and then the fun starts. fully auto shotguns with higher fire rate than most assault rifles, grenades that explode into toxic/electric/fire/younameit aoe, and bows that shoot 2 arrows at a time, explode when they hit and also pin enemies to walls (but not before cutting them in half). you really can get crazy with stuff in this game and i cant wait to see what they come up with next. game is also regularly updated with an amazing and helpful community.",291.8
"to kill time, 10/10 would play. its only fun if you play with friends you trust and know. but if youre tolerant to others, thats fine as well. solos also good but happiness would always be short-lived in this game. also a good game to screw around~",1010.7
"even though this game is extemely boring, takes forever to accomplish things, derives you from your money. its still a pretty fun game once you are at a high sequence in the game.",29.4
"epic gameplay, massive updates, who doesnt want to play this game?? the first time i played it, it does feel a little bit dull, but now, it is awesome, like, really awesome!! those who likes to play 3rd shooter better try this game.. it will definitely, blow you to space! :)",37.9
"this game is amazing but it does require allot of things like crafting upgrading selling making buying all that stuff and you have to know how to play for it to be fun its no call of duty but trust me this game is awesome highly recommended for players of the 3rd person si fi",55.2
"its okay, but its not groundbreaking. some weapons require platinum, and you pretty much dont get any without buying some. also, the level design is repeated and makes you feel like you are playing the same thing over and over.",22.7
"its an overall good game, but the grinding in the game is just insane. its like gaben just gave up on the game. me: oh allmighty lord gaben, please give me a blessing gaben: what kind of blessing? me: i want that really cool sword gaben: oh okay, it will take u.. about 132 hours of intense grinding! me: but gaben... gaben: np, i know im to friendly, but u deserve it me: but... gaben: now go out and farm! me: ok... 132 hours later. me: were is my sword?",1021.1

"pros: + fun gameplay for a while + good graphics cons: - seeing the same levels gets boring after a while - grinding fest to get new weapons to get grinding - try to rank up once per day -------- devs give absolutely no  if players have fun playing, as long as theyre wallets get fatter. you can craft weapons, or warframes, but it will take 12 - 72 hours to finish crafting, or you can pay to boost it, if you ever get the items for it. you dont? well pay to get better drops. pay for this, pay for that.",25.7
"interesting, but gets boring real quick. has your standard unlockables. give it a try, but dont expect playing it for verry long...",2.9
"let me clean my self, if u dont play warframe because it is not game like cod youre a dummy. warframe is solid f2p game with amaing gameplay thx to damage 2.0 and melee 2.0 wich are awesome upgrades because you can go and use a katana only wich has 80 slash- 20 impact- and 20 puncture damage wich is a perfect anti infeasted weapon but its weak vs corpus and grineer . best thing is that all op weapons etc are availeble for no extra costs like 10 bucks for some platinium.....all things that can improve your gameplay are availeble trough out foundry....only customization things like syndana, camos etc are exclusief for platinium. this game deserves the title of best f2p or even best game of 2014 and ratings 10 out of 10 for sure, after playing first time 8 months ago, until now, its not boring :d",161.3

"this game is by far one of the best games i have played i dont normally care for shooter games i like racing games and open world games that pretty much have cars in them like nfs games and gta granted gta is considered shooter game but basically warframe is most deffenitly an exception the graphics are great and the animations good and its also addictive and its free to play. their is only one thing that seems to be a problem though and that is not only can you play with other people you can also play solo which is great but when your not connected to the internet and you want to play warfame in solo you cant apparently you have to have the internet in order to play at all which is basically my only complaint but even at that i most deffenitly recommend this game",908.3
"been playing this game for a long time (the hours in my steam didnt sync with my warframe account idk why), and its so much fun along with the community itself. well this game is a grinding game which forces you to play missions over and over and over again, but its so addictive. the most fun part is building your warframe/weapons until it overpowered (or op), putting the right mods and stuffs. theres so much memories in this game even i cant remember them all lol. game score? for a co-op f2p i give it 7 out of 10.",849.8

"the game itself is good, but its got a few annoying aspects unless you pay, such as only having 2 slots for warframes, meaning you have to sell others to make room. i hear the in-game market is good for getting the platinum (paid currency), but you would need something people would want to buy to have any chance at getting the platinum. it costs 20 platinum to buy a warframe slot, and i would suggest you never buy the warframes straight out. depending on the warframe, it can get quite pricey, even if you take into account the other things it comes with. real money - paid currency rate $5 gets you 75 platinum, and only 1 warframe i believe is this cheap. some warframes cost near $25 or more to buy straight out.",117.4
"it is a good game but the parcoure is bad and they need cutsences",277.6
"ye, i tested it once again and its improved a lot. i wont mention what is the big plus of all that, because it is self explanatory and if you dont know, play the game! it sure is worthy, for now. hope they dont destroy it. old: played the closed beta, dont believe the trailers, the game itself isnt as great as they show it, though it is worth to play, especially with friends and alike. maps are boring tho, enemy ai is this games weak point.",6.5

"i used to love this game but after buying platinum (in game credits) and not receiving them i started asking help from the support. ive sent every evidence that i did pay but they said they couldnt help me. note that this is my second time buying platinum the first time went great but now i just feel really cheated. i just cant play something that make me feel so cheated. i was even really excited :c to think ive been boasting this game to my friends and how awesome it is t^t",804.7
"it adds life and ecxitement.. wich is lost in most games it just makes you addicted because the feel of action never stops you can just keep going... and it aslo provides tons of choices for character creation wich makes it even more awesome.",27.3
"i have spent (unbeknownst to me) over 300 hours playing this game and i have nothing but positive things to say. despite the fact that many free-to-play games often require you to pay in order to progress, this isnt true with warframe. as ive learned from the very beginning you could play for hours-upon-hours without having to spend a single penny. it wasnt until i was nearing 100 hours that i realized how much i enjoyed this game. not only that, but i also thought that investing in (platinum for) the game would only help make my already-pleasant experience even better. warframe has evolved alot in the small amount of time that ive played it. through player purchases the developers have added new maps, new mods, a killer melee battling system, and outstanding and unique missions and modes that only add to the spontaneity of this game. just imagine a game that mixes ninja gaiden with call of duty with vanquish. from my own personal experience, its worth checking out - especially if youre a college student (like myself) and are strapped for spending money on the new games coming out every-so-often. give this game a shot and im sure you will come to find at least a few things that make warframe a fun, great, and unique experience. game on. - lenny",380.2
"one of the best co-operative games out there, hands down. there is a noticable lack of progress as you start off in the game with your first warframe but as you start to expand the tenno campaign against the grineer, corpus and infested (the funnest of the three to fight), you will find that upgrades become easier and easier to get. the collection of mods, weapons, blueprints, rare materials is truely addicting. the downside? the lopsided micro-transactions. do not let the slow-going at the start fool you into sinking money into this necessarily. nearly everything can be collected through gameplay, alerts, operations, etc. patience perseveres in this. as for me, i sunk some cash into this because i wanted to support the developer of the game. theyve really crafted a fantastic product here that is easy to jump into but also has the depth that hardcore players crave. unconditional recommendation!",97.7
"fantastic but hard to pick up at first. helpful to play with experience friends",34.2

"very good game, early on its mostly just go planet to planet and unlock them but once you get to late game your job becomes level up your gear, farm for items and go to the void. some people seem to be confused, warframe is in a loot game. its kinda like borderlands in that you level up (your gear, but also your mastery) and collect items. but in warframe you build more weapons and frames. should you play it? yes. should you play it expecting a linear campaign with a great story and character arches like they go from nice and fragile then to a total badass? no. if you enjoy starting with pretty much nothing and earning cooler and cooler gear and like the sense of achievement from getting that braton prime then yes. definitly play it.",541.1

"its free, you can get practically everything through playing (that includes cosmetic items),and its really fun with a group. atleast try it.",61.0
"for a free to play game, warframe certainly gets quite a few things right: the graphics are gorgeous, the game mechanics are simple, & the frames (characters) are unique, and stand out with personalities even though they dont have dialouge. as a bonus, the developers are very involved in the community; adding new weapons and items, as well as implementing new game modes and events with detailed backgrounds on a regular basis. the weapons and frames are so diverse and numerous, & its really fun to experiment and find a combination that you call your own. the only problem i have with the games structure is that you get very few weapon and frame slots to start with, and you can only get more through buying platinum (cash). there are so many weapons and frames i feel that they need to add a few more slots, because new players might not have the information they need to sink some money into the game if they cant experiment with more than 2 frames or 4 weapons. and, unfortunately, the starting weapons suck to the maximum, but that should be expected since you need to work your way up. i would definitely reccommend this game to anyone who wants an action / brawler game, because the melee / ninja-acrobatic side is stronger than the shooter side.",1147.5
"this game is great, you can pin people to walls with a bow, and chop arms off with a staff.",130.3
"this game got boring and repetetive very fast. it uses the tactic of just throwing a lot of enemies at you and hope for the best. it is free, so no real loss if you still want to try it, but i don`t think it is worth anyones time.",0.5
"while there are many things to brush up on this game by de, they already have made this game a blast to play already. not recommened for people who are not used to grind in online games but its doable for people wanting to play casually. as someone coming from a 5 year playing ro, i ensure u at the very least, the grind is not as bad as it is there.",321.9

"warframe is co-op fps game that provides a new playground with many options. where teamwork is key to takedown tough bosses to get new blueprints for stronger, more powerful warframes and weapons. warframe has pros and cons. the pros of this game is that it provides a fun, enjoyable experience with lots of options concerning weapons, warframes, modfications to your weapons and warframes. it also has a rewarding victory when new weapons and warframes are built. the cons are that while building new weapons and warframes is rewarding, it can take a minimum of 5 days to build new warframes and a usual 12 hours for new weapons. also this game is in beta so sometimes it may run perfectly and other times have bugs or even crash after extended periods of play or if repeating the same mission over and over. the final verdict for this game is 6.75/10 because this game is a enjoyable experience with a few cons but doesnt quite live up to its full possibilities and expectations in some multiplayer pvp areas.",111.8

"whats most important here is that the game is free and its fun. if your computer can manage the graphics, you have nothing to lose by giving warframe a shot. if youre the min-maxing type or any sort of person who likes to break down systems into a series of personal goals, you have no barriers between you and many, many hours of enjoyment. for my part, i had a fun several missions, but it became clear that i was playing and trying to inhabit a world of people who were much more ready to invest time and grinding into something that wasnt giving me the payoff i needed to keep going. i never felt much of a sense of direction once the repetitive nature of the missions was revealed.",15.9

"starts slow, but honestly, this is a diamond in the rough. a game that needs to be played to be understood. i never knew i what fun it was to play a space ninja, but after about 15 hours, its got a few hooks in me, and not bad for free. im in my mid twenties in rank with the starter gear and am pondering the grind for new equipment or simply cashing out and having $10 or $20 to ride on for a while. the missions of mercury are a bit dull, but once you get the venus, the missions open up a bit and become a bit more engaging. in terms of polish, it isnt the shiniest stone but it isnt the buggiest by far. i would put it on par with a payday 2 or tribes ascend sort of feel.",323.4
"i dont see what is so fun about this game. it is well made and great looking, the developers are active in expanding and improving it, and its a very popular game on steam. even so... its boring. its fun at first and every now and then but each mission is almost the same with similar level builds and same enemies each time. warframes and powers are cool but eventually their colors fade and it goes back to the same old grind. maybe its just me but i think its repetativeness is boring but hey its a free game. no harm in giving it a try for yourself.",48.3

"so here is the deal. warframe is aweful. honestly 0/10 would not play. maybe... maybe 2/10 cuz swords. other than that this game is lame. you force yourself to play a few hours, however, becuase it has gotten higher ratings than some of your favorite games. so youre in around ten hours, and you get to your first level 30 weapon. you have since then purchased and/or found other weapon parts and intended to build a superior weapon to the weapon you currently have. you give it a shot and holy dear lord is it good. and it felt pretty satisfying coming out of the 12 or 24 hour oven (foundry). so you play with that for a while and have a decent amount of fun. so okay, games not great, maybe a 5/10. at least its free. but, becuase this new weapon is pretty good, you want to see what else is on the horizon. rinse and repeat until about 40 hours when you realize that youve covered most of the starchart and have a few good weapons. rinse and repeat until you can take down anything in the starchart very fast. rinse and repeat until you can take out the stalkler in one hit with a meelee weapon. rinse and repeat until you can last to 45 mins + on t4 survival. etc., etc., ,etc. 10/10 god tier game. would recommend (even dropping cash on teh game) tl;dr graph of y = x where x is how much you play and y is your desire to play",271.4

"this is a really fun and interesting 3rd person shooter. the game is quite beautiful, bringing the player to a host of different planets with varying scenery. the gameplay is tough, but fun. although the mechanics are lacking in some ways. the aim assist function helps keep the player locked to a target, but only to a point, this gets especially hard to manage when facing flying enemies, for the aim assist only loosely locks to the target, and when locked, the aim is tough to unlock. i found that in the simulator, that i was failing most of the time, due to the shielding enemies flying around so much that i cant hit them. on top of that, the shields they grant to their allies are too overpowered, with a bow, the player must hit the enemies head three times in a row to get the kill. this makes it not worth trying to kill the enemy over the support drone flying above them. i think that with some good tweaking and nerfing of some enemies, and the complete elimination of the defense missions (they pretty much suck every bit of fun out of this game, which is running, gunning, and slashing, there isnt much of that when there are hordes of enemies converging on you to kill a very fragile piece of equipment)",42.4

(i prefer borderlands :p ) the diffrent missions can be completed in diffrent ways . you can either come in all guns blazing or do the entire mission by stealth, using only your sword. after the first missions you might be a bit bored but after a few hours , when you have customized your character to make it personal , you have an arenal that your pleased with , and when you leave mercury (because you are always stuck on spaceships/earth and the other planets are more beautiful to play in ), the game will progressively be more fun. at some point (when you are a reasonable lvl) you can raid and do instances , online with random players or just your friends... the mod system (you mod your weapons so they become stronger) is very confusing for begginers but after a while you will get the hang of it , and its preeety dope.. i recommend this game to everyone .",52.1
"i think its a pretty good game, it is enjoyable. i played it when it was first released before it was even on steam and well, all the glitches and such i experienced are probably now fixed. so if those are all fixed id imagine it is an enjoyable game for all. the only thing i disliked was well, its halfway impossible to find the items to craft armor or weapons. which gets you annoyed and you end up wanting to spend real money on in-game currency.",16.6

"this is a great game, i fell in love with it on the ps4, but its really something you need to spend some time in and maybe a trip to the wiki or the forum to really see its potential. if youre cool with shooting a lot of basic enemies and occasionally some badass ones, youll be fine here. honestly, when youre traversing half the area in a spin attack and slicing through infected like a space ninja blender, youll appreciate this game.",2.3

"its very rare that a f2p game with a model like this keeps my interest for over a few minutes, but ive been playing warframe for 7 hours within the first day of downloading it. really surprisingly quality and well-polished combat as well as loads of different mods and abilities makes for a really entertaining game overall.",620.7

"ive been playing this game since beta firstly came out as f2p, and game was good then but really boring, no trading, few warframes, a lot of bugs and i still got till 30th lvl before ive decided to stop. few days ago few mates and me saw it on steam and install it again, i found my old acc and started playing again. game is awesome now. the amount of bugs they cleared, stuff in stores, game mods, lvls, optimtizations and basicly gave mostly what people asked for, they are active on forums, answering q&a and very helpfull. love their blogs in which they love to tease and give people news about stuff they are working on etc. get it, great game, much fun, if you have few friends, start a clan and fight.",6.7
"i highly recomend this game, its great if you enjoy third person shooters. it has amazing graphics and eventhough it is grindy its one of the only games i acctually enjoy myself in while grinding for levels. i can spend hours on end with this game and my friends can go weeks without seeing me, so prepare to kiss your social life goodbye if you become as addicted as me. if you havent given this game a try then you should it has a bit of a learning curve because of the dynamic combat system but eventually you can get it. the missions can get slightly repedative at times but since they can change at any moment with new objectives and the preceduraly (sorry idk how to spell today) generated maps can spice things up and keep you entertained. 10/10 p.s. when on the log in screen type in flappy in the email/username spot and hit enter (no password) a flappybird minigame featuring the zephyr warframe will appear (if they havent removed it yet)",780.9
"more like warfail. total ing grindfest now, if you wanna cut the grind times to a minimum you have to pay for it, and the premium currency prices are ing outragous. and forget about all this new weapon every week . all the new weapons are just crap now, like that new staff weapon, which looks like someone sat on the end of a bo staff, the starting weapon, which is excacly what it is. they may have added that space combat crap in, but it got sooo boring really fast, considering all you can farm is another two weapons for it. its also disorientating, so unless your a hardcore ace pilot, i recommend getting some gravol on standby. theres a few new missions to play on a new planet, but the problem is the planet is trying to kill you. its colder than hoth, and if you build up alot of freezing you take damage! even if your playing as the warframe that shoots ice and causes avalanches. this game used to be fun, but now, since its soooooo popular, they mess the damn thing up with so much crap, its unruly.",421.2
"downloaded i the deleted it and then downloaded it again but it wont download this time.",4.4
"i play this game on almost everyday and i love it i can never get enough of it all the content to play with and build it incredible and the weapon configuration is always interesting changing it to different playstyles and chosing what to take where so you can do you best on a mission but with all the positives this game has it does have its downsides one of them being that it can get really repedetive grinding and farming for resources can be annoying but if you can get past that warframe will be a very fun and time consuming free to play game i highly reccomend it with friends and my one tip is to not waste your platinum (real money) on scarfes or immortal skins just use them on catalysts and reactors to make your weapons and warframes stronger.",961.0
"a very good, polished (even though currently in beta) f2p, with zero pay-to-win. its entirely co-op. if you enjoyed mass effect 3s mp, or enjoy third person shooters like red faction guerrilla/armageddon, then youll love warframe. also, they made dark sector.",561.2
"well, in my opinion this game was great at its start, but then, after update over update it just went.. em.. in a hideously wrong way. the gui is horrifying, and so everything else is way more complicated than it should be. theyve tried to make this game less slack, but it still has a very few gamemodes, and it lacks in maps. its just simply boring.",103.0

"so i have been playing this game for about two weeks, started a guild, and did pretty much there is to do in the game. there are lots of levels, around 200 i think, lots of planets, lots of random events for random blue prints and mods and teno, also this game isnt really pay to win, i guess, because you can earn everything you need in game, and trade in game stuff for platinum, which is not required to win, but it can get you stuff you cant get without it, luckily there is a market of people selling platinum for items. also, the game is fun but repetitive and not enough people play, however it is very complext and entertaining at the same time, but there are serious lag issues in pvp, rail missions and things like that, so much so it makes me debate if these people are using hacks, because they function fine in the lag, where as you just end up dying and not knowing why or how. there are also a lot of bugs in this game, game crashes, falling through the map, enemies being behind the map preventing you from killing them and finishing the mission also. these bugs are rare, but when you come across them, and you will if you play this game like i have, than they will make you debate on writing this game a bad review. however, if you love rpgs, mmos and fpss than this game is worth checking out. besides the bugs, and the repetitiveness, i still come back for more, for now. its also free, so why the heck not.",432.6

"a solid third-person shooter with enjoyable gunplay and swordplay mechanics. warframes movement system is also fun and unique, allowing players to slide around surfaces, jump off walls, and easily maneuver around enemies. being co-op based, this game is not for everyone. it is, however, worth a try.",25.2
"for me this is one of yhe best games i ever play on a pc free to play",10.7
"this game is really great. the only thing that could be upsetting is that at times you may want more power with your weapons and you just will not get it unless you mod your weapons or find all the parts for your blue prints. it can be very challenging. i feel almost like i cannot avoid taking damage, but you can definitely deal damage. all in all, i do enjoy this game and it is holding my interest. also, it is a plus that you can pve in it unlike some other free-to-play action games.",10.1

"a very well made free to play 3rd person shooter. uses a custom lanucher/updater. gameplay gameplay is quite repetitve in the long run. there are a bunch of planets available to you, each with sectors ( missions ) with different gamemods which you complete for rewards. the game uses tiles to randomly generate levels. some planets have unique tilesets, etc. has a bunch of different weapons and weapon types, each item has to be ranked up with xp. you can then mod your weapon/warframe/etc with a huge amount of mods to tweak each parameter to your liking. has a lore, but theres no campaign as such, just a few story quests. real money basically almost nothing is locked behind a paywall in this game. the only exceptions i found are some cosmetics ( character attachements, color pallettes, animations sets ) and inventory size ( for weapon and characters ). you can trade in-game currency bought for real money to other players at higher levels, which means that you can unlock pretty much everything for free, which enough time put into the game. not only that, but you can get a -75% discount on platinum ( currency bought for real money ) as a daily login reward, and for 5$ you can get enough of it to lift all restrictions on the inventory size and buy some cheap cosmetics. buying weapons/characters for platinum is pointless because you can simply craft, or acquire them otherwise. score if i had to give it a score, id say 7.5/10.",267.9

"scavenging, shiny robots, fast paced universal combat, itll get you hooked! i have friends who play this endlessly, and after joining all the hype, i dont regret it. if youve ever played the borderlands series youd get a slight feel for it when you notice all of the mods, ammo packs, etc flooding the ground. this game really immerses you into several atmospheres. for those who like to take it slow can go for stealth approaches in levels, adding a booming level of intensity. patience is key, so be careful not to get caught! then there is the tanking aspect, if you want to get a mission done quick, ring in your fastest and heaviest fire power, because youll have hordes of enemies on you! starting out though, try not to get too intimidated, i recommend tuning into the the storyline, as it can help a whole lot. bring an experienced friend a long to help! getting confused and put off is easy, as a lot of the game aspects fly right by you pretty quick. overall this game is great, you have a long way to go before you end up getting bored because the variety will take you on so many experiences. 8/10",11.6

"the more i play, the more i cant stop playing. all of the best things in the game cant be bought with real money through the market, which means you actually have to work and farm for the best gear, so it isnt pay to win at all, as some would have you believe. survival & defense missions are surprisingly addicting, and the replay value is obviously there. i would however reccomend not playing the entire game solo, as the matchmaking is fairly solid, and the game is more rewarding when playing with a full team, and laying waste to swarms of enemies. great game with some small issues, but i look passed them overall. recommended for people who are loot junkies and love a good crafting system. the real fun in this game comes from building your gear and ranking it up. as you can see, i like warframe, and i actually plan on spending money on it, which most f2p games dont get me to do, but im enjoying it a lot more than i thought i would.",638.8

"i`ve been watching this game progress and grow and it only keeps getting better and better. online connections are smooth and the players are mixed between calm, serious, or quiet, all of which have some degress of skill as well. very enjoyable game, configuration methods to suit your playstyle, easy to pick up on even if you aren`t good at shooters. the ai are challenging and use cover, you have to outsmart them to win, and there`s something satisifying about slicing a foe in half with your melee weapon... personal rating: 9.9 out of 10 - the .1 being your fingers may get tired by how long you play this game!",365.8

"with a great player driven economy, and the ability to earn all non-cosmetic items in the game, digital extremes has hit a great point with players all over with warframe. while many would say that the premium currency (platinum) is highly overcosted, they regularly give out coupons for their daily login prizes, ranging from 20% all the way to 75% off the regular price, and said platinum can also be earned in game by completing certain missions and earning parts and mods that the player can sell to others for the currency. the gameplay can get tedious, seeming as how most of the missions are cookie-cutter. but if you can get past the grinding, and the repetition, warframe might just become one of your favorite free-to-play gems in your library",129.8
"great game at start things start to get boring after 300+(played 200+ house before connecting my warframe account to steam) hours of endless farming to get items that you want but the first 100 hours are amazing. the new contents added every update are really fun and if you are the type who like farming for items, warframe is one of the best games for you. new prime gears and new warframes every major updates or some of the sub updates give an additional 20-50 hours to farm all the items so if you wait patiently for the updates, warframe could be a never ending fun for you. ive quit warframe now but i still enjoyed the hours that ive played in warframe. its a great game to get and i also reccommend buying platinum just for weapon and warframe slots.",134.3

"first of all this game somehow doesnt feel like a grind you can get most of the weapons/frames pretty quick,the community are awesome mostly in the north american/eu servers, like help newbies etc. the stealth is just to simple and weak.gunplay is fun with many ways to take out your enemies,from your oridnary guns to lazors beams to enegry weapons etc. each frame looks and funtions uniquely.there are so many ways to kill your enemies,will you slash dash your way through your enemies? will you zap them into oblivion? and many more.also you can earn real life currency (platnium) though trading rare stuffs (prime parts)/mods/stuff :p. arcwing is awesome as you fly around space and blast your way though victory, but there not much really to play arcwing as there are very little weapons/mods for it.there are syndicates you can fight for that gives you rewards of doing missions got them,though a little more lore can be added to why and how they were created so at least i could give a damn about why im helping the syndicates rather than focusing on the rewards.overall this game is fun, but it is very repetitive though they have many game modes.they are feel the same at times",1144.7
"i love this game, its amazing how much they base their game around the community. they host livestreams over on twitch every so often to have a run through on warframe or host dev streams so the devs over at de can listen and share their ideas with everyone and let people know whats going on with the game. pros: great graphics not that high system specs frequent updates/ bug fixes great fun nearly everything on the market you can build but obviously takes time an ingame currency called platinum which allows you to buy things ready made with everything instead of farming stuff. cons: items in the market are overpriced ( 10-15 for just 1 warframe!) a  ton of performance issues on the higher levels and new tilesets (but they do alot of updates and try their hardest to fix). becomes a grindfest in some cases and becomes repeated boringness. sometimes ai act like toddlers and run around not knowing what the  they are supposed to do. boring for low levels. but ive got to say its still in open beta and it is an extremely fun game and to see the game really show you whats its ment to be keep playing if your bored of the first few mission  gets alot better once youve got rid of your crappy starter gear for some pretty neat gear. a fun challenge and is meant to be played with friends.",436.1

"cyborg ninja third person shooter thats as succinct a description as i can think of. you play as a variant (over 20 kinds) of grey fox from mgs1, or raiden, whatever you prefer, in a far future solar system filled with humanoids, robots and infested flood (from halo) like aliens that you shoot and slash and stab and stealthy stab and energy stab and jump stab and do other things i havent unlocked yet. its got crafting and a grind to match for the specific items you want, but i dont mind that since i find the core gameplay of shooting and running and jumping and somersaulting really really fun. so yeah, play this game. its free and the vast majority of content is completely free. only cosmetics are forced to buy with money dollars.",21.2

"playing this game is a must if you like third person shooters and parkour. its just perfect in everything; the developers are very nice people, the game is completely balanced as a f2p game with real currency(i.e. platinum which you can get for real money or during giveaways). graphics are stunning, gameplay is great, ofcourse there are some bugs. also, theres not a single thing such as if you want to kill everyone in a few seconds, buy this premium status and buy all the op guns that you can only get for real money! unlike in most of the other f2p mmo games. you can get every single weapon that is in the game just by playing! you can suggest things to be added into the game as well(you can do that on their forum). this game is in good hands, therefore it is good itself aswell. i have to tell, i barely ever make reviews, and if i do : its either a perfectly done game or a terrible one. this one was worth the time i spent typing this. :l",258.0
"way too grindy,a waiting simulator and strongly encourages spending money.",112.0
"to be honest, the only reason this game is geting such amount of recommended rates is because its a free to play game. if people had to pay to play this game they would get really pissed off after a week or two if the dont like grinding games that much, because warframe is the king of grinding games. this game has alot of content, very cool content yes, but youll find yourself farming one item for countless hours and then waiting days for it to be available (after you get the materials for each item you have to wait for it to be finished, unless you pay). and this applies to everything, weapons, warframes, mods, mods mods. and of course, the bugs, i really dont want to write about this since i stoped playing a few patchs ago so maybe most of the bugs i encountered back when i was playing might got fixed already but holy f*ck did i find some *t bugs in this game. anyways, i got bored pretty fast but i cant say it was not worth the while, i had fun playing valkyr after i finished her completly, the animations and graphics are amazing and even though there are some warframes that are stronger than others all of them are viable and fun to play. download this game if you like ninjas, futuristic enviroment and if you dont mind grinding in a repetitive way for hours. after all, its free to play.",248.5
"it was all fun and all when i first started playing this game. however after a couple of hours here and there, i feel like i have lost my passion to like this game. the only thing thats keeping me to play is the aesthetic look and the graphics. everything feels like a grind fest and its just seems so ridiculous you have to wait 12-24 hrs for an item you are building. the only way to get around this is if you use plats to speed up the process. :(",98.0

"the game is great , one of the best free to play games ive ever played - only played 123 hours so far. the amount of grinding that needs to be done and missions to complete of different difficulties makes it so that the player can never say ive done everything without properly playing the game for hours upons hours. a good selection of warframes (different characters basically) to make and use. missions like survival make it fun to play with friends for a long period of time and with so much bosses and items to collect one can not be bored. ill give this a 8/10 due to the fact that i havent tried the pvp nor have i ventured deep enough in the game (i.e. the highiest missions) to give a full review. ill mostly give this a 9 after venturing further and maybe a 10 once i get in to the pvp and so fourth. also there are many glitches and beta issues that pop up from time to time, for example people getting disconnected as soon as a game starts / people getting kicked from the party at extraction and so fourth. but overall for a beta - this game is pretty awesome. so 8/10 for now and it can only get better in my opinion, try it out!",397.9
"i love this game, i will be honest the constant need for platinum is irritating (if you want to good stuff without the long grind) but the gameplay is smooth, the weapons can be amazing when modded to your liking, and the maps are beautifully done. i cant recommend this enough, not everyone likes it but hell - i love it.",1084.2

"recommended game, if you guys ever played mass effect before, very similiars, but its free anyway",10.1
"warframe is a fun game that is free. the combat is smooth and fluid, and the game provides unique weapons for wider variety. the only issue is that the settings need to be customized. the default controls need to be handpicked for the most part, and the game needs to be played in windowed mode, but that is my only complaint. the rest of it is really fun and it puts an interesting spin on the shooter concept. tl;dr like mass effect combat with less cover. play in windowed. fix key bindings",123.0

"warframe is the type of game that you can keep coming back to. in the beginning, its grindy but its almost like a good kind of grindy. after playing for about 400 hours i started to get bored, so i took a break from the game for a couple of months. when i came back, so much had been added and improved, it was like a whole new game. digital extremes is an excelent developer and is known for listening to its customers feedback. with the upcoming x1 release, i imagine sinking even more time into this amazingly fun and beautiful looking game.",896.1
"seems like a cool game except i cant seem to get past the first part. there is some god damn gate that i cant get through, ive watched tutorials on youtube that show them crouching and walking underneath it but the damn gate is closed all the way with no indication of how i should open it or what i should do. so if anyone finds out let me know and ill change this review, until then i cant exactly play the game.",1.4
"keep in mind this game is still in beta so its clearly unfinished and very buggy. that being said im finding my self addicted to this game! this game in a nutshell: four ninja/commandos blasting through horde after horde of soldiers with over-the-top weaponry and abilities. the level of customization in this game is unparalelled there is easily something for everyone. the action is fast and i mean very fast! there is a single player option but ive found it a lot more fun to jump in the melee with 3 strangers and have fun. one aspect of warframe that i havent tried out yet is the dojo feature. its basically a clubhouse for your clan. you can build extra rooms and forge specific weapons and armor. there is also a pvp gametype as well. there is an out-of-game store to buy in-game curency, upgrades, weapons, ect. this is understandable as the game is still in development and its how the game studio is making money to finish it. its not totally neccesary to purchase in game money but i do feel inadaquite when someone blows by me and clears a room with far superior equipment. like i said this game isnt finished. right now the game is just the multiplayer missions and the associated menus. there is a lot of set-up for a great story. digital extremes, please dont let me down. flesh out the story and factions. give ths game some character. this has the makings of a great game, dont let me down at retail.",52.6
"warning: this game and its studio (warframe/ digitalextreme) has sold to perfect world entertainment on july/2/2014. pwe has a long history of bad reputation and not before long warframe will become one of its revenue machine. right now they are banning people talking about pwe in forum/stream. this game has its moments but its time to move on.",478.5
"not bad. will definitely play it more. hope the combat gets more interesting at later levels.",0.9

"hey there, tenno! looks like youre interested in playing warframe. maybe its sleek character designs and world aesthetics that ring equal parts japanese sentai ranger/tokusatsu superhero and western science fiction caught your eye. or maybe the promise of an invigorating third-person shooter experience meshed with light rpg progression elements got your attention. if you enjoy: - endless grindwalls and microtransaction temptations at every meaningful gameplay decision - a vacuum of engaging content beneath those grindwalls - undocumented stealth nerfs and obfuscating excuses for these changes by developers - unfinished projects explained away by the promise that these features will be fixed at some point in the future - a lack of transparency between developers and players - a clear lack of direction for exactly what the game wants to accomplish - game developers who constantly run away from their mounting self-created problems then you will probably like warframe. enjoy your stay. if not, i would suggest playing another game.",777.1
"often described as a pay to win game. i found that not to be the case. warframe is a third person shooter that is easy to pick up and rewards players who put time and effort into the game. the initial learning curve is set quite high, but can be made easier with help from the rather polite online community. missions can seem repetitive at times, but the constant addition of new content and game mechanics make warframe always feel fresh. being still only in beta, there are a few minor bugs that stop it from being one of the top free to play games around. these issues however, hardly detract from the game itself and are only noticible because the rest of the game feels so polished. overall, warframe is a genuinely good game that has a lot of things going for it. i look forward to the developers live release and whatever additional changes accompany it.",162.8
"warframe is extremely fun to play with friends and its challenging at times giving people a goal to shoot for. i think its a very well designed weapon and warframe crafting system aswell, though farming some parts for specific weapons and primes can get a bit (insanely) repetetive. great systems of trading parts for other parts with other players etc, though a fair warning to anyone new !! the grind is real !! overall good game but can get repetetive at times. :3",401.6
"good game if ya like rng, grinding, guns, waiting, space ninjas with superpowers, guns and sword play, flying around space with butt-thrusters, using an attack dog that will cost you an arm and a leg, not having to pay money to actually advance in the game (though it helps later), and having crapmed fingers from all of the fun your having, this is the game for you. its the poor persons destiny",767.2

"review time: so this is a pretty good game, problem is it doesent really explain what to do, as a newb to this game 1.5 years ago i was lost. if you find that you are in this situation then i guarentee that you will hate this game, it has no direction and the mindless killing doesent really have much replay for the first frame/weapon and starter planets, but with time and persistance and a little bit of spending creddits for better gear then i guarentee that you will enjoy the massive ammount of weapons to choose from couppled with warframe abilities. warframes are easy to aquire and weapons are really cheep for the most part, farming for monney is easy to do as long as you have someone in trade chat carry you to a high level mision for easy monney. finally for a last opinion, i would despite all i have said get in a guild and play with people, this game is not meant for solo and playing with a squad of 4 is much more fun than sticking it out by yourself.",563.1

"game is very addicting, downloaded it on a whim from a friend who played the game occasionally. was slow to start, but now i have spent over 90 hours and counting in it. there is a lot of grinding in it unless you want to drop some dough. however, the grinding is enjoyable and there is almost always someone to play with. the enjoyable gameplay along with the constant updates and additions make this one of my favorite f2p games of all time and i dont feel pressured to drop a lot of money on it, even though i will occasionally make a purchase here or there. 9/10",236.3

"warframe is an amazing game. its a third person co-op sci-fi shooter space ninja extravaganza! its a little slow starting out (if you have the money, i recommend getting affinity and credit boosters), but once you get past the first planet or two, you really start to have some great fun. with a good team and communication, this game offers hours of never ending entertainment. each warframe (playable character) offers its own unique play and fighting style. with (currently) 16 warframes and 3 prime variants (the 4th, excalibur prime is no longer attainable), over 100 primary, secondary, and melee weapons, and 5 sentinels (robotic companions), this game has massive replayability. the very best part is, its free! so why not try it out? p.s. dont stop after the first couple missions, i promise youll find its an amazing game!",163.3
"while starting off on this game i felt like i wouldnt enjoy but as i played through the game i found out that this game is really good and while yes, the art style looks weirdish (hammer head loki) it grew on me and farming in this game can be annoying, once you get your gear leveled up it should be a breeze. if you are eyeing this game at lest give it a go.",1048.8

"+ = awsome graphics, excelent gameplay, the whole space ninja idea is awsome and alot to do in the game and very fun to play with friends. - = only thing thats is negative in the game is the cost of platinum ( the currency that you need if you like to buy gear, characters, resources faster), but its still a free to play game so it doesnt really matter",83.4

"the concept of the game is cool, graphics are nice, playing with friends is good and all... but! it gets tiring quickly due to its lack of variety in stages, enemies, modes etc etc. if you are looking for a game to stick with, this is not for you. however, the game is free so its fun to just jump in and play with friends once in a while!",13.3

"ive never seen such an asinine implementation of a microtransaction system. this wants you to pay exorbitant amounts of real world money for things that should be in-game currency (like continues). the general price for a trivial item is more than most complete games cost outright. the gameplay doesnt really live up to the hype. characters feel sluggish compared to the blitzkrieg enemies. the damage you take spikes dramatically, leaving you lead with no real clue what hit you (or when). but you probably could have evaded it only you didnt run like you were trying to hold in a duece. the art style is incoherent, mostly seeming like a direct lift from quake ii. it is, however, a beautiful recreation of it. the game loads fast, the game engine seems highly optimized and runs fantasic. in fact, it uses all the bells and whistles my hardware can provide and still runs faster than games that look 1/3rd as good. too bad pretty aint enough. warframe has a great foundation from which to build an amazing game upon. it just lacks in so many fundemental ways. but more than anything, the greed of the microtransation system is what kills this game. this is a poop nugget with a spit shine.",35.3

"dont let the metascore fool you. its an amzing game with great gameplay. best of all its free! what do you got to lose?",2.2
"fun, action-packed game. really nice graphics. if you like ninjas in space and shooters, this is the game for you. fast paced game play, dungeon crawler co-op game with many weapons to choose from. it could do with more strategy as most games with a full team of 4 wind up being a huge zerg and the final kill count seems to be related to the person who run the fastest. game can get grindy and repetitive, and the store items can be a little pricy, but if you want to just have a blast and shoot anything in sight for a while, this will get you hooked.",243.4
"i havent downloaded the game but its probably real bad. thanks",9.1
"bland and repetitive. combat could be much more fun if it involved some kind of locational damage, but it mostly comes down to clicking your enemies until they die.",27.0
"didnt keep me hooked for long enough. and i will have you know for a picky and judgmental gamer like me, that is quite a bad sign. the long updates, the scific setting rip-off, the mediocre community ratings. convince me otherwise, but plenty of other fishes out in the sea to waste my time/energy/attention with.",4.1
"you will need a good and fast pc to run this game but when you do it is really fun",12.9
"great game all in all, its free and all weapons in game are obtainable without the use of real cash. i love this game, the game can get repetitive, but if you have a couple friends to tag along with you on missions, then farming for new items is a blast. theres always something to farm for, either a new gun, and new melee weapon or a new warframe. this game will keep you busy for a long time.",523.2
"game is very monotonous and getting the other warframes, as well as pretty much every other piece of equipment, is straight up un-fun and a pain in the .",19.0
"for all those friend of mine. i suggest everyone to try this one. needless to mention this is free to play game tho. its pretty much addective third person game. i would love to play this whole day and night without rest and food :)) . some kind of high technology mixed with katana and bow and other stuffs. its really new thing for me from the very start. even now i dont know what exactly should i do :))",11.9
"the game is a lot of fun but repetitive so it can get boring fast. its a lot more fun if you play with friends so that its less boring. at a certain point progressing does require you to pay for more weapon or frame slots. if you dont then you will have to trash , remake and lvl up what you already have to continue progressing your rank. lucky the slots arent expensive.",790.6

"i came back to the game after being absent for quite a while playing in the early stages of the game and now experience a whole new fresh rework and i do enjoy it much. the game always has been one of the games i enjoy greatly over a shorter period of time. i dont think the progression system works for a title to play over a long period of time but by adding more and more events they work around that quite nicely. still i think their micro-transaction model isnt well suited for a free-to-play title; its more of a play the game, then pay to play on kinda thing. if you wanna progress further than account-level 4-5 you will have to spend cash nomatter what, or decide to give up old progress you did (selling old items) in order to progress further. luckily they give you a certain amount of currency from the beginning but you easily end up in a situation where you are forced to spend in order to play. i dont know if the game offers enough content to justify that action. until then its one hell of a fun time.",90.3
"this game is really addicting once you play it long enough. you dont even need to buy any of the guns. there are blueprints that you buy with in-game money, not real money. you can buy the weapons and appearance if you want to. but if you dont want to buy anything you can just use the in-game money to buy blueprints. so it is truly free",123.9
"review time: so this is a pretty good game, problem is it doesent really explain what to do, as a newb to this game 1.5 years ago i was lost. if you find that you are in this situation then i guarentee that you will hate this game, it has no direction and the mindless killing doesent really have much replay for the first frame/weapon and starter planets, but with time and persistance and a little bit of spending creddits for better gear then i guarentee that you will enjoy the massive ammount of weapons to choose from couppled with warframe abilities. warframes are easy to aquire and weapons are really cheep for the most part, farming for monney is easy to do as long as you have someone in trade chat carry you to a high level mision for easy monney. finally for a last opinion, i would despite all i have said get in a guild and play with people, this game is not meant for solo and playing with a squad of 4 is much more fun than sticking it out by yourself.",563.1
"it takes a bit to get used to (how to equip various mods, upgrading your armor/weps, etc.) but is absolutely worth it! the graphics are awesome, the levels are friggin amazing, and it can surely give a challenge to any kind of player! the frames (armor) for each class looks absolutely amazing, and each class has its personal skill (ultimate, basically) thats cool!",10.7

"gravedigger fagus said it best: its a game about space ninjas destroying space nazis and futuristic ea representatives. i dont think i need to say any more here. you cant leave out the mutant zombie versions of said nazis and ea reps. its like this, you and your crew infiltrate ships and bases on various planets and   up (and thats just with the weapons)! when everything is done, your team rolls out like nothing happened. space nazis, what space nazis? exactly. seriously though, the game is extremely fun. you get your choice of primary, secondary and melee weapons, per loadout, from an assortment of weapons from each faction (with an option to go melee only). there are several warframes to choose from, each with unique abilities. you can customize the colors for pretty much everything! you aquire mods to make your weapons and warframes more powerful. you can have up to 3 different mod loadouts and color schemes for everything. practically every weapon and warframe can be attained through crafting. the game is updated fairly frequently, and most importantly, its free! so if youre like me and enjoy shooters, co-op, hack and slash, love ninjas and are flat broke, this is the game for you!",987.3

"this game is probably one of my favorite games ive ever played. the story line behind it all is very creative and i havent heard anything like it. i heavily recommend this game not just because of the gameplay, but because of the developers that repeatedly update this game so its at its highest point of operation, and the players that play the game. most of the community are very cool helpful peopel that will help you get an understanding of the game. so all in all i would rate it 4/20 would blaze again.",1095.2

"now that over a thousand hours of my life have gone into this game as well as a good chunk of cash i can really give this a better review. in short, its fun but doesnt feel like its going in the direction it should(or that i would like). i dont really know how to describe my feelings for it. after u.i. 2.0 it just wasnt as much fun. i was rank 16(highest you could be at the time) and had every weapon i could obtain except for 3 and then new ones came, and then more, and more. sure this is how warframe has been but for some reason it just wasnt as fun. some of the new weapons now look fun but during that time i couldnt get back into it. i will say that if you come across this review and havent played yet, get the game. its amazing when you fist start out as you have so many weapons and warframes to choose from. and of course its a grindfest so if youre into that then you will be fine. i hope you enjoy this game and maybe youll see it finally get released.:corpus::grineer:",1183.3

"i hope you trained your fingers well, otherwise you will lack in mobility. first off bigest issue the keybindings. ingame you need to switch from sniping to key-smashing-meele. sadly while keysmashing the 1 meele-button. you lose one button for your movement. when you now try to use an ability, you can only run in one direction, making it worse to meele. this is a problem you properbly wouldnt have while playing on a controller. sadly i cant aim that way. minor issues: - the bow is op as hell even if uncharged i often used to meele-snipe instead of meele, because: - meele is either a one-hit-kill (in the back; assasinate) or a feather against a stone(in the front) - story is so linear it hurts for example (rewards): machine for blueprints -> blueprint -> materials - ai 10m away they wont see you. you can snipe as you want unless they press the alarm, but: - the alarmsystem is somehow spawning enemys as strong the first hard encounter, but can be hacked by a 3 year old - abilitys consume mana like hell so can max. use 2 unless u find a box with mana for a half ability pay-2-play: if youve chosen a character and your weapons: you can only change the weapons, but good weapons cost gold by the way if you dont like your character dont worry a cooler one is playable, for money ... jeeey",3.0

"its a pretty fun and cool game, for most of the game youre wildly stronger then any of the enemies and its nice and relaxing. the only downside is that you have to pay real money for almost anything- sure you can skirt by without dropping a penny into the game, but there is still a lot of money grabbing attempts.",471.9
"one of the best mmo games right now. you dont have to farm as much.",1023.8
"do you wish to grind for weeks to get one nwe item? months for a warframe? years for anything else? well then this game is for you! 3 runs of a level and you will know the other maps like the back of your hand! everything looks the exact same, the layouts are not really that random, its grindy, its repetative and there is no feeling of progression whatso ever. why you ask? because there is a cash shop, and they want you to buy from there to get the best items and warframes and such you can. the new ui causes so much frame lag that i actually had to turn everything down. the old ui was better than this grabage they have now but you will never see it again. the mobs, they are all the same. nothing special about them at all and the boss fights, they are just the same mobs you have been fighting with maybe one or 2 special moves but they are still the same thing. with lots of hp tho! not a good game unless you feel like grinding for no joke weeks at a time to get what you need in the same map over and over and over again.",4.5
"its a fun game, and i recommend it to anyone who wants to feel like a badass, fighting different kinds of enemies and unlocking new weapons and warframes. warframes are sort of like exo-skeletons that youre in. each of them have different kinds of abilities and they suit different kinds of playstyles. the developers are listening to the community and constantly adding new updates. while some warframes are considered more stronger and better than others, its still a fun game - no matter what. and hey - the worse the warframe, the harder the challenge, and the harder the challenge, the more time it requires to master it and when you master it - you know you suceeded! :)",127.3

"to get to game play you must load the launcher, the launcher checks for updates, then launches the game, which takes a brief load. you must then wait for it to load some more for, sign in, and get another load screen. over 5 minutes of loading to even get to the game. after getting to the game, you must do the tutorial level, which, if youve already played the game and uninstalled it, you know how to play already, and you can not skip. you also do not get your equipment from your previous install, so you have to learn how to use the weapons and warframe you may not even have. after finishing the tutorial, you are then put on your ship, where an mmo like chat is happening in the bottom left hand corner. the chat was an awful place, with people being awful. all in all, i give this game a rating of why are there so many controls, and why did i just do a backflip / 10",18.5

"fantastic co-op shooter. you can play solo if you prefer and there is still a sense of challenge. rank up your warframe, weapons and minion bot and add mods to customise their damage and shields. clan dojos you can build up together with materials that drop in missions. the item store is purely for cosmetic or to rush getting weapons/warframes. everything in the shop can be acquired in-game.",194.8
"warframe is a great game. the multiplayer feature of this game is nice. i had a good time playing with a friend. however, i did not really enjoy it. im not sure if i will play it again. i have played for an hour and a half so far. its a good game, but not a personal favourite of mine. i would reccomend warframe to some of my friends.",1.6
"very time consuming, gets repetative after awhile. fairly fun though looks very beautiful, its nice that you can get things without paying real money for them it just takes more time and resources.",114.6
"i recommend this game bicause of the cool grafichs end the easy gameplay",3.3
"fun game to play, especially with friends. amazing visuals, and a variety of roles which you can fill; whether it be an assassin, tank, disruptor or support, you can have them all. and the best part of this all... every weapon and warframe is free. just gather materials, and build them with hard time. trust me. its fun.",1086.6

"problem:free account heavily limited...thats the only problem everything else is ing awesome its like every sci fi game ever combined with directed with michael bay 9.5 out of ing 10!!!",3.8
"i played this game over 24 hours, so i might know what im talking about. warframe is a great looking game in many ways and yet feels good too. this game seems to be a too good free-to-play, but yet i feel like i paid for it. story is good but not bad, but what we all gamers care about the fun and gameplay in games, and this game does a great job of doing this. i highly people who really spend their time playing video games to play this game... but yet im not a player who playes all day and i still enjoy playing it. if i were to give it a score of 1 though 10 it would be a 9-out of 10, because it still has more updaes to come and yet when a new warframe comes out every update it get sadden and feel that im not powerful anymore. some bugs here and there but you will not run into any on your great adventure in this game. this game is a should have.",153.0
"nend something to release stress, play this game. feel it! enjoy it!",193.6
"you play the role of a rhino headed ninja. well, there are other warframes available, but one of them looks like a rhino headed ninja. you fight people that look ugly and need to get a makeover, so you kill them for your relief of saving money from not having to pay for their beauty treatment.",6.5
"really well-made game that introduces features like sprinting and shooting at the same time, a little bit of parkour, crafting, shooting behind you while running, and other well-made features. i highly recommend this game!",28.8
"one of the most satisfying and intense games ive ever played. when it first came out, i immediatly downloaded it, and although it was tad repititive, it was instantly addicting. it has been a privilage to watch this game grow and evolve into something truly unique and unreal. the fact that it remains free to play is something to behold in itself, because the quality and fun that this game provides outclasses a number of games ive payed (in my opinion, sometimes too much) for. the community for this game is extremly supportive and friendly, one of the best ive seen in a party based co-op shooter. if having a blast for free is something that you enjoy (it is), pick up this game immediatly. also, ninjas play free.",252.2
"- this the tps online game with the most number of diffirent weapon on the world, a hugh and plentyful weapon horde is waiting for your and your friend so get in and enticement your friend. - good co-op game play cuz you need your friend choose best equipment, weapon, class ( warframe ) to finish the mission faster or for best performent. - the game play is plentyful, very much things that when i though i found them all, new things that i have never know apear, and the game is alway update, new contents are release each months or week. - one more think, you dont need to buy platinum ( in game cash,gold, special money ) to be strong, all you have to do is play and looking for item drop, and that you can trade to other people for equipments, weapons, warframe. enjoy this co-op online game",515.9
"havent played this game too much to give a in-depth review about it but it has pretty good graphics and cool gameplay.",2.1
"i have been playing this game since the release of open beta and it is easily one of my favorite games of all time, it is constantly updated with new content it looks beautiful and it has something for people that love shooters and for those like me who just love some good melee mashing. i have met de steve and de rebecca in person and they are really wonderful people who are truly commoitted to making the game a great experience for everyone. warframe is truly an amazing game and i would recommend it to anyone. i think the amount of time i have spent on this game kinda speaks for itself though, even if you are apprehensive, its free so why not give it a go? whats not to love about high-tech space ninjas?",826.0
"warframe is one of the best games i have ever played hands-down. the game is gorgeous, the gameplay gets you addicted in the first hour, and the storyline keeps you guessing. this game is not pay-to-win. you can craft any gun or tenno in the game without paying real currency. tons of mods to custimize the gameplay to your preference. 10/10 download the game while you have the chance! fyi: to those of you who do not have an intel core i5 or higher, and a graphics card equal to or above the nvidia geforce gtx 8600 series, you will experience some lag, and rendering will not be amazing, but the game will play. fyi 2: for those of you who have a crash report when they hit the play button on the game, please read on! when you launch the game from steam, and the launcher pops up, go to the little gear in the top right hand corner. ( directly to the left of the minimization button.) click on it, and a window with a set of check boxes should pop up. uncheck directx10 and directx 11. click ok or save and click the play button again. the game should launch normally. hope this helps!",130.0

"i played that game before it went on steam. i went through the whole grinding hell. then they decided to bring out a new update and changed all my super rare items to common item. my characters that was able to finish the highest lvl solo wasnt able anymore to finish lvl in the mid range of difficulties. i stoped playing. come back yesterday after years. and the game is now even more ed up and the grind managed to get worser. there are alot better f2p games. dont download",192.8

"very good game! at first it will be boring to collect all the resources to get the wanted weapon, but when youll get the weapon the fun starts!",28.1
"its a great game. whoever says its pay to win lies. you dont have to spend any cent on the game, and tbh you can get all the items without spending a single penny. i did and i can do any mission on the game without problems. only problem it has is that the end game might not be that great yet but it has plenty of updates and they care about players opinion and feedback. also the community is great. only drawback is the bugs, but hey is beta and most of the time (over 95% of the time) works fine. it has continous updates and events and also the alert system keeps you always busy. archwing (next patch) looks awesome. this game has great pontential and they wanna be sure to explore it. its an awesome game and its free... hope to meet you there!",856.0

( update ) after many hours of play i had a lot of fun but that fun has ended and i moved along, besides releasing a new warframe to try out ( as updated content ) it became a borefest same maps same gameplay same mobs, in the end nothing is there to keep you playing very short lived. however i would recommend giving it a try it is free after all, ( just keep your wallet in your pocket you wont be here long )",532.8

"seriously. this game may be in beta, but when it comes out to its final stages, youll bet you wont want to put this game down. it also tends to discourage others to pay to win for its high prices for platinum. overall, a great game.",164.5
"after many decades of grinding, i have finally reached the final stage....oh wait. 10.5/10 - ign 24/7 grind recommended",121.9

"it is an amazing game and is a great co-op activity.",10.2
"a fun an unique third person co-op game, warframe is an all around interesting and fun game with a slew of objective based game modes that pit you and your team of space ninjas against three factions: the space marines, an evil space corporation, and space zombies. there is an incredible selection of warframe classes to play, weapons to use, and challenging bosses to fight. the biggest downside of this game is the business model. as a free to play game, you need to sink about a hundred hours or more into it in order to unlock new weapons and classes by grinding for obsurdly hard to obtain resources, blueprints and credits. however, the fun fast-pased action is enough to carry the game through its failings. altogether, if youre looking for a neat co-op game to play, either solo or with friends, warframe is at least worth a look. since only frames and weapons are locked behind cash walls, there is pleanty of game content to enjoy here.",256.3

"ultra-fast-paced dungeon crawling, mmo, rpg, shooter, hack-n-slash. a robust tutorial to make the tiresome and difficult early game easier and a very expansove end-game round out this package. pros: graphics; if graphics are your thing this will deliver, absolutly gorgeous maxxed, but youre going to need a decent computer pros; armory: there are tons of different weapons to choose from pruimary, secondary and melee. cons: armory; once you find the warframe and weapons that let you win, it gets old really fast. community: the community is great when its not awful . rumors of devs having a secret war against one clan or another seem unfounded on the surface as the devs and the community at large are helpful in all ways to both new (and long time gone) players.",414.0

"an amazing game, gameplay is nearly flawless... nearly allot of possible manuvers hard to learn all. fantastic blend of learning curve and style",98.3
"this game is posetively beautiful and i can attest from the beta stages when i initially joined it was great and still it. it went under a lot of changes to make it what it is now and i think it is totally worth it. all nessecary items in the game can be earned with in game currency, no pay-to-win-esque style things. the only items that require payment are completely cosmetic.",459.3
"this game is pretty fun however it gets boring since the maps are reused",95.5
"very excellent freegame. watch the trailer and be amazed",56.6
"one of the best casual fighting games ive ever played. free to play, friendly communities and team spirit is highly valued. the only downside is bugs... they do exist. however, we can look at it on another point of view... this is a work in progress game. always adding new stuff for players! well done guys!!!",1315.9
"this looks and plays far better than a free game has any right to be. all the designs for players and enemies alike are absolutly fantastic with a very organic look and feel to them that ive not seen in a sci-fi setting before which really adds a unique look and feel to the game. its sort of repettitive but the randomly generated maps and solid gameplay make it fun to play never the less, and you can easily spend just 10 minutes on a game or 8 hours. they support this game with regular updates so theres always something new. even though it runs off of micro-transactions its not so much a pay to win game as you can unlock and build most of the weapons and warframes just by playing the game. i feel its more fun and rewarding to build it yourself instead of buying it, but i tossed them $5 because i figure this game has given me at least 5 dollars worth of fun :p",150.2
"the game started off very fun with it having some pretty solid combat but unfortunately that can only get you so far. it ended up being the way of vindictus, the combat was amazing but the content was lacking. all the stages are pretty much the same and it gets extremely repeatative rather quickly. however, for some people it could be something new and fun to play.",26.2
"good to see how much harder it is to exploit glitches... even if i do miss them... the good ol days... :,(",455.2

"space ninjas in space with space guns. thats basically what i say the game is to people that have no clue about it. and i love this game. sure it has its fault, suich as f2p meaning nothing, you still need to spend at least $20 on it eventually. but other than that, the devs are nice, the community is good. and its all in a ll fun to play. the gamer itself is really neat, even though its a beta, its still a very decent game. a lot of fun killing times, granted its not very heavy on the lore, but its still a good game. its sort of like minecraft, you dont understand it, but you still get addicted to it at some point or another. the weapons are cool, and the fact that you put on a different suit and it gives you these awesome abilities, makes it fun. you can customize the play style to however you want it to be. stealthy, bum rush, magic. its all there. so check it out. it wont cost you anything to start, but if you get into it, a little investment to help out these awesome devs is totally worth it.",413.6

"warframe is one of the most addictive games out on the market today. its mainly a co-op pve game but does have pvp in form of conclaves, small team matches. you can choose from a variety of warframes, which are powered exoskeletons with designs based on evangelion. all your weapons, sentinels, and frames are heavily customizable with many colors and addons to choose from. the game has hundreds of weapons to choose from and all are unique. it also features beautiful maps and challenging bosses. its a game that looks good even on the lower settings and has nice lighting. login rewards are also generous and sometimes you might get 40% off to even 75% off your next purchase. its not a pay-to-win game as anything you can get can be acquired in game, including platinum through trading.",418.2

"warframe is third person shooter co op action multiplayer game were the protagonists are the tennos a kinda ninjas from space but theyre not aliens they are humans trying to get back to their power the solar sistem that is conquisted by a variety of bosses and powerful normal enemys so if you like third person shooter games you should play warframe ninjas play free!!!",592.0
"this game haz guns and swords and people shooting and swording so i think its a pretty good game if you like swording people in half/3 pieces. i like 3 pieces of chicken but not always. i like it spicy. also this game has robots but you kill them and they are hard. they have guns. robots are cool.",41.7
"warframe is a fun, yet somewhat laggy free to play co-op game. the quality is amazing and the visual design kicks , gameplay is fairly simple (sort of like mass effects combat, but without the cover system and rpg elements) but fun and its probably the first f2p game that doesnt feel like a rip-off its good!",1.4
"warframe its realy my favourite free game!!! its coop, free and i love its plot!!!",1276.5
"this game is very fun to play with your friends. a bit like borderlands but less randomness and more tactics . (i prefer borderlands :p ) the diffrent missions can be completed in diffrent ways . you can either come in all guns blazing or do the entire mission by stealth, using only your sword. after the first missions you might be a bit bored but after a few hours , when you have customized your character to make it personal , you have an arenal that your pleased with , and when you leave mercury (because you are always stuck on spaceships/earth and the other planets are more beautiful to play in ), the game will progressively be more fun. at some point (when you are a reasonable lvl) you can raid and do instances , online with random players or just your friends... the mod system (you mod your weapons so they become stronger) is very confusing for begginers but after a while you will get the hang of it , and its preeety dope.. i recommend this game to everyone .",52.1

"i have put in nearly 200 hours and still counting. i quite fancy this game. the different environments and classes of enemies bring some interesting variety to the table. all the maps are randomly generated so farming for those materials to build weapons or new frames isnt quite as tedious. equippable mods can make you that super serious player to kick some bum or that silly player that shoots exploding arrows which just might kill you too. this game is still in beta so things are constantly changing! whichever your play style, i believe that there is a little bit for most everyone to enjoy this game. not enjoying it? try playing with friends! :) 9/10",185.5

"for a game that is still nominally in beta, i have had ridiculous amounts of fun in warframe. squad-based 4-player mission instances across many amazing tilesets, with an incredible range of weapons and frames (exoskeletons) to use. multiple mission types, looting, crafting, mastery ranks, clan spacestations, clan conflicts, events, and more. the dev team is highly connected to the playerbase in a way i havent seen in other games. updates are normally weekly, hotfixes are rapid when theres an issue, and lets not forget the devstreams. who doesnt want to be a space ninja? whether you are bending the forces of magnetism, setting the world on fire or teleporting to every enemy in the room and backstabbing them all at once, i hope you enjoy your new addiction.",1110.9

"updated review: this game has become unplayable for solo players, practically every mission is near impossible to win for the solo player!!",299.7
"pure grinding. the grinding emphasis is so strong that most games are just people running through the levels, ignoring all enemies, to the end to finish the stage and get the rewards. new players will be lost as they try to fight and actually play the game. it becomes a look how fast i can run through this stage simulator. graphics are cool, story is cool, gameplay idea is cool. though everything got exploited into a weird grindy running game. many people will enjoy this, no doubt. i didnt get hooked though, and i love grindy games.",1.4
"this game is surprisingly addictive, and its pretty incredible the amount of content you get for free. you can play as a number of different warframes and build so many items. lots of mods allow you to enhance your build even further, such as being able to add elemental damage to weapons. overall, a great game to play with friends or online!",620.7

"the recent changes to melee makes this game great.",179.0
"easily one of my favourite free-to-plays, due to the nature of the in-game purchases and how much fun it is to grind levels/gear. i actually cant think of another ftp game that is fun to grind. runescape was probably only the other fun game going back to its classic days, but even that has basically become pay-to-play, disregarding the fact that they still advertise it as a ftp game. you can aquire anything in the game without real world money, and it isnt ludicriously hard like it is in competitor games. furthermore, your far better to spend your money on additional warframe (characters/suits) and weapon slots as initially you are pretty strapped for space. however by the time you reach these limits you will know if your money is worth it. keep it mind however that the slots are incredibly cheap aswell, for 2 weapon slots sell at at 12p (p is platinum, the ingame premium currency), and 1 warframe slot a tad more expensive at 20p. definately give this game a try if you havent already, it wont cost you a cent - literally!",348.9

"i recommend this game as a time waster. look at all the negative reviews first of all. do you see how much time theyve all spent playing this game and they gave it a dont recommend.i just started playing and the first 5 games i played were tons of fun with people. if you play this alone however it gets very lonely and that gun of yours looks really friendly. all jokes aside its a fun game at first then youll be bored to hell is what im guessing because there are people with 2.000 hours on record that play this game and give it a negative review. i will say that this is mostly pay to win from the get go because most if not all items in the shop need platinum to buy, but that really doesnt hinder youre experience that much since most items are cosmetics. yeah not really most weapons need platinum to buy and the weapons you can buy are locked with an xp something. im guessing you need to go to a certain level. i have just started playing it and its fun for me and i hope that itll be fun for you too. remember its ffffffffrrrrrrrrrrreeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!!!!!!!!!!!!!! so theres really no reason to complain. if you dont like it give it a negative and tell us why, but if i catch you with over 24 hours of game time then i know yo enjoyed it for the most part.",2.2

"overall this is a nice game to play whenever you have free time however the game itself is extremely tedious and occasionlly boring whenever you try to play alone. if you do want to pick this game up i advise that you play with a friend so that it will be more entertaining. otherwise here are the games pros and cons. pros: -nice diversity in characters & weapons to choose from and use - graphics are nice to look at (especially at max settings) - blood and gore is always a plus - can use in-game currency to buy warframes(characters) and weapons - you never feel like the game is pay to win cons: - in order to obtain new warframes and weapons in-game without buying them you have to buy the blueprints, obtain all of the materials to craft said item via the games crafting system and crafting times are fairly long ranging anywhere from 12-70 hours in real time also you have to do all of this with in-game currency. - level designs are incredibly repetative as you will see the same level designs several times over the course of your playthrough. - two leveling systems profile leveling/character&weapon leveling. yes in order for your weapons and characters to be at max power you have to level them up first also leveling your profile takes a huge amount of time. - certain weapons are level locked so in order to craft or even buy them you first have to level up your profile to the required level. - game can feel like a huge grind especially when playing alone.",408.9

"its an ok game. its not bad. there are may worse games out there, and to be honest, this one is actualy kind of fun. you dont need very much skill to be good at it, and it really is a pay to win game, but even if you dont, that just means itll take about 10 times as long to do stuff. i wont harp on that though, as most games are like that anyway. the graphics are really good, the environments are well thought out, and no two maps are the same, because every map is randomly generated. the ai is pretty , but they make up for it with insane accuracy. the warframes are also fun to mess around with, and the wepons are cool. this isnt a game i recommend if you want a challenge, i recomend this game to people who want to beat the living hell out of thousands of underpowerd enimes while using superpowers like lightning, fire, wind, death itself, or a shrukin (suprised me to).",181.5

((cap. obvious here)) on the down side the enemys are really dull the game can get some what repetitive with escort quest , defend this while wating for that, but dont let that cloud your mind warframe is still an amazing game and if you have the chance defitenly check it out",4.6
"fantastic game. interesting and unique abilities and warframes. solid mechanics, good pacing, really fun movement and satisfying sword/gun play. there is no paying for power, the only things purchasable with cash (platinum) that relate to power can be found or crafted in-game. cash exclusive items are as youd expect purely cosmetic. the only downside (which in my opinion is nothing worth crying about), are the waiting times. when crafting items the wait can be either 12 or 24 hours depending on the item being crafted. [a whopping 72 hours if crafting a waframe]. this can of course be rushed for cash much like a mobile game.",142.3

"initially looked at warframe because i had nothing really to do until dark souls ii released. though after playing for a while i found that the game is very enjoyable albeit micro transactions if you want extreme customization (i.e skins more color options or heads) the game does start you off with 50 or so platinum which is enough to buy an acessory or color set which is cool. there are very few things you cant get unless you pay for, you can pay to unlock weapons without needing to grind for parts which is good in all some weapons might require you to be a certain rank to be able to even buy the blueprint for (in game currency of course) or alternativly you can buy them with irl cash. getting new characters can sometimes be taxing but in the long run its worth the time it taxes to construct the new character ( 12 hours for each of the 3 pieces then 72 for the actual character). daily rewards are very nice as well you can get anything from 50% of your next platinum purchase to weapon blueprints or even exp/affinity/credit boosters. all in all warframe is a very fun game to play.....crap now that i think about it i didnt even mention the gameplay o.o",88.0

"warframe is a great sci-fi thirdperson shooter. the shooting feels great playing in the suits or warframes feels great. the abilities are fun to use. and it seems to run fine on my old laptop. the game is still being updated and there are events quite often. there is actually a story in the game, not the best, not the worst. the game uses a easy-to-use card-based modding system to up your abilities, weapons etc. plus: -great variety of weapons and warframes. -everything in the game can be get without purchasing, except warframe and weapons slots. -you get 70 platinum (in-game currency.) to use when starting. i recommend spending them on weapon and warframe slots. -clan system and customisable dojo. -big and easy-to-use card-based modding system to upgrade your gear. -lots of different planets and missions. -play with your friends using the in-game invitation system or play with random people via the in-game matchmaking. -randomly generated levels. cons: -the levels are randomly generated but they look the same a lot. -the prices in the shop are sometimes absurd. -a few bugs and glitches here and there but the game is in openbeta. -some of the mechanics are sometimes unexplained. like the parcour mechanic. -foundy crafting is really irritating. -joining a session via matchmaking is sometimes pretty irritating and sometimes just doesnt work. the game is still receiving updates and new weapons, warframes etc. i give this game a 8.5/10.",37.7

"what more is there to do than recommend this game? first of all, its free to play. this means you dont have to pay money to play it. it does not mean it will run like those flash-games that represented what was free to play just 5 years ago. (although free to play used in the manner as it is used in warframe it means you can play without paying, but paying could make the experience better. nonetheless, as a non-paying user, i think for myself that it plays just fine for free.) warframes looks are equal to or better than most aaa releases and the gameplay is likewise. it might take more than a few hours of playing it to understand how to work it properly, and it doesnt always tell you excactly how to pull off every move, but this also leaves a lot of room for experimentation, which i think is one of the points where this game shines rather brightly. if you like ninjas, sci-fi, shooters, stealth actions or slashers, warframe is likely to hit you in at least one good spot.",18.4

"great game. my only problem is that i cant restart. if you play this make your character wisely unless you want to have tomake a new warframe acount to restart. plus you can only have 1 account per email. that means to restart you have to create a new email so you can use it to make an account. other then that it a great game.you can be sneaky or go in guns blazing. probably best to chose the right build for sneak or guns blazing.",33.6
"this game has nice graphics and the gameplay is fun. however, theres a reason why this is still in beta. after playing for a week or two youll see that pretty much all the missions are quite similar. sure there are different ones like extermination and survival, but most of them end in getting the task done and then running back to extraction. also, this game is a complete grindfest. the devs put up ridiculous prices so you either have to buy the item or you have to grind for days in order to get it. however, if you do get your item, it usually takes days for it to be ready. a new warframe takes three days. three! and you need three components (which all take a day each to build) in order for you to move on to the main blueprint (takes 3 days to build). so this game emphasizes on you either having money or time. but yeah, not much content or backstory either. i seems interesting enough, but its so vague. i would just play this for a week and then get on with your life.",156.7

"while this game is fun and action packed, it can get extremely repetative and pointless. the game is fun to play with friends, but it can be absolutely mind-numbing to play by yourself. pros -great graphics and lots of shiny environments -action packed -the different warframes have a few unique elements that make for some fun gameplay -in theory, you can build the warframes (the ones you would usually have to buy) cons -game is super grindy -environments, while pretty, become stale after a while. you are basically in the same 4 or 5 different environments with slightly different layouts -the system to level up cards to gain powers is interesting, but again the grind... -little to non-existant story -certain warframes are completely unbalanced (namely the ones you have to buy) -most things worth building take forever to create this was a fun game, but at the end of the day i cant recommend it. theres way too much grind and not enough going on behind the scenes. this is a fun little coop game to play with your friends, but youll quickly start to feel the repetition as you reach the 10-15 hour mark. there are some games that are super grindy but hide it well behind interesting gameplay, a good story, or a variety of builds to work towards. this game is not one of them.",56.3

(ps4) or in steam big picture mode. the plus side and down side is that it is free to play. you get to enjoy a good game for nothing but if you want anything more than bare bones content you need to buy it and the content prices are a bit high. just look at the dlc prices... geez. (dec 2013) i think if i can get into this game i would be happy to throw some bucks their way to support it. i guess i am a potential investor like all new players.",4.5

"this is a really fun shooter. at the moment it is completely free, sure if you want some color customizations you need platinum (the cashable currencey) but that platinum can be farmed by selling mods or blueprints. anyway, the game is nice and well paced. the controls need a bit getting used to but otherwise its a borderlands-halo mashup with some extra mobility and less humor. the different warframes give you various playstyles. from tank to ninja everything is in there. if you like good shooters with lots of different weapons and mods and you dont mind serious grinding, then youll enjoy this. if youre not a big fan of grinding you probably wont like this game unless you want to invest real money, since your base weapons arent all that great, like in any game youve played you have to put some effort in it to get the good stuff. if you have to break it up into pros and cons it would probably look a bit like this; pros: - good shooter - large variety of modifications for warframe and weapon - multiple playstyles possible - free to play design well made - nice graphics cons: - controls need getting used to neutral - grind heavy - fast paced to sum it up short its pretty much space ninja grinding asap.",888.4

"has lots of potential but, in my opinion, falls flat because of its repetitive third person action/shooter gameplay, which is nice in the beginning. but after ten missions or so (which usually range from 15-45 minutes i guess) youre starting to think that maybe youve seen all this game has to offer already. rest assured, theres tons of loot to find so theres plenty to come back for. you just have to accept that theres not much variety and the fact that people get lost frequently because of the terrible level designs. which is not good for a game that focuses on co-op. not a bad game per se, but just not my cup of tea.

"this game -- what can i say? its simply (and more) amazing! the graphics looks very fine (though the game needs more ability optimize), the gameplay is smooth and great (if your computer/laptop is better than my laptop) and... its just a really great game. warframe, being a 3rd person shooter (coop/singleplayer), i thought, could never be that good of a game... or can it? well, the answer is yes, it can, and it definitely blasted through my expectations. this is a game worth playing with your friends (really, the coop experience is exhilarating to the max), and definitely a game that will last long in your/your friends book. 9.8/10, would play again... and again... and again... and again -- you get the picture. try it. its fun. what more can i say.",11.7
"i have to say that for a free-to-play game, this is really fun. if you like to run/ slide everywhere whilst slicing up enemies then this game is for you. if you like to just shoot them then this can be for you too.",491.5
"recommend this game because it is very interesting how the fighters fight and shoot their weapons at the guys! it isnt like any regular shooting game where u just shoot a gun, these guys have special abilities and also have swords instead of knifes! there are strong but slow moves and fast but weak moves! a lot of interesting attacks!",0.9

"this game provides everything that i needed to really get into computer gaming.",14.2
"an exciting action game with lots of different weapons and warframes to choose from. interesting upgrade mechanics and addictive loot gathering will keep you coming back for more, but eventually the lack of mission and enemy variety will start to make playing feel like a grind. due to the cooperative nature of the game, and the fact that the items not available to free players are only aesthetic, it never feels like paying is necessary in order to advance. a lot of content does require a significant time investment to reach however, and the option to pay allows players to access things a bit sooner. overall a great game, and with updates still coming out, im eager to see what the future has in store.",906.3
"its a pretty good game, its smooth, yet you can get lost easily, it has alot going for it in the player clan department like designing your own dojo is nice. ever sense i first started in update 3, so much has changed, its harder, and confusing. but easy to get the hang of, i reccomend using a controller to play this game. only flaw i truly see with this game is the fact it takes forever to build any of the gear in this game",95.9
"very good game looks great they put alot time into everything !! i only wish they make it a freeroam mmo later down the road or add spaceship fights into !! then it would be crazy good !!",499.7
"honestly, with it being still in beta, i am massively impressed by the brilliant graphics, great gameplay, sick weapons and skins, the being able to not be pay-to-win and most of all; by the best community that i have ever seen in any mmo ever! i already played this game so much and i hope that i will maintain playing this amazing game!",334.2
"imagine this as halo 3, but with more customization and in 3rd person.",132.7
"great graphics and a fun co-op experience attempt to make up for a terrible ai system and repetetive gameplay and maps. controls work well, yet there isnt many combat options. this game would be definitly recommended for anyone who is broke, has a bunch of friends, and some time to kill. 6.8/10",29.6

"best f2p game so far... everyone should own this!!!",9.8
"such an awesome game but mostly need money to become stronge because most item need platinums to be purchased and thats a problem for player from diffrent country.",15.8
"warframe is unique. it is unique because all of the weapons and warframes are craftable and easy to obtain. most free-to-play games these days are pretty much pay to win and people who pay have an advantage over the people who dont pay. the game offers hours of fun and the satisfaction of building a new warframe is unbeatable. the enemy ai is alright and does have 1-2 bugs or glitches every so often. the wide range of guns and warframes offer more fun and playstyles to the game, be it charging head first into battle, taking a stealthy approach or using the op paris prime or synapse to decimate your foes. each warframe offers unique abilities such as absorbing damage and being nearly invincible while using the rhino, or using nova to completely kill everything in your path with her antimatter abilities. overall, the game is very fun and players are always willing to help you out, but with the ability of being a bit repetitive and sometimes boring with an op setup. i give this game 8/10. this game deserves a reccomendation.",173.6
"this game is the best i have ever played. its a really well made game, and its fun to play with friends, and also play alone. amazing deals on the real world currency money (platinum) and good combat system. remember ninjas play free.",613.4
"you ninja things and sometimes win sometimes lose but you lose less when you win and get better and less scrubby, and crafting takes a long  time unless you pay monnies you rich person what do you think because you have money youre better than other space zombie ninjas? jerk. this has been a professional review by me. final review score; 9/10 i guess this game is okay.",811.7
"its very gud game would recommend 10/10 -billy mays",69.5
"call of duty? battlefield? halo!? what are those!? 10/10 best shooter.",50.3

"its a good game dont get me wrong but.... its not for everyone.... you will jump in and enjoy it for like the first 6 missions but then you realize how much damn grinding there is and then how tedious and boring it actually gets... graphics=10 voice acting=8.7 gameplay=6.2 mechanics=7.6 overall worth value .play this if there is like literally nothing at all to play.",2.0
"fast pace game that can be difficult to learn, but it wont take to long. the game is fun with friends, because you can all do a mission completely silent without someone you dont know comes in and ruins it. besides its ninjas who could hate this game?",4.6
"one of the best free to play games out there.. you can basically get everything without spending a dime on it..",686.7

"it never ever lags, its completely free, it will keep getting better as you play it, there is so much more than just the trailers and pictures. what can i say, get it! its awesome!",234.3
"this game, as every other game in steam, was created in true korea, so i recommend it. death to all who oppose us",9.7
"*sigh* i have a love/hate relationship with this game. you know the term carry in the context of a multiplayer game? well, the graphic and audio teams carry this game. its a goregeous game, in both rendering and design. the space ninja aspect is unique, and the game truly succeeds at making the player feel like a badass. however, i hate to say this, but it feels like the game designers just dont understand game mechanics. every update is two steps forward, one step back. systems are implemented with serious balance problems and left uncorrected. difficulty is an ongoing mess, with 99% of the game being ridiculously easy, and %1 being impossible. new bugs are introduced all the time, and some very serious bugs have been around for several months, with no acknowledgement form the devs. that being said, i cant not reccomend this with a good concience. it has provided me too many hours of entertainment and deserves acknowledgement for it. play it casually, and it will treat you right. dig too deep, however, and the dev team will end up dissapointing you over and over again.",1106.5
"this game is.. very unfriendly for new users, first few steps are easy to play. and looks like enjoyable. but after that, suddenly player need hard effort for game. fast reflexes, understanding of warframe, mod, and many things. if you finally got something know-how about this game, still game is too uncomfortable and stressful. repeat same mission over and over again for resources to make warframe, weapons.... and because of this too hard leveling, there is no new users to play regular. just oldbies who wanna new equinpment update, not a new users. so, if you cant find a friends or clan in game, you must solo in every mission to unlock mission nod. thats very painful. and sometimes impossible for one user. eventually i dont recommend this game for new players who wanna fun with action game. and this game is not a fresh thing, its old, almost 2 years. but still didnt change a basic problem, just updating new gear for oldbies like ventilator to dying man.",260.1
"i found it to be very original, and always a good source for an hour of fun, then it simply stopped working",28.8

"a free-to-play game worth all the time and effort. a variety of items to use, to build, to get,... you can never tire from its gameplay. ever expanding, only time will tell when it will stop. worth all the money too if you were to spend on the in-game items.",442.0
"warframe is a great game to play with friends, since it is very much a co-op game and teamwork is essential for success. on top of everyting, its free! also, this is not a pay to win game, since all in-game items can be crafted or won in in-game events without spenidng a dime. the graphics are great, and sometimes i just play because of them! though there is no actual story, there are planets, items, guns, clans, and anything needed to make this a great sci-fi game thatll give you hourse of fun! just beware, if your computer is very slow, lag may affect gameplay.",151.1
"warframe is a unique game. i havent seen many games which give you this kind of control over a character, nor so many customization options. every time you go into a mission you have an infinite number of possibilities for how to tackle it. different loadouts are more successful than others, and that will depend on the mission youre taking on and your playstyle. the character-building aspect, although there are no skill points to spend, is deeper than most mmos, and i think its a good change. everyone is on a level playing field, and the most hardcore veteran still has a few frames that he hasnt maxed for the times when he wants to let others pick up the slack for a change. the game exudes polish and charm, and playing it doesnt get old very quickly. high replay value, tons of content to play through, highly reccomend giving it a day or two of play. the games only weakness is its learning curve, but tough it out and youll find a game thats easy to play but hard to master.",529.9

"i am very new to this game but already i am enjoying it very much. great co-op game and lots of fun. one of the most entertaining ones out there when it gomes to free games! if you enjoy co-op shooter games a lot then i recommend you give this a try.",32.5
"awesome combat, good amount of customization on everything, and really fun co-op. also theres a decent amount of stuff to do and a bunch of warframe classes to choose from that will suit almost any playing style...",4.9
"incredibly fun, although it is repetative, each time you play it feels like a different game.",577.1
"good, fun game. the keystrokes are simple and easy to pick up. so if youre new to pc gaming, dont be afraid to give this a chance. even for the vet. players the story (from what ive played) is good. its key focus is team work. soloing can be done... but trust me. working with others is the way to go. hours of fun, easy to pick up, many play styles to pick from. a good game.",6.1
"great game! good gameplay and its quick and easy to get the hang of.",13.0

"i recommend, but with the caveat that it needs more work. the initial instructions on what to do are kind of shoddy, which leads you to be matched up with people who have absolutely no clue what the hell they are doing. 10 minutes later youre screaming at them to extract just so you can end the mission. i am pretty sure that after i get out of noob central i shall enjoy the  out of this game",59.3

"sprint, slide, slash while sliding, slide after slash, slash after slide and repeat. whoosh whoosh whoosh",7.0
"this is one of a rare few f2p game that i would really recommend. the development studio really is involved in the games community and takes what they have to say very seriously. if you are looking for a great way to unwind, with lots of running-n-gunning and hack-n-slash wall running, ninja craziness all taking place in a dystopia future of our solar system, then this is a game for you!",1260.7

"i still cant believe this game is for free even after a few years of playing this game",8.6
"awesome game! nothing else can resume what this game is, simply awesome. i have played this for 200+ hours already and it is simply awesome. and best of all, its a game where you can trully play free without being hindered in any way. sure, you will not get some things quite as easily, but you can still get them if you try. this game has action, speed, powers, awesome guns, ninjas, swords, axes, daggers, all the awesome things you expect from a tps (third-person shooter) sci-fi game. surely, it can get a bit repetitive if you only play missions, however, now they have installed a brand new pvp system, so, as some would say, pvp matches are never the same. with that in mind, we could say that this game lasts forever!",117.5
"a while ago, i used to play this a lot. i had the same stock weapons for a long time, because its so hard to get a new weapon. when i finally got a new weapon (it was expensive), it sucked. i dont want to grind. but when i did grind, i got a cool gun. then my computer broke. rip",30.5
"great game, but i dont like this game update because its so huge.",63.7
"great game. you can play the game completely free and just pay for pimp factors.",88.5
"this game is a good game if it works i had this game a couple months now and havnt been able to play because of the evolution engine. if it works for you youll love this game p.s. can someone fix this game i want to play it",6.3
"its a simple 3rd person shooter that feels like youre playing by yourself even when you arent. i got on and played a round alone and it was just lacking something, but it was alright. then i tried out the online game play and this is where i would take a few things into consideration before using up hard drive space. the idea of the game, after reading up is that every unit is individual and contributes to the larger team effort in a unique way. great concept! however it falls so flat that one might believe that it was tossed off the top of the empire state building. it turns into a run and outgun frag fest where all you end up doing if trying to get the most kills and score the most loot while leaving everyone else behind. the exp has nothing to do with team preformance or teamwork and instead only values the indiviual. thus turning what could be a great teamwork experience into super mario party with guns.",1.7
"this is one high graphiced game with a great story line love it",18.0
"you get to be a space ninja with awesome special abilities. you use those special abilities, and an impressive arsenal of weapons, to slaughter robots, zombies, and space marines. and its just so satisfying.",280.7
"i would recommend this game if youlike sci-fi mmo, sure most of the missions might require 2 people sometimes to get past a  of a boss but the style and feel of the game makes up for it with its mix of hack and slash and shoot em ups not to mention its a good game for a free to play title",4.4
"warframe is mass effects gameplay combined with halos versatility meshed together with left 4 dead 2s cooperative teamwork. this game is the epitamy of f2p games in my opinion with a very good model. anything that you can buy with real money can be acquired in game for free, and the best equipment cannot be bought at all. this game is easily my favorite one to play and i highly recommend you try it out.",812.3
"its a really good game to play with friends. as well with strangers but there lacks a lot of fun. only downside of the game is that it kinda feels repeatable in way your mission dont really change that much its straight up go in kill/collect/protect that and thats it.",6.5
"*farm for x amount of time to get warframe blueprints you want* f*cking final-youre out of a certain resource *farm x amount of time to get required resources* f*cking final-you need to craft the parts *12 hours later* f*cking final-you need to wait 3 days for the warframe to be built *3 days later* f*cking finally i can play with this damn warframe in the end you dont even like that particular warframes playstyle rinse and repeat",55.3
"i left this game for some months and came back to feel the awesomeness again, started over with a new account, and i had a lot of fun seeing all of these new changes like the cutscenes and the badass intro, the dynamic weapon selection that allows you to choose unlike before, and the characters look very cool and have a lot of unique abilities.",149.9
"this game has come a looooong way since they first started. at first it was like were robot ninjas in space and now its literally robot ninjas in space with super powers, guns, and dogs. starting nearly powerless you grow into a powerful warrior if youre willing to give it a go. i do recommend that you play with friends though, this is pretty harsh to solo players",341.2

"if you like ninjas/aliens, this is a game for you. youre a complete badass with a sword, primary and secondary weapon. most items are able to be collected in game, instead of having to buy everything (free to play cliche). if you want to build items instead of buying them, it takes time to gather the materials and the building itself takes a ton of time, but is worth it in the end. super fun, especially when with a group of friends. at first it can get repetitive, but the more you play and earn better items and new planets, it becomes more fun that it was when you started. overall, great game!",16.9

"i will open this game with the fact that everything in this game takes one of two things: patience or money. almost everything in this game can be earned for free if you are luck enough to find it or see the alert mission in the hour it is up. people say this game is pay to win. paying is a definate advantage, but it isnt everything. if you dont mind working for your success, this game may be for you. warframe is a third-person shooter based on high mobility combat and a high variety of weapons and abilities. from invincibility to massive anti-matter explosions, this game may have everything wanted in a primarily cooperative shooter. you play as a tenno, effectively a space ninja set out to maintain the balance of our galaxy in the distant future. you start from the center (mercury) and move outword while gaining power and money. everything from your warframe (your ninja suit of armor that gives you four abilities) to your weapons upgrade by killing enemies and completing missions. at the time of this post, i have logged almost 300 hours into this game. i have tried loads of weapons and watched as the developers release patch after patch improving this game as it is still in beta. the enemies are challenging and weapons are very dependent on farming credits and mods to improve them. if you want a game that has one of the best communities in a free to play games that i have seen, the variety in this game will not let you down.",736.2

"its so funnnnnnnnnn on a serious note it is a very fun space/ninja 3rd person fps/hack and slash game everything is setup to run as groups of up to 4 tenno (players) co-oping against enemy ai to complete missions ranging from assassinations to wave based defense missions. if you like running around with friends killing mobs of enemies and unlocking new weapons/warframes/pets then this game is for you. even if you are interested in a stealth ninja experience many additions have made this possible although it is much harder to stay undetected than running in killing everything",421.7
"if you hate pay to win games you may not like this game at all, however, everything you can buy with real money (except vanity items and boosters) can be earned through grinding (though the grinding is pretty intensive), so if youre willing to put in the time, you may never have to spend a dime. however, i would recommend putting money in simply because this game is still in beta but plays like a released game, minus a handful of bugs. the gameplay itself very addictive and fun, especially if you like to play with others in a shooter-run-and-jump-melee-fight style. the videos here on the steam market just dont do the game any justice at all. but dont take my word for it, the game is 100% free to download with zero commitment so download the game and give a go some afternoon and judge for your self. heres a tip: if you do decide to try it, while the game is downloading, visit the warframe wiki. the game is still in beta and tells you very little on what to do outside of the basic controls so theres a pretty steep learning curve, but the wiki is chock full of info on every aspect of the game, this will give you a bit of direction and a heads up on whats happening and what you should be doing to start earning goodies.",34.7
"been playing this game for 2 years *hrs may not seem i have* and its been such a brilliant expirence 10/10 best f2p game",389.2
"dont listen to theses critics on metacritics. they judge to much about a game which is still in the beta phase! each month comes out a great patch! more and more will be added, i mean more events over the weekend, more blueprints to collect and craft. more planets with more levels. collect resources to craft items! the game has potential. we the players (tennos) have to develop the game with the developers. its a good game ... >:| silly metacritics, why you listen to those people who thinks they know more about the game then they actualy does!",453.6
"a fairly repetitive game, but it leaves you wanting more.",68.2
"this game is great i like the gameplay but i think games that are free to play try to make you buy things or it makes it harder for you too play untill you buy stuff that will help that is anoying but other then that its a good game",20.2
"its a very difficult game to play... but i like it... i guess. :p",4.0
"not much variety but its isnt a bad free to play game. you dont need to pay real world money to have fun but it will take longer to get stuff if you dont",12.1

"this game is awesome but there is a flaw the items i buy at the steam community market are not showing up in the game i hope this will be fixed or not this game would have been a 10/10 but because of that it is a 9/10",171.8
"if youre into the sci-fi genre video games, then this is the game for you. i downloaded this game despite the skeptisism from other reviews and i definitely do not regret it. it took a minute or two to get used to the different types of weapons and features the game offered but once you get the flow of the game you just cant find yourself to get away from it. what more could you want in a sci-fi co op slasher game, your a space ninja that basically recks house with a whole ninja aresenal and badass space ninja wizard powers. your basically goku and thor mashed together into one badass dude that s people up because hes so badass!",3.6
"considering that this is a great advantage for anyone to play a free to play game this isnt worth wating your time on.theres always going to be that one game thats says free to play but with a catch you have to use real money of credit card on the website or you can use some money from your steam bank to buy more plantinum thats the most thing that i hated this waste of my time peice of  game.yea sure it has good graphics and all but still the money thing still ticks me off eveytime i think of it.find otehr peoples recommendations after you play this waste of time game peice of  after you get the concept of it.its why its probably gonna get knocked off steam one of these days.",263.1
"warframe.... warframe you strange beast, youre repetitive, and obnoxious but damn i love you. i love you because the implications in your universe make me want to know how people live in that setting. combat is a bit choppy but well done, f2p is one of the better models (aside from a wait-to-progress gear and a few powerful frames being locked behind absurdly hard-to-unlock-bosses) updates have been both fleshing out the content and the universe, actual languages given to the inhabitants, unique bosses that are less reskins and more something that actually challenges- well, entertains at least. when i left in 2012, warframe was space-ninjas with unique powers fighting nebulous empires with bland-voiced stormtroopers. when i came back, i returned to a four-way galatic war, between a dogmatic corporate religion, a militarist legion of recursive clones, transhuman assassins struggling to retain their humanity, and an infestation so virulent that it makes the former three point their guns at it in unity. there needs to be some frickin books made about this game!",211.1
"this game is amazing, good graphics, good gameplay, never get bored.",935.4
"space ninjas vs space nazis and an evil version of apple. 69/69",991.6
"it handles like mass effect 3s multiplayer and if you squint, you might think youre playing a game set in the me universe. for a beta, this is a beefy game. lots of characters to play as and weapons to kill with. there are over 100 missions to complete on various planets. im loving this game. havent had a bored moment yet! dont be scared away by the free to play tag. it is definitely not pay to win. everything in the game is accessible to free players with the only strictly purchasable items being cosmetic. warframe is the shining example of a f2p game made with the players in mind. now with pets!",219.6
"ive been addicted to this game last couple of days, i came back to it more than a year latter, i played in beta but gave up shortly after since there were not that many players back then. since this is my first review here it goes. first things first it free to play, free, you dont have to pay a dollar to enjoy awesomeness of this game. its not pay to win, more like pay to look badass. graphics are really well done and mission design is absolutely beautiful. (i am not a big fan of instances, but i think it works best like that for this game). fast combat, parkour skills, variety of melee and ranged weapons (swords, bows, kunais ect.), a lot of planets, countless missions, many warframes to chose from every having its own unique stile of play. game is updating every few days with bug fixes and balances, things i dislike: - better and more balanced pvp and cephalon (allow more weapons and mods). - some bugs like falling trough elevator, getting stuck in invisible hole and damn i hate when i am climbing small box or a wall and just do backflip 20 metters behind into enemy lines. - it takes decade to craft something and when you find all parts then wait 12h to 3d (its realistic trough). - too addictive. i hope this helps you decide if to download and try game yourself (that you should totally do) or not. :d",96.8
"super ing awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",16.4
"great game for all skills upgrade system is hard to learn but once u do its very helpfull wide veriety of weps and skins evrything is able to be found in the game but thats the hard part",463.8

"great game! looks great, feels great, plays great. and still free. and finally coop !!! also the acorbatics in this game are amazing and fun! an must have game imo!",1280.7
"this is an amazing game thats expanding quickly. however if you dont like waiting at minum, 12 hours for most things to craft then it might get a bit boring. but you can usually manage you time fairly well to where its no big deal.",329.2
"super sweet 3rd-person shooter! controls and systems take time to get used to. the damage system has got a big learning curve, but once you do get it youre basically a god. almost everything in-game you can build, but there are some things that are exclusively pay to get. plus they give you some in-game premium cash when you start up- so all good (its dirt cheap if you want to buy some more). online interactions are pretty o.k. you get a squad most of the time, but you never truly stick with them cause of connection issues. without a good internet connections, your ethier lagging from your connection or someonelses. note: you actually need to join a clan to do crap in this game 0.0. probably cause some weapons are exclusive to clans. the gameplay gets repetitve after a while, due to the tidous farming and the same mission types over and over again. though there are a few random events that keep it fresh. the shooting mechanics are....well...... generic shooting mechanincs, nothing really special. unless of course, you count the warframe abilites. overall score: with its fun and social gameplay, and a few minor bugs and problems i give warframe a 9/10.",183.9
"i was a alpha tester for this game also a grand master founder(and if you sit for like 2 hours you can see my name on kappa) and i knew some of the devs ingame, the game just isnt good anymore.. it was a game of derping around having fun with friends as space ninjas then the addition to the void happened and it became a game about grinding more grindy than wow, then pwe bought majority shares and now there is pay gates on the features of the game.. like meele for example. it is impossible to reach any sort of progress on this game without spending money on microtransactions and there is a lot of microtransations.. i would ask for a refund, but i know it would be refused",868.8
"good game for evenings. it is kinda boring for me because we have to farm a lot, which is in my opinion boring. i recommend it for the gamers, who loves completing levels again and again, to get some materials ;p",17.4
"awesome first person shooter! fun to roll and shoot and wall jump and slice up people with your luminescent sword.",25.8
"this game can easily make you play for hour on end, leveling you warframe, weapons or just getting resources. the abilty to play along with your friends is a great thing aswell. seriously, who would want to play as some futuristic ninja and not have their friends along.",84.2
"suprisingly fun for a free to play game. at least until you get tired of grinding constantly for new weapons. still, worth a try.",74.4
"great game................need the level 2 badge, so yea..............",234.2
"very good gets boring after a while so get it but i have not got very far so its very boring.",50.7
"free to play? hells yeah it will give it a try. sadly there are pay-to-win aspects in the classic dual currency system. the game features an amazingly fun movement system, but do your reseach. not novice friendly at all for it takes so much time to get into. warframe is diablo meets prince of persia meets ninja gaiden meets rage meets mass effect.",30.5
"this game is an absolute must if you are looking for a quick and dirty third person shooter. from free running mechanics to a huge selection of weapons, this game features lots of customization options, great graphics, and a back-story that gets extremely strange when the fans have dealt with it. (space potatoes, anyone?) you can sink some real world money into this game, but it is far from required in order to progress. there are server errors from time to time and occasional disconnection issues. coming form a game in open beta though, warframe does a great job of offering what could very well be a finished project. sensors show a security force coming your way. its the grineer...",644.1
"i used to love this game. ive been playing since it was first released and it was amazing. but the 1.8 beta patch changed too much. and screwed over the older players. our amazing gear and suits lost that awesomeness and the game became pay-to-win. all in all it is a good game but not something i would recommend",2.4
"what can i say about this well it is fun dont get me wrong but at times it can feel like a big grind fest and at others it gets repeative but once you get past that this game opens up to a whole new world of fun with constant updates and the devs keeping hotfixes and things i recomend this to anyone that wants a new experence",351.4
"great third person, futuristic, assasins creed kind of game",32.2

"move along people, its overrated. if you go f2p, the wait for zephyr with a new clan will be almost 2 weeks if we add the casual grinding. you have been warned.",1275.6
"had one of those matrix like moments where at high speed i dove off a balcony firing dual pistols backwards at a gigantic space monstrosity and im coming to the conclusion that for a free2play co-op shooter, warframe is a hard one to top.",664.7
"i dont know why i like it but i find my self very attracted to this game",5.3
"this game has a very intuitive gameplay style which is one of many addictive aspects of the game. its an open beta game completely free where you get to play as space mercenaries called the tenno who are a group of super space ninjas. listen guys.. let me put it this way.. free space ninjas get it get it!",684.3
"very nice game, it has nice sword moving and karate moves, epic co op game too.",9.3
"ninjas. shooting aliens and robots. with tech and . 11/10 proper review, pardon my english : this game is fully free to play with slow and steady pace towards full geared. with many different ninjas that you could get for free by grinding bosses. mostly content for premium users is costumes and , but wait, you could half of those by some random event in-game and premium users items is just for a quick good game. therefore i conclude this game is fully free to play by an exception, you couldnt get all of those cool looking ninjas and weapons in your inventory because you could only add slots with microtransaction. the community is great i think, dev is supportive too, i got a quick responses for wanting to change my e-mail id. so i have been enjoyed for about 300+ hours of fun smacking the enemies with so many interesting abilities. the missions could be repetitive and boring but random generated map negates it a bit. therefore anyone who enjoyed tps-games should give this a try, nothing to lose.",279.1

"amazing 3rd person shooter, definatly play it... nowwwww",0.5
"have been playing this since launch and it has become quite the game. the customization is insane and while a bit grindy matches with friends are a lot of fun. if you like space ninjas, try this game. even if you dont like them, its free. although not nessecary i would suggest a small payment after you feel out the game (if you like it that is) - starting out can be hard and by the time you know what you want you probably have spent time earning other things so. you still have to level up anything you get but its nice to just have a reliable weapon or something to get you through the upgrade process of other things. that is not much to ask tho for a game you can try for free lol",78.9
"warframe - one of the best hack n slash, action-packed, parkour-ridden games ever created. the graphics are splendid, as it goes with a space, star-warsy feel. it offers a wide variety of arsenal that can be used in battle. different kinds of characters, wide array of weapons, paints, and many more. in a nutshell, this is a must-try and a will-stay-and-love game. hands down to the devs and creators of this game. youve made the one of the best games in existence.",65.5
"this is a beautiful looking game and the gameplay is ok but it falls with almost everything having to be bought with money.",5.5
"its a third-person shooter, you have multiply ways of how you want to kill your enemies, with your characters abilities, primary/secondary/melee weapons, in which expans in almost each major update, you can also have a pet or a sentinel with their own unique uses for different things. there are many characters to pick but first you have to unlock them by either buying them or get the components from boss fights and then after getting 3 different components you build your character which takes time and the currency in the game. you can play with people or solo if you prefer it.",433.2

"excellent game but it is still in progress so you may find some bugs.",1102.3
"do you wish to grind for weeks to get one nwe item? months for a warframe? years for anything else? well then this game is for you! 3 runs of a level and you will know the other maps like the back of your hand! everything looks the exact same, the layouts are not really that random, its grindy, its repetative and there is no feeling of progression whatso ever. why you ask? because there is a cash shop, and they want you to buy from there to get the best items and warframes and such you can. the new ui causes so much frame lag that i actually had to turn everything down. the old ui was better than this grabage they have now but you will never see it again. the mobs, they are all the same. nothing special about them at all and the boss fights, they are just the same mobs you have been fighting with maybe one or 2 special moves but they are still the same thing. with lots of hp tho! not a good game unless you feel like grinding for no joke weeks at a time to get what you need in the same map over and over and over again.",4.5

"its pretty good... but i eventually stopped playing. you need friends to play this with you for it to be more fun, but that is just how it is with online games. the good -it looks good, it runs fine. nice action and game mechanics. challanging in a good way. fun combat, nice customisation. the bad -can be boring, dependant on other players, takes days to get the good gear, tons of updates, going solo just doesnt work, you have to pay to get the fun stuff if you dont want to wait for days of playing. the ugly - man some of those enemies needs some plastic surgery, they look like someone beat the crap out of them. i would reccomend the game to people who have friends that are willing to play this and have fun with you. otherwise i dont think you would have such a great experiance, but it is one of the greater f4p games out there. so atleast give at try and see what you think.",19.2

"update. still one of the most awesome ftp games your going to find. would still highly recommend this game. there have been many gilded ftp games, being fun enough on the exterior of core gameplay just enough to get you hooked before essentially forcing you to spend money to stay relevant. this is not one of those ftp games. the only aspect that bugs me atm is that you have to have platinum to unlock extra warframe and weapon slots aside from the default amount they give you. that is only if you want to own more than 2 warframes, and you can sell frames and weapons to make room for others as you try them all out. although some of the more in depth features, such as polarising your weaponry, and building a clan dojo require hefty grinds, with 3 other team mates they are fun. all around good over the shoulder shooter",583.3
"best interactive third person shooter i have ever played. running adn jumping on and across walls, and the huge assortment of weapons and warframes is amazing. each warframe fits a different person all you need to do is figure out witch one fits you the best then youre unstoppable against any enemy thrown at you whether its grineer, corpus, or the infested.",15.4
