"i recommend, but with the caveat that it needs more work. the initial instructions on what to do are kind of shoddy, which leads you to be matched up with people who have absolutely no clue what the hell they are doing. 10 minutes later youre screaming at them to extract just so you can end the mission. i am pretty sure that after i get out of noob central i shall enjoy the  out of this game",59.3
"basically you are a futuristic ninja in space, why would you not play this game?",431.1
"great game, lots of powers and weapons, great fun :)",1105.7
"while graphically beautiful and high twitch and fluid action this game lacks a variety that keeps the continued play value that i usually like to see. basically if you wnat ot log on and kill a bunch of stuff, then this is the game for you. they attempted to provide variety with collecting and building different weapons and power ups however this merely turned the game into a grind, looking for item components.",57.5
"i do really like this game. everytime i am playing warframe it reminds me of mass effect. you can explore the galaxy, customize and craft new weapons, change their look as well, get some new powers, team up with friends and kick some asses togheter. theres also a pvp but i havent tried it yet. the graphics are awesome, much better than in any other f2p game.",115.6
"i really like warframe especially when i play it with my friends because it a very fun experience for a group.",322.5
"fun game and lots of content but alot of which is only accessible by using real money or grinding a whole lot which can become very repititive",23.9
"i think this game looks great i cant wait to play it,442.8 mbs in wish me luck.",3.0
"i really wish warframe could be played on mac. i have a macbook pro with nvidia geforce gt 650m graphics card, which is good enough to play this on high settings. i currently have it on my  pc that can barely run it. i could use dual boot or virtual machine on my mac, but who wants to put that messed up piece of crap windows on a perfectly fine laptop? is it worth the risk to destroy my laptop just so i can play an insanely awesome game without graphics lag?",801.8
"im having some login issues where it keeps adding unessisay letters and my war frame freezes in the middle of game play but other then that the game is excellent",22.3
"the un-official, real farming simulator. with guns and physics! ( doy~ :p )",104.0
"this game is a very special game it is a game where you grind 60% of the time, if that turns you off this game is not for you, if youre still here then i would fully recommend this game it starts off on earth and moves out you are fighting against humans and robots with a boss at the end of each system, it doesnt shove microstransaction in your face and you can definitely get through without microtransactions. i love this game i hope you will to.",22.1
"this is actually a fun game, i can see where it gets grindy but thats just one downside. it has plenty of good sides, like the fact that youre a ninja... come on now, a ninja. i just wish it had a player vs player mode. now that would be beast.",3.6
"with the newest update (update 14) changes have been made to make this game very new player friendly. this was a big issue with the game before- it just didnt accomodate new players well. so if you tried the game before and got frustrated with it, nows the time to come back and try again. trust me, you wont be disappointed.",1282.6
"please give me my life back, it wasnt much but, it still was my life.",187.4
"i dont like the fact that in the update 14,(well in my experience of the update so far) kubrows die and i had wasted 80 platinum (currency). it feels very unsatisfying to know that i wasted money on this game. i want a refund",342.7
"best free game i played. it has realy good graphics and the best part is you get a sword and a gun.....i damn near unstopable now.",5.3
"for a free to play title, this is one of the best youre going to get. hell, it hold its own with full price retail games in my opinion. extremely solid shooter mechanics mixed with thousands of updrage combinations for each weapon make this the definition of replayability. the leveling system works well, with newer players slowly getting intorduced to new concepts of upgrading, and the ability to powerlevel new weapons/warframes once you get a solid grasp on how the system is designed. the crafting system in the game can feel like a bit of a paywall, but only for a few select things, such as the nekros warframe, but with enough time, every item in the game can be crafted, so in theory you can unlock every single thing without spending a dime of actual currency. all in all this is a phenomonal game, and because its free to play, you have absolutely nothing to lose.",270.6
"they should add skateboards for all the grinding you do",523.3
"coop experience is great! without teamwork you are sure to loose. the random mission system is cool too knowing that you wont be playing the same objectives when you replay a mission. most of all i gotta say the optimizations in this game are amazing... my weak pc could run it at 30+ fps. i was astonished on how smoothly it ran. this is the game for you if you like coop and have a weak pc. (now make sure your pc isnt that weak.. lol...)",709.6
"a very cool game indeed. i did not want to play this game at first thinking that it would not be very fun because the game is a free-to-play game. however the gameplay is great and very action-packed. i really wish this game had more of a storyline, because there is allot that the creators of this game could do with a single player or co-op campaign. other than very little story line, if you like game with allot of action and killing hoards after hoards of monsters while you play as a tenno in the field to save the universe!",399.5
"7/10, i only got one problem with this game, wheres the ducks?",18.0
"when ever i try to log in it say internet time out, anyone know how to fix this cause it looks like a awesome game",1.2
"gotta say really great game, been playing it since its beta phase and its only managed to get better and better. 10/10 would reccomend.",268.0
"given the cost of entry, warframes well worth a try if youre in the mood for something different. it has a great mix of shooter/melee type offense. whenever i play this game i feel like a ninja. this game is in alpha so it will have its issues; but, overall its a free fun game why not give it a try?",23.7
"great game, ive logged loads and loads of hours on it, for quite awhile you can solo it too but on most bosses and defence missions youll need a helping hand. its a good blend of melee and shooter, filling the enemy full of lead (or tiny metal darts) then hacking them to bit with your melee weapon of choice, collecting and building new items can be a grind at a start but after a while it soon eases. plus its free, give it a try",167.7
"pretty much an awesome game if you actually stick around and play and level up your character",413.6
"game is buggy, still crashes a lot on my laptop after such a long time in beta with no improvements in the stability of the game. i would play this game, but the frequent crashes ( every 5-10 mins) just makes it impossible for me to enjoy playing the game.",35.9
"its taking my soul away. great game! getting more equip for your warframes has never been so rewarding. getting new characters maxing them out is pretty fun nor get boring. heads up! the first few levels will seem like a drag, but it does get better.",151.2
"really fun and a good way to be introduced to an mmo",368.9
"everyone should play warframe. its free. its fast paced. its balls out. its ninjas being boss  ninjas, and the best part about it is, ninjas play free. p.s. people who think warframe is pay to win, its not. people who buy all there gear, and upgrades lack actual skill in the game. so if you want to be a boss earn your boss status.",796.5
"warframe is a brilliant game, many alternative fighting styles, and so many mods and items. try not to put money into this game, get in good with high level characters and forge your playing style, and the prices of platinum are a rip-off. warning: do not play this game because of the current update since it stops all game use for windows 8 and up users.",433.6
"this is the best game i ever played never gets old :d ninjas play free wooot download it and see what i mean. this is the first game that i never lose intrest to. i play for hours xd warframe rockss",558.6
"really fun and addictive game. the controls might take some time to get used to though.",34.5
"repetitive as hell, would be much more fun if they stop recycling the maps and how the hell do i link my warframe account with steam? lol 10/10 would r8t again",143.1
"it is amazing! the concept of it and the graphics along with the fast paced action co-op and powers is awesome :d",1.0
"i honestly cant critisize a free to play 3rd person shooter that has multi and single player modes when it comes to actual gameplay, however, i have to admit creating a new acount for the first time can sometimes be a real *****.",8.2
"i dont think id played enough of it. ill get back to you with a review.",346.4
"this is a great game and its free. the only negative thing is that it can get a little bit repetitive and a bit glitchy. the thing i love about this game aswell is that you dont need a good connection to play it in co-op which is great for me. i would recommend playing co-op after the first few mssions as it gets pretty hard after that.",25.9
"10/10 best f2p game ive played yet. the devs are chill and hilarious!",529.7
"while i have only played the tutorial and 3 missions, i already know i am going to play alot more. it is addictive, with good gameplay, shiny graphics, and a feel of reward for the time you put in. it is at least worth a try, given that it is f2p!",2.7
"warframe, a game with ninjas in space fighting robots, wierd evolved humans or something and aliens. also you are doing it all without effort in that full body suit that covers your eyes..... so i have no idea how you see, but still it is a great game and i give ot 5/10 for its bugs and glitches and weeks of trying to fix it",121.1
"so far this seems pretty rad. its also ftp/ptw, so theres that.",25.0
"amazing get it now you fight npcs and buy gun blueprints then find the stuff to make the gun!!!!!!!(or buy it) yay=5 star",13.2
"this game was very interesting and fun back in january but after a while i started to grow more distant to it each day, and i grew more fond of it each day. i quit for a few weeks back in may and i just couldnt stop the temtation to play this game again, so i played it again. then there was the day satan had a nasty plot : he made de make update 14 or should i say nuke of death update that almost no one will enjoy! after the update i was very very very angry, made a video on all the flaws they made at the time (note that there are still flaws i didnt go over), and stopped playing a game that i thought was one of the greatest games ever. i strongly suggest if you are new to this game you will be fine but quite a few vetrans like me quit because of the blights that they put on this game.",267.7
"great game at start things start to get boring after 300+(played 200+ house before connecting my warframe account to steam) hours of endless farming to get items that you want but the first 100 hours are amazing. the new contents added every update are really fun and if you are the type who like farming for items, warframe is one of the best games for you. new prime gears and new warframes every major updates or some of the sub updates give an additional 20-50 hours to farm all the items so if you wait patiently for the updates, warframe could be a never ending fun for you. ive quit warframe now but i still enjoyed the hours that ive played in warframe. its a great game to get and i also reccommend buying platinum just for weapon and warframe slots.",134.3
"such a good game. it has such goof graphics and gameplay. especially the imense customization there is. very well made.",129.1
"fantastic game, whether you only play for free, or purchase things. it has a great community, and above all else, the dev team communicates with the gamers more often than most other studios.",488.2
"fun little action-shooty-time waster with gorgeous graphics and awesome animation. entirely free to play, though with the quality of what the game offers i never felt ripped off buying slots for the killer badass weapons i was able to acquire. quite entertaining and worth the price of admission.",1236.0
"109+ hours in and i still dont know wtf is going on",115.4
"excellent game. i dont think i will get bored witht his one anytime soon.",108.4
"game is by far, one of the most amazing games i have played.. in years....fluid from gun combat, to melee, then the big bada boom! abilities and custom variety for your very own warfarme. grand...simply grand!",273.2
"after watching the legend of the drunken master starring jackie chan and every bruce lee and tony jaa movie known to man i was finally qualified to join the warframe community. after picking my first warframe (loki) i traveled across the stars slaying untold horrors. but my blade was sturdy and my spirit strong, infested, grineer, corpus i cut them all down. hordes of enemies like a flood would droun me if it werent for my amazing ninja abilities i would have been defeated. warframe is amazing, and its free! only other game on my steam library with over a few hundred played. it is well worth it. the graphics are just beautiful for such a game and they dont even put stress on your computer, the warframe varities, levels, modifiers, weapons and customization leave you satisfied. not to mention the many different game modes to choose from and massive amounts of planets to trek across. you are a badass ninja fighting through the galaxy with your amazing suit (warframe) abilities and destructive weapons that can all also be modified with mods you find. best free game i know of. i highly recomend it.",481.1
"so to pretty much sum up this game, you are a space ninja robot that goes around beating up evil ugly people who cant have children. oh and you can shoot lightning out your fricken hands. pretty neat. also the grind is real.",55.3
"overall this is a nice game to play whenever you have free time however the game itself is extremely tedious and occasionlly boring whenever you try to play alone. if you do want to pick this game up i advise that you play with a friend so that it will be more entertaining. otherwise here are the games pros and cons. pros: -nice diversity in characters & weapons to choose from and use - graphics are nice to look at (especially at max settings) - blood and gore is always a plus - can use in-game currency to buy warframes(characters) and weapons - you never feel like the game is pay to win cons: - in order to obtain new warframes and weapons in-game without buying them you have to buy the blueprints, obtain all of the materials to craft said item via the games crafting system and crafting times are fairly long ranging anywhere from 12-70 hours in real time also you have to do all of this with in-game currency. - level designs are incredibly repetative as you will see the same level designs several times over the course of your playthrough. - two leveling systems profile leveling/character&weapon leveling. yes in order for your weapons and characters to be at max power you have to level them up first also leveling your profile takes a huge amount of time. - certain weapons are level locked so in order to craft or even buy them you first have to level up your profile to the required level. - game can feel like a huge grind especially when playing alone.",408.9
"a very solid f2p third person game. yes, it is grindy. yes, each mission will feel remarkably similar to the rest. yes, the only real goal in the game is to gather resources to build new warframes and weapons. despite this, is it fun? the simple answer is yes. despite feeling like youre grinding a lot, the combat and features of each warframe and the modding system keeps players like myself coming back for more. slashing enemies up into pieces doesnt seem to get old! there is also a decent variety of warframes to build, though some will obviously be harder to get than others, they can all be obtained without paying money. however, you do only have 2 warframe slots to begin with. you could buy more slots with the 50 platinum (premium currency) that you start off with, at 20 platinum per slot, but this is the only major downside to the free-to-play model of the game as the rest of the platinum items are mainly cosmetic. there are still quite a few things that need improving, such as spectator mode. currently when you die and want to spectate, you cant even rotate the camera around the player you are viewing, making spectator mode feel kinda useless. there are also a few bugs in game causing you to sometimes not be able to melee, fall through the map, and other minor things. these things dont happen too often however and doesnt take away from it being a fun and decent game. overall, its definitely a game worth the download, and you might even find yourself getting hooked on it!",1060.3
"please do not play if you are looking for a 2d version of a 3d rock climbing platformer simulator. i came into this game expecting that and i was absolutely dissapointed.",91.0
"this is the best game ever made i play this on ps4 and pc when away from home get this an add me on steam",23.0
"epic combat and awesome abilities. gameplay kind of repetitive, but multiplayer is super fun. ninja experience exceeding any ive seen before. 4.5/5",11.2
"a very fun and amazingly well done game. its amazing that it is free when considering how much details and effort have been put into this game. although the enviroments can become annoying since they are repeated very, very often, the mode and story and other elements of the game, do change. like i said before, its a great game for being free and if you like nice fairly face, but not too fast, paced game play and co-ops, then this is perfect.",158.2
"this game is rad as all hell so like, youre a space ninja and you run around shooting bad guys with space guns. right so already this is mega-badass, but heres the thing, you get space shurikens. thats right son. cyber ninja stars. so alright youre sold but you gotta be saying this is too good to be true nope. you also get a sweet  ninja jetpack that lets you fly around in space, as a ninja, and shoot space baddies with your sweet space laser. for real. and its free.",255.4
"this looks like it could possibly be a very fun/interesting game. only problem is that it wont even download. the warframe client always gets stuck on checking for new content while also displaying the remining mb left to download (no progression though.) if anyone know a way to fix this, that would be very helpful. until this gets fixed i am going to have to not reccomend the game.",122.6
"cool, cause ninjas, and space. now all we need is pirate- no we have those too",65.1
"warframe is a 3rd-person, part parkour, shooter-rpg hybrid where the name of the game is level-grinding and getting your warframes (classes) to be the best. this game has been in free open beta for well over a year now (something pretty rare these days), and the devs show no signs of slowing down. the atmosphere is incredibly erie, the boss battles are serious challenges, and its great fun to just be a badass, gun-wielding, super-powered, alien space ninja. it rarely gets more awesome than this. theres also a wikia site that is chock full of info for beginners and veterans alike that will hold answers to all of your questions. however, despite trying to inject a story in here, the game just isnt quite ready for it, and you wont care for it after 2 hours of gameplay. theres no obvious track of continuity here, so whatever story elements there are, theyre all over the place and confusing at best. the game can also be a graphical strain for those with less-than perfect computers with all the patches its gotten over the years. the store was also fully functional before the most basic of texture pop-ins were resolved, but this has since been corrected. you want a fun way to pass the time and feel like youve earned your rewards? get this game and you wont regret it.",68.0
"great game, great visuals a must have on your library",11.0
"this is the game for awsome space ninja killing that you can parkour with op charecters warframe is your game and i like the game cause there ninjas and im a ninja so go get the game if you want to slice a guy and crush a grineer soilder to bits.",524.1
"warframe is a brilliant game i played it since before it was on steam and i could always rely on it to free me from my boredom of other games. even if you dont like the look of this game get it because its free and i think itll suprise you",1.6
"an annoying grindfest where people with their moms credit card outdo you anyways, only redeeming feature is the models. animation is poor and the menus are garish, the stability of the servers provided are laughable at best and can make it almost unplayable. the way upgrades work are limited and poorly assembled with very little to actually incentivize more play. warframe gets a 100/100 a+,  this game.",121.1
"really awesome game fro a ftp. doesnt need much to run with doable graphic!",130.0
"best free tp play game ive played this year. feels like mass effect meets halo.",77.5
"i am sam fisher. this game sucks jelly bean ballz. every map is almost the same because every object is same in the map and to many sfx. bunch of weapons and stuff that needs real money is standing there for lazy  reason. i do not recommend a game if your a eye killing type of human being. lag server lag i do not recomend a game for anyone this game should be thrown out and deleted.",18.0
"way too repetitive... same map over and over, with the same goals...",20.4
"amazing game its very fun but 10x better with m8s",3.5
"cool game a little bit like halo and mass effect together but free and mp! realy recommend this game!",583.3
"warframe is a great game were being a space ninja sometimes involves using rocket launchers or sawed off shotguns.",263.1
"i love the co-op focus and the mmo elements. the real standout is the gamplay. killing enemies with a variety of weapons while flipping and sliding is just awesome and keeps me coming back.",439.7
"when i first tried this game around v7-ish, the ui was a fuster-cluck of stuff. i had no idea what to do, who goes where, why the warframes even, etc. so, sadly, i gave up. as well, a tubor of a pc was no help either. come a few weeks ago, it is up there, in my opinion, with good f2ps like team fortress 2. it follows a pattern where you have to work for stuff, and buying things is not necessary unless you want to shorten build times. i like that, it is a sense of progression that even few p2p games give. i really like that. as well, each warframe is varied, and unique in each power. some are pure tanks, others are butterflies-of-death, and 1 is basically a self-repairing/energy siphoning queen, and another is the best for defense missions. as well, each wep feels varied, and looks unique, and few need certain prerequisites to acquire them. higher mastery rank, gives you cooler weps, and clans/labs allow research into cooler weps. aside from the occasional bug, i really love this game.",210.6
"really fun game,would be great if they gave free platinum every few weeks",448.8
"this game is like a rain drop from heaven! #bestgameever!!!",399.0
"its a fantastic next-gen free to play game. the micro-transactions arent anybodies cup of tea but premium items dont get in the way of pure skill at the end of the day. its multiplayer only for now but single player looks promising, the co-op aspect of this game is great with a mix between racing too the finish and helping teammates destroy enemies or claim objectives. no pvp yet but a not so popular duel-mode is currently in place. the mission layout is expansive and pretty good to navigate through and the graphics are a treat.",85.9
"space ninjas and parkour, everyone should play warframe, if not, go f*** yourself buddy, cause youre missing out",74.4
"honestly one of the best, free to play games out there. sure you can pay to win... but! you dont have to! which is great.",509.3
"nice game but u will resolve the crash display driver has stop working..",4.5
"awesome game looks nice for a free-2-play but it is 90% pay to win type of game. the game it self is still amazing.",10.0
"pros.warframe is a very very good game it`s better than most $59.99 games it`s not pay to win like a most free to play games you can get every warframe/character though in game resources and you can get most costimization items without paying a thing, i`ve played 300hours without spending a pennie and had fun doing so.and while graphics aren`t every thing warframe has very good graphics for a free to play game. new content is constantly being made adding new modes,mods,warframes,weapons,game elements such as sindicits,quest,companions,and etc.also warframes or characters aren`t more powerful than others just different. cons. while i do so dearly love warframe its not a perfect game there are bugs that accor every now then mostly after major updates, sometime forgring times can be a bit agervating,pvp can sometimes seem glued on, and there can be overly long grinds at points.but in the end i strongly recommend warframe to those who enjoy fastpace co-op pve third person shooters/sworders.",440.0
"i used to love warframe very much. but then, when ive unlocked sedna and phobos, enemies are tougher to kill, enemies can airborne while warframe cant (not archwing) and enemies weapons can damaged your shield very fast. mine was from 900+ shield to 200- within 10 seconds on rhino equipped with steel fiber ranked 8. i did cashed out from money to purchase some items. i realized that its all a waste! theyre uselss! only for f***ing decorations to make looks cool and awesome not the weapons! dont cash out some money for platinums! its a waste for money! i couldve buy other games like far cry 4 or sniper ghost warrior 2!",197.9
"i am a space ninja assassin armed with claws only ripping through the enemies like tissue paper. 10 out of 10",603.7
"its a good game but im so  tired of deleting it every ing update since it always get ed up during the update process and then i have to reinstall, nonetheless its still a good game and worth the time reinstalling -_-",489.2
"awesome game played 85+ hours no its not a lot compared to other people but for me thats a fair amount definitely recommend this game.",94.6
"digital extreames. you might know the name looking on the back of the startrek game of 2013. they did awful on that, so this has to be the same right? if you think that warframe is the same as startrek, please, download this game to see how wrong you are. startrek had some hype to it. it looked good, but playing was not the same. warframe didnt have much hype when i first downloaded it. it looked too good for my computer, and so after turning down the graphical settings, i finally got to experiance this bliss. im not going to drag on with this one like i do most of my reviews. itll be as quick as it did to make me fall in love with this game. so graphics, ive never seen anything more beautiful. controls are tight, resposive, and swift. map design is ingenious, with corridors and platforms, different goals for ships, and loot a-plenty. pay to win aspect is pretty much not there. its more of you can earn this item but its also avalable for purchase, making handing over money an option rather then a task. the bouncy shoot-n-slash combat is mindblowing, sounds are the best ive heard ever, and over all warframe is something you should download right now. im not one for the whole rating system, but i have to give this a 1010. it is amazing, and whoever is curious to download it, please get a better computer or a ps4 so you can experiance the tubular graphics while playing an off the hizzy game.",23.6
"i have played this game for a very long time, and it has come a long way. a year ago today the mercury tile set was the only tile set, and now they have antire planets! i love this game, and i will follow it untill the multiplayer servers are no longer officaly hosted and then some. keep up the good work digital extremes, and thanks for this amazing game. `big-head hancho",340.0

"kinda feels like a heavily upgraded version of the mass effect 3 multiplayer to me, pretty solid game, one of my favriots",323.3
"no activation message yet been 5 days now... 10/10",40.8
"its a really entertaining system where it really rewards those who dedicate some time to it. sure, grinding is a really fundamental part of the game but it really makes time pass really quickly if youre in a competent squad or clan. get the bow though, tons of fun to use. :od",51.4
"how to be cool: 1. download warframe 2. play warframe 3. attempt to make friends while not playing warframe 4. forgot step 3",35.8

"this is an addictive game to play and you will stick to it even at the first 5 minutes of gameplay.i truly enjoy this game since it is free-to-play. although there are some premium features, you can get pass this by just playing. this game requires alot of grinding and knowledge about the game. the community is great and there are many people willing to help you suceed in the game. this is one of the best games i have played in a while.",460.5
"this game, is endless fun with friends :l so play it lol",598.7
"you are an exoskeleton wearing, gun toting, space ninja with memory problems and awesome powers. do i really need to tell you much more? the game play is fast and fun. devastation is the name of the game as you turn enemies into piles of dust with a lightning gun, piles of shreaded beef with some claws, punch through them with a laser cannon, or even nail them to the wall with a bow (and hilariously break physics sometimes when you do) the powers of the warframes give you many tactical ways of playing. do you use the power of electricity with volt and fry enemies with lightning or do you take a rhino and laugh as they franticly try to take you down as you walk through the horde unfazed by gunfire due to your iron skin ability? maybe you like to take a steathy or fast aproach and choose the ash where you can blink behind enemies to finish them off and slice up an entire room with the push of a button using blade storm. in the end, its up to you. battle well, and win often",504.7
"ok, pros: fast paced shooting mechanics, decent sword mechanics. good mobility, customization not that good but workable. teamwork, can still play solo however. and a stealth and free-run mechanic. nvidia graphics and physics! cons: you will never get into pvp becuase of your inventory ### doesnt meet the requirements. unfair, if not almost cheating ai. cash store always dangled in front of your face. when the game adds a new playable warframe, it feels like you must pay. in order to play it. feels unrewarding. buggy beyond beleif, but thats because its an mmo. near impossible to join a guild/clan. notorius time waster. lotus voice. overall: i enjoyed this game for a few days, but between drm, lack of commmunication with other players, and cash store ads. i reached my pain; enjoyment thresh hold. it just seems like a time waster, and you never feel like you accomplish anything, unless you sink in $$$ of course. if you need to waste a few hours go ahead, but it just felt to as if there was no point to doing all of the same repeating missions over and over again. its up to you.",15.2
"awesome game! cant really describe it, but its a co-op ninja fest!",39.6

"to keep a long story short, the game is artistically beautiful, vastly entertaining and can provide you with hours and hours of fun while still tantalizing you to come back and keep playing. over all, i definitely give this game a 9/10 in its current state.",72.6
"probably one the of the best free to play games currently available on steam. great support by the developer and fun and addictive gameplay. one of the few free to play games i dont mind giving some money to in order to support this. highly recommend this to any one who likes 3rd person action shooters and fast pace action.",484.1

"downloaded it. made an account. says my email is fine but my password is wrong, even though i had just logged into the website with it. i got a password change and the game yet still says my password is wrong. nice to download a game that doesnt even have a working log in system.",0.5

"great f2p game, has some buggs/glitches but they are doing their best to fix them. not pay to win since you can get everything without paying but its just faster if you pay real money.",197.0
"i admit that when i first started playing this game i was impressed with all the bells and whistles that the game had to offer for a free to play game. i played it so much at first that i got burnt out on it and the game just felt like a grinding fest. which in essence it is, but what really helps when playing this game is to make friends. your friends (if they have been playing for an extended period of time) will beable to give you the information you need to meet your goals of a new weapon/warframe and make the process extremely simple. if you like playing lone wolf that is fine as well you can set your misson access to invite-only and if you need information check the wiki. simply play how you want.",368.2
"i punched a guy, and he exploded... im quite sure its a good game...",33.1
"i find this game to be somewhat of an oxymoron. it is centered around the thematic ninja, but is constantly devolving into chaotic button mashing and a screen full of bloom and particles. the game is given to us in the form of a crack a-team of space-ninjas, but very rarely does one feel like an assassin. the warframes are cool, and the art design for them is amazing, but some of these abilities are completely hit or miss, and especially in the late game, practically unusable. enemy hit points are simply too large for some of the games spellslinging frames to be practical. ability economy is at a low, but at least you can remove them from your frame. the game does do one thing right and that is the progression of equipment and building of new frames is very satisfactory. i cant tell you how desperate i was to complete my frost. and after you start crafting your preferred frames, you start to enjoy the game much more, but maybe thats because i didnt care much for excalibur. one of the biggest faults of the game is the annoying maps and the enemies pathing ai that dont want to work with each other, forcing the defense mission in question to be unwinnable. just something that needs ironing out. melee combat and movement combos are tones of fun, if not a little sensitive.",154.8
"awesome graphics, good team play and massive customization.",858.9
"warframe, where space ninjas do battle to ensure their very survival and uphold balance in the universe. this game, put simply, has been an interesting and amazing experience. there are people willing to help, there are constant updates to keep you interested, and has an immersing ui system. the endless possiblities of modding your weapons or frames, the amazing color packs (if you decided to get extras), and the actual visual gameplay. i am proud to say that de has made me hooked on this game. good job and congradulations to any awards you guys may win. i look forward to playong more of your creations. :)",158.1
"warframe is an excellent game, and its free! you are a murderous cybernetic power suit space ninja dude going around slaughtering various evil factions to help bring balance to the origin solar system. the combat in the game is satisfying, offering high diversity of loadout choices with so many different weapons and mods that can drastically change the way you use them. the movement is top notch, with a well implemented parkour system (sometimes it can be a bit wonky, but thats mostly just funny) that makes the game very high mobility in a refreshing way. the story is not really yet developed, though the placeholders for one are definitely in place. warframe is a constantly evolving game, and will have something quite different basically each few months that youre playing! the sooner you get in on this, the better!",417.3
"awesome game. lots of grinding but thats the fun of it all, meeting new players or having fun with a group of friends. f2p only charging for cosmetics as everything else is craftable(be patient, it can take up days to craft some items.) overall, an 8.9/10 in my book. solid gameplay, plenty of cool weapons and warframes to give a try. just dl it and play already! :)",30.3
"warning: prepare to shell out 20$ if you plan to play for more than a day or two. the game itself is pretty fun and brings a very satisfying gameplay. really no reason to download and try for a few hours. all items can be acquired (slowly) just by playing. the only thing players are really forced to buy are permanent inventory space, which is a must, since there are alot of weapons you will want to get and warframes. that being said, prepare for the game to get very repetative after first 72 hours of playtime. there is no real endgame, and all missions become repetative grinds for mod cards and resources.",277.6
"used to play this about a year or 2 back, was pretty cool but repepetive. im starting to play it again and its pretty sick, the game has changed like crazy and i personally love it. check it out.",9.2
"what a pile of rubbish controls are clunky and slow to respond the multiplayer sucked so bad you get put into matches with people 500% above you that fly trough doing everything while your still learning the controls then they get annoyed because your not where they are... not worth the time of day tbh",0.6
"im not usually a fan of fps games, but ive really enjoyed playing warframe. i think it may be that its cooperative instead of competitive, so my lack of quick motor reflexts isnt as big of a deal.",83.7

"i wouldy highly recomend this game to all ages exept for the parts were it has blood but apart from that this game is a realy good high grahpiced space ninja game! five stars",231.0
"best team based action rpg with balanced dynamic play and a continuously evolving lore",233.4
"great game! the only problem i have with this game is theres no story! it would be awesome to have a single player only story, and also have the missions you do in the game, because after awhile these missions do get repetetive and boring. my rating: 7.5/10",4.5
"dont get me wrong, i love warframe, and i do recommend that you at least try the game, but through my experience with this game i have had nothing more than trouble. game play is awesome, endless hours of farming and grinding, it is truely an mmo players dream, however the game has far too many bugs that the support team refuse to do anything about, from constant log issues to frozen ui the support team always recommend you allow the game to run through firewall, no matter the issue. personally i find no use in firewall, it does nothing but slow me down, and i keep my computer clean, physically and digitally, so for me, i have no use what so ever for firewall and it is always disabled. still everytime i run into an issue while playing (which i must say, happens literally once or twice an hour) and report it to the support team, they always tell me the same thing, allow the system to run through firewall. but when i exclaim to them that this cannot be the problem i am met with an apology and instructions on how to allow a program through firewall. its a great game with a terrible support team. my enjoyment in this game would usually tell me to rate it a 10 of 10, but the constant problems prevent me from giving it any higher than a 5 of 10.",189.6

"ok my first impression, its confusing no real learning curve just jump in and go. 2nd it credits me with 9hrs playing i think its more like 9min. i hope to find its better, it taught me a few secends about how one class worked i need to go to a private area and learn the class i chose so people dont get upset at my not knowing what to do. i will give it a thumbs up for now.",11.1
"not polished enough, i want to be able to see my face. platinum is overpriced.",1285.2
"a fun game i shall admit however it has afew problems: its too repetative find,kill,capture,escort,defend,survive thats everything in the game in a nutshell. the balance is almost non existant. with some of the hardest to earn frames being the weakest and the easiest to earn being the strongest. youll need to grind for hours or even days if your unlucky to get enough resources for a single blade or gun. other then fighting there is nothing to do. i wouldnt mind that if maybe the ais were not the old 2d attack style ais that always walk,run at you in a straight line. when with infected they could have wall crawling,wall/roof pouncing ect. or having some sort of unique attack style other then get target in visible range then fire til i or it dies. all up its a fun game for awhile but once you notice how limited it is and how much of a grind fest it is you will move on.",102.3
"dont get me wrong when i say at at least one point in our life, we all wanted to be a ninja or a pirate. warframe combines both of these fantasies as you blaze across the solar system as a robotic ninja-assassin space pirate. can you name anything more awsome than that? although the levels get quite repetative when its either a space-station, a high-tech mine or the surface of a snow-covered planet the maps and rooms are so beautifully designed what more could you want? (aside from, yknow a tropical island) movement is amazing and flows beautifully, want to run along the wall over a bottomless pit, before running up another wall to introduce a clone-grown space marine to your katana? go for it, you crazy, crazy . its like a beautiful ballet of death and dismemberment. there are characters (warframes) for all skillsets and play styles from tanks, to nukers, from support to debuff, its all here, folks! if you enjoy the idea of combining swords, guns, honour and parkour warframe is definately the game for you!",238.7
"its just like spiral knights, but with jumping and flying mechain instead.",30.9
"i love fast paced action games, but never liked shooters. im more comfortable with melee combat. but with this game its a mixture of both melee and guns. the combat is so smooth and fluid i actually liked pulling out my hand gun and shoot a few grineers while wall running, sliding across the floor past a horde, or in mid-air after a high leap. this is by far my most favorite action game that i can just hop into and go ninja... with a gun.",21.1
"another free to play. ill admit this isnt the best of games, but its a fun game to play for a couple of hours every now and then. lots of weapons and upgrades, but unfortunately youll have to pay some money if you want the really good stuff. all in all, its fun but very very buggy. full of glitches, but the constant updates are working on fixing this game up. time will tell how thisll turn up.",87.1
"simply stated, dont call a game free to play when you have to pay real money to have any sort of fun. micro-transactions are the biggest pain in the  in the gaming world. this game feels more like some ea p.o.s., rather than an independent developers. and by the way, your new update killed the game for me completely.",7.1
"if you like space+ shooting x melee % killing allot = a really good game...i know that wasnt that great for recommending this game but you should at least try it.",570.2
"game is really focussed on borring farming of resources to make your character stronger. plot is really in the background and it is so generic and so obvious it can as good not be there. whats more game is really vulgar about trying to make you to use pay to win strategy. the only pros ive seen is an interesting graphics (theme + quality) and quite good mission group matching. if you want to play game about farming for items - install diablo iii - much more fun :p",2.8

"ok ben playing i want some more friends to play join me so we can all work on geting better",61.8
"the game itself is good, but its got a few annoying aspects unless you pay, such as only having 2 slots for warframes, meaning you have to sell others to make room. i hear the in-game market is good for getting the platinum (paid currency), but you would need something people would want to buy to have any chance at getting the platinum. it costs 20 platinum to buy a warframe slot, and i would suggest you never buy the warframes straight out. depending on the warframe, it can get quite pricey, even if you take into account the other things it comes with. real money - paid currency rate $5 gets you 75 platinum, and only 1 warframe i believe is this cheap. some warframes cost near $25 or more to buy straight out.",117.4

"amazing game, and loads of fun to play with friends. be prepared that this is a progression type of game and there is a lot of grinding to be done before you are powerful enough to enjoy the whole game. be prepared to work for things you want over time , if you are not wanting to spend too much money. easily one of the best f2p games ever.",47.9
"one word: boring. other notes: 1. unless u pay u cant get any non-default weapons/frames easily, it didnt look to me like unless u live inside the game u can get anything non-default at all actually, unless u open ur pockets of course, then u can get everything instantly. 2. lack of any story, yup, they just toss u into the action and go ahead, grind mobs p_p very... fun, that. 3. gets boring very quick. 4. higher lvl players with awesome gear can get into your newbie party so youll be just walking around feeling worthless. 5. you can get into high lvl party with every1 having awesome gear except you.. and once again you will be just running after them feeling worthless, and will likely be kicked when they see your 0 kill count. 6. graphics aint that good. 7. to lvl up u need to pass some kinda exams which would be fine if... u didnt need to wait 24 hours to have another attempt if u fail.. which aint no fun at all.",6.8
"very fun third person shooter! i have greatly enjoyed the game style. its perfect for playing with friends since it doesnt quite matter what missions youre on, you can always jump in and help your buddy, even if youre rediculously underleveled and only serves as a momentary distraction for the enemies. there has been some technical difficulties, but that comes with a game that is still in beta. also very great for people who want to play free. almost all content is accessible for free players but, of course, there are a couple perks for anyone willing to pay. all in all, a marvelous game!",521.3

"as a frequent player of this game on ps4, i can say this game is nothing short of brilliant. you play as a warframe, part of the group called the tenno, who have dedicated their lives to bringing sanctity to the solar system. fighting against the terrors of the grineer, corpus, and the infested denizens. some people might think ughh this game is awful it has micro-transaticions!-stupid consumer but they are wrong. this game does have microtransactions. however, whith enough dedication and love, anything that is microtransactionable, you can earn in game. you heard me right. so everything can be free. not that im saying you shouldnt use the micros. they are a handy way of paying the developers for this wonderful peice of work they have created. the games mechanics of shooting, using powers, melee, and parkour to traverse surfaces are incredible. it keeps the game fresh and replayable with all the content included including a working clan system with a dojo you can build from the ground up for you and your clan mates to make together. so to rieterate, warframe is a great game that you should definantly play.",0.9
"damn good game, and it gets more and more content every major update. 19 (i think) warframes to choose from, compared to the original like, 6. thats a big leap in gameplay and content. every planet has unique areas now, and there are outdoor environments as well. the story adds to the gameplay because the more you play the more lore you learn.",1140.6
"grindfest!!! grindfest!!! grindfest!!! two questions first, did u ever heard in any game that for making a resource which is used to level up a weapon or a suit (warframe) u have to wait to for 1 ####ing day???????????? no. this game does. i can wait for a whole day for a weapon or 3 days for a warframe but a whole day for forma...not cool!!!!! did u ever heard in any game that after applying that resource to a weapon or suit for upgrading u have to relevel it from the start??????????????? no. this game does. you would be thinking that it is fairly easy to level it up again because its upgraded, but trust me it will take you sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo long to do so..... now i am not saying this game is bad, actually it is better than some other online games in steam but the grind boy oh boy!!!!!!! last but not least---->>>>> it will take u a year to make a latron or boltor prime without money!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",458.8

"absolutely raises the bar in the free to play category. graphics are smooth, contemporary and optimized. gameplay equally so. unlike most games in the f2p genre, this one is considerably generous. cosmetic add-ons aside, the game gives you everything you need - free. modifications, weapons, in-game currency, and even warframes. kudos to the developers, although they almost certainly still make a buttload of dough. nothing about this game forces players to pay-to-win. if youre willing to spend real cash, thats your choice. at least give it a go. itll cost you nothing but your time.",43.5
"really great co-op game, try it and youll easilly get addicted to it!",47.0
"its an ok game. its not bad. there are may worse games out there, and to be honest, this one is actualy kind of fun. you dont need very much skill to be good at it, and it really is a pay to win game, but even if you dont, that just means itll take about 10 times as long to do stuff. i wont harp on that though, as most games are like that anyway. the graphics are really good, the environments are well thought out, and no two maps are the same, because every map is randomly generated. the ai is pretty , but they make up for it with insane accuracy. the warframes are also fun to mess around with, and the wepons are cool. this isnt a game i recommend if you want a challenge, i recomend this game to people who want to beat the living hell out of thousands of underpowerd enimes while using superpowers like lightning, fire, wind, death itself, or a shrukin (suprised me to).",181.5

"its one of those neverending betas. farming is the main concept of the game, and even if you enjoy the fantastic gameplay and the variety of weapons, it forces you to buy slots for them, and its very tedious, also there is nothing else to it, you finish every star system, some lame story arcs that serve the purpose of making you farm even more to unlock more features and thats it, the most outstanding feature of the game is the trading system, if you farm enough, you may get good stuff that you may sell for platinum (the currency you normally would have to pay for with real money) to buy the same stuff at a smaller price and resell it again, repeat this enough times and you will find yourself with enough platinum to buy a house. if you like this kind of game, go for it. i mean its not bad, its good, it feels good to kill stuff, it feels good to have friends killing stuff with you, it feels good to cut enemies, but i wouldnt recommend this game unless is just there to waste time.",1012.7

"yes yes yes yes yeeeeesss!!!!! such a good game, you can really feel the atmosphere of your surroundings , the storyline is a bit typical, but the gameplay is astounding. outstanding graphics also really make the game, come to life. the voice acting, i could go on all day about it. its extremely well written and the actors appsolutally nail the emotions, and the voices fit perfectly with the characters. my overall opinion is that, this game is delight, and i would rate it 10/10",5.5

"the gameplay itself is fun as hell, but the over all interface of the game is probably the main reason more people dont play this. its confusing how to set up your character or even really how to get into missions or what order to do them in. clicking the wrong thing can have you doing the same novice mission over and over, or throw you in a game way above your level (for you to get slaughtered). communication in game can be lacking as well, and so can direction. over all the game is fun and amusing, but doesnt really have much long term playability. i put yes on recommend because its worth checking out, but without a revamp i dont see it ever getting overly popular.",4.2

"as much as i enjoy the game, i hate the game developer for not putting too much effort in it. ive played for 5-6 months. it could be fun if you have a lot of friends but things keep being repeated everyday. de get new things everyday but not enough, barely to keep the game fresh. you pass mastery rank 8 and thats pretty much everything i can own in this game. i can recommend playing this if you want a co-op, fast, fun game but not recommend if you hate doing same stuff everytime. pros: - fun, nice action - 4 player co-op - decent graphics - space ninjas, bows, kunai... - definitely not pay to win (you can pay to get some unique stuff) - no major bugs cons: - connection is pretty stupid. sometimes you have to wait for so long (4-5 mins) then connection to the host has been lost appears - ninja plays free but de recently gave players a lot of beam gun and stuff, not many ninja weapons - warframe does not scale to late game - too much farming - weapons so unbalanced - little update everytime, archwing not enjoyable as expected although i dont recommend the game but it was one of the best f2p i have played. id give a 8/10",832.4

"-      . the game is completely necessary to remove the use of machine guns and pistols - it nullifies the style of game. you need to create different modes of gameplay: level sweep speed, stealth, maximum damage, etc. add to the exterior of the characters individual items that are not part of the characters body: bags, antennas, ammunition you need mutch more effects in kills. enemies must to do something exept of just walking (every enemy). each enemy wants something, something must to do, etc. let enemies will be less, but every enemy becomes more interesting. the enemies have beds and toilets, a mess - a sign of life. more myths about ninjas in usual gameplay. the game will be alittle complicated but more interesting and exciting",2.7

"for a game thats still in its beta stage warframe brings a lot to the table in satisfaction. although the currency system could be a bit cheaper. warframes mechanics, like acrobatics and parkour, bring not only a cool aspect to the sci-fi shooter but pushes the player to perform amazing kills that would never be done in any other shooter. the weapon side of warframe is a bit basic but does show some variety. guns that impale or lasers are pretty much standard in sci-fi but the way melee is done is phenomenal. swords, axes, and staffs that brutally smash and slice your opponents all over the screen is great. with warframes extensive levels and dynamic comabat system it is definitly a game worthwhile. 9/10",40.1
"by far the most action packed, unique, and flat out fun free to play game ive ever had the pure pleasure of beta testing. ive been with warframe since the closed beta, back when it was just plain ol loki, volt, and excaliber, back when mag was the hot-class everyone was trying to get... this game has grown so much and im glad to feel like part of the family watching it grow from so young to what it is today. i love this game with a passion. its a keeper on my hard drive.. remember fellow tenno, ninjas play free.",106.7

"this game is awesome. i really like the freedom to choose whether to go all out and rip up the mobs or complete the mission in stealth, nearly undetected. unlike a lot of games, this game has levels for each part of the equipment, and it is upgraded the more you play. moreover, there are a lot of rare items that you basically can loot, however it may be hard to find a specific one. the upgrading system is based on your decisions how to customize your character, and you can always recustomize it the way you like / the way thats most fit to your quest. once again, awesome game, highly recommended!",57.4
"though it has its bugs and glitches, this game is incredible. ive always liked ninja-introduced games, and this is one has proved its self to me. pros 1. kurbows: these mutant dog-like creatures may attack you when untamed but when you destroy a kurbow nest to get an egg (i dont know the logic in that.) you have a chance of getting your own companion. though i like primes as well. 2. good surplus weapon arsenal: some games dont have many weapons for you to choose from, but warframe does indeed. going from a sword and shield to a nice shotgun, warframe keeps providing weapons for even the stealthiest of volts. 3. plenty of warframes to buy and choose from: most games say: once you choose this character you will stay as that one forever. well, some of them do. though it cost lots of platinum to buy them, its worth it for me to test out the others. cons 1. constant control glitching: i found this to be a real nips twister. on an obstacle course i was half-way there when i needed to wallrun and wallclimb at once. i cant tell you how many time ive dealt with the controls bugging out on me. 2. platinum. all the damn time.: youd basically need platinum for most of the stuff you buy. you wouldve thought theyd cut you some slack and make that low priced too since its hard to earn platinum other than the common way, buying it. im not being greedy, i just think you should be able to buy more things with credits. overall, the game is good, but some major patches are needed.",96.5

"lets see warframe its a sci-fi game with exosuits (space-ninjas) fighting the ugly bad guys. well you can basiclly buy almost anything in the cash shop, including cosmetics. this game is immensly fun with friends, and trying out the amazing weapons, there are katanas, whips, laser guns, shotguns, freeze rays, and many more. now the maps are the same, and can feel repetitve, because it is, although some of the levels look really cool... well compared to the other maps. now the gameplay could range to really boring to really fun, that depends on what weapons you using and how you use them. now the warframes are the exosuits the players can wear, it gives them special powers, like jumping high, iron skin, healing, and mind control. getting warframes can be very difficult, and that brings me to my next point, the learning curv is very steep so you need to watch youtube videos on how to play properly, thes game is also very difficult so if you like that then good. so in the end, do i recommend this game? well if you like what youve seen here then go play this, if this turnes you off, then you can try it i guess. so i personally enjoyed this game immensly, but i didnt let that get in the way of the recommendation of this game. this review is just my opinion.",942.8

"this game is very underrated, it deserves a higher meta score than it has, a lot of the negative reviews were back when the game was much older and offered less, they dont represent the game now. excellent co-op, mostly bug-free, smooth controls, outstanding graphics, tons of weapons, upgrades and customization, get pretty much anything you can buy with the store credit in game also (except warframe and weapon slots i think). oh and replayablity. i have been playing this game for a long time. they are always adding new modes that refresh the expereince. i cant recommend it enough. 8.5/10",412.2

"not as good as i expected but still cool.the game has some bug issues and the missions are often repeated.this is clearly a game that you should play with your friends,considering the single player sucks.in the other hand,warframe has big variety of weapons,customasasion,charachters and many more.worth to try it.(btw sry for my english)",83.3

"at the beginning (maybe) youd like it. its entertaining once you get some new warframes to play and maximize (same with the weapons), and constructing a dojo is more like if youre lucky or not. however, is a bit frustrating when the pvp lacks some competivity or some rewards... in fact, practically no one enters there since theres nothing in return (no ranking system or something that makes you play more of this) at the end of the day, youll realize theres nothing interesting but to gather resources to buy some weapons to see how powerful you become... and for what? well, heres my realisation quote: is that it? i wasted my time id even go back to lineage 2. i do not recommend to play warframe, could be addictive but still frustrating afterwards. -arkl1te",220.6

"warframe is a very interesting game. the combat is smooth and the game is really beautiful. however the game has some flaws. for example this game can lag very easily in my case if you do not have a very good computer, the game takes forever to level up and get weapons if you want to get them free. its not because of the currency in the game. the games currency is easy to get however to get new waframes and new weapons it can take quite awhile. the weapons you need to go find materials, not very hard but the waframes are very difficult to get. they will take you many long hours to get because you need to get rare material craft that takes about 24 hours then craft another 24 hours then another. and then you have to put them together and craft it all together. it is a very long process and if you want to buy the paid currency prepare to pay a lot. overall the game deserves a 9.5/10 it has these crafting flaws but the gameplay itself is very good.",72.2
"this is a great very pretty looking co-op game. all i can say is sliding, flipping, wall running space ninjas for the win. the game can get a little repetative for right now with the grinding, but i beleive that more content and maps/missions will change this. over all the game is very well done and outstandingly free.",67.2

"ive played this agme for 40 hours on xbox one and started playing this game on pc so i know what kind of game this si even though i have low playtime on pc. anyways, warframe has to be one of the best 3rd person shooters ever made. fresh gameplay, cool graphical style and really good graphics that run even on a low-end gaming pcs. theres just one thing i dont like about. this game has to be one of the best f2p games since you can get pretty much anything for free. but weapon slots and warframe slots are pretty limited. you get 50 free platinum which i should be used on a couple of arframe/weapon slots. you can get more platinum with real money and the price of the platinum isnt really that cheap. people wanting to buy cosmetics will have to use pretty high amounts of money. overall, one of the best game ive played! and that takes a lot. i dont really like current gen games but warframe has to be the best game that has been released in the past 5 years.",175.3

"ive been playing this game nonstop for the past few weeks. its a great game. although i feel that there isnt a lot of story or plot, there is, however, a nice backstory/lore and a unique setting. the game allows you to customize your character (to an extent) and has a large selection of weapons and warframes to suit ones playstyle. in the beginning, the game felt very pay2play; everything i wanted at that point costed platinum(premium currency) and wasnt available until i progressed further and it required (what i assumed to be) heavy grinding. but now, having progressed much further, ive found that most things could be acquired with just time and patience, and the only things that truly required platinum were cosmetics and bundles. and platinum is a tradable currency, so if you really want x that costs y platinum, you could make platinum by trading with other players. but is the game fun? yes, its loads of fun. the gameplay is relatively unique, progression freels rewarding, and it looks great. updates are pulled out quickly, fixes are adminstered hastily. overall, its a very refined game (especially one thats in beta)",762.4
"good game this game requires a good computer.... that is a warning...",2.0
"warframe is a different kind of free to play game. instead of barraging you with ads, or forcing you to buy things you dont want, it completely keeps the aspect of a regular month-to-month or one time pay type of game. while some could fight and say its , pay to win, i beg to differ. while you can use platinum, the games currency for real money to game transactions to purchase already made weapons or new characters, youre not limited to having to use your money. instead you create the items, making the game that much better, thus the games fun lies within the aspect of creating and gathering materials for items and trying to be the fastest or the strongest tenno the solar system has ever seen. anything you can buy, you can create. it may take a few hours of fighting but then where would the fun in the game be then? in summary, warframe is a new twist on the f2p game industry, by one single characteristic that makes warframe collect most likely the most revenue of any free to play and that is they do not force you to purchase items. no one likes being forced into anything , especially not a game, and this game, one where the devs listen intentively to the players, patch things accordingly, and make the game all around enjoyable by not making you pay for a monthly subscription or limiting your activites by not paying, derserves more respect than it can ever obtain. plus: ******* space ninjas. 11/10",241.3

(he had recomended it earlier) and i said that i had looked at it, but it looked very complicated. i was like ummm... so i did it then and there. i downloaded it. i figured it was free so it wouldnt hurt to try. so i chose my starter warframe and got started. i remember going to a survival mission on mercury (apollodorus) and having a blast. it was so much fun. about 3 hours in, i bought a burston blueprint. i farmed on a defense mission for the components. it came into my recognition about how expansive my arsenal could be. a long time later, im still playing warframe. i have come a long way, just like the game has. i spend time helping starters and providing tips, and going on hard missions in the void and derelict. warframe is a truly outstanding game.",757.8

"warframe, where do i start? the graphics look nice, you got space ninjas, you have blood and gore, what could go wrong? - everything, major bugs draw me out of the game, such as falling through the map while trying to wall run (happened twice) when in a party with friends sometimes the mouse will stay on your screen after you invite somebody / been invited and accepted doesnt seem like a major problem right? well you cant move till the maps are loaded in (happens alot) by-far, the worst thing about this game is the grind, you want to buy a boltor? that will be 225 platnium or, you can go grind for hours to get a single weapon. or just pay 225 platnium. the platnium prices are a bit over-priced, its not so less of a pay2win game, but a grindfest to where you kinda are forced to buy platnium because some items are almost impossible to get. the game has gotten better lately, but it shouldnt do the kind of payment method they have, its overpriced and its obvious that they are trying to rip you dry. this game isnt that play for gameplay except for the glitches and errors, but the grind is rediculous. i cant rate this game due to it being really good but really bad at the same time (love hate relationship)but i can give it a nickname, grind simulator 2014",22.5

"i love this game, its a blast to play coop with some friends or even random people. the only problem i have is it is not mac compatable. i used to have a laptop that ran windows but it broke unfortunetly and i now have a mac which i recieved as a gift (not my choice really). i know you can run windows on a mac but i have heard you can run into many problems including running out of memory (only have 4 gigs in my mac and you cant change it out on mine). i would love if this game became mac compatable and would gladly drop a few more $ on it as i have in the past. but with the time i had with the game, it was a blast!",162.4

"yes i recommend this game to any people it`s fun, there is alot of cool stuff in it like guns, frames and melee weapons and all the stuff there is all can be found in the game without paying platinum but if really want platinum its your choice its your money its worth it to play this game.(there are also some scienceish like the planets that would help you remember stuff in space if you need to :d)",348.9

"its a fun game but it has many issues. important (downlad from warframe website and not steam!) when you first download it it gets around 6 gigs of data, then when you launch it it patches the game. so if you try to verify or backup the game you lose all fiels and it will donload the 6 gigs again, and then patch it again. save yourself some headache and download the game from the warframe website. i gave it a thumbs up cuz its a good game but man i had to download this game 3 times already and that is not fun.",21.5

"i love this game!! it is so much fun and it never gets old. online mode however when you want to join a level it brings you to a clan that could be farther in to level and you dont start from the beginning. that is my only complaint. the scenery is so ammazing. how i would descirbe this game is halo but free. yes this game does have a lot of inspiration. art: halo, when you lose your health you fall down and a teammate has to pick you back up to save you: left 4 dead & call of duty. gameplay: mass efect. however these inspirations dont bother me. highly recomend this game.",11.8
"what i like about warframe is the way you can absolutely dismember your enemies, but what i dont like is the scavenging for materials to craft weapons. and crafting the weapons takes about 12 hours, while making a warframe takes 3 days. 3 days! that is just unacceptable. it should be about a couple hours at most to craft stuff, not half a day! unless they change the time it takes to craft weapons/warframes, i dont recommend getting warframe.",231.0
"this game is wonderful in the sense you can commit hilariously epic carnage on the enemy types in warframe. this game is also wonderfully frustrating because of the multiple layers of rng (randomly generated rewards basically) and it is a very long grind to get to the highest rank if that is your goal. i would have to recommend this game to people who like dark sector and its pretty bad ai where enemies are moving to cover and stand in front of it before starting to shoot at you.",672.8

"really laggy and slow. motion is blurry and super fast. its a great concept go! just have to iron out bugs and movement as well as aiming.",13.9
"really fun game and really cool! but unfortunatly when you finish the main story you go into multiplayer online coop matches. this means you are faced with odds to high for your level or weapon efficiancy but to get better weapons or level up you have to either spend money or keep playing which is very difficult as all the odds are against you. still a great game but i wish the better weapons and powers where easier to access, instead of having to spend real money.",6.7

"first off i would like to say that this game is super adictive and fun. secondly if you do play this game or want to start playing the game id suggest you look at a few tips and tricks to increase your productivity ten fold. for starters i suggest you get excalibur, because its the most balanced and easiest warframe to learn how to play. top tip: you just have to get rhino, that warframe just wrecks everything in the way. overall i do enjoy the game and i would highly recommend it to anyone that likes 3rd person shoot and kill everything in you way with 3 other friends yeah.",794.6

"its ok. not great but ok. ive really tried to like this game but i just havent been able to get there, yet, and i find myself going back to mass effect 3 (its a shame bioware has pretty much blown off its multiplayer support). i really dislike the fact that you cant earn platinum by just playing the game. instead youre either required to shell out money or need to grind for ridiculous lengths of time to unlock new stuff. regardless, for what its worth, its pretty good, especially considering its free-to-play. if they were to change the purchasing systems and leveling system in the future, id most likely donate cash toward its development. addendum (2013/12/13): its actually a lot of fun. ive been playing the crap out of it the past couple of weeks and, now that ive picked up on the resource farming and have a better idea on the forging, i think its pretty entertaining. i still like the overall feel of mass effect better but me has become pretty stagnant compared to the continuous evolution of warframe. i will continue to dislike the purchasing system and the inability to get new equipment in an acceptable amount of time without paying for it. i also find it appalling that de put in the option to pay platinum for credits. all-in-all, fun",176.4

"im going to sum up this game as simply as possible. it is a repetitive, grindy game. you should know this going in. do not expect a massive variation in what you do. now the fun stuff a parkour system - wallrunning, sliding, flips, vaulting, all that cool stuff while firing guns 4-player co-op (its not an mmo.) a good f2p model (only stuff that you have to spend real money on are cosmetics - weapons can be crafted using resources gained from missions and blueprints bought from the market for credits.) gun modding and stuff (customise your gun to make it more effective against specific enemies, or just make it set people on fire. clans (guilds, armies, whatever you want to call it. you share a dojo, a communal map that you all build which allows you to unlock exclusive clan-tech weapons. adorable sentinels (they fly around above your shoulder and shoot stuff. they are adorable.) 9.6/10 - not bad (ign) goty",681.4

"i dont have many hours logged yet, but i can say a few things about this game. firstly, it is very fun and innovative[for its genre] second, the match making or squad finder or whatever you want to call it is nifty as hell, people can join whenever and usually at moments when you need them. third, despite all ive said it is almost 100% pay to play. its free, yes, but after a certain point you have to start putting money into it if you want to stop dying, or get new weapons or armor or abilities, but, if you either keep grinding and keep your head down or throw a few bucks into the game, it is one of the best games ive ever played. i hope too see you planetside!",96.6
"i love this game, a very good parkour element mixed with balanced shooting makes it a very fun game",312.7
"this game is awesome!!! somewhat tactical as for the mods that you want to apply, nice details, large maps, cool flappy birds too! warframes have its own excellent ability and quite easy to control, so i would recommend this game. however, the 50 platinums the de give us, not much things to do with it! plus many people would not wanna buy platinums, and hacking would feel wrong... what can we do after the 50 plats have been used up? nothing, pretty much. so, maybe this could be one small downside but others than that... good game",916.7

"as someone whos played a lot of the game (225 hours as of when im writing this), i can say its overall a pretty good game, and its all but boring. it is, however, fairly repititive in its play, and you have to either a) get used to a lot of grinding and waiting, or b) spend money to get things quickly and the way you want them. it is pay-to-win in a few senses, but everything you can get by spending real money, you can get by waiting for in-game time-limited, occasional alerts, which give the same things out. as far as grinding, its like every other game with an rng that tends to hate or love certain players. it has a fairly balanced player market, in which you can sell these *rare* items you get from the rng to other players for platinum, the credits you spend actual money for. so, in a sense, spend time on this game and you can convert it into practical real money. over all, this game is pretty well-done, especially as far as graphics go, and id recommend it to anyone who likes mmos in general, even though the themes and genre may not please others, along with the lack of lore. either way, its a solid game.",317.4

"if you love third person ninja shoot-em-ups, then this free title is for you. it boasts amazing graphics and latest features while keeping the requirements at a decent medium. the variety of characters and weapons give this game much color and room to master. i recommend this to all of you, just for its mere size of ~2gb.",59.6
"good game. looks great for a free to play, and is very addictive. its worth getting.",72.1
"i believe this game has much potential. it needs improvment in areas espicially how it runs. at first i thought the diffuculty was my pc, even though other games run very smooth on it, so i put everything graphics wise to its absolute lowest and still encounterd frame rate drops. although thats the great thing about pc games, they can be greatly improved. beyond that, this is a tuly an amazing game and im yet to encounter any bugs. combat is very cool and addicting with great wall running mechanics and animations that truly make you feel like a cyber ninja. missions are huge and should take you and your friends, assuming your online, awhile to complete. the ai works well, you wont really be challenged unless your alone however. platnum is the worst money drainer as i only have 40 platnum without paying, and items cost all the way to 300 platnum. you can choose from 3 starting characters, and need alot of platnum to get more. as a score, its atleast an 8/10. i didnt really get into the story, which is good but pretty confusing, and you might not get as many frame rate drops as i did. overall this is an amazing free to play game that i highly recomend.",4.1

"great game overall. if you havent played this game yet then you need to play it. this game set the all time high for great f2p games. my only problem is the motivation in the game. as you can see by my hours ive put some time into this game and have had a lot of fun with it. though, once you get to higher levels unlocking the higher weapons and frames that you want it gets kinda boring to play. since they have put in quests that makes the game a bunch more motivating to play, but they dont have many and unless you are playing with friends you will probably get bored of the game at higher ranks too. trust me though when i say that this game deserves a play if you havent tryed it yet because this game is awsome.",95.5

"warfarm is far and away the worst offender when it comes to rng-based, unfun grinding, and the developers are probably some of the most incompetent in recent history. melee is shallow and nonviable, stealth (though for some reason encouraged) is not an option, there is an incredible lack of enemy variety, every single mission type feels the same, the grind-based progression in this game is some of the worst in any game i have ever played, the mod card system is unsustainable, and the developers are completely incapable of making the big changes that need to be made, opting instead to put a band-aid on the issue in the form of borderline-worthless mods. this game being free may seem attractive but i am warning you now that warframe is the most colossal waste of time you could ever try out. just save up some money and buy another game, or go look at other free-to-play titles out there. dont waste your time with this game, and please dont waste your money.",556.1

"what started as an experiment into a new free-to-play game has expanded into one of my biggest addictions. warframe does what other f2p games fear to do: provide 100% of the content, in a grindable way that makes it worth your time to play. it neither takes ridiculous amounts of time to garner the things you want, nor are they set so expensively it isnt tempting to just buy everything. from tight controls that make skill matter, to delicious stats for the most mathematical of minds all the way to the constantly evolving enemies and tile sets, it will take a while to master the game. and once you feel that youre an expert, out comes another update. it seems that a constant stream of new stuff is falling out of the servers ready for you to get your ninja on. also, the developers are very keen on keeping their userbase happy, and to that end theyre constantly making tweaks and additions. the new trading system is a longstanding requested feature, dojo updates are always happening and new frames keep long time players interested. in short, you have literally nothing to lose except free time if you want to try this game and free time is overrated anyway.",377.5
"p.s. i suggest you to try the game first..... game not bad, graph good, game play for  but it is ok, too much glitch but still ok. but this game started to kill as after 5 day playing. 1-3 hour a day every night and all we did, hmmm nothing we did 12 time 1 stage 9 times second, 11 times next then we wanted weapon we go back for farming and all this about is tooo much grinding! you must do one stage over over over over and over again, or you can get premium and you get all. so if you are ready to grind all your life off then go ahead or if you dont have place to put your money in, you are welcome =)",7.7

"i purchased one of the founders packs for warframe about a year ago, finding that the game had very little substance i decided to quit. i started playing again yesterday *7/21/2014* to find that they had made some major updates to the game. the layout of the solar map is very pretty now but the game still lacks substance. the community seems horrible as well, racism runs rampant in the chat room and the game gives you very little direction on what to do or where to go. the tutorial gives the impression that weapons are found lying around the map waiting to be picked up, but thats not the case. three weapons can be bought from the market for the ingame currency, otherwise the rest need to be made by buying blueprints. the blueprints take on average twelve hours to make in the foundry, and you can speed up the process by spending real money. i understand that this game is free to play but it feels like there is a little to no progression aside from spending money. all in all i give it a 5/10, its borderline -okay-.",170.4

"warframe is a form of fps shooter/close-quarters combat game that is intensly immersive and very well designed between the way combat works and the amazing graphics, there are quite a few classes and you can do many different things from assainations to all out kill everything that moves, you can play with meele or charge around with your guns n stuff single player: playing alone means less mobs and easier missions all around very fun to do, and sometimes better to play as for certain things multiplayer: massively amusing and you can play with freinds and just cut down hoards with help overall i would give this game a 8/10 and would recomend you download it esp since its free and for a free game this is astounding",441.2
"best free to play game in awhile. most free to pay are freemium; wear cash can make overly powered. but this not the case with warframe. there is in store cash only items ,but most weapons and warframes can be got with simply time and effort. combine with combat composed both mele and ranged it makes for a fairly enetetaining mmo",314.3

( directly to the left of the minimization button.) click on it, and a window with a set of check boxes should pop up. uncheck directx10 and directx 11. click ok or save and click the play button again. the game should launch normally. hope this helps!",130.0
"i personally like this game a lot but i feel like not enough people play it. its a very creative and beautiful game that sets itself apart from from other games with its levels, but after a while it gets slightlyh repetetive in my opinion. i give this game 8.5/10",36.3

"i generally dont like shooters and oftentimes this type of game gives me motion sickness. however, im having a lot of fun with this game and it doesnt make me feel ill. also, its third person, rather than first person, so that helps. there are quite a few classes to choose from, though you do have to hunt down your parts to make them. but thats half the fun! pretty much, anything in the cash shop, you could just as well hunt for it. cash shop is more of a convenience and not really necessary except to unlock slots if you want more warframes.",145.8

"a few words about the game. super fun, super addicting although this game reminds me of the dogs and mdk it fails to hit that humorous mark and creates live warframes from the tenno in spirit of mdk. now besides being a ba you pretty much own and have a hard time dying. the game mechanics are so fluid that dying is almost out of the question unless a) something went wrong b) you are an idiot. c) you went too much solo. this game is perfect to a t. however despite that once you are sucked in you will find you want to do other things despite this game being so blasted awesome! thereof the game hits the sweet spot in your gray matter of the cortex in your brain and vanishes from the fun nerve. in a matter of coloqiualism you miss that fun spot by a hair and make people pay for certain tech upgrades. i understand why, but this also creates road blocks. i wish you would simply attack $20. onto the title and then create a lot of free addons. this game is amazing but not quite in another reguard as its too perfect to be believable. soon you will find agg thhis seems too fluid and easy. to play....",4.3

"its a great game, with stunning visuals and impressive mechanics for a ftp game, and it has an incredible amount of content. the actions like wallrunning and rolling around like a true ninja makes it feel like you are actually a warrior taking on massive amounts of enemies through superior skill and cunning. the downsides come into their own when you take a look at two things. one, the stealth aspect. its great to pull off a stealth kill, but unfortunately it most likely wont happen more than one or two times in a mission, because the enemies are always aware of where you are as soon as you have been noticed once, regardles of whether they actually saw you enter the room or not. the second part is the business model. should you happen to be a fan of incredible weaponry, prepare to pay. a lot of guns take more than $5 to unlock, which is straddling the line between microtransactions and macro transactions. despite these flaws, its still a great game, albeit a bit grindy if you do not want to pay for the weapons.",215.7

"gravedigger fagus said it best: its a game about space ninjas destroying space nazis and futuristic ea representatives. i dont think i need to say any more here. you cant leave out the mutant zombie versions of said nazis and ea reps. its like this, you and your crew infiltrate ships and bases on various planets and   up (and thats just with the weapons)! when everything is done, your team rolls out like nothing happened. space nazis, what space nazis? exactly. seriously though, the game is extremely fun. you get your choice of primary, secondary and melee weapons, per loadout, from an assortment of weapons from each faction (with an option to go melee only). there are several warframes to choose from, each with unique abilities. you can customize the colors for pretty much everything! you aquire mods to make your weapons and warframes more powerful. you can have up to 3 different mod loadouts and color schemes for everything. practically every weapon and warframe can be attained through crafting. the game is updated fairly frequently, and most importantly, its free! so if youre like me and enjoy shooters, co-op, hack and slash, love ninjas and are flat broke, this is the game for you!",984.7
"this game is really fun alone or with friends or even with random people.",196.2
"this game is grindy as . not as bad as some ive played, though. good looking game, with fun action. the different warframes (suits) add different abilities and while some of them are less than fantastic most are at least kinda fun to play (some are hilariously fun).",312.9
"this is what destiny should have been like. if you were ever thinking of getting destiny dont, just get this, its 10x better and actually has content. will definitely be supporting the devs as much as possible. great game.",8.2
"space robot ninjas fighting dirty racist illuminati trade federation mercenaries clones with zombies using swords and guns and bows and stuff. highly recommended",1254.6
"i give this a 5/10 because it crashes way to much for me... but it is still a great game. it looks great the gameplay is perfect i love it... so i recommend that you play this badass game... really... play it now... also it is one of my most faveorite f2p games ever.",9.8
"grind frame. just say no. but seriously, i played this game more than a few hours and the infinite power creep is mind numbing. grind, grind, grind to get a new gun or frame to grind, grind, grind, to max out and rank up and then grind, grind, grind to get the next frame or gun. would not do again.",658.3

"day 256, still have not seen the sun. still farming for boltor prime. help.me.",186.3
"this is a very enjoyable game, but you have to be carefull if your used to making small purchases in games like this. i went from telling myself that i would spend no more than 60 dollars on platinum, to having spent a few hundred dollars on this game over the course of the time ive been playing it.",753.2
"at least play once if youre an hardcore f2p gamer. enough said.",3.2
"what can i say, i fell in love with this game. it is a game that was somewhat tailor-made for me. no clunky armor, master chief sci-fi space marines here... no console-ish mechanics limiting what types of moves you can do in relation to the environment. extremely responsive mod system: you feel the change on your character and weapons as soon as you start modding and upgrading the mods. best visuals on any free to play game out there. it can range from casual, relaxed missions to incredibly difficult and insane ones. i could go off and on but all i can say is that this game hit all the right notes for me.",1191.0
"this game is a great oppertunity to burn a few hours and have tons of fun doing it. for a game in beta it is fantasticlly built, they have a great community and is in a very fast paced setting. and its free to play! when the developers release an update they pack so full of fixes and additions to the game youd think that they were adding a mod. (but then again a update is basiclly a mod) i enjoy playing this game for two main reasons: 1. the fact that it is very fast paced and requires lots of thinking in the now, because the ai is very sophisticted and reactes accordingly but could get some improvements. 2. the amount of fun that i have just grinding away to get a cool item. i personally spent 40+ hours grinding away to get two really cool items in the game and i really enjoyed grinding that. when i dont know what to do in the game i go and play with my freind the first few missions. im now going to write about some minor issues in the game :d when i played the tutorial it was preety laggy the first time, so you might want to take that time and change settings ive only chrashed twice for no appernt issues but on review of those logs my pc stopped two important files from working. but i recommend this game greatlly and i cant wait to see where this game goes.",862.4
"the best part about this game to me is that even though you can spend real money and get almost anything you want at the start, it really doesnt matter since skill still plays a huge part in what you can and cant do. also there is nothing that cant be gotten by farming, and there is even stuff that you can only get by farming that is not available in the market. the game can be a little repetitive, but what isnt entertaining about being a space ninja and running into a crowd of enemies and killing them all with throwing knives, or killing them with a blast of fire. play this game, you wont regret it.",199.6
"this game is great alot of the weapons you have to buy with platinum but you still get some fun weapons to use i think some of the guns you can buy you can get from just playing anyway. <3",69.3

"a free game where you can be epic space ninjas reking other space things. 10/10.",15.0
"pay to win es... pay to win... play with a group of friends... its more fun that way. plus you wont get mugged by a hoard of bad guys on the higher leveled missions. im suprised how well the game runs when played online. lots of different warframes to pick from, each of them having their own unique abilities... but each of them costs like a whole new game.",22.5
"if you have a couple of friends to play this game with you will lose countless hours.",242.5
"great for people who like: sci-fi environments having alternate characters fast paced action learning advanced mechanics color customization guilds/clans loot grinding for rarer items horde modes not recommeded for people who like: a story driven campaign (i believe this is under fruther development) playing solo (without random other players or friends) a melee-only game (while possible, its not easy) exploring every bit of a map (most groups prefer to run through missions/levels)",164.7
"this game is pretty good. it needs some work, but its free to play so its definetly worth playing. i like the co-op game play, but a few things to fix: -sometimes the achievements dont work -personally, i think the melee button is in a bad place -make the waypoints less confusing",3.3
"dont know why people call this a grindfest when there isnt really a endgame or a objective. its only a grind if you make it one yourself, all the guns are well balanced and the game isnt that difficult. the main goal of the game is to have fun and enjoy the community.",624.8
"verry nice game with a lot of content, there are some problems with all that content, the nu game syle with the archwings is rubbish, is nice looking and all that crap but thats all good looking, is to dizzy with all that spinning, and there is much more but in conclusion the new content may macke the game much more good looking and more but that doesnt mean thah is macking the game more playable for us its actualy macking us harder to find what we want, wat i do realy like is the combat sistem and the nice grafic thah the game has. i will recomand this game to any of you for the next reasons, good grafic , nice combat sistem, multyplayer coop, alows u to trade some items, and much more content that makes this game a good game, i still need to say that u might find some bugs and specialy when they macke a new pach",253.7
"space ninjas and awsome fighting what more do you want?",71.6
"this game is good for the first 200 hours or so then it gets boring but every update brings something new so you play it again so i rate this game a 8.5/10 good game not enough varity to keep me playing though also lots of bugs",264.2
"started with the excalibur (if you dont know by now, the jack of all trades, master of none frame) played for a bit over 35 hours before getting the rhino construction up and running (the most recommended frame for newbies), some might get it sooner, but i just happen to be slower than most people with these things the gameplay seems pretty solid, and even though the recruiting and trading channels are messy, i eventually got into a nice and cooperative clan also, youre a ninja in space with tons of different weaponry and you can sell/buy stuff to/from other people for/with platinum (the pay-to-get currency), but beware the trade taxes",60.0
"warframes concept, when presented to the normal person, would seem unusual or unappealing. this can be forgiven since the concept is space ninjas on a solar mission of fighting giant brutes and strange merchantmen whilst holding back the invading forces of a mysterious infestation. yet this game has proven to be hundreds of hours of fun for myself and my friends who would play it. the ability to go through a procedurally generated map while shooting grineer platoons in a defense or slashing apart an infested swarm in a survival mission has produced unlimited amounts of fun. the game gives the player an ultimate suit of armor which grants them unimaginable power as they run, jump, slide, kick, shoot, grapple, punch, stab, and slash at enemies who give the player an actual challenge. the content is even more extrordinary as it is updated very often and is largely influenced by the community. thus every player has a direct voice in what they want the developers to put in next. thus for a game overflowing with action, adventure, community, and a sheer uniqueness not commonly found in the typical selection of modern games, warframe should definitely be on the consumers list! did i also mention that it is free?",757.2
"this game cant play in mac os!? why isnt you making for mac os?",232.3
"if i fail at maths ill blame this game. i still regret nothing, 10/10",94.6
"i completely admite this game, although i do not enjoy the multiplayer. i always have to 3-4 minutes for one person to catch up in order for us to complete the mission.",3.6
"this game is art. it really is amazing. its like a free, better than destiny, awsome game.",33.9
"i wish your charactar was faster and more controlable but all in all a good game",3.5
"it takes a bit to get used to (how to equip various mods, upgrading your armor/weps, etc.) but is absolutely worth it! the graphics are awesome, the levels are friggin amazing, and it can surely give a challenge to any kind of player! the frames (armor) for each class looks absolutely amazing, and each class has its personal skill (ultimate, basically) thats cool!",10.7

"so much to do in this game, and so many weapon to build :d",917.6
"after all the changes and updates, i cant really get into it. i will go back every now and then but i cant see myself sticking with it for much longer. pros: -decent 3rd person shooter for a free to play -can be fun with friends -runs well and is well optimised -constantly being updated (also a negative) cons: -its free to wait, pay to win -the movement system can bug out badly -the guns feel more like your scratching the enemy than shooting them -late game melee isnt viable -only 2 or 3 wareframes are able to survive late game due being able to cheap the game -the ai is akin to a spud, and will run at you in lines and mostly out of cover -the updates have sucked what was fun out of the game -(constant re-balancing and changing of core mechanics, as well as adding unintuative ui changes) -useless weapons and wareframes can lead to beginner traps overall it just seems like the game is being updated over and over to force you to pay money for things, and the obsurdly ridiculous waiting times are a joke. to make and get a fully upgraded weapon that can last a while (until a rebalance) literally takes over 2 weeks. thats to get all the blueprints, grind for resources, grind for money and literally wait for it to build. or you can spend real money and get it on the spot there and then without finding the blueprints or grinding.",104.8

"i just ordered a steelseries gamepad specifically for this game. with that being said, time to get back on the grind.",7.9
"this is a third person shooter that incorperates free running, ninjas, and pseudo-magical abilities (explained with scientific reasons). it is a great and fun game that i love with all my heart and support. i do have to warn however that it is very buggy and glitchy but i feel as though that just adds to the fun of the game, but some people would disagree. it is however limited since it is only 4 person squads but the multiplayer aspect is the best part about the game. so grab some friends and go kill some stuff in space with swords, guns, n stuff!",553.6
"grinding and running simulator space ninjas with energy guns so much hate with laggs and crushes with weak notebook why love this game? qooo~",192.2
"overall this game is just awesome, with a fair buisness model and a great engine it has everything you would want. even though some of the levels (very few) are repetitive you can enjoy the game alone or with a friend. i highly recomend this game so check it out maybe youll have a new favorite game to play.",57.6
"cyborg space ninjas with special powers, need i say more? i do - the tile sets are massivly repetative so once you learn where all the doors are you can get a little bored however its a fun game the shooting is smooth melee is a nice addition and the boss fights actually feel like boss fights (try soloing lech kril!) worth it, you should but this game",174.0
"hey everyone! im new here and this is my first game to play. i like this game, i played it just now and i think its a very interesting game. the graphic looks cool, the design of it looks awesome, and i think its about somekind of alien? right? sorry if i get it wrong. since its the first time for me to play games at steam, i was really excited to find this game as my first game to play which is free and it has a cool graphic too. im worry about my computer though because its lagging like hell these days, i hope its nothing. anyway, this is real cool game, you really should try it, and also its free to play.. now im going to play some more :)",17.8
"this game....whoooo man its great! its so addicting and fun as h***! ive blown so many hours into this game and i just cant stop! one cool thing is that if your pc is slow orrr maybe you prefer a controller.. you can play this on the ps4 for free aswell! pretty much the only thing that annoys me is that there is a currency known as platinum and the only way to get it is to spend real money on it :/ if you dont plan on spending cash on this game then you can still obtain everything but it is going to take alot of time. well that pretty much wraps up my review! i give this.... 8 out of 10 and i reccomend this to any sci-fi lover like myself",4.1
"i give this game a potato out of 10. (what can go wrong with epic space ninjas?)",75.8
"a game of running, shooting, and flying through the air. kill hundreds of enemies, and look bad  while you do it. fire grenades that will kill you if you arent careful(penta), or use the noodle tentacle  gun(phage). go flying around with a pair of dagger-axes(dual zoren) or kill almost anything with a single swing of your blade(galantine) in all honesty, what de is doing with warframe is a great change of pace from the norm. i mean, space ninjas, how could you as for more?",445.5

"well, not that my short time playing this game amouts to the crazy amount of tme that some people put into this game(right now i have 70 hours in this ga time), but this is the best free game that i have ever played so far!!!!!! p( ^ . ^ ) the epic combonation of parkour, ninjas, aliens, robots, and the co-op/clans makes this game amazing!!! especially update 14 which was very nice btw.. xd even though ever single word of this is my opinion please at least try this great game.......well....its free so not that you have nothing to lose anyway....",274.3
"got stuck in a wall in the second mission, great game.",1.6
"space ninjas, running around grabbing rescources and completing missions, for free, whats not to like? pros: -missions are good fun, repetitive, but the different environments makes them fun enough for you not to notice -wide variety of weapons, from a massive two-handed sword to a automatic rifles -fleshed out clan system, where you can build your own base with duelling arenas, research areas obstacle courses etc -combat is simple, but fun -warframes and thier powers make combat even more fun (mags upgraded pull causes her to ragdoll enemies around the target, sendng them flying, always awesome) -free-to-play -im no graphics expert, but ive always thought that this games graphics are gorgeous cons: -microtransactions, most stuff is possible for you to get, but it takes a lot of time, farming bosses, getting a new warframe will take you a very long time. -graphics may make it lag on some pcs (my friends laptop lags) in conclusion, a good game, but microtransactions let it down",138.3

"warframe can be described in one way, the baby of dead space and mass effect. it is a corridor shooter and shares the same aspects of both dead space and mass effect. the lore for warframe is very straightforward and generic. you are a descendent of a famous group of mercenaries known as warframes. you are in a never-ending battle between the warframes and the tenno. as for gameplay, not much to say other than it is what you would expect from a 3rd person shooter. the graphics are execellent and make for some very smooth and rewarding gameplay. however i do have to say that since the graphics use a new engine, you might need to scale down the visuals a bit. not a bad game, and its free!",30.7
"this is a great 3rd person shooter game that is not to be missed out on, especially considering the creators are kind enough to hand out such an awesome game for free!",6.9
"warframe takes a free to play format that really works - rewarding players for their commitment to the game, while allowing for many customization options that dont make the one with more $$$ too powerful. definitely worth a play in my book.",4.9

"this is a fun game ! there is a lot that could be said about warframe, like, the available arsenal, somewhat simple, but interesting and fun game mechanics, customization options etc. but there is ultimately one thing, and one thing alone, that makes the game worth all the time one can spend on it - you play as a space ninja ! a ninja in space, fighting alien races with swords !!! i think ive highlited enough features :d",336.8

"my experience with warframe has been very fun and pleasant. i recommend this game for many, many reasons, and i will list a few so you can get the idea: astonishingly relaxing and fun to play, allows fun and unique co-op with friends, has so many different combinations to play and test around with, while providing a fun experience overall. overall, download this game, its so amazing especially for f2p, worth your time. you wont be disappointed.",187.4
"this game is fun im not gonna lie but the bugs and crashes and really annoying freezes make the game damn near unplayable",10.1
"amazing game online and single player, you can play campain missions with your friends and other online people, but you cant play against them but hopefully in future updates itll change maybe",1077.5
"10/10 father would want best game for fathers day definitly lets you play solo without crashing will also let you play with other people so yeah quality game",23.1
"solid f2p shooter. just get over the first 3ish days then you will be lovin it also the buisness model is fair and you dont ever have to pay for content. i havent spent a penny on it. hope you enjoy it as much as i did. 8/10",115.3

"one of the best free-to-play games on steam! this game is very fun to play, and even more enjoyable when you have friends at your back! id recommend this game for anyone looking for a great cooperative third person shooter.",96.6
"extremely fun, particularly with friends. new tilesets are being added almost every update, and where once there were a handful of re-used levels, theyre moving rapidly towards one or several unique looks for every planetary sector. player customization, while unfortunately heavily cash-gated, is constantly growing. weapon variety is everything you could want, and again, is still growing. enemies and bosses are varied, and even with that variety, the devs have confirmed a fourth hostile faction to be added at a later date. in short: this game has quite a few strong points that grow stronger with every update. one caveat: be prepared to exercise either patience or your credit card. new stuff is either crafted very slowly or bought for an assload of dosh. i can forgive the bugs because its still open beta, and they do correct them fairly quickly. however, the frankly absurd exchange rate of platinum versus actual goods bought hurts it in my opinion, as that gating has turned almost a dozen of my friends off from joining. 8/10",923.4
"this game in my opinion is one of the best free to play games out there. it is always changing and becoming better as it does. i would compare warframe to destiny, they are very alike games, lots of customisation, lots of fun game modes, things to find, things to unlock and money to earn. if you like destiny then youll love this.",145.5
"its a great game ans really fun. its like being a pirate a ninja and a spaceman all in one!",713.4

"its free, its fun, its available for ps4, its a bit of a grind though. but despite it being in full release its still in a beta state. not in a buggy way but in the way that they add more and more content every month.",528.8
"warframe is a very good game. you could make all of the warframes characters without speding any real money. the mission are not the same, there are all different. ninga kicks and flying kicks are cool in this game. there are lots of weapons and melle weapons to choose from which is cool.",197.8
"so, this game is nice. good graphics, good gameplay, decent balancing(?) i personally would recommend it to anyone who has extra time. this game requires you to replay or farm levels for certain resources. for instance, at some point, your weapons are too old to use them against newer, stronger enemies, so you set out to craft new ones. however, the amount of time, and work you must put into getting weapons that will carry you farther into the game is overwhelming. not only weapons, but warframes also require too much to craft. tkes me a day to get materials, or more, and 3 days to craft the actual warframe. now, you may choose to use stock weapons bought with credits, the games main currency, but the game insists you either buy platinum to get new weapons and warframes and whatnot, or craft them yourself, which takes a bit of time to do. though, judging from the majority of people on steam, i doubt time will be a problem. so, go ahead and play this game, if you want. its free anyway, what is there to lose?",60.5

"thrust me, hours feel like seconds while playing this game.",297.5
"a really, really good game with beautiful graphics, although the grinding is really strong it rewards you with tons of guns, melee weapons, warframes and lots of other stuffs. it is one of the better free2play games right now and doesnt need any money to be spend on to be good. you just need a lot of time... like really a lot of time.",499.1
"if you hate pay to win games you may not like this game at all, however, everything you can buy with real money (except vanity items and boosters) can be earned through grinding (though the grinding is pretty intensive), so if youre willing to put in the time, you may never have to spend a dime. however, i would recommend putting money in simply because this game is still in beta but plays like a released game, minus a handful of bugs. the gameplay itself very addictive and fun, especially if you like to play with others in a shooter-run-and-jump-melee-fight style. the videos here on the steam market just dont do the game any justice at all. but dont take my word for it, the game is 100% free to download with zero commitment so download the game and give a go some afternoon and judge for your self. heres a tip: if you do decide to try it, while the game is downloading, visit the warframe wiki. the game is still in beta and tells you very little on what to do outside of the basic controls so theres a pretty steep learning curve, but the wiki is chock full of info on every aspect of the game, this will give you a bit of direction and a heads up on whats happening and what you should be doing to start earning goodies.",34.7

"my honest opinion to start my review i would like to point out that this game is pretty fun but when played friends it is instantly 10x better, this game is also not your typical pay to win most of everything in this game is buildable but some of the items are only accessiable through buying. cons in the game would be glitches that i run into but they are usually fixed by the constant patches this game gives out, other than that i havent found any other cons that have disturbed or broke the game in anyway. oh yea and did i mention you can cut people in half and parkour :d now go out there and be the best space ninja you can be.",44.4
"the game is so damn good, trust me, but there are just a lots of milestones to buy cash point, you want to craft a weapon? here, please gather the required materials, pay the credit after you pay the credit, and wait for 12 hours, just when i thought grind is the only wall, now comes the crafting time... i mean cmon, ive gathered my mats, paid the required price, and now wait for 12 effin hours for mah knuckles? so here it is, the game itself is enjoyable and action packed, but hell the dev loves money so much, not only the cash shop is stingy as expensive french cuisines portion, but most of the warframes are expensive too (granted to balance it out with crafting), but theres a waiting time for 12 hours after you give the mats to the crafter and if you want to have the crafted stuff now, you have to pay with real money currency... so theres these 2 walls in early game 1. grindy for some people, and even some have more patient, theres rng system you know... 2. dem crafting wait time, this pissed me off the most though if you have no problem with them, then just play the game, its definitely worth your time.",189.0
"better than destiny in every way. cant beat free. the game is gorgeous and combat is fun and a blast with a buddy, but i just dont like the in game purchases, think they are way to expensive, we are not talking .99cents for angry birds here, some of these items are more than i care to spend, but you might like it so i say its an awesome game and worth it to try it.",22.4
"i know that you shouldnt do a review on a game before you have even played it but thats not the case here the case here is that when the game says itll take 23 hours to update a 300mb update is rediculous, and my intrernet can download 3gbs and a half an hour. some reviews here are bad and some are good but when the game takes so long to update it will most sertainly turn away new players such as myself and other potetional players.",1.4
"its a good game dont get me wrong, but the amount of farming just kinda shuts it down for me. that, and on top of the waiting time to even make the item you worked so hard for just irritates me. if you can get past that then you can enjoy the whole jumping off walls thing you can do.",16.1

"i started a few months after the open beta began. i have not been disappointed in this game ever. every update adds more and more things to do and makes the whole game feel like a brand new one. it is the only free to play i have ever invested more than $5 in not because i had to, but because i wanted to. everything can be done without paying for it. everything. it is amazing and i think more developers could surely follow their example. gameplay is always getting better and the game continues to evolve into a more fleshed out and realized universe. in short, it is awesome and i think everyone should give it a try.",921.3

"looking from a basic point of view...this is an amazing game, but in all truths do we really want to pay for revives? do we? cause thats pretty stupid. this game however does have some amazing features that you may be able to get over the fact that you have to pay to revive when you run out of revives. such as being able to cut enemies to pieces with a katana like sword and using your ninja skills to assassinate and kill enemies quickly and crisply! the controls take some getting used to but this is overall an amazing game and i recommend it only because of these features and a few more awesome features. do not get game if you cant afford platinum! which is used for revives and buying new warframes.",27.0
"now this game for free is totaly awesome! not sure id spend the hudreds that you could to be invinceable, but, you can progress and rank up with a litttle help from other warframes, the maps and missions are endless! you could probly spend an unimaginable amount of hours on this game alone, i recomend it to anyone who loves the fast pace, shoot em up, coop and deathmatch type of alien crazy i mean forever mods weapons, and customizability type of game, how it got a 68 is beyond me! free is 50 and a game that works good is atleast another 25 in my book, with the anount of updates, i mean like everyday, these dudes got there #$%^& together, i love it for a free game.",35.9

"i played this game back in closed beta before it became a uber grind fest mentality, there were skill trees for weapons and frames, mods existed but were not essentialy needed unlike the current system were as now i need to grind hours of my life away in order to actually have good gear that was once good back then becuase apparently the mod system was better and skill trees were silly... pvp was promised but i feel like it should have been there sooner to provide end game content... not really p2w however if you want more then 2 frames either attempt to sell things in the player market or sell a frame. (even vintage items are sold for crap so expect farming forever) despite the few hours logged on steam, ive been around for quite some time, and as a casual gamer i get on here and there so my rank suffers for me having other things to do. yet again a game that is fun to play but requires your life and attention for you to enjoy it to its fullest. warframe had potential, even look at tbs wtf is warframe and you can see the skill trees yourself.",86.9

"do you like being a super weapon? if so youll like this game, if not move on. every weapon and warframe in this game can be earned in game (excluding the collecters edition rewards). they all take time to get and build but none the less you can get them without cash. on the other hand if you dont want to spend the time to get them you can buy them. you can also trade items in game with other players for the in game cash currency (which is a market all into its self completely player controlled). the game play is fun and for the most part co-op. four warframe teams going up against entire armies, all with different powers. what little pvp there is, is focused on clans (guilds) and control of highly profitable co-op mission areas. the clan that controls one of those missions collects a reasoure tax that they set. in can be as little as nothing or as high as 100%. the longest a clan can hold a mission is 24hr after which any other clan may challange them for it. anyone can help attack or defend a clan controlled mission (unless theyre with the attacking/defending clan then they must attack/defend), which offen leads to clans keeping the tax rates fairly low to encourge outside help. when you first start playing do not spend the free cash currency you get right away. read the forums theyll give you an idea on where to spend the free money to get the most bang for your buck. good luck tenno, your in for a fun ride :)",806.4

"warframe is a very fun game that gets updated regularly and is also very fun to play with friends because it has a stragey/stealth aspect that can be used. my only complaint about the game is the farming for crafting. its very tedious and includes you getting the blueprint for the item, getting the crafting components for the blueprint (usually involving farming), then waiting for the item to finish after you use credits and the components. other than that warframe is very unique to any other game in the genre and definitly deserves some attention for how cool it is.",291.4

"this game, although in beta, is updated regularly and managed excelently by de. although this game can be hard for beginner players (especcially those who have not played shooters before), once the first of many sections of missions is completed, players will find that character and weapon upgrades are both common and rewarding. there is no plot, except that the player is an alien race (or appears to be) fighting other factions for solar system dominance - yet this does not matter as the amazing graphics and gameplay this game offers. in terms of graphics, it depends on the players computer. low-level computers may find it hard to play this game effectively with a reasonable frame rate, and high end computers that can handle the increased graphics performance and quality the game offers, will be more than enough. although i cannot recommend this to all gamers, as there are some that do not like shooters or this specific genre of shooter, i would say to atleast check it out as it is currently free. for those who are interested in this game, i would definitely recommend it, and i can tell you personally from experience, you can get hooked.",443.1
"i just started playing this game, and i have to say this game is astounding for a free-to-play game. the visuals are fantastic, and the combat system is dynamic and exciting. i would recommend this game to anyone looking for a mmo to play.",103.5
"my character has a wind-up key on his back, shiny gold skin, and a large attachment. recommended.",127.6
"one of the best games ive played but needs to have offline mode",5.1
"this is the best corridoor simulator ever, i think in my 5hrs of playing i ran down the same corridor at least 1000times!",4.9
"this game is amazing to play with your friends and be stelfie, it has differant wepons and stuff that you will need to build i would reccomend to tell your friends to download this game and play with you",34.2
"a free-to-play game worth all the time and effort. a variety of items to use, to build, to get,... you can never tire from its gameplay. ever expanding, only time will tell when it will stop. worth all the money too if you were to spend on the in-game items.",442.0
"for a third person primarily co-op free to play game, warframe is fun. pros: co-op, free to play, 4 player co-op, controller support, moderately low system specs needed to play, tons of weapon options and content. cons: high grinding for good items to craft which can take up to 4 days, adds and cash shop with stupidly priced items ex: a weapon is about 10-15$ usd. repetitive gameplay can get dull. lack of customization unless you purchase it via cash shop.",44.8
"my favorite warframe is the one that wraps himself in tinfoil to stop bullets and has a eating disorder. nah. not really its the one that heals, the lobster looking one.",221.7
"this is a great game, i fell in love with it on the ps4, but its really something you need to spend some time in and maybe a trip to the wiki or the forum to really see its potential. if youre cool with shooting a lot of basic enemies and occasionally some badass ones, youll be fine here. honestly, when youre traversing half the area in a spin attack and slicing through infected like a space ninja blender, youll appreciate this game.",2.3
"its a pretty fun game apart from the grinding, everything is makeable with credits, and trading mods for plat is always a way to make some plat. i would rate it 8/10 l0l ya nan",326.7
"if u like fast paced games get this game like rpg shooters get this game. this game is known to be repitive at times but theres always new content coming out ex: events, guns, equipment. this game always has you doing something.",445.7
"fast paced over the shoulder space shooter. very fun when it gets wild",40.8
"too much pay to win else, too much grinding. melee feels very weak. movement is free yes, but has very little purpose. kinda weak. could work for you if you have friends. not much to say, sadly bland despite the outstanding art.",105.8
"when there was aliens i went to doctor and bout a cheese bottle andi ate it for free. when i lept i saw aliens were dead and bick  in my hand. so i cooked it and made soup",2.6
"i downloaded it overnight hoping to play it the next day. so the next day comes and im about to play it. it checks for updates and does all that stuff. then i create an account in login. i start watching the cinematic at the start of the turoial and then it comes my turn to play... i move around for a bit while listening to lotus speaking to me. at the moment she says this shows vital signs like youe health my game crashes. after attempting another two times to find it crashes at the same point i validate the cache files only to find out its missing 11 files and wants to download the whole game again. im not even gonna bother... im sure its a great game but this experience has really set me off.",0.4
"two hours in and im enjoying myself greatly. cant wait to get further in and start playing around with new warframes and, you know, like everything else.",20.1
"only one thing can even describe this game. volt prime: go faster edition. 10/10 would go faster again.",124.8
"ninjas vs aliens and alien ninjas with guns, quick gameplay, decent controller support (if you like that), free to play. dont really need to ask for more. definately one of the better f2p games ive played this year.",989.3
"action-packed based in a great sci-fi/space enviroment. great free-to-play model. frequent updates. very smooth combat animations with beautiful overall graphics. the good: graphics, animations, models, weapon variety, enjoyable endgame content, sounds. the bad: maximum of only 4 players per mission, no dedicated servers(yet).",395.0
"great gameplay i can play this for hours on end. i never run out of things to do and the poeple on the game are very nice. the graphics are amazing and they take into account if your computer is not good. boogner rates 10/10",250.7
"i feel that every quest/mission were kind of the same long boring action. firefightss with cpu enemies that got really old. getting screwed over if a team mate leaves the game. all out, i dont recommend this game.",7.8
"this game is a lot of fun and every warframe has different qualities and play style, so no matter what you play with it will be fun",782.6
"well, this game can be very dull and boring at times, and can be extremely repetive, almost to the point that you would want to uninstall it to get your gigs back, but even though my critisism of this game would not change any of your opinions, i would not reccomend this game to anyone whatsoever. some people may consider my preference of games distasteful and hideous, but i firmly believe that this game is dreadful, appalling, atrocious, heinous , grim, sickening, dire, and abhorrent.",4.1
"there are some games that show that free to play still has something fun to offer. warframe is one of those titles co-op ninja beat em up or shoot em up. the downside is that the game kinda tries to push you to buy platinum (game money currency) by putting kinda of ridiculous real world hours to build something, besides that you can have all things in the game (besides cosmetic) without paying a cent.",184.9
"simply put, one of the best free to play games out there in more than one genre, not only the vast ammount of content and missions fully available for you even if you didnt spend a bloody dime on the game make up for hundreds of hours of gameplay, the vast and colorful variety of weapons that let you obliterate, decimate (looks into a dictionary) tear apart... eww, more stuff like that! plus the wide cast of characters that are also completely free (given you play missions, gather materials blah blah blah rpg elements) this game puts everything at your reach, you only have to play it! oh yeah one downside... get geforce or gtfo (jk but you ll probably lag during the massive skirmishes)",659.7
"this game is amazing!!!! (and that all there is to say",3.9
"is very nice yes it is and i have shotted all of the aliaens",519.8
"good game for free!! gameplay is pretty good.. worth a go.",7.4
"ninjas play this, if youre a ninja this is your game.",459.4
"this game is addicting! you should get it its really fun, and has lots of action!",603.7
"this game is a awesome 4 man squad shooter. the missions can get a little repetitive but it is fun if you play them in different styles :)",476.6
"ok first i have to say space ninjas thats what you are playing when you play warframe but i have to say thats not a bad thing becus there is parkor wall jumping clans guns swords maces ect. for there are likes of things for you to doin warframe. now if you look at my playtime you will see i have played warframe anuf to tell you its a good game and i think they are sending it in a good direction. now if you like to shoot hit jump and jenraly just repeatedly bash things in the face and hope it dies befor you do. then yes this is the game for you and have fun cus it is a fun game end!!!",248.8
"its a nice game but its hard to find party in hard quests.",20.9
"so far the best free to play fps i can find on steam amazing graphics actual strategy in stuff never boring cause the levels are never the same exactly. not one of those easy to beat games nor is it a impossibly hard game its just... i dont know how to say this in words",206.9
"if you dont like ninjas in space then well, id learn to. warframe is a fast paced extremely costomizable, over the should experiance. i have not played a game as interesting and engrosing as this one in a long time.",21.9
"get this game. play this game. become epic by playing this game.",186.0
"not all free games are so epic.by saying epic i mean ultra epic and never forget game! 8/10..",159.0
"a very good games. it has a lot of potential but it is ruied by a none fluid gameplay and of course a pay to win systeme 6/10",1.7
"very repetitive, but the updates that come and all of the weapons are great. playing with other people/friends is a lit of fun as well. 8/10",34.9
"most of the time its great. gameplay fun, i love the theme. clan and alliances add to it. the downside it that, starting out your have a limited amount of slots for your warframes(your characters to play as) and weapons. it also experiences frequent bugs. most of the things wont bother you as you get platinum handouts now and then(platinum=the bought currency) and just one handout is usually enough to buy you enough slots for your warframes and weapons. it definitely is not a p2w game. youll enjoy this game a lot. that is when the bugs dont interfere. for me they arent extremely annoying yet, theyve only been rather minor. good game, fun, creative, 9/10",127.0
"if you hav nothing better to do this is the game for you.",2.1
"this is a great and crazy fun game to play. the learning curve is a much at first but once you have a few hour in this game you are hooked. the design and game game is wonderful. the frames to pick from or obtain offer everyone something speical to them and the style of game play you would enjoy. the dev are always releasing new content and items. i like that this is not a 5 hour game and then on the something else. this game is something you will enjoy for months and never look back. give it a try and hope to see you in the game. thegrid",406.4
"good game, but too many bugs including random disconnecting from server and more.",78.8
"firstly, this is not a p2w game like most of the f2p games out there, just pay2rush. all items can be bought with in-game currencies except cosmetics. second, it offers great graphics and even greater optimization that allows you to run the game smoothly everytime. third, lots of weapons and customizations. fourth, the developers are hardworking, expect multiple hotfixes and updates daily or weekly. if you care about the in-game and steam achievements thingy, its currently broken but who says it wont get fixed. lastly... just go and play it already!",58.8
"warframe is a great game to play with friends and is really enjoyable. the gameplay is fantastic and i highly reccomend this game to others.",19.5
"if you want a game that rewards cleverness and skill, a game that allows you to take almost any appoach to solo or small team infiltration missions, allows endless possibilities for customization and allows you to create all of your equipment in a monster hunter style kill and loot style... warframe is for you. this game combines the gunplay and ability useage of mass effect 3 (minus the cover mechanic) with nearly the same wall running/climbing level navigation as assassins creed with all of the same john woo slides and dives of max payne 3. this game is simply a rush to play and rewarding to progress through.",393.8
"so here is the deal. warframe is aweful. honestly 0/10 would not play. maybe... maybe 2/10 cuz swords. other than that this game is lame. you force yourself to play a few hours, however, becuase it has gotten higher ratings than some of your favorite games. so youre in around ten hours, and you get to your first level 30 weapon. you have since then purchased and/or found other weapon parts and intended to build a superior weapon to the weapon you currently have. you give it a shot and holy dear lord is it good. and it felt pretty satisfying coming out of the 12 or 24 hour oven (foundry). so you play with that for a while and have a decent amount of fun. so okay, games not great, maybe a 5/10. at least its free. but, becuase this new weapon is pretty good, you want to see what else is on the horizon. rinse and repeat until about 40 hours when you realize that youve covered most of the starchart and have a few good weapons. rinse and repeat until you can take down anything in the starchart very fast. rinse and repeat until you can take out the stalkler in one hit with a meelee weapon. rinse and repeat until you can last to 45 mins + on t4 survival. etc., etc., ,etc. 10/10 god tier game. would recommend (even dropping cash on teh game) tl;dr graph of y = x where x is how much you play and y is your desire to play",271.4
"this is one of those few games you find, that are not only creative and unique, but fun and a blast to play with friends. from doing mid-air slides while shooting a machine gun or stabbing mutants with a sword or axe, this game packs a powerful blast of action and indepth building of your tenno. i would highly recommend this game for anybody who is wanting to find a good free-to-play on steam or just trying to find a way to spend spare time. i would give this game a 9.5/10.",164.7
"the graphics on this game *.*...fantastic! love the ability to advance in levels through crafting weaponry, armory, and shield a lot to take in in the beginning but can be learned very easily game has the same concept as eso but has that sci-fi appeal likes the fact that you can play this game co-op, multi, and pvp highly recommend. 5 starts chia...addicting!",13.9
"well i like this game, its a game meant for people that like to adventure, play with friends, fight, you can do all sorts of stuff! you get to duel with members, do missions, get pets, make weapons, make your weapons better, and enjoy the game :)",641.0
"this is the only game where i can run through a wall and die after falling 1000m. elevators work too.",295.9
"this game is f*cking amazing like really i recommend the f*cks out of this...",215.8
"great game. co-op multiplayer is extremely fun. the variety of warframes to play are extensive and unique. the weapons all seem great so far. looking forward to more and more content.",50.4
"the game, after i spent twenty bucks on it, just stoped working. it would stay and the update screen and would say can not conect to the internet. after getting very mad i asked my fauther to take a look at my computer thinking that might be whats wrong with it, and guess what, it wasnt. then i have my friend take a look at it, he is a computer buff, he said it wasnt my computer either. that must mean that is the game a just sunk money in to.",284.4
"ive barely played 3 hours and just finished the first couple of missions where youve gotta go after vor or whatever. i killed him, and now can completely see this game is grind heavy. if i wanted to grind through a game, id go for a game with at least some open world features and maybe a tad bit of story like oh i dunno, wow. this game is just murder porn with half a story and a grind thats completely unaddictive. this game could be more, but really its the same crap with no variation.",3.2
"dat game doe. thats all i have to say about this game. if you have a slow computer and are in a more console like world, then this game is a free-to-play on ps4 and i strongly recommend that.",29.6
"i tried for over 3+ hours to play this game, everytime i tried to launch it, it said direct x failed to update. which is amusing because the system im trying to run it on already has directx 11 on it, how do you need to update something that is already at the top of the list. and once the directx failed to update the launcher went full on  and wouldnt let me go any further.",0.1
"pros: amazing graphics, great gameplay, lots of cool different fighting styles, a fair amount of suits and weapons cons: some long grinds. overall: good game. 7(8)/10",32.6
"i would never reccomend this game, the gameplay is boring, and the controls are screwed up. worst 3rd person game ever",0.3
"i love this game but it would be nice to actuallyearn platinum buy ranking up but i still recomend this game",28.7
"grind........this game is just about grinding missions all over again to get new .......grind grind grind.........i want 181 hrs of my life back now........",188.1
"amazing... the time i have spent is evident of that... the movement system is awesome...",444.6
"i love this game now lol best free to play ive ever played",278.7
"a thoroughly good game. play solo or with a random group and have fun...play with friends and the fun is elevated to an utter addictive level. no matter if you like to keep the enemy at arms (or gun barrels) length or up close and personal (with a sword or axe), warframe will suite most fpss out there.",91.4
"its an amazing, addictive game. lots of fun to play. highly reccommend it.",226.1
"so, youre a space ninja armed with a gun/bow/grenade launcher/weird alien tech weapon and a sword/hammer/fists/mace and wielding crazy powers to destroy/stun/confuse/decimate your enemies? why have i never heard of this game before??? seriously, this game is phenomenal, the graphics are amazing, the weapons are fun, the powers are cool, the devs are constantly fixing and improving the experience, i cannot find a fault with this free game! i dont have a lot of time to play games, but warframe doesnt require that much dedication to enjoy it at all. the action is fast-paced, the plot is light, the requirements are minimal, the game is ever-evolving giving you new things to do, the tech options (in the form of mod cards) are immense. i highly recommend everyone to try it! what have you got to lose? its free!!!",246.8
"theres so much grinding you would think that youre a puerto rican hooker...",41.4
"i dont really wanna spend to much time writing a review. i just want to keep playing!",725.6
"this is one of those games that just assumes everyone has the latest gaming tech. if you want to re-create the expirience, play far cry 3 on windows 98. its about half this laggy.",2.0
"love the graphics, gameplay and story! plus with being able to play with other people that are not a&#holes makes it even better! i recommend this game to everybody i know and more!",92.3
"i dont like warframe a little cuse i waited 12 hours and after waiting 12 hours thre was an update so havent played it yet",23.9
"i got lost in the menus after i beat the tutorial. 11/10",0.4
"very entertaining and the action is adequately fast and gritty down to the core. spent a lot of hours on this one, and some cash too. totally worth it, but the warframe experience wouldnt be complete with some friends along. :) gets a little lonely sometimes.",273.3
"cool game. it is fun to watch your weapons level and add damage to them",115.5
"extreme variety of weapons and characters to play from. graphics are incredible and provides intense and satisfying gameplay.",1307.4
"its my personal opinion based on that it wont patch. it says patch failed, download files corrupted and it starts over and over again and nothing happens.",27.4
"they say that the first step is admitting you have a problem... well im admitting that im flat out addicted to this game",133.2
"the best kind of grindfest i want to be a part of.",760.9
"lol this is the game you have to buy its like pure notes.... if you wannna have fun and envy chromas play it!",72.8
"very fast paced fun. lots of ways you can play this game. can be a bit grindy but the combat is satisfying",399.0

"free to play space ninja parkour simulator. attach potatoes to your ninja and weapons to enhance.",593.8
"ok so there was a person who only had 8-9 hours in this...just to clarify pros: graphics gameplay controls story voice acting mixture of shooting and melee combat feeling badass flipping off walls and chopping dudes up cons: not enough hours in the day to play might destroy relationship/marriage could cause loss of feeling in  might cause loss of friends 10/10",426.8
"well this game is really fun with its parkour, weapons, enemies and daily challenges but it gets boring around the 50-60 hour mark because every map starts to look the same.... but its a free game so go ahead and pick it up for and have fun with it ;p",125.1
"if youre not playing this already, youre a loser. straight up.",162.5
"good game. i love it its really sexy, and sexy oh, and sexy",7.1
"holy supercalifragilisticexpialidoshus, this game is so fricking fun!!!!!!!!!!!!",17.9
"good game. a little light on story for my taste, but thats personal opinion. fun to play, the fact that maps change every mission is neat, and customization is varied and interesting. overall; definitely worth playing.",40.9
"warframe, for me, has been the game that keeps on giving. it is incredibly action packed, the combat system is smooth and customizable, and the graphics are just beautiful for a free to play. while there are some set backs such as need/terrible pricing of platinum, this game is one of the best ftps out there.",30.1
"an intensely fun, free to play, third person shooter. tons of fun, but if you dont want to pay for premium currency, prepare to spend lots of hours grinding. not a ton of stuff at end of game, but lots to do for newer player.",769.5
"i love this game its well developed awesome graphics but need weapon that we can buy using ingame money.",456.5
"warframe is one of the best games i have ever played, there is a uniqeness about everything you do and all the different mods, colors, weapons, and warframes really make it feel like your characters are your own. every time you play you look at your teamates and see what warframe they are and are able to fit in nicely with one another to really take down enemies and more importantly, just plain have fun. plus warframe is basically futuristic ninjas with guns, how could you go wrong",750.6
"this is fun! check it out, its free to play on steam, coming to ps4 as f2p as well, so get ready !!!",52.8
"game is awesome! can play free or put money into it to get some items and frames you want.",821.2
"probably the funnest, most addicting game i have ever played in all my time on this planet.",604.5
"fun game, but the downside is that you have to put in a lot of hours, and the repetitiveness of the levels would eventually dull ones senses. yes, there is a pvp game mode, but rarely are people logged in there, plus, you dont get to use all your abilities and items obtained from grinding in there. you play with a skeleton warframe. defeats the purpose of getting abilities and items in the first place. there should be more of a storyline too. one of the perks is that the community is friendly and players are always willing to help one another progress through the game.",1089.0
"this game have good graphics and work as wel i recomand to have a good graphics card like nvidia geforce gtx 720.",2.5
"awsome game and free to play and not at all a pay to win",873.2
"this game is like haloish but has level u need play lot its fun buy guns with ip or rp like league",7.1
"if this game only ran on a cheese grater, i would still play it.",1106.2
"great run & gun gameplay that will keep you on your toes. lots of ways to customize your warframe, weapons and sentinels with the use of mods that can give you that edge. i would recomend entering a clan as the support will help you become great at this game.",321.4
"the finest most exiting and best suported beta i have ever experianced if you havent played it play it, get it installed and play it, the community is good, the developers are on it. its a new style of play but once you get your head around the nuances of the combos you will love running around as a space ninja",129.7
"its such a shame...though this game has some of the most fun ive had playing f2p, the buisness model leaves much to be desired. unless your willing to grind out mission after mission, or pay for content, your going to find yourself leveling and aquiring better items much more slowly than i would have liked. the gameplay is reminiscent of me3s multiplayer, with more expansive levels and a smoother playstyle. if it wasnt for the pay2win system thid would be one of my favorite games on steam.",4.6
"imagine this as halo 3, but with more customization and in 3rd person.",132.7
"amazing co-op games with many characters and wepons to chose from get warframe its amazing!",49.2
"an amazing game with it getting even better the further you get into the game.",834.4
"do not expect to get anywhere in this game without paying money or putting in way to much time.",9.7
"warframe is an amazing free to play 3rd person shooter that does not lack anything in the graphics eye candy department. it is fast paced, the levels get harder and harder to deal with, and is amazing fun when played with friends. highly recommend it!!!",314.3
"great game only down fall is it will make you forget you have real life things to do.",1116.3
"its fun for the few first hours, but then it just gets repetitive and boring.",90.0
"play warframe its so good youll be slapping yourself silly",552.8
"i really love this game! the graphics and gameplay is amazing i also love the how each warframe has a very unique ability that they can use! keep it up! :d",16.8
"you see in the game from weapons, warframes (characters), sentinels, pets and other cool stuffs. the only character and weapons you cant get is the excalibur prime, lato prime & skana prime - cuz its a game founders items. other sci-fi / fantasy themed game can never be better than this game. unique art style that will blow your mind the moment you see it, very good and detailed background storyline that is also stick along with the in-game living universe. new contents and updates every month thats always get you hype and surprise you all the time. the game focused on co-op pve hack & slash things rather than pvp but its still have some good competitive pvp mode like clan vs clan or alliance vs alliance... let just stop right here, youve to play and feel the game yourself, words mean nothing in this game. and one last thing, warframe devs always care about the community just like valve did, theyd ask you how you feel, how you doing, what is going on, what do you want in the next update, do you have any problem while playing... and so so on, they really care about you, they do, same goes for the community itself, good people everywhere will help you noobs if you get stuck somewhere or dont know this or that. just play the game and you will be in love with it.",55.7
"its a great game, with stunning visuals and impressive mechanics for a ftp game, and it has an incredible amount of content. the actions like wallrunning and rolling around like a true ninja makes it feel like you are actually a warrior taking on massive amounts of enemies through superior skill and cunning. the downsides come into their own when you take a look at two things. one, the stealth aspect. its great to pull off a stealth kill, but unfortunately it most likely wont happen more than one or two times in a mission, because the enemies are always aware of where you are as soon as you have been noticed once, regardles of whether they actually saw you enter the room or not. the second part is the business model. should you happen to be a fan of incredible weaponry, prepare to pay. a lot of guns take more than $5 to unlock, which is straddling the line between microtransactions and macro transactions. despite these flaws, its still a great game, albeit a bit grindy if you do not want to pay for the weapons.",215.7
"excellent graphics for a free game. rpg format 3rd person shooter. most items in-game can be bought with credits earned from missions or the blueprints to create them via farming materials so you really dont need to spend $$ on platinum, unless youre impatient. love the set up. a lot of fun. the missions maps are randomly generated, too. makes it interesting.",39.6
"definition of insanity: doing the same thing over and over, and expecting a different result. this game = insanity incarnate. heres why: -play the same level, over and over again, expecting to actually get a mod/prime/resource -play this game over and over again, expecting it to not be the most rage-inducing game youve ever played. -complain in the forums over and over, expecting nerfs/buffs on demand. however, i still reccomend. somtimes its fun to be insane....",547.3
"downloaded it. made an account. says my email is fine but my password is wrong, even though i had just logged into the website with it. i got a password change and the game yet still says my password is wrong. nice to download a game that doesnt even have a working log in system.",0.5
"at the beginning, you get some . you use that  to kill  to get more . its free and its awesome.",254.5

"yeah its free to play. yeah its multiplayer. ehm, why i added this game to my library? i dont know.. dota 2 is better!",2.7
"pretty fun game for a f2p game. well designed and tons of action. recommended.",4.1
"warframe is not a player friendly game but if you have a friend who is already experienced with the game or you can just read 1 or 2 guides you will be fine but overal warframe is very fun if you wanna be a freking space ninja and murder fools with all maner of weapons and super powers.",85.5
"baest f2p game ever!!!!!!!! try it out and add me (deadlya) :dddd",1016.6
"this game turned me into a farmer with a nice corn grinder as that is all",166.8
"why.... just why oh why. this game used to have an incredibly cool starmap to pick mission targets from which has been replaced by the least imaginitive version of a boring laaaaaaame excuse for a planet interface any intern could possible slap together, fail. most of the rest is really cool aside from pointless pvp. awesome game if u wanna just bounce off walls and be invincible while shooting lazers everywhere. i loved this game until this new interface. unbearable to play now goodbye warframe :(",344.3

"from a collectors point of view and only from this view : stay away from this game. lot of exclusives that you wont be able to get : - helmets with powers - weapons with good stats - mods (enchant weapons to get special effects) that are better than others - cosmetic stuff (which is okay for badges, less okay for the scarves) your dedication is not needed if youre a new player. because you were late, you wont be able to get the best weapons. they will probably never come back with special events because they dont care. for others players who dont care about playing an uncomplete game, its actually an interesting game that evolves a lot and could be really great if it didnt consider newest players like crap. fortunately for me, im an older one, so i can actually enjoy it.",1090.9
"frankly the longer i pay this game the more i cannot believe it is free. now believe me, i hate to say that because of the risk of it becoming something other than free, but this game has some serious high points. first off, the game is beautifully rendered. the combat is very smooth and easy to pick up, even if you are just beginning. as you progress you become more and more aware of the acrobatic aspect of the game. this coupled with the different combat options makes for a truly interesting experience.",412.7

"this is not a game to be played alone. that being said its a lot of grinding and frame building. archwing is amazing and a whole other set of challenges on the game since it is so different from the rest of it. this is a game that will take time and passion to get into. it is well worth it. the trade systems in the game are pretty good but depend on other people who play the game. it can cost a lot of money to play unless you have the willpower to resist lol. though you dont need to spend money on it till later on. i recommend using the platnum that you get when you first start on slots for frames and weapons. it will save you a lot of time and trouble once you start lvling up and getting new gear. i recommend also choosing a syndacte that will do you the most good after you learn your play style and the most common frames you use. they also take a lot of time to build reputation with but the rewards they give you are astonishing and can often be traded for good platinum if you do that i recommend keeping one and saving up to get another to trade. msg me if you have further questions this is the most frequent game i play..and im deffinitly not ending anytime soon.",527.7

"where to start, this game is amazing. who dosent love futuristic ninjas with a large asortment of weaponry and warframes. you (and your sqaud if you chose) are a thought to be a long extinct race called the tenno. you (and your squad) are sent on challenging missions such as raid, capture, assassination and more. with unique maps and randomly generated scenarios, this game is hard to beat comparied to the other free to play games. it plays well and it is well polished. its flaws are the currency for ingame money called platinum, $5.00 = 75 platinum in which a warframe cost 375 platinum (depending on the warframe). another flaw is the building system, you go all over the solar system collecting various resurces and materials to build weapons, warframes, ect. but the warframes require a s**t ton of material and some of them you cannot get in one go. you may have the bluprints for the warframe ect. but you nedd to work for it. once you have all of the materials you can build the warfraem, weapon, ect. but it will take 12hrs for weapons, warframe parts 24hrs, warframes them selves will take 3days. but, this games goods over shadow the bads with f-u-n. so if you like space ninjas, badass weapons, cool looking warframes with unique powers this is for you. (9.3/10)",382.5
"this game haz guns and swords and people shooting and swording so i think its a pretty good game if you like swording people in half/3 pieces. i like 3 pieces of chicken but not always. i like it spicy. also this game has robots but you kill them and they are hard. they have guns. robots are cool.",41.7
"to tell you the truth i cannot stand this game. like i see people saying its the best game ever and how its a landmark in free to play games. but all it does is just rehash all that is wrong in the genre. first off i will admit the game is ing pretty. the reflections and lighting especialy. but the gameplay feels bland and asks way to much from the player. some of the more advanced manuvers are just ridiculous. try pressing the control key while holding shift. and i hate games like this that dont scale the difficulty properly for single-player. i mean if i have no freinds dont penalize me. overall the game is just grindy. like its the whole point of the game. the idea of mastery levels are explained terribly. but hey if you like grinding one level over and over to get a certain material go ahead.",32.7

"warframe is honestly one of the best games i have ever played. its a tps/parkour game it is still a little buggy but that is totally forgivable once you experience the gameplay. not only is this game fun its an experience the way you interact with the environment makes you feel as if you were actually in the game wall jumping, and parkouring through the maps of the world, but anyways positives and negatives aside this game scores a 9/10 from me would reccomend to friends and family.",279.1

"its pretty, well-designed, enjoyable and has lots of lovely weapons with which you can run around doing murders for kicks. however, it is an mmo and will likely eat your soul. that said, at least it doesnt try too hard to extort money out of you with microtransactions. if you work hard, literally anything (except the founders pack, which is basically just a reskin of the old newb kit and some other, non-gameplay-affecting stuff) the game has to offer is available to you. 9.5/10 would consign life to endless grinding again",208.4
"one of the most interesting projects of 2013 that flowed into 2014 that ive seen. the game has all what a gamer needs. guns, fancy karate gimmicks, swords. two words: space ninjas. what is actually good that the game even tho is f2p but it does not follow a shadowy p2w path. you might be confused in the beggining, as getting the stuff, crafting, locations and controls. but when you get over it, you might as well like it. another aspect that drives the attention. constant new content updates from very friendly developers. i might add that devs do take in considiration players ideas and implement ideas and throughts into a real thing. almost all the stuff ingame can be aqquired just by playing the game, you just need to get over the beggining. but this game is still in beta. there could be bugs, there could be flaws. currently devs implement tons of content every two months (aprox). in general this is a game that you might totally like or just play for two minutes and uninstall. playing with friends is recomended.",903.8

"this game is an example of free to play done (mostly) right, which is very rare. you, a member of the tenno race, are equiped with suits known as warframes, each with unique stats and powers. it is your mission to aid in the war between the tenno, grineer, corpus, and infested. admitadly, the game plays like a standard third person shooter, where it really shines is all of the different weapons and mods just waiting to be discovered, like bows to assault rifles, health increases to abilities. its not without its problems, though. the game is littered with microtransactions, and while optional, grinding isnt fun unless you have friends. oh yeah, this game has a standard 4 player co-op system too, which it is usually designed around. overall, i would suggest getting this game with a very open mindset.",700.5
"warframe is immensly diverse in all aspects; from creating your character to just building something in the foundry. it has incredible team play and great missions types. there is also a real sense of comradery among players. theres so much to do and complete its no wonder some players have been playing a full year from its release and still have tons to do. the look of the the game is unbelievable,the graphics alone are top notch and pull you in just from the title screen. the controls feel fluid and absolutely flawless. aside from all the positive comments i can throw at this game, the only negative gripe i have is the connectivity to their servers when entering/leaving a mission when in multiplayer, and also host migration seems like it needs some technical tweaks. if the mere seemless possibilities to expand, explore, and create and over the top gameplay dont pull you in, then the 1gb download and free access most definitely will.",927.5
"a while ago, i used to play this a lot. i had the same stock weapons for a long time, because its so hard to get a new weapon. when i finally got a new weapon (it was expensive), it sucked. i dont want to grind. but when i did grind, i got a cool gun. then my computer broke. rip",30.5

"amazing movement and combat system unlike any before but does cost money eventually no matter what and will need to have its finishing quality added. the character leveling and custimization is great but once you realize theres not much more to do once you have a couple warframes and a good couple levels up you realize all of the work you put into making a badass godlike superhero ninja is only to continue puting more time and money into each character and there is never any sort of player to player recognition for your time invested in your character. games like world of warcraft have all of the intricate mini parts of the game, like warframe, but no matter what you get tangled up in you always know grand total the game is still alliance vs horde(primarily) and warframe and its creators. needs to finish with its own distinguished main reason to play the game. something that makes you take all the time you spend making your guy just as awsome as you want him and then actually lets you use him for a purpose other then more leveling or material farming. my vote is for hundreds of warframes to eventually meet in head on 360 degree warfare in online servers on the supposed new part of the game. control points, weapons and warframes would be great!",203.7

"i really enjoy this game, especially when its played with friends. there is one thing i dont really enjoy, and thats the thousands of hours grinding for materials for a weaponwarframe. most of the weapons are single blueprints and take about 12 hours to make, but each part of the warframe blueprint has a seperate blueprint. for eg.: rhino consists of rhino helmet, rhino systems and rhino chassis. every single part is a different blueprint and takes another 12 hours to make. if you cant afford to buy platinum, it usually takes about 10-15 days of grinding for the materials for every different blueprint. doing the math, its 240 hours + 36 hours + the extra 72 hours to complete the warframe, it takes simply 348 hours (14 and a half days) to make a single warframe. but i still recommend the game, but if you dont spend a little money on buying platinum, you wont get very far very fast.",365.4

"warframe a fresh new take on the third person shooter series of games. with futuristic weaponry and characters, i instantly got hooked on the game. instead of being a pvp oriented game, warframe focuses on co-op missions. you can team up with up to 3 players, forming a 4 man squad, to eliminate nodes on the map and receive rewards and experience. there is not much else i can say other than you should definitely try this out. youll have to experience this game for yourself to realize how awesome it is.",53.3

"out of all free to play games, this one is my favorite imo. its still in beta from what i can tell, but its rather good! let me start out with some of the things i whitnessed in this game. (and why i like it.) 1st: you dont have to play this multiplayer. you have an opption to play by yourself! i love it when f2p games do this. 2nd: even if you lose a mission, you still get a little bit of money. sort of like a you tried! keep trying! plus, if you win a misson, you get bonus credit. from what i have seen it ranges from 1000 to 1500. im not sure how far it gose. 3rd: the gameplay , in my oppinion, is so sattisfying. im not someone who likes rpgs, but this gameplay is super addictive! i love the sword play in this game, its epic. now, some of the cons. 1: there is a lot of grinding, but i can forgive that due to the gameplay being fun. 2: while they allow you to buy blueprints, some of the items are a little pricey, this is a f2p afterall. 3: expect bugs. the only bugs i have whitnessed were graphical ones. not too much, but they are there. and that is all i can think of. correct me if im wrong on some things, but i would recomend this game to any space ninja enthusiest.",29.0

"this is one of the best ftp games ive ever used it is a third person shooter based on you being in a suit called a warframe. warframes are buildable suit that each have unique properties and abilitys, i really loved this game. key word would be loved, its an amazing game but its often just a repetitive farm, in the 10th update (when i stopped playing) they made a change to the slide and sprint machanics that i just hated, and from there it just went down. now i admit i dont mind and actually like farming and yes this game did make it fun and unique its still what made me give it up in the end. so i personally really do suggest the game i mean playing with my friends i got 250 hours out of it. so out of 100 id give it 94.",268.2

"surprisingly good game with co-op. sort of like the mass effect 3 multiplayer, but good, and with free-running space ninjas. there is almost no pvp in this game, which is wonderful for all of us sick of wonderful pve games being ruined by devs focusing solely on pvp, but if youre too much of a  little gremlin to play cooperatively with other people youre not going to like it very much. as someone whos dumped a lot of time into this game already, i should point out two things going in: it takes about 10-20 hours before youll get the hang of all of the craziness (so read up on the wiki), and it *is* primarily designed to be a cooperative game (so find a group to play with, because itll go much faster and be more reliable than playing with players from matchmaking).",732.6

"its fun but just like most the online competitive free-to-play games here, this one would require some ching-ching for you to win and pls no i wasnt trying to be racist. also, most of the missions would require you to play with more than one person. about the game: i only played briefly as i have the wonderful world of dota 2 right after i downloaded warframe. basically what you are is an alien ninja species that can use guns as well, a species called tenno. the tenno are almost extinct because of a certain faction which i forgot the name. so, what youll do is to team up with other tennos (or you can solo if you buy powerful items using real ching-ching) and defeat the evil faction. there are also some other side missions where you do other stuff idk i havent played yet. keep in mind these: -if youre looking for a free to play game, this is a no-no because youd get bored. -even though my time was brief i enjoyed it and i had money to spare so it probably helped tremendously with my experience. -i didnt try surviving the game without money, so since its free and if you have time id recommend you to at least try it. happy gaming guys.",14.3

"pros: + excellent weapon variety + excellent warframe variety + vibrant visuals in some areas + mostly everything cash shop can be obtained free cons: - endless grind - boring enemy variety - so-so plot that is overusing the awakened hero in troubled times cliche - difficulty based off of stat differences - enemies blend in with the environment due to grays, whites, and blacks being pre-dominant in the art style - huge focus on grind for it or pay for it model that is thirstier than nexon - facebook game style get the resources and wait 12 hours ~ 24 hours for it to be made crafting for things as simple as accessing a guild base - limited inventory slots that can be expanded for microtransactions - very, very money-hungry - did i mention itll make you wait 12 hours or pay roughly 50 cents just to access your guild base faster? - hacking puzzles that attract enemies that can be eliminated by paying tl:dr so-so game at heart ruined by greedy money hungry s who want you to pay for this game with 10000 microtransactions when you could just go and buy other better games. hell even some asian-developed mmorpgs brought to the states arent this blatantly thirsty.",2.9
"an interesting take on 3rd person shooting and an overall solid co-op experience. dont let the beta tag fool you, it feels and acts solidly. the two biggest weaknesses of the game are the grinding and the samey looking levels. the levels are procedurally generated and easy to get lost in.",23.3
"very fun if you like games that involve shooting and ninjas, but maybe not for people who like pirates. then again, there is swords, so mabey you can pretend :)",5.9
"free to play, why yes it is. although a lot of this game is through learning by experience of play through you really dont need any money to spend to enjoy this game. the trading channel in which players can buy and sell items is easily the best way to enhance not only the community but yourself as well. love being a ninja in space? new updates are monthly with a dedicated staff. theres really nothing i dislike about the game. endless opportunities using hundreds of different weapons, customization beyond belief, its a real joy to play.",225.1
"great game. it may be a little hard to get attached to at first, but once you do youll be addicted. its a fun fps with awesome game mechanics, but a lack of story makes it difficult to get hooked. its very much game first, story second, but its a great game nonetheless.",768.6
"personally, i love this game. space ninjas, magic, and mass murder is pretty damn great, however, it has some game breaking bugs that always coincide with events. i had a party bug that made me go solo always, which was no problem, but running a melee only interception is ridiculously difficult. if youre gonna hold an event, make sure that your game doesnt break during it. seriously. anyway, i have no other complaints because this game is amazing, but devs, i understand the weekend is your break, but the events usually start on friday anyway. i really hate that. i really dont wanna play this game because its gonna suck me into it again, and then break and ill be left scratching my head.",251.7
"recommended for a try due to high polish sticking around however, unless you have dedicated buddies to help with the ridiculous artificially difficult bosses, not recommeded.",55.7
"this game absolutely amazing and extremely addicting! the graphics are awesome; the gameplay is fluid, and i, personally, experience very little lag, even though my computer is not that great and lags on most games i play or try to play. the character customization is also very good, even if you dont have any money since some extra colors are available to you for free. and, if you do have the money, the possibilites are nearly endless from changing what type of warframe you use to what body type it has to the decorative armor pieces that it wears, and the various color palletes give a vast aray of possible color combinations. the only thing id even think to complain about is how the maps tend to repeat, but, at the same time, i like how the maps are generated randomly from a specific set of rooms each time a mission is started, preventing the entire map for a mission being the same multiple times in a row. there are a couple glitches i have come across, though, but glitches are to be expected in pretty much any game, and the ones ive seen are nothing that really ruin the games fun and excitement. theres also that fact that there is no pvp, except in clan dojos, but that is so easy to overlook with how exciting everything else is. overall, this could perhaps be one of the best games, if not the best game, i have ever played. it is definitely worth the download, and you really have nothing to lose if you happen to not like it.",53.9

"killing stuff is fun. sneaking up on people/things and killing them is fun also. so even though i have to admit that i have no idea what warframe/gear is best, or even how to get it, warframe is fun. im still using the same junk that i started the game with, running around killing things, defending things, and grabbing things and then running... lots of running. and i can do it either singly or multiplayer. its that single player bit which got me to try the game in the first place... not a big fan of online shooters (and the in-game chat channel is as dreary as in most online games). the game is perfectly fun without groups, though i imagine theres plenty of content you couldnt do without help or at least uber gear. but for me, its fine. i wont spend any real money on warframe, so i have no idea how the lack of platinum affects your options in the long run, but for what it is, its a great bit of fun which can be had for free.",17.6
"i have played this game for about 8 hours and i am on my way to start creating another warframe (oberon). but i highly recommend this game because its free, and is insanely fun if you like a parkour/3rd person shooter and play in co-op, then this is the game for you.",76.1

"it may have repitive gameplay elements its still fun to play especially with friends. it may have pay to win elements, but you can still be the very best with out paying though it may take longer. overall its a game to give it a try if you got no other mmo shooter to play. another thing you are a ninja. 10/10",57.7

"this game has changed the way i look at third person shooters. i love the constant additions and improvements as well as quests given by the generous amount of updates and i hope to see this game get even bigger in the future.",97.8
"pros... its a free game, amazing graphics, addictive gameplay, controller support, new content is added all the time, cons... since its a free game the micro transactions make the game a p2w(pay 2 win) since you can buy pretty much anything and if you dont decided to pay you have to grind and grind and grind to get the mats to build the items you want and after you killed all the bosses the game becomes a repetive grind for everything, the chat/invite system is to complicated but my main issue with this game is the lag problems it has, since the party host is the server host it depends on the connection they for you to have a playable experience other wise you have a 1-6 second delay on everything, you can shoot an enemy and see him die but the body will still be around cluttering the screen that means that you will have a massive amount of enemies just standing around blocking your attacks. i have a pretty decent connection(100mbps/100mbps) so i know its not my connection causing the issue and its seems that the only solution to this problem is to find people that have good connection and play with them, if the devs can fix this problem i can overlook all the other issues and actually enjoy the game.",204.7

"warframe is a free game to play with your friends and makes you feel like a ninja (if you want ninja weapons...). playing alone is enjoyable, playing with friends is more enjoyable as with most games and it is a game that you select your class, level up, and upgrade your weapons. cant forget the premium weapons and  which make you feel like you are weak, behind in the game, or you just want to buy them because they look nice. nice graphics, not too crazy to run this game, and pretty basic controls. i give this game 7.5/10",3.3

"exellent game, its not like the other si-fi and futeristic games. this one is diffrent. the dev team have really made the game look beautiful not only that but the combat is fluent, there is many other ways of killing your foes and not to mention the 20 diffrent and uniqe warframes (classes) they all have diffrent abilities and all hae a diffrent play style.",47.6

"normally im not that much into f2p games as the quality is usually abysmal and basicly whoever pays always wins over the players who dont. warframe is different in this aspect though. the graphics and effects are superb, everything players can buy can also be obtained ingame (although sometimes it can be a bit of a grind) and the devs are extremely passionate about their game (this is easily noticed how fast they react to glitches and how well they listen to the council and the normal players). as a founder and a closed beta player this game has already made brilliant progress and the devs are far from done with this game so expect a looooooooooot more content. definitely a recommend from me. (around 600+ hours in the game)",541.6
"extremely impressed. especially for a free game. i would pay full market price for this. highly polished, graphics are incredible, interface looks good and works well. only minor issues are that the mod system could be more well explained and intuitive and the enemy ai could use improvement. i started off stealthily shooting enemies that were out of sight of other enemies until i realized that it doesnt matter. an enemy can watch his friend get nailed by an arrow and have absolutely no reaction unless he sees you or hears you shoot. other than that amazing game.",18.7

"while im writing this review i have about 150 hours in this game. this game is great. you dont have to spend money if you want cool weapons or gear. it can be all unlocked. the platinum which can be bought with realmoney can also be earned in the game (selling prime parts and moods etc.). in this game you play like a spaceninja you can either go in stealthy or you can go in guns a blazing its your choice. hope this short review helps pros: - great visuals - fun combat - great warframe designs - a lot of weapons - great community cons: - repetitive soundtrack - lackluster mission objectives - some bugs - grinding",188.0
"i love this game and i most love that its not a shooter if you dont want it to be. all the crafting and editing of the dojo is so fun to do. the game and all of its aspects connect perfectly together like a puzzle. except the new tutorial doesnt make it as confusing like a puzzle but you get my point. i hope.",139.6
"i recommend this game for multiple reasons... lets start with price. its free. now that that is out of the way, i think this game has a great story to it and it isnt obsessively repetitve and boring. this game also has good graphics for being free to play and i would actually pit it against serveral pay-to-play games. the modes of play on this game are somewhat limited but other features of this game make up for that entirely. warframe gives players a massive personalization platform from which to work and idealize their gameplay. this game isnt the best thing that exists, but it is a very good game that has lots of appeal to a wide variety of gamers. another side note would be to overlook the fact that this is a 3ps. when i saw that it looked like a major detractor from the outside, but once i started playing, it really opened up my mind. this game does still have its minor glitches and issues, but the team behind it does a fantastic job at ironing out the problems where they can. i highly recommend this game to anyone who wants to experience something you dont normally see in a shooter.",278.3
"good game nice graphic totally recommend this game if you are into fps type games",50.9
"im almost certain that this is the best f2p game out there and completely free. you can argue that league of legends is better but its really not. everything is free as far as gameplay is concerned, similar to league, skins cost money but is not required. just download it and throw money at your screen please.",10.8

"brilliant game. its free, but if people so desire they can pay to advance further; or not. youll still enjoy it. a mixture of tactical third-person shooting and fast-paced free-running and melee combat, this game has community-minded features such as clans and alliances, and gamewise its got a huge number of varied mission types, playstyles and gear. aesthetically, its beautiful. you dont need a diamond encrusted alienware to run this at top graphics settings. almost everything looks good, and it runs very smoothly on most systems. an excellent plot, voice acting and mission selection, modding and inventory system. add the fact that it is still technically in development, meaning that theres constantly new content coming in, and youve got a masterpiece in the making. ive enjoyed this game since beta, and have done so with spending a very little amount of money as a founder to support the development. i would advise anyone who can get this to do so. youve got nothing to lose, and a lot to gain.",295.3

"its a pretty decent game, but it gets boring after awhile, being that all the levels are almost completely identical. the game is good to kill time, but if you really want to get into it, its a pay-to-win game. if you pay, you will really pay a lot being that everything you can buy, that is usefull is 20$ and up.",43.6
"its grindy, but if youre into collecting things this is probably a good game for you. there is a codex that sort of works like pokemon snap, and there are lots of weapons and frames to unlock. like most pve games, once you learn the mechanics and behaviours it starts becoming dull.",610.0
"this game is consists of mostly grinding resources, blueprints and mods to create your ulitimate arsenal. nevertheless, this is still such a good game. interesting weapons and warframes, maps and events. the game, at first, is a grind to get to your desired arsenal. but when you get there, boy is it fun to play. i do recommend getting some friends to play with you for double the fun.",300.6

"kinda cool but the menu system was kind of annoying, and single-player was stupid easy.. in multiplayer there was a challenge but its super real money orientated.",0.7

"i have spent (unbeknownst to me) over 300 hours playing this game and i have nothing but positive things to say. despite the fact that many free-to-play games often require you to pay in order to progress, this isnt true with warframe. as ive learned from the very beginning you could play for hours-upon-hours without having to spend a single penny. it wasnt until i was nearing 100 hours that i realized how much i enjoyed this game. not only that, but i also thought that investing in (platinum for) the game would only help make my already-pleasant experience even better. warframe has evolved alot in the small amount of time that ive played it. through player purchases the developers have added new maps, new mods, a killer melee battling system, and outstanding and unique missions and modes that only add to the spontaneity of this game. just imagine a game that mixes ninja gaiden with call of duty with vanquish. from my own personal experience, its worth checking out - especially if youre a college student (like myself) and are strapped for spending money on the new games coming out every-so-often. give this game a shot and im sure you will come to find at least a few things that make warframe a fun, great, and unique experience. game on. - lenny",380.2

"id like to support this game, but really, its built to suck your wallet dry and its horribly expensive. the platinum conversion ratio is 75p for $5. almost any weapon is atleast 145p, which means it costs you $10 to buy one damn weapon. most of the good weapons are 230+p which is going to cost you $20 with some platinum left over. you might think, well, thats not really terribly horrible, right? except, the way the damage system is built, you will totally suck against one or the other factions without buying weapons that are effective against them. and dont give me the crap about being able to craft the weapons, because crafting resources are scattered and ive yet to unlock the systems in which to find any specific crafting materials needed. but you can buy them, for real money. and whatever warframe you pick at the beginning, thats the only one youll ever have until youve unlocked enough places to gather the crafting materials, or you drop the real world cash one, which by the way is 20+ just to play another class.",97.0

"i very much enjoy this game, and i have devoted lots of time to it. i may not be the best player in the world, but here are my two cents on it. pros: fun to play, cool designs, interesting mechanics, teamplay based, the people are fun and goofy, and its quite easy to pick up. constantly expanding. cons: not really for casuals. a sort of lack of clarity after you beat the tutorial. crafting is somewhat confusing before you figure it out. there are still bugs here and there. however, if you are going to pick up this game, i recommend you look up information on the wiki frequently. because its good for you.",99.0

"im sorry but once again warframe has failed me. why you might ask? well heres the thing:since my last review i said that it did some mayor improvements and it did. but then i came back to a mayor problem:getting bored of my weapons/warframe and trying to get new stuff,but not being able to buy/craft anything aka it costs way too much ingame money. first you have to spit up 20000 credits(which is one of the cheaper ones)and then you need to pay another 20000 credits to craft it. and all the materials arent even available yet in the beginning. so you might say:well then go do some frikkin grinding and progressing so you can get those materials. mayby,but i dont wanna spend the first 20 hours of gameplay on grinding. the phrase ninjas play free is wrong,for you to have fun in experimenting with different loadouts the best way is to just spend real money on it. ps.the game is laggy as  final opinion:the key moments of your game are at the start,so that way you can win a gamers heart and make them keep playing the game,this is not something these people got. i am sorry but you could not win over my heart once again,mayby in another year of updates whil you get it right.",16.4

"the game itself is a good example of how f2p should work...everything in the game, from weapons, warframes or even items can be made by yourself using in-game credits and resources you find while playing, you can pay real money if you want to get whatever you want early but is not really necessary so you can fully experience the game without paying anything. sadly that doesnt mean the game itself is really good, there are just a few maps that you will see over and over and there is no real point in playing the game since there is basically no plot, even though the game is full with lore and no end game content, once you reach the last planet and do all missions in it, there is nothing else to do but to keep buying new equipment and level them up and sadly that was my experience, in less than 48 hours i made one new warframe that had one skill that was really powerfull, one sword with a charged attack that could pretty much insta-kill everything (except bosses) so i didnt really need new equipment after that so it didnt take long before i reached the final planet and finish the last mission and after that....nothing, so i just uninstalled it",52.1

"this unique f2p game is one of the best pc games out there. it has a very nice system of parkour, combat, and other things. and the updates come out at a rather frequent rate, always giving you more, and looking forward to more. the one thing that i dont like is the secondary currency of platinum, which can only be bought through real-world money. but you can get up to 50% off discounts just by playing the game. and it is not at all pay-to-win. you can progress easily through the game if you really want to. platinum just makes it to where you can get a jump across some obstacles. everything is can be accesed, and nothing seems to be platinum exclusive. 9.5/10 stars. i really recommend this game!",102.5

(although free to play used in the manner as it is used in warframe it means you can play without paying, but paying could make the experience better. nonetheless, as a non-paying user, i think for myself that it plays just fine for free.) warframes looks are equal to or better than most aaa releases and the gameplay is likewise. it might take more than a few hours of playing it to understand how to work it properly, and it doesnt always tell you excactly how to pull off every move, but this also leaves a lot of room for experimentation, which i think is one of the points where this game shines rather brightly. if you like ninjas, sci-fi, shooters, stealth actions or slashers, warframe is likely to hit you in at least one good spot.",18.4
"ruined my life for one month. grindy as hell, but its just so worth it. want to pin stuff to walls with your bolto? go ahead and grind for one to a few hours. but then, tis so fun just firing f*cking crossbow bolts with a rifle. want to get the nova warframe? sure, grind for the blueprints, with a 33% chance drop of a specific one after killing a boss , then grind for all the f*cking plastids , but sucking stuff into a black hole is so satisfying. go ahead, be like me and ruin your life, but be warned, some updates will be major (i.e. i quit cos of a new ui). edit 1: just got back into it- amazing sauce. contacted support for something and the response was posted in less than 24 hours :) gj devs tl;dr : grindy, but fun with good support!",116.9

"probably the most fun i can get from a third person shooter/hack n slash online game there is out there in my opinion. what i like about the game: the countless amount of mods and weapons there are, the fun coop multiplayer mode and unique classes/warframes. what i dont like about the game: quite repetitive at times, requires a significant amount of grinding and the countless amount of mods and weapons are either obtainable through grinding or real cash. all in all if you hate grinding avoid this game at all cost but if you dont mind grinding or like it, its a must have.",70.8

"for being a free to play game it has nice graphics and smooth gameplay. that being said the areas are extremely repetative in nature and becomes almost boring to play in. i understand the game when i played it was only like 6-10 months old and still in beta but even for a preview i got the feeling that after about 40 hours of gameplay you probably seen everthing this game has to offer. pros: free to play, great graphics, good amount of replayability due to many many different kinds of suites being available, powers and customizables make for a good amount of variables. cons: free to play, but pay to win/have fun. i am getting worried that game companies are going to start adopting this method and it scares me to no end that it will spell disater for the game industry. its almost ruined a whole generation of games for me and many many others. overall: fun to play for a while, but to keep having fun money is to be spent and alot of it unless you spent the huge amount of money on a founders pack already. decent overall free to play game, at the very least try it out cause honestly there is no harm in playing a free game.",31.4

"ye, i tested it once again and its improved a lot. i wont mention what is the big plus of all that, because it is self explanatory and if you dont know, play the game! it sure is worthy, for now. hope they dont destroy it. old: played the closed beta, dont believe the trailers, the game itself isnt as great as they show it, though it is worth to play, especially with friends and alike. maps are boring tho, enemy ai is this games weak point.",6.5
"this should not be rated m it is worth t it is hardly gorey and just a little bit of blood.",6.2
"warframe, one of the best free coop online shooters out there. they gameplay is kinda routine u kill enemies and complete tasks, this can get boring (especially if u dont play with friends) but if u continue u will be rewarded! (ull need to grind a lot) the high variety of weopons, warframe and mods (upgrades for weopons/warframes) could make every session different u can adjust ur play style to the warframe u play with so it always stay different. also the events are always fun to do en they show up frequently wich makes u wanna play even after u said that u would stop (it happend to me) i hope this inspires u to give it a try and remember never give up and keep grinding!",280.3
"a good game i think most people should try. its a good co-op game to play with your friends, only downside is that it can be computer intensive. it can also be lag at times. but its also free to play and its nice to search for warframe parts to make new warframes and weapons.",453.9

"just a warning to any one intending to invest time into this game. through my own personal experience i have now lost months of playing time and hundreds of dollars because this company decides it was ok to delete my acount with out my knowledge now ive been side linded in support for almost a week the customer service is digusting and respond with aditude toward its customers, this businesss practice is disgusting and unacceptable. so just a note if u plan on playing and spending money you do it at youre own risk",152.9

"a very good, polished (even though currently in beta) f2p, with zero pay-to-win. its entirely co-op. if you enjoyed mass effect 3s mp, or enjoy third person shooters like red faction guerrilla/armageddon, then youll love warframe. also, they made dark sector.",561.2
"the combat and movement of this game is amazingly complex, detailed & fun. however, i dont recommend coming into this game without watching some begginer youtube videos, the tutorial system is no where near informant enough to explain this game. great game, 8/10",12.8
"best f2p there is for me . not trully free though but it doesnt demand you to pay 40-50 euros so you can proceed with game . just with 5-10 euros you can access almost everything in the game , and there is lot. content is added frequently with lots of updates either big or small. i recommend this game hands down. if you can play this with friends then even better !!!",320.6
"i totally approve of this game, bit glitchy from time to time but what did anyone expect from an open beta game. i tried it once, got hooked and so did a friend of mine who didnt like it at first, theres potential and players seems to be part of how this game evolves. 3 major letdowns though: #first out are those russians and whatnot who keep insisting *not* to use english when doing online gameplay even when they are asked to keep it so everyone could understand. #second, speedrunning kids who go from start to end asap without actually doing any real gameplay. #third, is more of a personal preference as *even if* they support the devs, i find it extremly lazy when people just buy their gear with platinum as it just takes out the fun of the game, everyone want it all, but no one seems to be willing to work and wait for it, shame. but other than that, its a fun game and even more with friends so bring them. /nazher",344.4

"great game! has mutiple ways to fight great crafting system. no need to spend real money to continue within the game. combat is amazing. the aspect of the dojo for clans is amazing be able to make a base for your members to craft there items and also requires crafting. such a good game. check it out.",427.3

"i find this game to be a solid alright its a time sink (majorly), it takes around 2-3 days to make a new warframe(new class) after collecting all the pieces. unless you pay for the warframe then you get it automatically, you may like this game if you like leveling up, playing the same maps which may get repetitive, farming. i give this game a 7/10, it is a time sink but it can get highly repetitive.",70.0
"while i used to enjoy this game greatly, the devs continue to make it more and more absurd to try to unlock any of the new content without paying for it. walls upon walls of rng combining together to make it dozens of hours for some of the gear, if you ever see it. prime equipment and the new warframes are particular offenders of this. downvoting until i see some real dedication to changing their tactics. less rng stacking. let interesting cosmetics make you money from a happy playerbase that feels its not just hoping for the dice to roll in their favor. there is no progress in rng. just luck.",252.9
"this is a game i enjoyed back on my brothers ps4(back when there was just this and resogun), but to the combined efforts of my houses console restrictions, my brother playing it constantly and infamous second sun, i havent played it for a while. its about time i install the pc version.if you like hack n slashes and third-person shooters, warframe is a mission-based combination of both. it doesnt take long for warframe to leave an impression on you. everyone except the evil emperor zurg is invading the planets of the solar system, and you go in with others to fight off, defend, eliminate, protect against, capture, survive against, or rescue people from the enemy. the combat has some variety with the melee combat and is both simple and satisfying. the craftable weapons, customization, various abilities for the expanding amount of classes in the form of warframes(ah, he said it, he said it), daily rewards and creative boss battles make this an awesome f2p that youll keep returning to. im sure its keep patching and updating to infinity and beyond!",7.3

"good game, but i wish there was a pvp gamemode. after a while all the grinding gets old, but its fun to play every now and then",224.5
"this game got me hooked right at the trailer, i cant believe i havent been playing this the last two years... its everything it promises and has a huge variety of customization. its free to play and once youre one hour into it you will lose yourself in it... fantastic setting and graphics, and sooooo much custumization!!! love it!!! lotus ftw",121.1

"space ninjas. a novel concept that for some reason, i had never considered. im not very far into the game yet (not even ranked yet), but i can already tell this is going to be game i will have a complicated relationship with. being a keyboard & mouse user, i find it slightly difficult to control things at times, and occasionally the camera just does not want to co-operate. but this is a small thing, compared to the amazing overall depth and quality of the game itself. if youve ever wanted to play a ninja in space, with deadly powered-armors and insane abilities, warmframe is the game for you. just like fps games? prooooobably not going to be your cup of tea, but you should try it anyway, because who knows? you might be surprised.",13.5

"this game is very enjoyable. however, it seems the developers dont know where theyre going with it. some days warframe is brilliant and i love it. the next something could be changed or switched or removed or added. its impossible to tell. i still reccomend this game, but dont expect to know what itll be like tomorrow. i am editing this review about 8 months after it was first posted. the game has been going downhill since february, and has finally reached its death. the game is currently an unplayable pile of . so much potential wasted because of greed.",761.5
"some people said that this!, its the free-to-play version of destiny...",10.6
"highly enjoyable, immersive game with intense, quasi-realistic graphics. if you have a high-end graphics card, your experience will be reminiscent of a 3d cgi movie. very high quality. to sum up the game? space ninjas. that is all you need to know to find this game awesome. easy to use basic controls, more advanced mobility including wall running, long distance jumps, slides and flips to make you feel like a real ninja. plus, the co-operative element is important. every member of a squad is essential. dont let anyone tell you otherwise.",449.5
"fun, co-op shooter with elements of melee combat that set it apart from a lot of your other games of similar genres. the only real downside is the sheer amount of pay-to-win aspects of the game. you can acquire everything naturally in-game, but be prepared to spend a lot, and i mean a lot, of time trying to do so. if you can get past that though, theres a really fun game here that everyone whos remotely interested should pick up and try.",167.3
"this game is awesome really fast paced and alot of action love it!",19.3
"fast pace combination of 3ps with a mmo that includes a nice dose of meele combat , a bit grindy for gear upgrades but most content is available without spending a dime on it, nice overall power progression and mission variation with the addition of the perk/card upgrade systems make this one of the top free to play games. mechanic and content wise it is what destiny should have been.",139.3

"theres alot of fun to be had here, but to be honest, it isnt very good. plagued by tons of bugs, horrible monetization, and overall farming galore. i would rather just buy another tps than take the time to get into this one. seriously, it is really annoying and almost insulting at times. i dont reccomend if you are looking for a fun tps, but if you want an investment, this will work.",376.1

"some what repetative game at times when you have played it 1000+ hours but its worth it, its a 1-4 co op game with some pvp features such as duals and so on. it has fun clan features like clan dojo that can be built by clan members. there is a lot of choice between weapons and warframes (classes). but the most interesting thing about this game is that it is not p2w instead event 2 win and the updates come faster with new content than any game out there also this game requires you to work hard for the best items and frames in the game through skill and cooperation with others.",306.8
"warframe follows a simple, a-b-c premise. a is one to four cyborg alien space ninjas from space. c is where they need to be. b is fifty to two hundred evil space fascist clones, evil space tech cultist blue collar workers, or evil space zombies. if that doesnt tell you everything you need to know, its still worth a try!",211.2
"bloody cool. can be a prick of a job finding players, but still, bloody cool. like an army of jedi assassin ninja viking pirate robots cool. and i dont mean the force-bothering-robe-wearing kind.",19.3
"it is the awesome game ever but it has some complications to it. you use chips to buy responds if you die in the game you respond back, but eventually you waste those chips and you have to use real money to buy more and i love the game but please who ever made it. get rid of the buy more chips it is super annoying",65.4
"+not pay-to-win +every character and weapon can be earned without paying actual money +probably will end up buying some cosmetics with money anyway, just like lol or tf2 -i feel it requires joining an active clan or a group of friends to play with for the fun to keep going past end game",801.3
"warframe is a fun yet not entirely filling game. you play as a tenno an alien space ninja being that has to grind through levels with one to three other players obtaining items to build other warframes or other items like weapons or small minions. the game does look very impressive for a free to play title and level desighn from what i have seen is very captivating but with one flaw its repetitive you will find yourself in the same level more than once and after a while this becomes bothersome thanks to the nearly endless pattern of obtaining items to build better gear. in conclusion warframe is a fun fast paced third person shooter that is a nice addition to any game library",2.3

(like arena fights for instance) maybe a little vehicle warfare... (space ninjas on hoverbikes would be the bees knees).. the current maps that are playable in the game make for good instances but a more open world approach would help bring more gamers to the scene without question.",943.8

"i love this game, dont get me wrong, stuck with it since beta. but ever since the prime access updates the game has become unplayable. the lag is terrible and im on fiber optics. the frame rate is all over the freaking place so i end up dying a lot where as before the prime access update i usually died and failed missions from being stupid and goofing off too much. it took me 30 minutes to get through the freaking tutorial with my new account. that should take at most, provided you dont stop to admire the phenomenal detail of the world you play in, 7.5 minutes. this is simply unacceptable from any software developer. if ea games did this, they would receive a huge reputation drop with their consumers. and yes before you ask, im running a desktop that always gets updated with the neweset nvidia graphics card, a superior sound card, fiber optic internet connection, and 6 quad core processors. i can run crysis 2 at max settings and have a perfect gaming experience. i cant even run warframe on its lowest settings on the same computer. i dont know what the developers did, but if they can fix these recurring issues throughout the warframe gaming community, they would definitely have exponentially more 100% approval ratings and recommendations, myself included.",114.9

"a fun third person shooter with a lot of dynamic options on how to achieve the mission objectives within missions. the difference between marching down a hallway in nearly invincible armor burning everything in your path or sneaking behind an enemy commander and riddling them with arrows can be achieved by the difference of a warframe and a single weapon. and each unit gets 3 weapon slots per mission (primary ranged weapon, secondary ranged weapon, melee weapon) allowing for many unique capabilities even among the same warframes. and there are hundreds of mods that change damage type and weapon capabilities, making each weapon unique to its owner.",511.9

"well, its a very well balanced game, great graphics, complex stat system. before i explain why the actual gameplay is great, you should know that it has a massive grindwall which can be avoided with money. the physics system is still new and buggy, but it is definitely a great engine. the game starts off very slow, and takes a bunch of time to get used to. after the first 2 weeks you will have done no more than what an experienced player could do in a few hours. if you arent a vivid everyday gamer - i dont recommend it. otherwise, if you dig gaming, with friends and randoms - its certainly worth a try. lots and lots of content, complex player systems. all sorts of unique guns, launchers, blades and skill trees. thousands of multiplayer combo stratagies, hundreds of one-man stratagies. gamestyle is up to you, mass killing & fast paced, or higher dps, slower & challenging games. many updates and exclusive events. one thing i must warn you about is the community. ive been on the forums a lot, and have seen it grow old and bitter over time. the great majority of players are not your friends.",658.0

"this game is very fun, it was one of the first f2p i tried and honestly its one of my favorite. you play a a in space ninja, running on walls, awesome tile sets, fun clan system, fun to just mess around in the clan or the void. only dowsides is that some weapons are clan research, or some are only possible to get though the use of platinum which is real money. and that once you farm for dayz to get the needed resources you must wait for either 12 hours up to 72 hours or 3 days to get the item you farmed for dayz to get. but other than that i think it is an awsome game well worth the time you spend on it",1065.8

"fast paced third person shooter with instanced based missions and ton of weapons and suits (warframes) to find, piece together and then try out. not a lot of story thrown at you but there is quite a bit if you want to go looking for it. combat loosely reminds me of the mass effect series, purely based on appearance but the speed and mobility is probably only rivaled by something like titan fall or mirrors edge. only thing i would really knock about the game is the microtransactions are a bit much at certain points but once you make it over the initial hump of getting out of the first couple planets of missions the game really opens up and becomes a real blast to play. having put over 100 hours into it already, occasionally dropping a few bucks down to buy some materials or speed up builds doesnt seem out of line at all.",643.2

"i dont recommend this game to those who either have a budget,or time is something precious to you. it takes hours to find blueprints to make weapons. it may be easier for those with money or with alot of time,but for people like me with no mney and no time, things just go very wrong. high levels are high levels due to massive amounts of time they invest into the game including money as well. some of you may disagree and say thats not true,it isnt pay to win or its easy to get materials and blueprints. those of you who say that think to yourself how the late warframe gamers that log on for the first time ever,after the game has been out for a whole year, no one is i nthe nooby area, guilds consist of high levels going about there daily thing. while noobs can join in and try to take on high levels with their guilds. nothing changes, time kicks in,the ability to stay alive long enough to get anything in a mission. it may just be my opinion,but for people who need to work for money,and cant sit around half the day to acquire materials and blueprints will see it a bit differently. the game have been easier back then, but it isnt now, the game has progress to far to support any new players,unless they have money to invest. so before you downlod this game and waste away a few gb think about what i wrote here.",297.3

"super sweet 3rd-person shooter! controls and systems take time to get used to. the damage system has got a big learning curve, but once you do get it youre basically a god. almost everything in-game you can build, but there are some things that are exclusively pay to get. plus they give you some in-game premium cash when you start up- so all good (its dirt cheap if you want to buy some more). online interactions are pretty o.k. you get a squad most of the time, but you never truly stick with them cause of connection issues. without a good internet connections, your ethier lagging from your connection or someonelses. note: you actually need to join a clan to do crap in this game 0.0. probably cause some weapons are exclusive to clans. the gameplay gets repetitve after a while, due to the tidous farming and the same mission types over and over again. though there are a few random events that keep it fresh. the shooting mechanics are....well...... generic shooting mechanincs, nothing really special. unless of course, you count the warframe abilites. overall score: with its fun and social gameplay, and a few minor bugs and problems i give warframe a 9/10.",183.9

"this is an amazing game 4/5 the only reason i dont like it is that u need to dedicate to it and in the beginning ur weapons suck [if u choose the wrong one] the game has a story but its not a very good one. though the gamplay makes up for that you can do pretty epic parkour and if u want more of an hack and slash instead of a third person shooter just dequip ur primary and secondary. the game may look like a complete charm at first but evantuly u realize its just farming enemies until u get better stuff leading to boredom after a long period of time. [also if u get it i dont really reccomend a kubrow if ur not extremely dedicated cuz he will die if u dont care for him. pros: epic gameplay and u can play with ur friends as much as u want. cons: bad story, wait times for items and constant farming. its a fun game with addictive attributes and i do reccomend it if u like rapidly killing enemies with a bladegun] pros: epic gameplay and u can play with ur friends as much as u want. cons: bad story, wait times for items and constant farming. its a fun game with addictive attributes and i do reccomend it if u like rapidly killing enemies with a bladegun]warframe powers",101.5
"i honestly didnt believe i would like this game, because its not really my type. but its a lot of fun! you start with one class (warframe) and your mission is to conquer every planet in the universe. you are provided with different missions, for instance: defence mission, spy mission, rescue mission etc. while youre at it you can save up materials for building a new class (warframe), weapons or other items. you get mods which strenghten your warframe, and you can choose exactly how you want it to be. you can choose to solo, invite some friends, or join some strangers in your fight against the other races.",236.7

"great game for a free-to-play. however, the game can become boring after you begin to invest time into it, and the gameplay can prove repetitive. so far, warframe is posed as a closed beta under the guise of constantly being fixed, and the devs regularly add more weapons, characters, etc. in order to sooth the repetition of gameplay for veteran players. while this seems good at first, it quickly becomes a detriment to the potential of warframe. all in all, the game has fantastic graphics, and a style akin to me3s multiplayer. it is fun to play as a pick-up title, and i have high hopes for it. however, having invested countless hours myself, the game has grown boring, and the promises of constant updates instead of a legitimate story and endgame can be aggrivating. so if you want to play the game, dont invest any money into it, as it fits the free-to-play genre far better than one you should actually pay for. 7/10",170.3

"love this game. so many options! male and female warframes, weapons, accessories, and companions, and so much more. i love how you can customize just about everything color-wise, if you can buy the color pallettes. my only hang up is that platinum (the currency you can pay actual cash for.) is pretty expensive. but you can wait and see if you get a discount on it in your daily bonus, or you can trade prime parts for it, so it isnt too big a deal, just takes longer that way. its pretty amazing to play with other people and friends as well, jokes galore and you can mess with your friends. theres also some funny glitches that happen... like falling out of the map, getting stuck in walls and things and so on. the glitches dont happen often though and it only happens usually when the player is doing something they probably shouldnt do... like run at a wall full speed or jump up the elevator shaft while its moving and go through the ceiling. good game. 10/10",245.5

"this is probably the best game ive played since skyrim. all i can say is, what a ride. i havent got to the point where theres excessive grinding yet, so im still kind of in the honeymoon phase with this. the graphics in this game are exceptional, the gameplay is amazing, the levels get a teeeeeny bit repetitive, but not too badly. i started as excalibur and i love it. obviously, when you start off, you do have to pay some real cash to get new warframes or items immediately, but how else do you expect a free game to get their moneys worth for making the game? i have heard people say that you can buy or trade for things in the in-game player market. overall 9.5/10 all day.",149.7
"after playing warframe for 1000 hours ill say it definetely was a blast and still is. it never ceases to fail me that it always made me and my friends feel like were badasses. one shotting things and wiping rooms in mere seconds made me feel like a god almost. when ever it came to the hard stuff it was a bunch a teamwork and skill to output such great results whether it be survival or defense missions. although this game is not perfect with its few glitches and grindfests (freaking rng >_<), i feel it has come along way and from its beta till now. this game is about the journey not the quest (sometimes :3).",1081.8

"you spend alot of time farming for stuff and the grind is real. but those arent really bad things because you do all this while being a space ninja with 4 powers to destory your enemies with as well as 3 weapons a primary, a secondary, and melee weapon. i will say the game will get boring if you play without friends or a clan but with them the experience changes quite abit but ill leave that for you to find out.",952.3

"the life of a warframe player -gets game. -plays for 30 hours . -starts noticing the paywall. (dont you dare say there isnt. you need a catalyst/reactor to make your frame/ weapons do damage to anything over lvl 30. yes they drop in alerts but unless you want to wait a fortnight at a time at the chance of getting one you will end up putting money into it) -puts money into the game and it feels like a whole other game. -starts the farm for prime parts. -hits 600 hours and has all prime frames and weapons. -just sits there wondering why the  they just did all of that. ok for all of you saying there is no paywall they drop in alerts. you do realise they drop once a bloody fortnight. for a non casual player playing this that drop rate is too bloody small. you will gain more weapons in one week that you want to catalyst than the amount of catalysts drop in a whole damn year. next time read the damn review before you say they drop in alerts!",833.6
"very fun and so many things to discover but one things is the mission is too same",94.1
"i love this game if you enjoy grinding and getting to feel like you got an awsome reward for that farming then this is your game if you keep up a fast pace and go like the ninja way you can kill every one. the mod are plenty i have been playing for almost 500 hours and you start to see that they put in some filler. if you put the game on ultra for the graphics it looks like your playing a future type tv movie. the lore is lacking but they have said that they may put in some more into it.when they make an update like for version 14,15 exc it always has somthing amazing to offer. the old tutorial is crap compared to the exclent one now for example you can get to chose your own guns and weapons insead of having the crap mk-1 braton,skana, but the lato was good. the mission and events make it so that you cant get bored and when you play void survival it feel like a battle to the death and your fighting and endless wave of enimes. the defense is a bit less then the survival but you have a less priority of caring for your life. the weapon selection is huge i want to try and make all the guns but i have only schratched the surface. the warframe make it so you can adapte to any situation. i recomend if you do get platinum you should save it either to get parts resouces or getting some stuff from the trade tab.i recomend fully that you get this game and even though your bored from farming just for a bit the reward after is the best thing you can get",776.5

"warframe is, in my opinion, a great game with a lot of potential for the future. this potential is strengthend by the fact that is now available on xbox one, ps4, and pc. is it perfect? no. it has a ways to go but i believe that it can become a truly great game.",179.1
"warframe a game where you never feel satisfied with where you are at an always wanna play more an more. at every turn of this game i felt intertwined with the world of warframe from the graphics to the amazing gameplay. its free to play an has a in game store which you need platinum for but if you find yourself playing for more than a year i believe you will buy some with real money. as the game stats in its title you play as warframes an you can craft every single one or you can buy them all but thatd cost you some hefty moola. it is very satisfying to make your warframe as you find yourself more inwraped in the game world as you make them. you feel accomplished after you spent the hours farming for the nessasary materials to make the things you need. an nearly everything in the game you can craft just cost credits which is what you can earn by just completing missions. from guns the swords this game hits the spot for action an if you like hack an slashing game or more gun approach then this game is for you. i found myself putting hours into this game an only wanna put more. ive made 4 warframes an bought 2 an i only wish to get more. they all add a different role to the game. if i did a review on this game id give it a 8/10!",181.4
"its fun and all. can get a little repetitive when you have to grind insanely for something, but its need for grinding is what makes it fun. you have to spend time into this game. you cant just leap into the highest level in a short time. everything has build timers and as i said, the grinding can be insane. i recommend this game if you have alot of time to spend or if you simply want to have some fun with friends. granted, the game has its occaisional glitch and internet connectivity issues. but its still a fun game to play.",37.0

"it was very fun at the start but it got quite repetetive. i still like it except some features in the game are locked until you buy them with real money. cant argue with that though if its a free to play game. fun to play with friends or just solo. 7/10",62.4
"this game has both an exciting mechanic for movement and combat, however it suffers from relatively depthless (and seemingly vast) content. it felt very repetitious very quickly. it doesnt seem to have much of a sense of community to keep you too involved either. for a free to play it is good, but it is always annoying when it is necessary to spend hundreds to be on top of a game. worth a play, but either dont go alone or make friends with randoms quick!",7.4

"i am probably going to buy a control pad for this game.",11.0
"fast pace game that can be difficult to learn, but it wont take to long. the game is fun with friends, because you can all do a mission completely silent without someone you dont know comes in and ruins it. besides its ninjas who could hate this game?",4.6
"for a free to play game,this game has so much detail and lore within it and you can totally play it free.its great",142.3
"this is a typical free game in which you can pay to level up faster or pay for extra weaponry instantly. however, it is possible to play every single aspect of warframe without putting in a single cent and it will still be an enjoyable experience. 8/10 a good mix between grinding and fun.",118.7
"do you wish to grind for weeks to get one nwe item? months for a warframe? years for anything else? well then this game is for you! 3 runs of a level and you will know the other maps like the back of your hand! everything looks the exact same, the layouts are not really that random, its grindy, its repetative and there is no feeling of progression whatso ever. why you ask? because there is a cash shop, and they want you to buy from there to get the best items and warframes and such you can. the new ui causes so much frame lag that i actually had to turn everything down. the old ui was better than this grabage they have now but you will never see it again. the mobs, they are all the same. nothing special about them at all and the boss fights, they are just the same mobs you have been fighting with maybe one or 2 special moves but they are still the same thing. with lots of hp tho! not a good game unless you feel like grinding for no joke weeks at a time to get what you need in the same map over and over and over again.",4.5
"if farming materials / kicking  and looking cool while doing it is your thing, i would highly recommend warframe. :)",295.5
"dont be fooled by my steam profile, i have 400+ hours on this game from before i started playing on steam. the first few months were good, but i left for a while because of work and computer issues. when i came back, the damage system was completely different, and all of the maps and missions got very repetitive. as my friends all left the game, i noticed that the only reason that i played was because of the co-op with my friends. if you have no one to play with, it gets pretty boring and repetitive.",0.2

"havent played it in 2 years but i think it was meh",7.1
"this game is great. the fighting is intense and the set-up of gameplay is well thought out. however, if you choose to play this game, make sure not to rely on paid items and/or more experienced players to get you through missions. i made that mistake and i am now having problems progressing further since the previous planets give less xp than before and newer planets for my account are too difficult to complete. although those mistake could cause major problems for a player, and the though that money was wasted if you bought items and find things too difficult, i completely recommend this game.",81.1
"clearly i recommend this game to anyone who wants team-based pve action, with loads of characters(warframes) and weaponry to chose from that are unique in everyway and that varies differently from each other with their own advantages/disadvantages to even the playing field. fast intuitive action team based or stealthy solo missions, its l4d ninjas in space at its finest.",564.4

"ive been playing this game since beta firstly came out as f2p, and game was good then but really boring, no trading, few warframes, a lot of bugs and i still got till 30th lvl before ive decided to stop. few days ago few mates and me saw it on steam and install it again, i found my old acc and started playing again. game is awesome now. the amount of bugs they cleared, stuff in stores, game mods, lvls, optimtizations and basicly gave mostly what people asked for, they are active on forums, answering q&a and very helpfull. love their blogs in which they love to tease and give people news about stuff they are working on etc. get it, great game, much fun, if you have few friends, start a clan and fight.",6.7
"this looks and plays far better than a free game has any right to be. all the designs for players and enemies alike are absolutly fantastic with a very organic look and feel to them that ive not seen in a sci-fi setting before which really adds a unique look and feel to the game. its sort of repettitive but the randomly generated maps and solid gameplay make it fun to play never the less, and you can easily spend just 10 minutes on a game or 8 hours. they support this game with regular updates so theres always something new. even though it runs off of micro-transactions its not so much a pay to win game as you can unlock and build most of the weapons and warframes just by playing the game. i feel its more fun and rewarding to build it yourself instead of buying it, but i tossed them $5 because i figure this game has given me at least 5 dollars worth of fun :p",150.2
"play this game on the ps4 its heaps fun high reommend it :)",3.3
"it was okay, but it gets repetitive after just a few missions.",10.7
"well, this is a fun game so far but there is a bug that makes you start the whole beginning thing over again when ive already completed it. this may not have happened to you but it happened to me. you can se my hours on this game not much because of this bug. and when you star its in windowed mode for some reason, why?. its a free to play game (or pay to play as most free to play games are considered as). but just try it out and see for yourself because what the heck! its free!",0.7
"ive been playing for just under a month. ive lost most of my friends. ive lost intamicy with my girlfriend. ive installed this game on my computer at work. ive played hooky with friends, family, work, my band, just to play this, the grind permeates my thoughts, and is deteriorating my mind. its kept me away from food, water, the bathroom, and aaa garbage when asked by the nurse in my final days, why ive got no visitors, ill simply reply: i did it for the potatoes, laying in my death bed. idgaf its worth it",207.7

"its pretty boring, full of grinding and unfinished stuff. patches bring content, that shouldve already been in the full product. lacks a decent cover system.",288.7
"great game with a few kinks that have to be worked out, but thats just part of being in a beta. competeing with all the other mmo games isnt easy but warframe is coming along quite well.",359.7
"this game is amazing, i can barely run it on my computer but i love it to pieces, if you have a gaming laptop or pc, get this game!",80.9
"this game is here to stay. ive played quite alot of it and i cant wait to see whats comming. i will just start with the negatives - to get them out of the way. the main problem for me is the server situation, the games are user hosted and that creates problem (however a new recent patch promises at least some optimisation, we will see). another problem is the lack of rewards you get from pvping however pvp is yet problematic. few bugs here and there, some will argue its a rollercoster, but i like what i see from the developers, taking care of the game + its issues the best they can and keep adding tons of new things. having said that, warframe is a game like no other out there. the artwork is really inspired and the combinations of warframes, mods, weapons, archwings, gamemodes will keep you intrested for a long time, having thousands of things to do and collect. another huge advantage of this game is the free to play model it uses. you can practically buy/sell/make/trade almost anything, i love the fact that i can spend real money or dont pay a single dime and create what i want with relative ease. i hope warframe keeps heading to the direction it is, and we see more and more stuff in the future!",474.7
"dope game. good graphics, fast paced over the shoulder action ; only gripes are that there needs to be more enemy variety, as well as most of the missions feel....kind of the same? run through complex from point a to b style. luckily theres ninja parkour moves, which makes traversing the levels more enjoyable. both issues that i have about it can be fixed with (hopefully) future updates & patches. otherwise top-notch game.",31.3

"honestly? this is the best game ive ever played. the physics are fantastic, the graphics are off the charts, the teamwork is optional but fantastic, the weapons are numerous, the economy is fun but not mandatory... honestly, just play it. its the best decision youll ever make.",166.9
"warfrmae is a game ive been following since alpha and like many other games i never loose intrest in playing it, yes this game isnt for those who just want it all now an not wait but i think that the grind and trial to obtain warframes without using real money makes the warframe that more rewardable, the game just amazes me every day, its one of the only games that actually feel like a living breathing world every weekend has a new global event where the developers have us go up against a grineer vs corpus rivalry or a sneaky corpus tradesmans escort. every warframe adds a new field to play with within the randomly generated levels and i love all the customization and loadouts that are avaliable you can play how you want to play; be a tanky rhino and destroy the fron lines or a nova who assists the whole team in a damage amplifier or be a sneaky assasin like loki or ash and stealth an entire mission. oh and dont get me started on u11, in the lastest update they have added more amazing rooms and decoration to the clan built dojos. alot of the content in warframe is not visble at first glance but if more people gave this game a chance i promise they would love it. plus its free!! ( btw i play warfame from the website and not through steam, i actually have 450+ hrs on the game not 19 hrs :/ )",20.6

"man i love ninjas, space ninjas, thats just awsome. the game may not be the moast intense game you have ever played, its more about the community and the friends that you play this game with. this is a good time with friends, the crafting takes a long time and it may get updated with wierd changes from time to time, but if you boil it down its still the same game that i started playing with my friends, and i still enjoy those times.",567.5

"what can i say your a freakn space ninja with a dog that has elf ears and a bat nose. it is one of the best free to play games with microtransactions in it imo they implemented it in such a way where you absolutely do not need to buy anything with real money. the trading system needs to be in more games also the way you rank up through the mastery ranks, it makes you use everything until its fully leveled, not just get it and you dont like it so you sell it . gg 8/10 would play again",603.1
"game is awsome and mod sysytem awsome recomeneded for all but... bugs close the game not because low specs i have over the requirments in 1080p and building takes up alot weps in 12 hours some 24 warframes 3 days but the game is great very addictive i play 8 hours a day total of over 116 hours not recomended for gaming addicts",885.3

"been playing it since cbt and before it got onto steam. great fun at first but will get grindy near end game. the dev are working on improving the end game contents and adding new stuffs with every update so its worth a shot and they take players feedbacks seriously. gameplay: 7/10 graphics: 9/10 sound: 5/10 replayability: 8/10 community: 5/10 dev support: 10/10",92.9
"warframe is a third person shooter set in a sci fi universe. you play as a ninja alien that can take the form of any warframe, which is just a fancy way to distinguish the different classes. it starts out a bit cliche, but has a shocking level of depth once you crack the surface. its especially fun if you can get 4 friends together, in the same way payday is fun. sure, its a grind sometimes... but is it really a grind if the activities are a blast? i definitely recommend warframe.",51.7
"awesome ftp 3rd person co-op shooter, its free-to-play in the best sense as you can unlock everything buyable through playing. the best items are only attainable through playing aswell, so theres no buy-to-win feature ^^ highly recommend giving it a try.",333.9
"its a really good free to play game. graphics are great. it doesnt really have much story to it which i wish it did. sometimes when you trying to get resources and grinding missions to get it, it can get boring at times. otherwise its fun to play with friends.",429.1

"love this game really one of the best free to play games out there",347.8
"this is still open beta, which means there will be changes. however, that also means new content too and thats what washes the boredom away. aside from that, the sleek art design and presentation are very appealing. its a 3rd person shooting/slashing/powers and abilities sci fi game, much like the mass effect series which made me start playing in the first place.",937.3

"yes it became my obsession . i love this game and i will finish it",137.6
"in my opinion it is , unique style and even in the begining its incredible co op based and its kept me interested in it from the co op always needed in the begining but considering its free its a great deal for the gameplay and uniqueness ( lots of repeating i know but its incredible for itself it got over a million in the last 8 weeks making it 3 million players and counting fast) if you ask me its worth it",11.9
"like destiny but free and without all the  parts, created by people who actually care about their game and their community. its hard starting out - join a giant friendly clan as soon as possible, and brace your face for immense grind. it gets repetative, but its worth it.",244.2
"the game is beautiful, im not one to like shooters like this, and i love it, cant have a day i dont play an hour or 2 if i can get away with more, but in a fairly big issue is the game needs a dedicated server, the shenanigans i have to do for multiplayer to work is very unpleasant some days it can take 4 hours for a scheduled meet to work out and others we give up and solo what we can. all in all this minus dwarfs more the pluses but regardless i am actively recommending my friends this game, though im not using the ingame recruitment option.",134.4

"i was only thirteen years old, i loved warframe so much. i had all the weapons and frames. i prayed to warframe every night before bed thanking it for the life i have been given. warframe is love i say, warframe is life. my dad hears me and calls me a . i knew he was just jealous of my devotion to warframe. i called him a . he slaps me and sends me to go to sleep. im crying now and my face hurts. i lay in bed, its really cold. a warmth is moving towards me... i feel something touch me... its nyx! im so happy. she is my favourite warframe she whispers in my ear this is my ship. she mind-controls me with her mind-control ability, and puts me on my hands and knees. im ready. i spread my keyboard and mouse for nyx. she penetrates my tv screen. it hurts so much, but i do it for nyx. i can feel my screen cracking and my eyes start to water. i push against her chaos, i want to please nyx. she absorbs my love, and roars a mighty roar as she fills my screen with physic bolts. my dad walks in. nyx looks him straight in the eye and says, its all chaos now. nyx leaves through my window. nyx is love. nyx is life <3 10/10 ruined my life",308.5

"hell yeah. quick, fun, lots of play styles... i like it! revisited: the game is pretty good, but the community just sucks. very juvenille. since figuring out the basics depends on information from other players, youll spend a lot of time hoping for someone to answer simple questions rather than posting yet another braindead your mom.. line. pitiful.",88.6
"great game, but its along the lines of halo at the fact that your a superior part of your species and you have to defend your planet from aliens from another world. very fun, but will take the money right out of your wallet. if i had to rate this out of 10, i would say 910. i recommend this game to any gamers.",4.5

"i love this game its awesome have alot of updates and always fun with friends :d",915.1
"i liked the game sooo much in the beginning, but when you level up your warframes it gets too easy. then, for those conclave things(pvp) someone will always have those broken melle weapons, it just gets boring. for example, dragon nikana, everyone was dead with a slide hit.so i would recommend this game for the first... like... 200 hours maximum? but then it gets bad.oh, and dont you bother using money at this game except if youre going to put lots of it.i put like 100 over the 2 years i played,and it didnt help much. anything you get with money, you can also get it with some luck and patience. alright so you can play it, the review is about my personal opinion, if there have been changes that make it more difficult and the pvp has become more interesting just tell me so i reconsider my thoughts about that game. btw sorry for any mistakes i made about how does the game work, long time no play. and another thing, if you want to enjoy your hours of gameplay in warframe, be friendly, it has a good community that can make you laugh or cry because some players are completely newbs. good luck.",345.0
"this is probably the most unique game ive ever played. sure it has a few glitches, but it combines a sci-fi atmosphere into a combat situation where you must use stealth, hack systems, parkour, or just go guns blazing to complete the mission. also it has co-op online, character and weapon customization all while being free. i strongly recommend warframe as it will keep receiving updates to become the perfect game. my only complaint? it is extremely difficult to earn new weapons and characters, as they want people to use in game purchases. still, amazing game.",44.3
"the general gameplay and experience was fun... while it lasted. the whole game gets tedious and players can easily buy their way to success, but that takes most of the challenge away. ive lost interest in this game, and so have many of the people that i personally know who played this game. my clan is dead and many more have gone quiet. generally, warframe now has a lackluster feel for me. i got used to the grinding, but de just added more, and then buffed the grinding with little annoying paywalls  that honestly generate more challenge. unfortunately, they nerfed across the board, so it became more difficult for non-paying players to effectively play. i cant imagine this game having any longevity. im serious. i used to love the  out of this game, but now its just complete crap. as little money as i did spend on it (after 300+ hours of play) i feel cheated. longtime players, founders, and vets alike have been leaving and/or disapproving of the games recent turn of events. discontent is all over the forums. de has become heedlessly distant from their fan base and gamming community. i implore you to seriously consider not downloading this game.",559.2

"this is a truely amazing game this review comes after i first started playing a few years ago when they only had 3 or 4 different maps that were recycled for each mission, how far this game has come the awe-inspiring environments, the ability to build your own clan hall, and the variety of areas are just the beggining. most everything in the game is accessable without payment however if you dont want to keep tossing your items you worked for when your done youll need to spend a little cash to unlock the inventory slots, but with the in game trading system it is possible to never spend a penny on this game and still enjoy its full potential. there are items that are usually only pay to get however there are regular events with these items as rewards over all very well done model of a ftp game in no way is it pay to win. this game gets an 8.5/10 from me the only thing that could help this game is a little more active lore area, such as more exploration and free wandering just to give the game a sense of a real universe which this company is working so hard to create",291.9

"the game is repetitive in its level design and missions, but its constantly updated with new content. the biggest draw for me was the fluidity of the shooting, platforming, melee combat, using the powerups... it feels smooth and very fun. especialy when youre playing with a friend using a mic, then youll have tons of fun. additionaly the game is absolutely beautiful with its use of colour, its lighting and shadow effects, which is even more amazing considering it runs smooth on my low-spec pc.",23.6

"honestly an amazing game. once you get past the kinda crappy starter gear and into things you like more, it becomes really fun. the biggest pushfactor for most players is the crafting time. once you get over the fact that you cant always get what you want right away and learn to deal with it, it isnt an issue anymore. overall, a really fun, unique game. id reccomend it to anyone into any kind of action game.",747.9

"repetative quality. spend your bonus real money currency on weapon and/or warframe slots. played best with people of the same rank as you, since veterans (from my experience) rarely wait up and just plow through the levels. try to learn all the movement abilities as early as possible (the quickest way of getting around for me was sliding, jumping and then sliding again). controls are good and fluent. graphics are awesome. art style is weird. i would only reccomend it if you have a lot of time on your hands and are bored out of your mind. otherwise, play something else (like spiral knights [no, not really]).",68.6

"it really isnt all that free to play and sure you can get the same stuff by both farming and buying with real life money.however if you just cash for the right weapon you just wreck everything.even for making things such as decorations for your clan you may require items that you might as well cash for.the game also forces you to buy weapon slots with your real life money so this game is pretty much p2w.however if youre willing to pump your money into it then sure it is fun get some friends,make a clan,cooperate and have fun",101.2
"best for stealth and running and gunning as long as you have a good setup",9.8
"a great game without cracking open your piggy bank. for a free-to-play game its actually really fun. its not a pay to win, its more like pay for swag. all weapons and warframes are obtainable in the game, unlike combat arms where you need to rent weaponry or buy for ridiculous price ranges (seriously, $30 for a m4a1?) graphics are phenomenal, no question about it. i beleive its one of the best ftp out there and will stay so for a long time. 9.5/10 rating (sometimes the game gets repetitive.)",1167.4
"this game has a good story line and even greater game play to it and the game has it own orignal idea. the devs puts out a update regalerly and hotfixes with in the hour of findding out there is a bug. the only thing most people will have a problem with it thats 12 hours to make a new gun and about 3 and a half days to make a new frame but it is well worth the wait. the combat is fast and the map are randomly put to gether with perset tiles and no map is the same as the last. the grinding can get slow and boring at time but if you get some frineds or random people you can make it less of a grind and more of how long can we last in a survival mission. there are alittle over ten different mission types from defence where you protect a cryo pod to killing a hvt and survival where you need to keep the enamey busy for as long as you can while keeping you life support levels above 0%. i recommand this game because of the different and origanal idea it brings to this current game marcket where you only find zombie survivals, fps and over all strange game types.",797.2
"may seem like its a pay to win game at first but when you start to play you relize its not its very good game",312.2
"ive been playing warframe for a while, and i have to say that it is a pretty good game. any bugs that are found in-game are almost instantly fixed by the next day in their very frequent bug fixes and updates. i feel that this shows a dedication to the consumers to provide a very enjoyable gaming experience. i feel that the gameplay is very invigorating and engaging, keeping you on your toes most of the time. its a multiplayer game, even though you do have the option of playing solo. you have a wide variety of customizations for your warframes cosmetically, and stat wise. overall, i think that this game is great, and that anyone who reads this should give it a try. its free to play, even though you can pay real money to make micro-trasnactions in-game for special items. i give warframe a 9/10",56.0

"warframe is game that makes other fps look inferior, its supposedly set in the future, where tenno soldiers fight grineer marines, for absolutely no unkown reason ; possibly the soverignity of the solar system. the game is also supported by microtransactions via steam. dlc from the game is ridiculous, the more you pay, the more stronger and better you are, but unless you actually put in time and effort to get the same results as the p2winners. overall, warframe can be naturally seen as a fps and p2w game, this game actually seemed more new, unlike the other modern-day fps like black ops. although the game can be seen as a p2w, rarely any time and effort needs to be put in to acquire better eqiupment since materials for blueprints are fairly easy to get. i rate this 7/10 or 70%",50.6

"the game itself is decent, and its addictive enough for some people to warrant the 900+ hours on record, but the game itself is quite flawed. large amounts of old or unused content are still in the game, so if you dont load correctly into a map, you might be looking at an old or unused user interface and cant do anything about it. a lot of bugs go unpatched for extended periods of time, and when they are finally addressed, it sometimes feels more like a workaround than an actual fix. whats worse is when this happens to some things that impact the game design itself. i feel kind of bad giving this a negative review, since the developers clearly care about what they put out, but what theyve put out thusfar feels almost more like a tech demo with project creep than a full game due to its lack of meaningful content. that said, the game is enjoyable, i just couldnt recommend it to my friends without a laundry list of caveats. hopefully that list will shrink in the future.",1297.0

"warframe is set in a universe where the solar system is locked in unending conflict between the tenno, the corpus, and the grineer, while the infestation threat looms over all three. you can carry out a number of different mission types to collect materials, credits, blueprints, and simply prove your skills while culling the unending threat. warframe is a game about farming at its core. you collect materials to make more weapons, warframes, and companions, eventually switching to new ones while customizing abilities and stats to suit your play-style. and while the game is in essence about farming, the combat, power, and movement systems allow one to create a very entertaining spectacle of flashing steel and lead. run on a wall, jump off, spin like a helicopter, and decapitate a grineer soldier, then top off the display by landing into a graceful slide followed immediately by another instantaneous guillotine slash from your weapon. learning to carry out movement combinations and power uses all while using firearms and blades of all sort is what makes this game really enjoyable. but, you might eventually get tired of the farming and look for a different experience.",523.2

"warframe is, in my opinion, unique among third person shooters. the gameplay and graphics are phenomenal and can run on most systems. pros: -graphics are stunning on full but still valiant on low. -a vast selection of weapons, skins, mods and missions. -this game is fantastic for when you are looking for action-packed, parkour-filled gameplay, but is also great to pass the time. -you can choose between singleplayer and multiplayer. -interesting blueprint mechanic where you can craft guns and skins. -every skin or weapon is beautiful no matter what it looks like. -takes on a social aspect e.g clans, parties etc. cons: -requires an internet connection to play. -you will have a better experience if you are willing to contribute funds irl. -microtransactions do not give you the bang for your buck. for example, 3.99 gbp gets you 70 platinum which is the worthiness of a pistol designed for beginners. -the hardest f2p game to progress in that i have encountered. a nice f2p game if you are tired of lousy mobas or cheap, bloodsucking anime money-s.",139.4

"warframe is a nicely done sci-fi hack-and slash third-person shooter with lots of customization options and replayability. each warframe has 4 abilities and can be equipped with lots of passive upgrades, called mods, which drop randomly from enemies. everything in this game can be bought with ingame money, as well as real money. the level-design remembers me somehow of lego, as there are finished rooms which are put together randomly every level to make every level unique. the ai is pretty good, too. enemies are trying to take cover most of the time and barely stand out in the open. it actually has no story yet, but that doesnt really matter, as it is still a lot of fun, specially with friends, to slice/shoot your way through hordes of enemies. it gets pretty boring after a while though.",33.2
"for a free to play game, its something you have to try and still probably get hooked on. its a level clearing game where you run around as a tenno, space ninja if you must, in order to liberate planets from either the infested, grineer or corpus robots. by clearing levels and objectives you level up your warframe which is your character. along with weapons and abilities. you start out with one class persay and as you clear levels you are able to obtain other classes though the forging station. along with unlocking other warframes (classes) you can unlock weapons. with weapons you can equipt modifications to them depending on the level of your weapon to make them stronger and to take on harder levels. towards the end it becomes a grind fest which can be a big downer if you are grinding alone. though the rewards for taking the time to grind out a stronger warframe, weapons and mods are something that you will be excited about and will keep on playing.",102.5
"the best multiplayer game i have player in a while and even better its free! not a single thing in this game requires money other than customization features like syndanas but they are rather inexpensive and the other things like custom hemets can be crafted. overall this game is amazing and its amazing how much the dev team cares for its players.",964.9

"this game impressed me so much that i nearly fell of my chair. the first time i saw warframe i thought to my self,how great can this game be. then i played it,man did i injoy it <-------did?,what am i talking about i still love this game. the graphics is good (by that i mean insane)the gameplay is surprisingly awesome and it has a nice touch of team work. if you die your freind can still help you from getting back into that insane battelfeild. of course you can play offline but thats.....how do i put this,cinda hard(yep allot).this game is very fun aswell from shocking a corpus to cutting greneer in half. this game is all about going mad (insane if thats what you whant to call it). so hack and slash your whay through warframe. give it a try",774.5

"in most cases i look down on many, many free-to-plays so when i first got this it was simply because it was free, and well, i just felt getting more games in my library. from the trailer it looked slightly interesting to me so... i got it. little did i know how stunning the graphics were for a free-to-play and little did know how emmersive this game is. with many in-game attributes to your character and its customization (which im a big fan of in games) i was instantly hooked. although there are some ridiculously priced dlcs and some in-game purchases, it doesnt affect gameplay because its not pay-to-win. if you can, by all means give this game a try, it may not suit you as it did me but... who doesnt want to be a freekin space ninja! -8/10",11.0

"as a f2p game, warframe is one of the best. the game controls amazingly for a space ninja parkour game. thankfully these mechanics make the repetitive storyline a lot better and the variety of space ninja guns and swords are so fun to try out and ninja parkour some space clones and aliens.",19.7
"its bloody parkour space ninjas. what more could you possibly ask for?",736.8
"warframe is a fast paced third person game set in our solar system in what seems to be the distant future. you play as a tenno, from what i can see are a group of highly advanced space ninjas, set to eliminate hostile species in the solar system. while its a fun game, the levels just keep repeating, like angry birds go. the levels are just :destroy the core! or find the hostage! or take out that guy! each gamemode has a different map but that map keeps repeating. each planet has a different mas though. now the maps repeat over and over again but this game just keeps getting so addicting! with a wide variety of weapons which of course, youll need to pay for them, make this game like tf2 with the weapon system except you dont really get weapons randomly like tf2. warframe is a f2p that is only available on pc, but now there is a version the the ps4 which isnt a f2p and i believe costs 60 bucks. id say just buy the game, but youll also need to create an account. be wise when choosing your tenno as each one is different. for new people, i suggest getting the balaned excalibur class. every class has a melee weapon, which you can buy different melee weapons. you start off with a sick katana which you can slice enemies with, or if you wanna go complete mafia mode you can get the electric knuckles! if you want my rating i rate this 7/10! install this!",8.3
"you have to grind for days just to get a new character 9/11",166.1
"i reccomend this game to all gamers that like action packed games.",7.7
"fantastic game. interesting and unique abilities and warframes. solid mechanics, good pacing, really fun movement and satisfying sword/gun play. there is no paying for power, the only things purchasable with cash (platinum) that relate to power can be found or crafted in-game. cash exclusive items are as youd expect purely cosmetic. the only downside (which in my opinion is nothing worth crying about), are the waiting times. when crafting items the wait can be either 12 or 24 hours depending on the item being crafted. [a whopping 72 hours if crafting a waframe]. this can of course be rushed for cash much like a mobile game.",142.3
"this is a great game, but the costs for weapons and cosmetics are too high and forces us players to grind or pay. this artificailly increases the playtime. most of the weapons, tennos, weapon/tenno slots, and cosmetics cost platinum or a ludicrous amount of credits to buy. purchasing with platinum reduces the grind tremendously but the only way to get platinum is to purchase it or using the in-game trading system. i hope you move the platinum/ micro-transaction solely to the cosmetics, or at the very least, lower the credit costs. im not saying this is a bad game, i am just saying that there is a large amount of micro-transactions in this and most other free to play games.",14.3
"it gets fun at first until you realize it is the same thing over and over and over and over again. different planet? same mission but theres snow! the only variety is the bossess and the warframes themselves. if you are someone who plays desinty and like endless grinding and repeating the same thing then this is the game for you but repeats and grinding isnt my thing",177.6
"can honestly feel pretty addicting sometimes. they fixed the issue of feeling like you never had enough money (by letting you earn lots of money in randomly spawned events). the guns and melee weapons are fun, if annoying to find a combination that actually works well. progression can feel slow at times, which can be aleviated with an injection of cash, but damn near everything can be aquired through game play alone (if incredibly difficult due to randomness and availability of certain random items) the most frustrating part is how long new warframes take to aquire. you have to farm/buy 4 different blueprints that take 12 hours (three of them can be crafted simultaniously) and then you need to combine those three parts in a 3 day (physical days that is) for your warframe to complete. and even then a free account is only given two slots for warframes at any given time. this is odd as theres ample slots for weapons, but not even enough to let you experiment a bit. but dont let my nagging fool you, it really is a fun game for the most part. definately worth the free cost if youre willing to invest the time. plus, you get to be a friggen gun toting",172.0
"insanely good i loved the gameplay and the ninja style is just crazy coll",20.9
"the core game mechanics are in need of a serious overhaul. the devs are focused on adding new gimmicks that are separate from the main game or highlight just how undercooked or even broken basic things are. with every new update the game becomes clunkier, the gameplay loses its flow and the experience leaves you frustrated. its sad to see de lose their focus and just throw stuff at the wall and see what sticks.",1097.1

"you know destiny? this is the game it wanted to be... warframe is a hack and slash shooter with free flowing movement and shooting with some annoying f2p tricks and moba tip bits. pros: the guns are various, good or bad - it depends on your mods and how you play the free flowing movement system is good and can slide in and hack people up 3 factions that offer good varation but the grinner are annoying with there armor the mods are a mixed bag as rng decides your loot some of the weapons and suits require you to be in a clan to get them it takes time to get good guns the suits or frames is good but be careful when you upgrade mods and there suit the crafting system is abit weird and has some pay to go tricks overall fun --- updates very often cons: dont finish the galaxy quickly, it gets boring the bosses are often gimmicky with weakspots the grinner can cause a bleeding proc that wrecks some frames and exposlives the infested arent scary but the elders can wreck you clans are needed for some of the cool guns the market often has cool guns that you either buy with real money or take a week to grind from them and build them most often the missions repeat. the ship and ui was better when it was menu based but that is me i recommend this game, it pretty and unique just remember it takes awhile to get used too.",350.2
"warframe is the best game i played so far on steam ! it has amazing graphich and the best gameplay that is evolveing every day.but it has repetiv ad that is its only downfall.but when you surpass that its amazing.you can chose betvine 100 weapons(fireing and meele) and dosens of sutis with their uniq powers!!! so log in and have fun",810.7

"its a good game, and the model makes sense, but the biggest problem is the 24h wait time for mastery ranks. i went for my first test, and the game went to black screen with a big please wait circle for about 15 mins. i finally shut down the game and when i came back it said i have to wait 24h. the devs had no reason to add this game mechanic because its not as if you can even play cash to simply pass on the time and try again. its simply there to  with you. i give this game 5/10 for the simple fact that the devs are . very uncanadian of you.",101.7
"please understand (before skipping this review because i only have 7 hours logged) that i played this long before i even knew steam existed. it might as well be a seperate game from the one i started playing, but it has stayed just as good, if not improved, over the years. the graphics are nice even at the lowest settings, allowing the ability to play a nice looking game without lagging. the gameplay, while slightly overwhelming at first, is fluid and makes you feel like a boss. you can play however you want, from being sneaky and evading your foes, or rushing headstrong into a horde of grineer with your sword, so every player plays their own game. additionaly, every warframe and weapon changes that style. for example, i main limbo on my steam, who differs greatly from my old excalibur. instead of sword skills, limbo can manipulate the void to his will and transport his friends, foes, and even himself into the rift between the void and reality. every single warframe has awesome abilities like that. the customization is awesome, and once you have a clan it gets that much better. this game is a masterpiece. a blend of assassins creed, dark souls, kotor, halo, destiny, and god knows what else. its free, go give it a shot. you will love it.",7.4
"honestly. hands down, this is the game you want to spend your precious time, and maybe even money on. best gameplay and great fast paced fun. get in now before you miss the best opportunity in your life!",79.1
"this game is pretty good. it needs some work, but its free to play so its definetly worth playing. i like the co-op game play, but a few things to fix: -sometimes the achievements dont work -personally, i think the melee button is in a bad place -make the waypoints less confusing",3.3
"after the general fun of the combat wore off, i started dedicating a lot of time to min/maxing my warframe and sentinel with mods - however, the developers repeatedly changed the game mechanics (stamina change, frames and sentinels sharing mods change) in ways that screwed me over or left me far behind in progress from where i was right before the game update. now that the game is a stable release, this may not be a problem anymore, but it left a strong sour taste in my mouth. even with this fact aside, it takes an extraordinary amount of time and luck to get better gear/items. in many games, you get small stat increases at relatively frequent intervals, or relatively frequent gear drops. although i think the weapons are supposed to be sidegrades, the expensive and high-rank weapons are much better, albeit somewhat more situational, than the defaults. it takes a lot of materials to build weapons, and a lot of luck to get certain blueprint parts to drop from missions. these add up to a very grindy game with very slow progression.",0.6
"its a pretty good game i just didnt play it as much so it seemed boring",17.1
"becomes the same thing over and over. extremely repetitive when on the grindfest for materials that are seeminlgy impossible to find. thusly, the game gets boring. it isnt the easiest to keep your interest in. a good selection of warframes, that seems to be getting larger, but that is a facad, becuase you will be spending the rest of your life to get the warframes unless you pay.",4.2
"great game lots of fun. to bad it comes with to many bugs and crashes and these just take the fun out of the game. fix these and i would recommend it but for now i wont",95.6
"this game is a really great sci-fi game! enjoying it a lot!!! just hoping if there was even a single way on earning platinum for free :(",143.8
"warframe is a free 3rd person instance based mmo, to truly get into this game it requires more time than i have put into it so dont solely base your opinion on this game off my review. warframe in my opinion takes a long time and a lot of grinding to start having fun with.. you begin with basic equipment and weapons that arent horrible so you not left that far behind, but you will soon be grinding constantly for your next weapon or suit. the game itself has a very loose story and backstory that you dont have to pay any attention to if you dont want to. your character is tenno and you play as a warframe or in my eyes just a fancy coloured mech. each warframe has certain perks and 4 special abilities and you take on typical mmo roles of damage, tank and healer. the artwork is actually pretty good for a free to play game, its very colourful and can even look pretty but because you are always moving around very quickly or getting mobbed by enemies you dont really get time to have a good look. to be honest its a very good game but its just not for me. i would suggest that if you were to start playing, get some friends who have already played to either teach you or carry you through the lower stages of the game. i rate it 8/10",18.4
"this is a great game but since most of it is pay to play and it costs alot to get waframes and gear its nt the most in tune game for an online game also the new change to the game has left all of us warframe gamers lost to what we do now most cant mpve or do anything and other are pissed thatthere is yet more pay to play things in the world of warframe but dont take me wrong it is or rather was a great game but this change has mostly left it far less fun and wantably by todays players if warframe took up the more modern way of pay to play like being able to sub to them for monthly payments far more players would be here and i think i would love it far more since it would be alot easyer to use gear and warframes if you got them all for a monthly payment in the ned it used to suck a bit now its just worthless to play if you dont care about either 1 losing a boatload of cash or 2 looking like a moneyless penny pincher then it will be fun other wise play another mmo as most are bettter than this",284.3
"i highly recommend this game. easily the most fun i have had playing any game. ever.",125.7
"in warframe, you get to collect mods for your warriors, and this upgrades their skills. you also get to customize your player/warrior. the gameplay is very simple and user-friendly, and you get to play solo or with others to complete missions. you even get to have an epic storyline along with it. it is worth your time to try out!!",124.7
"i reccomend all peoplle to at least try out warframe, it has a bit of a rough start, but once you get into it, it is an amazingly fun game. microtransactions are not required at all, and the only thing that cant be bought without money is slots and cosmetics.",904.3
"warframe, for being in beta currently, is singlehandedly the most phenomenal f2p game i have had the pleasure to play. although, it is a f2p game thus having microtransactions. luckily, digital extremes (the game developers), took into consideration, hey, everyone hates pay 2 win games, right? ok, so well leave in microtransactions for the lazy people who play the game to complete it and not for fun, but well make a way to earn platinum without buying it!. if you have parts for a prime weapon or warframe (your suits) or even a decently rare mod, you can head over to trading chat and sell it for xx amount of platinum. not only are the creators not money hungry scumbags, warframe is highly addicting, as you can see from my playtime. you will eventually get yourself into a situation such as ugh, my stuff is so terrible, but i need to grind out some resources to get this new weapon or ugh my stuff is so good it just wrecks anything in my path. i want a challenge and youll attempt to quit the game. you will never quit warframe. even if some serious  goes down, de will somehow rope you back in. warframe, recommended 8.5/10 near endless hours of entertainment, and a hell of a f2p. for your sake, get this game.",1240.4
"great settting and gives a updated twist on games like d3 and torchlight ii. oh and who doesnt love ninjas",1002.8
"its a fun shooter, but only if your into shooters. for me its a game i come back to. this game wants you to work as a team without talking. it can become a pain not be able to talk to your team. what hurts the game for me is my online connection because i got 1mb/s to 654kb/s and i get lag. i dont blame the game on that because a buddy of mine has a connection at 5mb/s to 2.5mb/s at its lowest. has no lag at all.",30.7
"the gameplay, especially the way it makes you feel awesome, makes me start playing. the crafting system in this game is what keeps me playing for hours. its fun to collect resources, craft items and then level up those items; almost as much fun as hacking through hordes of monsters.",441.4

"updated: well, its been a long time since i last reviewed warframe and its amazing how much better the game has become since then! its smoother and much more optimised (although me getting an upgraded pc helped) and there is so much more content than before. its still basically the same old grindfest (and its still almost impossible to find pick-up groups for normal mission progression) but with so many new mission types, areas, enemies, factions, the archwing (which reminds me so much of zone of the enders) theres actually a hell of a lot to do. the game still goes out of its way to screw you if you insist on trying to play for free, but you can get around if if youre bloody-minded enough. a tentative recommendation.",424.0

"good action game, that evolves with every update. at the beginning it is a little lame, to have your wallet tortured, becuase you need money, to buy slots for your items. otherwise you would only have space for two weapons, and this is annoying, if you dont want to spend real money so fast... however, the game is good, but lacks of a great story... just the same missions all the time, but the progressing factor makes the game really enjoyable and it is the best game, for a long co-op session with up to three friends. the different powers of your characters makes teamwork be a quite good and fun making experience. however, after 750hours the game made me rethink the concept of the developers. the game is in beta status and instead of developming a release, the guys release a beta to other systems like ps4 and xbox one.... and the only thing that evolves is the money making updates of cosmetics and new weapons, or chars... and this sucks.... instead of developing the game, the creators develop updates with much more new bugs.... with the saying.. hey, we are in a beta... but why do they create new stuff, instead fixing the good old... after update 14 ive stopped playing, since i feel fooled by the developers.",756.2

"warframe is a really cool and fun game to play, if youre a quick learner you can enjoy this game at its max, the only reason that makes me not recommend warframe to anyone is simple, too many bugs on pc, you have to grind missions for days because rng is so broken, also the new archwing update is so buggy you cant even do any missions because youll probably crash the game or just bug inside the mission and lose or get no rewards.",867.8
"this game is a prime example for the horrible concept of freemium gaming. - the game itself is just barely fun (actually its rather frustrating) until you pay for it. - pvp is a joke - only a handful of missions are actually profitable the rest of the +- 300 available missions just plain sucks - there is no actual loot like items for your character. its all about building more useless weapons and warframes to play with for mastery rating. (repeating the same dumb 1-30 level cycle with everything you build over and over. most weapons & warframes require 3-5 full level cycles to equip the required mods.) - credit sinks everywhere. prepare to use boosters or get credit starved. - every major addition to the game (e.g. kubrows, archwing, reputation system) turns out to be really really bad by design and doesnt add much to the game beside more options for the player to waste money or grind their brains out to actually enjoy the new content. - i could list more negative stuff for days if i wanted...trust me on this. + graphics + movement / character control tl;dr & final thought: the only thing that this freemium cashgrab game can do to get even worse is to send you push notifications on your phone.",437.0

"initially looked at warframe because i had nothing really to do until dark souls ii released. though after playing for a while i found that the game is very enjoyable albeit micro transactions if you want extreme customization (i.e skins more color options or heads) the game does start you off with 50 or so platinum which is enough to buy an acessory or color set which is cool. there are very few things you cant get unless you pay for, you can pay to unlock weapons without needing to grind for parts which is good in all some weapons might require you to be a certain rank to be able to even buy the blueprint for (in game currency of course) or alternativly you can buy them with irl cash. getting new characters can sometimes be taxing but in the long run its worth the time it taxes to construct the new character ( 12 hours for each of the 3 pieces then 72 for the actual character). daily rewards are very nice as well you can get anything from 50% of your next platinum purchase to weapon blueprints or even exp/affinity/credit boosters. all in all warframe is a very fun game to play.....crap now that i think about it i didnt even mention the gameplay o.o",88.0
"of the bit that ive played, i cant personally recommed this game. to me, it seems rather shallow and relies a bit too much on multiplayer mechanics. i find the combat to be quite shallow, thus having only about an hour and a half into the game. if the later game is much better, thats unfortunate because i will never reach it. you should never have to spend 20 hours to get to the good part, the game should always be in the good part. id stick away from this one, although it is free to play. so you might as well give it a try, to see if you enjoy it.",1.3

"out of a 5 star rating, i personaly would give it a 4.5. the game is an overall fun and addictive experience and has slight bugs with input delay and acctually following what you are inputing. other than those slight glitches, the game is perfect. but all games have some sort of glitch or bug, just this one doesnt impact the gameplay. highly recomend to players looking for a either stealthy or action packed game. you get to choose.",38.3

"i think this game is a very good and fast game. the characters look a bit weird but i think its not so hindered the gameplay. a lot of stuff you can craft given it a lot. that is megbirsz get almost everything so quickly and easily you can acquire stuff. continuous updates are what make the game more enjoyable. i can recommend it.",76.2

"despite of all in-game bugs that sometimes trouble me, i think, this game is a very well-made free to play game. i dont really like third person shooter. but this, this game is very challenging. it makes me want to play it again and again. it challenges your brain to really think, which step should you take while you proceed your mission. and i totally recommend this game for any people who likes tps. for a free to play game, this is a magnificent tps game.",140.8

"played this game a lot when i didnt have any friends to vc and play with, grinded pretty hard but never got past the casual area of gameplay, still hardly got past that point. with friends this game gets a lot easier to farm and do higher level stuff because you have some sort of coordination, until i decide to play vauban built for bounce.",758.6

"warframe is an interesting and innovative puzzle game. rather than the player trying to figure out how to use the game mechanics in order to progress, the game plays itself in the players mind. the goal is simple, you must escape the arsenal screen. sounds easy, right? youd be mistaken. the second you click appearance, the game has you hooked. it will not let you go until you have the right colors. what are the right colors, exactly? you have to figure that out yourself. buying new color pallettes will make the game either harder or easier, but the game does not tell you which ones do so. i have managed to beat this game once, playing as valkyr. it took a few hours, but i knew i had won once i started playing a mini game (theyre called missions in-game) and didnt compulsively feel the need to return to the appearance tab. at last, i had been freed. but i am still determined to beat the game with each warframe i own. if you like games that challenge the players mind, this is for you.",367.4

"playing this game is a must if you like third person shooters and parkour. its just perfect in everything; the developers are very nice people, the game is completely balanced as a f2p game with real currency(i.e. platinum which you can get for real money or during giveaways). graphics are stunning, gameplay is great, ofcourse there are some bugs. also, theres not a single thing such as if you want to kill everyone in a few seconds, buy this premium status and buy all the op guns that you can only get for real money! unlike in most of the other f2p mmo games. you can get every single weapon that is in the game just by playing! you can suggest things to be added into the game as well(you can do that on their forum). this game is in good hands, therefore it is good itself aswell. i have to tell, i barely ever make reviews, and if i do : its either a perfectly done game or a terrible one. this one was worth the time i spent typing this. :l",258.0

"so i have been playing this game for about two weeks, started a guild, and did pretty much there is to do in the game. there are lots of levels, around 200 i think, lots of planets, lots of random events for random blue prints and mods and teno, also this game isnt really pay to win, i guess, because you can earn everything you need in game, and trade in game stuff for platinum, which is not required to win, but it can get you stuff you cant get without it, luckily there is a market of people selling platinum for items. also, the game is fun but repetitive and not enough people play, however it is very complext and entertaining at the same time, but there are serious lag issues in pvp, rail missions and things like that, so much so it makes me debate if these people are using hacks, because they function fine in the lag, where as you just end up dying and not knowing why or how. there are also a lot of bugs in this game, game crashes, falling through the map, enemies being behind the map preventing you from killing them and finishing the mission also. these bugs are rare, but when you come across them, and you will if you play this game like i have, than they will make you debate on writing this game a bad review. however, if you love rpgs, mmos and fpss than this game is worth checking out. besides the bugs, and the repetitiveness, i still come back for more, for now. its also free, so why the heck not.",432.6

"this game is a lot of fun. you get to go around to different planets as a robot(cyborg?) ninja and ninja many enemies to death. it is free to play, so no risk for you to give it a try. they did something very peculiar with the cash shop however. the punishment for earning new robot suits in the game versus buying them with real-world money is death. bear with me as i explain. there are two methods to get new robot suits(the standard issue ones anyways). 1) someone pays real-world cash for them. you or someone you traded your items too for platnium(the cash shop currency) laid down some money so you can get that shiney new warframe(robot suit). 2) you farmed the pieces in the game itself and then crafted the warframe. so you invested your time and the game makers did not get paid. at this point, everything is still on the up and up. however, what i didnt mention is this: if you employ method 2, you will most likely recieve a stalkers mark and the game will send a super-powerful npc to invade your game and kill you, which removes the mark. in summary... if you played the game to get new suits instead of just buying them with real money, expect to be punished by being ganked by the games cash shop enforcer. p.s. i still recommend playing this.",597.6

"i recommend this game, because its fun tp play either in solo or online with your friends. the game focuses on combat , teamwork and has the foundry where you can build new things for your tenno. but, you have to get the blueprints first and then what you need for it, from a specific planet or enemy type. the game allows you to costumize a ton of things, like your colouring for your tenno, guns and even make these things better, by adding mods to them. of course the game just gets better by having a sword as your melee weapon with which you can do different combos, from the air or sliding under the enemys gunfire and slicing them into pieces. you start off with basic weapons, but you can change them as you get more credits, to buy faster, stronger and better shotguns, sniper rifles and such things as a dual ninja sword. in-game you can play up to 4 players, and if you with different amount of players, then you get different spaceships to run around on. as you level up, you get more mod capacity on your weapons and tenno. the capacity/rank can be increased by playing with it. when i say mods, i mean that you can get different upgrades that gives piercing shot on enemy armor, more shield capacity etc. and you can access them in your own arsenal, yeah your inventory is called arsenal, and then you can put them on and have fun slaughtering the enemy aliens. the game is beta, but its a hundred percent free-to-play.",394.8

"dont be fooled by the disgraceful reviews of the big reviewers like ign and gamestop or whatever, but this game is amazing, especially for free to play. you feel in control and can chop your enemies down using some skills you obtain, you can change colours of your character, get new skills and mods for your weapons, helmets etc. now dont get me wrong, these things come at a price, quite a large price too, i totally recommend this game, its fun and can have a blast with friends. to be honest, i would rate this game a 8 out of 10 for some flaws, but i am disgusted of how the big reviewers have rated this game, so i just want to back it up a bit.",18.6

"i just started playing and it is pretty cool. the characters and environments are super pretty and the game play is very fluid. the game feels like it would work really well on a console. (ps4) or in steam big picture mode. the plus side and down side is that it is free to play. you get to enjoy a good game for nothing but if you want anything more than bare bones content you need to buy it and the content prices are a bit high. just look at the dlc prices... geez. (dec 2013) i think if i can get into this game i would be happy to throw some bucks their way to support it. i guess i am a potential investor like all new players.",4.5

"update 14 intruduces many new things that appear to be for the better, but sadly youll likely have loads of bugs, such as freezing out of your game and having to reboot the entire thing, connection issues to parties, having to possibly solo quest missions that will likely be too hard, boss scaling so once what was easy is now a super pain in the  when you just want to get something done. dont bother getting the game until they can actually fix it. before i get replies saying that its me, i can assure you that it isnt, ive done everything to troubleshoot any problems, i have a good pc, and run on low graphics settings, and have 20upload and 40download, all ports are properly forwarded, and ive tried with/without them forwarded, same results, ive had other people have the same problems as me. if in the event your game is working properly, youre lucky, but ive had it with the game, and will no longer be continuing to play it.",138.0

"a rapidly growing pve-based mmorpg game with epic space ninja acrobats, a ton of weapons and a variety of different classes/roles. youll find it different from a typical mmorpg (ex. wow, gw2, etc). if you prefer a more action based mmorpg with more direct controls (wasd to move, mouse to shoot/aim, basically like an fps), then this is the game for you. might be rather grindy, but honestly what kind of mmorpg does not have any form of grind? it is also not pay to win as you can achieve most (still have to buy for cosmetics and whatnot) through farming. the developers are pretty connected with the community too, which makes the community pretty invovled in the development of the game. the community itself is majorly helpful and nice, its not hard to find help from the subreddit /r/warframe or the in-game chat channel it self. highly recommend this game for people who like fast paced mmorpgs.",1058.2
"i am impressed that they managed to make a game about space ninjas boring. grind grind grind until your bitter husk of an existence is over and you should be rewarded with some high damage items at least, not some  space larping axe and a nerf gun.",7.8

"beautiful game its great and controller friendly great ggraphics irresistable",7.0
"my favourite sci-fi game so far. 10/10 for me. the graphics are beautiful, the choice of weapons, warframes(characters) and mods(to upgrade all these) are just huge. the game is mostly a co-op game, with a maximum of four players per mission. your mission goals vary, the environment varies, everything is perfect. only one thing i dont like: the updates. when a major update comes out(like new mission type, new event, etc.) there are so many bugs and glitches and sometimes a lots of game crashes, that it makes almost impossible to play peacefully for one or two days. they should focus on looking for these problems and repair them a.s.a.p. in brief this is a beautiful game, interesting, always gives you something new to reach. i have 350+ game hours and im still enjoying it.",433.0
"you gotta get this if you remember your childhood well. this has everything a sci-fi fan could want. parkour, high-tech weapons, mastery, and most importantly, if the game is pay 2 win or not. the only flaw this game has is that its striking towards pay for convenience. which is, you can get all the warframes in game and what not, but you can also advance ingame faster by paying money. but dont sweat, probably none of the money that you shell out will not give you an advantage on player vs. player modes whatsoever. this game is striking towards the right direction, highly recommend spending some time with it and see what you like.",11.7
"parkour space ninja third person shooter. a bit grindy, but a good time killer and pretty fun. still a beta, so forgive any bugs.",369.8
"this is a very, very good game; for a free-to-play third person shooter, it blows away any and all competition, and you dont have to pay a cent to get powerful. its smooth, sleek, looks great on pc. its intense, action packed; you will hardly have a dull moment. and its only in beta. i want to see how this game plays out as a full-fledged platform for free action; it has my attention in all earnesty.",431.7
"a fun free to play game that keeps getting better!",23.9
"great game. minus the time walls, grind walls, and all other invisible walls. although f2p, you need to put money into it to progress. its either that or you have to commit multiple hours a day to acomplish something. microtransactions are horrendous. but overall, the gameplay feels good. just bad decision making and business design from devs.",660.6

"one of the most stable and enjoyable betas ive ever seen. fast, frantic action, which is a beauty to watch and play, and will, without a doubt, make you feel like an absolute badass. its accessable, making it easy to play, but still requiring some skill to pull off those really cool attacks and manuevers. a very nice balance, and hopefully the game will only improve.",5.7
"magic robo-ninjas with guns. what do you want? plot? shut up and look awesome while you kill things.",5.0

"very fun and addictive. this game boasts tons of collectables to enhance your playthrough, and gameplay immesnly. although at times, warframe may feel like a grind to get that item you really really need for crafting, if you got your friends to back you up, your pretty much unstoppable! i would reccomend warframe to people who like -rpgs -third/first person shooter games.",8.9
"this is a good game for the first couple of hours but it gets a bit repetitive after that. the combat is satisfying and enemies explode into glorious showers of blood but there are a lot of repeated assets and enemies, making this a game that you should get if you feel like something fun to play for a couple of hours, and its for the wonderful price of nilch, so you should probably pick it up.",361.8
"to me the game was pretty boring. same goes for missions. abilities are kinda all right, but its not good enough. i was happy to remove the game. i just dont like it and thats it.",0.8
"i thought that youve made a better game since i last played it but no. it isnt as i thought it was. its worse than before. i just installed it and logged in my old account to see that the mobs are freaking op. i used all my revives just for a mission and died in the end. why did i use the revives ? cause the mobs deal major damage. i even went to 7-10 lvl mobs and they still are op. i cant open the marked if i dont find a segment and to find that segment i have to go to these missions,but i cant finish them cause mobs are op and i cant do anything. i suggest you fix your game. cause this thing kills the fun for me. oh and if you say that i should mod or upgrade my weapons and character, i cant. i dont know why but i dont see any upgrade thingie in my arsenal.i think that has something to do with finding that stupid segment. anyway as i said i suggest you better your game,cause this kills the fun for me,atleast.",53.8

"this game has come such a long way since release. now i cant stop playing it. everything in the game can be unlocked as long as you put some time into it, so even if there are a lot of purchasable items and equipment, you can still be on par with those players. the combat is extremely fluid, physics are wonderful, graphics are fu**ing amazing, and the diversity in the frames and weapon builds make it fun to show off to your friends.",163.4
"if there was a maybe option id give it that- the game is graphically pleasing, and the concept of basically being space ninjas is great, but the game falls into all the traps of the mmo genre which completely wrecks the gameplay. you will be grinding for the sake of grinding in this game, and while fun at first, it wont keep you entertained for very long unless youre okay with mmo style grind.",159.5
"i dont prefere this game since you are just shooting and nobody can hurt you or anything, good part of it you are a ninja thats it...",20.4
"i cant even begin to express how boring this game is. its the kind of game that looks amazing but feels half-baked. the gameplay is shallow and repetitve right from the start, the story is non-existant, its grinding throughout and most importantly...the blade is weak. if your coming into this expecting revengance levels of precision and fun then youre in for disappointment. you may as well be swinging a baseball bat and since aiming your sword is the same as aiming your gun only in close-quaters youre likely to miss 80% of the time. if you must see for yourself then go ahead, its free but i warned you its not fun.",1.3

"since update 11.0, warframes taken a much more interesting turn; its damage 2.0 system allows for interesting elements to the gameplay, giving real depth to weapon customisation and forcing a player to have a variety of weapons to counter any setbacks. the games newest boss additions have been positive, allowing for a more team-based element without compromising the single player experience. at the end of the day, single player is still enjoyable, though harder missions are incredibly difficult to do. the core gameplay is rock-solid (with the occasional bug (portforward if you want an easier time connecting)), and mostly satisfying. there are still a few glitches in the game that hinder it slightly, (ui problems, animations bugs) but they wont seem so big. the game also encourages players to be social; clans offer bonuses, nightmare modes require teamwork to get through, and pvp offers a fresh break from whaling on npcs. weapon and warframe variation is impressive, to say the least. weapons, warframes, gear, equipment, powers; all these are important for your build and your playstyle. if you want to experience ninjas in space, this game is most definitely for you.",609.2

"i liked it, but i dont really get it. the idea sticks, but the level design just didnt click for me. they way progression works, mixed with the fact that there are little to no people at lower (?) levels makes this game confusing. maybe im just autistic. edit: after playing for 34.8 hours (and counting) after the damage 2.0 update, i get it now! i used to play warframe before, and everything was very confusing for me. this is a rather interesting game where you have to kick  as one of 200 ninja types against robots and fleshlings.",65.2

"i had doubts about this game, but they came to naught once i started playing. the style is truley unique and it is easy to spend hours on end in playing the game. the only issue i have is sinnce it is in beta it isnt fully fleshed out, meaning lore and story are lacking in some areas, but the game is totally worth it. shout out towards the devs who are always improving the game and responding to us on the forums.",139.0

"warframe is a great game because it has a little something for everyone. the games warframes supplement each possible playstyle. a few bugs are present, which should not deter players since it is in beta stage. warframe has crafting for the people who like to make cool stuff, small puzzles for geniuses, a looting mechanic, the ability to make any weapon a total beast, and a variety of weapons to fit any playstyle: the sprayer, the sniper, the heavy hitter, etc. the music is awesome at first, but gets a bit repetitive after a while, but gamemodes are fun and are challenging if given time, even the first stage has challenging levels. bosses are a bit overpowered but drop great items. warframe is incomparable with other third-person shooters, you could say its a different breed.",134.7

"i enjoy playing this game...it does get a bit grindy but i think most games do once you reach end game...the developers add new content to try to avoid this which is good...there are constant updates which i like...there are pros and cons to every game..but over all i really like it",755.5
"experiencing crash after crash, and tons of bugs. i enjoy this game, i really do. but not beeing able to play due to random crashes and an error where it keeps saying could not reach server makes the exeprience not worthwhile. keep missing out on rewards thanks to the crashes, cant rank up thanks to the crashes. i understand there has been a major update recently, and it came with alot of these errors and bugs but i recommend waiting to play this game untill most get fixed. some might think this might be your computer only but i asked in-game, and my friends who started playing at the same time as me, and most have been experiencing the same issues. a game like warframe, isnt hard to run on my system. i run all settings on high, tested if physx was the problem (which wasnt), turnd v-sync on and off again but nothing seems to fix the crashes. wait till de gets everything (or most) fixed which dont stop you from playing the game. then, i will highly recommend this game.",734.9
"excellent third person shooting with unique visuals inspired by what a lot of us hoped dark sector would be. this is a great game and an even greater example of how to properly use the free-to-play model. i am holding each of my friends computers hostage and forcing the installation of this game on all of them. theres nothing in this game that you cant get for free with a little hard work aside from some cosmetic items. while it may not appear all weapons or characters are playable for free than can all be earned with a bit of work. the gameplay supports numeroous playstyles as long as they include mass murder of any enemy on the screen. overall a great game, and no reason not to play it.",223.9
"a free shootum up with maps that change both over time and depending on who your fighting for, or what the type mission is. this game is alot of fun, crushing huge waves of enemies. with many different objectives and 3 different factions to contend with its damn fun for no investment. get your space commando on and experience the mirad of weapons and mods as you fight your way towards your goals.",384.4

"warframe is co-op fps game that provides a new playground with many options. where teamwork is key to takedown tough bosses to get new blueprints for stronger, more powerful warframes and weapons. warframe has pros and cons. the pros of this game is that it provides a fun, enjoyable experience with lots of options concerning weapons, warframes, modfications to your weapons and warframes. it also has a rewarding victory when new weapons and warframes are built. the cons are that while building new weapons and warframes is rewarding, it can take a minimum of 5 days to build new warframes and a usual 12 hours for new weapons. also this game is in beta so sometimes it may run perfectly and other times have bugs or even crash after extended periods of play or if repeating the same mission over and over. the final verdict for this game is 6.75/10 because this game is a enjoyable experience with a few cons but doesnt quite live up to its full possibilities and expectations in some multiplayer pvp areas.",111.8

"pros: - its free. - space ninjas - lots of warframes, cool weapons, cool powers - lots of parkour. you can wall run, climb walls, roll, jump, slide and shoot while doing all of that. - lots of customization to fit your playstyle - you can stealth it, or go straight up guns blazing - match making is pretty quick - ordis is hilarious - great environments - its free. cons: - not much story or characterization - no skill trees or skill progression - no exploration, the game is mostly just go to planet a, do mission b. - is a tiny bit linear, needs more open environments - business model is a little restricting (to make a weapon you need a blueprint. components, and a timer, that takes alot of grinding) - little character interaction beyond the co-op missions. verdict: its a fun game, i definetly recommend giving it a shot, especially if you crave something like destiny or halo or the like. you got nothing to lose anyway, its free.",20.5

"a great game which involves not only shooting skills, but strategy as well. the bad part about this game is the fact that you cant really communicate with your team in the game, which makes it a bit difficult to coordinate some times. the best way to play this game and enjoy it to its fullest is to form your own team and communicate through stream, skyper or other similar programs. that dosent mean that playing the solo is not fun, it is, but everything is more enjoyable when you are surrounded by friend. so go on! form your team and go kick some alien butt!",4.8
"game is boring. even with friends its still boring.",1.9

"this game right here is a prime example of what game are in the end: an entertainment medium. surely it is fun it be inside a story driven rpg, taking a role of a fabled hero in the quest to save the world, but sometimes you just want to have fun. space ninjas, swords, and explosions have to be at least a bit fun",553.9

"warframe is a great game. for some people. i am one of those people. this game is very innovative, because of the way it takes mmo, and mashs it with a single-player game. the controls are nice and accessible, and are also easy to learn. i myself, use a xbox controller for many games. the xbox controls for this game is also nice and feels good. the special effects is phenomenel. it looks amazing if you have a good computer. i love the wayu you can slide while shooting, use a sword to decapitate and how eye-popping it looks on my monitor. so yes, i would extremely recommend this game to another.",7.2

"this game really struck a chord with me. it seems to be just the right blend of mmo and co-op shooter. excellent developer, excellent engine with superb performance even on my old hardware (gtx 660ti). engaging melee combat and gunplay, combined with an insane amount of customization through the ccg-like mods system really makes every battle a fun fight. mmo elements can be too grind-heavy for some, especiialy if youre one of the they will get my money from my cold, dead hand type of free-to-play player. if youre willing to drop some cash though, that whole thing is not a factor. player clan (guild) dojos can also be built, which definitely make you feel like you have staked a small claim in the game universe. its lore, while a bit underwhelming, is excellent when it is there. i could go on for a while with smaller details, but why still read when you can try it for free*! *not free as in path of exile",118.0
"the gane its self isnt to bad. its a good bit of fun and has some real nice gaphics. ive only played a little less then ten hours of it, butive already started to see a trend. if you want to get anywhere decent and stand a chance at the pvp or at getting kills during the co-op, youve got to spend real world money. thats the one thing that sort of kills the experiance for me. i bought the game for the whole free to play aspect, but right now its looking like more of a free to play, pay to win type of game. like i said though, if you dont mind getting less kills or having a hard time killing other players, the game isnt bad. specially when you play single player or with guys around your handicap.",6.9
"i come back to this game every few months, and this is the only game in beta i have ever seen that gets better every time i come back noticably. every time something has changed (for good)/improved/or has been added. i love it. if you want a game that accualy has a team doing things, this is your game.",107.6

"the general gameplay and experience was fun... while it lasted. the whole game gets tedious and players can easily buy their way to success, but that takes most of the challenge away. ive lost interest in this game, and so have many of the people that i personally know who played this game. my clan is dead and many more have gone quiet. generally, warframe now has a lackluster feel for me. i got used to the grinding, but de just added more, and then buffed the grinding with little annoying paywalls  that honestly generate more challenge. unfortunately, they nerfed across the board, so it became more difficult for non-paying players to effectively play. i cant imagine this game having any longevity. im serious. i used to love the  out of this game, but now its just complete crap. as little money as i did spend on it (after 300+ hours of play) i feel cheated. longtime players, founders, and vets alike have been leaving and/or disapproving of the games recent turn of events. discontent is all over the forums. de has become heedlessly distant from their fan base and gamming community. i implore you to seriously consider not downloading this game.",559.2

"one of the most amazing games ive played, but still a lot of buggs.",8.5
"very awesome game if you can afford it. 300 us dollars is about what youll need to really be satisfied with it for a short period of time. if you got the money get it its fun. youll also need a ton of time to set it up before you even get to play. you can never sell it or even give items away . once you get it its yours forever.",14.9

"warframe is a fun, decent game on its own thats at its best when you play with a few friends and grind for hours on end for new warframes and weapons. youll most likely be farming and grinding continously, which after a while will wear thin. the sliding mechanics are fun to play with and melee is somewhere in between fun and clunky. its not a bad game, but it lacks the polish and lasting appeal for me to recommend it to anyone. 5/10",59.9

"warframe is a fantastic game free-to-play cooperative third person shooter video game. their are lots of great elements about this game that just make it stand out. the weapons are tons of fun to play with but need a lot of work to craft or if your not into crafting, you can use your real life money to buy them which is abit meh but it is a online-multiplayer game, it needs some economy. the clan dojo is probably my favourite part of the game. it is just so fun to click along the walls and explore new rooms. there are a lot of glitches in this game, ill be honest like a phew times, i do glitch through walls and invisible barriers but they can be solved easy. but yeah, good game. i recommend it to people who like third person shooters with online functionalities.",68.1
"seriously: the only f2p title that ever kept my attention. first i thought: ugh, another pay to win title and worse, being kind of a mass effect ripoff. then: hey, whatever it is, its fun!!! it is tremendous fun. i like the fact that it is only pve and pvp doesnt factor in at all. most of the community is nice and fun, even if there are some di**s around, so even playing with random people is fun. playing with friends is the best.",215.5

"warframe is an addicting and fun game. i mean come on, how can you not like ing space ninjas? the only one and major downside is that the game can be hugely p2w at times. you can obtain most items for free, but you need to grind a lot. other then that, the game has many styles. there is stealth, and there is also kill everything you ing see. i prefer kill everything you ing see, but i do love stealth for the challenge aspect. warframe is constantly being updated, and always stays fun. i would rate this game with 4/5 space shurikens.",621.6

"this game... this is my second review for it, and my opinion has stayed the same, this is an amazing game. the only way to fully describe this game is: ninjas... in space... with rocket launchers.",441.4
"are you interested in quick paced, rpg, 3rd person, zombie, ninja, robot shooters? you simply need to try this out then even if you dont, since its also free with no pay2win methods because its co-op as well! there are tons of weapons, warframes, and mods to use, the sounds and graphics are stunning and the story well.. i really didnt care for since i just wanted to kill stuff. negatives: gets really and i mean really grindy, why? well... the main goal in this game is just to rank up your mastery which requires you to craft everything and lvl them up fully. which makes it really repetitive so you may want to farm with your friends so you can keep on doing so. i got addicted whenever i made a new frame, sentinel, or weapon wanting me to max it out making it more powerful with w/e mods i decided to place which is satisfying. its well worth trying but is it worth staying? well... go in and find out on what you think.",195.1
"it sucks. forgot my password and they wont let me play thats dumb.",239.4
"great game, whether what you like is shotgunning things, sniping them from a distance, blowing them up, slicing them to bits, or committing genocide with awesome powers. become ridiculously op in the lower levels or run around in the higher levels where enemies one-hit you, either way youll probably find somewhere you can have fun.",605.9
"update 14 has really made the beginning of the game more playable. i would absolutely recommend it now. pros: lots of customizations you get to feel like you earned your new gear plenty of variety interesting gamemodes great opportunities for teamwork each update brings a brand new ui cons: crafting new stuff *sometimes* requires days of grinding crafting things also takes time (i.e. 12 hours, 24 hours, 3 days, etc) you only get a limited number of weapon and character slots people can pay to buy pretty much anything with real money, which sort of kills the sense of accomplishment for people who earned their gear",403.1
"the game has great graphics, and the multiplayer is really fun. highly recommended.",847.3

"from the makers of unreal and unreal tournament, incredibly fun, if flawed in some places. dont let the metacritic rating deceive you. while most of the criticism is well-earned, it belies the fact that there is a very solid, entertaining core here. the gameplay reminds me a bit of hellgate or borderlands, in terms of its fps-rpg play. the weapon variety, however, is more interesting along with a crafting system that keeps you coming back day in and day out. you wont find a gripping story here, but you will find yourself curious to explore the possibilities, balancing effectiveness with a style that suits you. this is a game that makes farming fun!",471.2

"why do i have 500 hours in this terrible game??? oh, because its cathartic and fun. welp. warframe is easily one of the very few f2p games that you can genuinely do in its entirety without paying a cent. starting off can be hard, though - the means of earning real-money currency in-game is not super easy.",804.8
"great game, starting items are a bit rough but once you get ranked up and can afford new items. jesus the game becomes so much better. i use to not want to play it because i felt like i couldnt do anything. then i got new weapons and a warframe, man and i am loving it now.",40.3

"i personally like this game a lot but i feel like not enough people play it. its a very creative and beautiful game that sets itself apart from from other games with its levels, but after a while it gets slightlyh repetetive in my opinion. i give this game 8.5/10",36.3

"after every stupid update they make , there are coming 100 hotfixes , they alwasy but always ruin something in the game . with every update they make . i think the programmers are a bounch of gorillaz* . seriosly if you dotn beliave me try it yourself waste your time .",393.0

"i recommend it , best game ever and its free , i think you never find another game like this but free to play",196.6
"if you think this game is lame, think again! 1. robot ninjas 2. cutting guys in half 3. super cool upgrades 4 .awesome ninjas 69. cool co-op",7.2
"probably the best game ever. join me. its free to play. :)",25.4
"one of the best free to play games currently avalible. whats best is that all of the content is avalible if your willing to put the work in, and not an unreasonable amount of work like games. the major downside is that it requires a fairly good pc in order to look good.",291.5
"if you like kilin aliens with super skills and guns this is your game",373.4
"this game, as every other game in steam, was created in true korea, so i recommend it. death to all who oppose us",9.7
"this game is like its like halo only its not you shoot the bad guys, and then you win! congratulation! you play with 4 random people and go through missions, so its loads of fun~! 12 out of 10",137.8
"warframe is alot more than a just a shooter, with crafting ,armor, classes, enchanting, raids, looting makes it more like an rpg on the lines of fallout vegas or mass effect.",121.7
"fun on pc and ps4!!!!! awesome game, so much stuff to do!",29.2
"this game is really fun and addicting and i really recommend this game to people who like ninjas, freerunning and fast paced combat.",268.5
"i recommend this for everyone who likes ninjas, yeah! ninjas in space! how cool is that? plus! free-to-play!",5.1
"this game is the definition of amazing. if you love ninja gaiden 3, halo, and borderlands, this game is perfect for you. i cant tell you how much i loved this game from the very beginning. 9,001/10",11.1
"unless you are a huge fan of fantasy, then this game is not recommended for you. the graphics are o.k in the game, however the plot of this game is not great. as a matter of fact, i dont even think i understand the plot yet. i am not stopping you from playing this game, but i can tell you it will be a unsatisfying experience if you do not like fantasy. thank you.",0.9
"really love this game ,but now i play on the ps4 because my comp sucks and now i have to start all over ;-;",72.5
"amazing game for old pcs.on dual core is working fine just you need toi have a good internet conmnection and vsync enabled when youre fighting.try it.!!!!",2.5
"best co-op game ive ever come across, and ive tried alot. simple yet complex and intricate movement and combat system, with smooth transitions into free running madness, all while under attacks from swarms of enemies. do you and your group have what it takes to survive?",190.3
"warframes pretty sick tbh and its quite a fast paced game in my opinion which is my playstyle, but anyways i recommend this game if u like 3rd person fps and its fast paced combat",302.8
"this is one of the best third-person shooters out there and i recommend it! :d",6.7
"for a free game, this is one you should definitely play! cant stop playing it!",223.3
"i hate it shuts down all the time i hate do not play this pice of junk",4.7
"slicing and dicing your way through hordes of enemies never felt more satisfying. i highly recommend this for people who love hack and slash games or people who love strategy and planning, this games got plenty of both. i think one of the only cons are that if you have an average (not for gaming, or average laptop) computer, you might want to go to through the graphics settings and turn off all of the motion blur, flashy lights, and lens flares.",62.8
"highly recommend this game, its a quick paced strategy game that is fine for both solo and team style playing. with the quick match-making process and the amazing ability to invite your friends and join in mid mission makes for good fun all around. this game has a fairly simple clan making system only trick is that to interact with your clan you must create a dojo key that requires some pick up from early game bosses. the editor is fairly friendly if you have people that have played the game before to walk you through, but after they explain it once it is very simple to pick up. mucho mucho fire and space ninja in space brvh!",59.1
"initial thoughts: pfffffffffff warframe more like snoreframe oh look at all these things i can never have unless i give the devs $80 and my soul tch wait this game is actually really fun even with the buttlord starting weapons; mag is pimpmaster flex and loki is swagbro supreme beginning thoughts: omg i can electric ninja slide and climb everywhere and slashing makes it even faster i was not expecting to have a robot pal or another sweetass ninja body in the first few days of playing but here i am secondary thoughts: oh dang you can earn basically everything without spending real life monies if youre swag enough also the devs are awesome beardy canadians who do things to make their game awesome and cool last thoughts: [hype intensifies] (warning: above review was written while drunk.)",526.7
"great game just everyone thinks its all about running fast and being first to the finish line lol",513.0
"very fun game if you have friends to play with, but the random people you encounter can be unpredictable. also trading is very difficult and the way the item system is set up you either have to constantly farm items non-stop so you can build your upgrades, or you have to spend your entire allowance/paycheck to buy what you need.",883.0
"they fixed their  but they still have a ways to go... introduce the nature warframe already...",770.8
"real solid mmo shooter with great battle mechanics and fluid movement.",53.8
"waframe, a game on which your are a space ninja that jumps around doing ninja like things. as for how the game plays it may feal a bit magnet to things sometimes, but if you can get by it it gets really flying everywhere. it may take a bit if effort to get good at the game but its worth it.",808.2
"an amazing experience for both the free consumer, and the big spender. youll never feel obligated to spend money, as nothing is completely gated to you as a free user, but i recomend supporting the game and buying forma, warframe and weapon slots, and catalyst for the best experience. buying weapon and warframes out right seems a bit silly to me, as farming them out is a large part of the game. highly recomend this game to all user who enjoy the gamplay mechanic.",305.8
"its free, its awesome, its parkouring space shooting with melee weapons and abilities mixed in, get it.",97.5
"hey this game is great. good graphics, fun and addicting gameplay, and its free. boom. perfect.",202.1
"i do have to say this game rock!!!!!!love it, coming from xbox 360 fan.",3.3
"love this game, fun and smooth controls! you can really do some crazy acrobatic moves with enough practice :) you can craft everything in the game, you dont have to pay a single penny! its free! try it out!",187.2
"this game is very big and requires dozens of hours to complete,even tough the quests are repetitive ,the combat and movement style of these game will make you think on many solutions to best your enemies and graphical content are superb.",82.3
"one of the most correct f2p shooter. every one have to try it!",592.9
"nice grapichs and skill for fps game.. but, this game have bad grapichs for ai.. i hope steam can fix that..",23.4
"fun game if you like doing backflips, wall climbing, and lots of par-core. on top of a space shooter. so basicly your a freaking space ninja!!!",177.2
"cannot make a account its sending me to websights that involve hacking...",11.2
"chopping, slicing, dicing, shooting, and rhino . 10/10 best ninja",513.1
"you must spend your real money on it if you wanna play well. also without many friends you wont be able to beat those strong planet.",139.6
"good game any thing you want in a third person shooter.",41.7
"i tried the beta and it looked very complicated. for one, the controls are garbage second the trailer made the game look ay better than it is. i know all games do that but this game made it look way to good and third the purchases seriously 19.99 for the first pack, 39.99 for the starter pack, and the most expensive thing in this game, 99.99 for a tenno pack. serriously",0.2
"one of the worst games you could ever play. i would explain why... but it isnt worth my time, nor is it yours.",1.4
"all i can say is... odd....odd....odd........... for lots of xp! 10/10",42.3
"do not let my hours playing this game fool you , ive played it for more than a thousand hour directly w/o steam and played it since release. the ultimate grinding experience , your only progression in this game is to obtain weapons/frames/rarecores. is it a bad grindfest ? no. enemies can be majorly challenging , maps have rotation starting spawns , you will almost never start at the same spot in the same map , but maps have a lot of sections and the devs even make the maps bigger and bigger with every patch. would you recommend ? -do you like running around being a badass space ninja ? -do you like to swing swords while being a badass space ninja? -do you like using super space ninja chi to kill your enemies? -are you willing to spend hours and hours grinding the same map for rngesus to bless you with a drop for a weapon youre making ? if the answer is yes to any of the questions , then its the game for you. the dev team is downright amazing , they actually listen to players , they host events , they do rebalances when needed and such , the game gets atleast 1 frame(armor/class) and 2 weapons per month so its lively and going strong and hold it goes strong while it lasts.",523.2
"this game is fun, at least for me, for only about a couple of days at most, maybe a couple of hours... this game is a great ftp game and has lots of great elements. the gunplay is great, the parkour is fun, and the characters (tennos and enemies alike). the game has constant updates and active developers who ask the community for advice on certain matters. the developers are very interactive with the community of players. the game, since it is ftp, does have a lot of farming for objects though. and a lot of wait times for guns or frames that you would like to build. and there is a cap on how many warframes you have. unless you buy more slots, which is only twenty platinum, which is cheap. but that is a bit of a downer. i personally like this game, but do not adore it. the level system is not something someone blows through. this game demands attention if you want valuable items. and if not time than money. it does get boring farming items as it takes a long time and certain drops are rare and require multiple playthroughs of the same game type over and over. and a word of advice... play with people who are better than you if you are a newb. this game was meant to be played with other people, whether that be friends from your personal life or randoms over the interwebs....... 6-7/10...",55.8
"i only played a little while but it seems ok, gotta go to work now. ill finish doing the tutorial thing later",851.6
"when i launch warframe: warframe just got updated! me: yeeah!!!! launcher: added wings so that u can fly like a boss! me mhm... also the wings looks like iron man things i dont know! me: -.- wich means... they just ruined a good game.....",348.5
"basically a free to play version of destiny, that came out before destiny. if you want a game thats fast paced & easy to play, and doesnt take allot of grind time to enjoy it then its worth the free install. but it is a typical console run and gun with a shinny appearance to hide the lacking of progressive storyline or variance in gameplay.",23.0
"much good, would reccommend. only downside, you need a good computer to not lag, a windows 7 will lag unless you put the settings right. so in other words, get it, play it, love it.",1.9
"a fun third person fps [so long as youre playing with friends]. there is depth to the game, but not enough to make it feel overwhelming. wall running and using abilities on warframes make you feel invincible and makes time start to flow, but at its core it is still a shooter genre and will eventually revert to that. i would suggest this to any hardcore shooter fan, and anyone looking to mess around in a game to have fun (because the early levels deff. supply that urge!)",22.5
"as a power-armored space ninja with cowboy neon revolvers i punched a space marine to death while a companion cube of deth shot its friend. 10/10 if you think the shooty aspects are good enough to outweight the grindy aspects.",227.2
"when i started playing this game it was in alpha. i played when it was first made. every since then its been going downhill. i still recommend it because it use to be a lot of fun and i am a founder.",71.7
"warframe is an interesting third-person shooter play game. you have a diversity of weapons (primary and secondary category) and melee weapons. the game graphic is pretty good, the tennos (a.k.a warframe), scenery, enemy, weapons and so forth are so rich of details. the most (and main) interesting of this game are tennos undoubtedly, each one has your unique and style power and characteristic and this is make you feel like a ninja. what, ninja? yes it is, you may walk on wall, super jump, throw shuriken stars, play like stealth (like a true ninja) and so forth. the game is still in beta mode then dont be angry when you realize you need spend some money to buy slot for more weapons and your new warframes",771.2
"my friend told me this game would look dreadful in 3d because of the motion blur, but he also have another 3d technology than i have. something with a samsung monitor with built-in 2d to 3d converter, but it is not as good as nvidias solution. the game looks cool with nvidia 3d and i can recommend this game, even though it makes my pc sleep :p nvidia physx also looks good hehe. i like the missions too and the play style of this game.",0.7
"great game with high potential, just that it must stay free to play",5.4
"i have no words to describe how frickin awesome this game is!!!!!!!!! a must play game for a fan of the sci fi genre!!!!!",19.8
"a pretty good game, a bit grindy, a bit buggy, but a pretty good game none the less. think of warframe as a game you can dump infinite amount of hours in (as long as you arent bored) every once in a while. its like, the 3d version of the cookie clicking game.",938.5
"amazing game. graphics are pretty great,it has lots of tilesets and enemys to kill. ton of weapons to use and warframe to get. insane grinding though and lots of rng. still really fun though. platinum is a tad expensive but you dont need to buy anything if you dont want to. no storyline atm though because its still in beta. ill update this when they add a storyline. rate: 8.9/10",1261.6
"great game for a free-to-play. however, the game can become boring after you begin to invest time into it, and the gameplay can prove repetitive. so far, warframe is posed as a closed beta under the guise of constantly being fixed, and the devs regularly add more weapons, characters, etc. in order to sooth the repetition of gameplay for veteran players. while this seems good at first, it quickly becomes a detriment to the potential of warframe. all in all, the game has fantastic graphics, and a style akin to me3s multiplayer. it is fun to play as a pick-up title, and i have high hopes for it. however, having invested countless hours myself, the game has grown boring, and the promises of constant updates instead of a legitimate story and endgame can be aggrivating. so if you want to play the game, dont invest any money into it, as it fits the free-to-play genre far better than one you should actually pay for. 7/10",170.3
"this game is super fun but i wish it was for mac and linux but what ever this game was awesome... while i could play the story",54.5
"its diffrent from most games but its sooo fun. the only problem i had so far is how many warframes and weapon slots you can have. its annoying cause you have to spend money for more slots. but from that its one of my top games atm.",329.4
"a grindfest as others have said, but the grinding is the whole point of the game - the grinding is legitimately fun. its basically mass effect, minus role playing, plus mmo, plus parkour space ninja.",125.9
"top of the line free to play game, second best ive ever played next to league of legends. a few reasons 1. amazing co op shooter, 2. awesome graphics even without top of the line pc 3. fast credit earning compared to other free to plays 4. innovative and addicting upgrade system for everything, armor, weapons, pets, spells, ect. everything lvls up indivudually and is just a very satisifying experience, although it may be a little intimidating at first, get past that learning curve and it is very rewarding. will take a couple hours before you realize what is going on with everything and how the system is laid out",230.2
"this is the best free game on steam ive ever seen :d...",129.1
"it was good when i played it, but if things change too much in any free to play, it can easily become pay to win. good little series, makes multiplayer a blast, lots of places to go. tps are gonna like the sword and gun combo to take down baddies, and the wallrunning ninja crap makes it flavorful game. needs armor weapons. (at least i think so.)",189.5
"warframe is by far the best game i have ever played outstanding graphics and detail i would of payed 10 pound for it",8.5
"great game and free content every month ! long time fun guarantees ! no pay2win !",441.3
"words cannot express how much i love this game, everything it does it does perfectly. imagine this: space ninjas, with guns, and powers, and fluid gameplay, amazingly fun co-op, a katana!!!! along with axes, broadswords etc. and so many guns that borderlands gets jealous (not really cause borderlands has a lot of guns but you get the picture, lots of gunz) warframe has so much to offer and so little to let it down. im positive that this is the best free to play of the year and maybe even the best multiplayer game overall. all of that stacked on top of the fact that its free, the only reason not to download warframe is that your pc/laptop/whatever cant handle it. download warframe, i can assure you that you wont regret it.",9.8
"fun and addicting, however to do anything you have to grind way too much. also on the rank up missions you can run out of ammo and energy and be left completly unarmed?? seriously, why? the enimies drop massive amounts of rifle ammo but almost no arrows so i cannot even complete the first rank mission becasue i run out of ammo and auto fail. fix this. the game is an 8/10 but could be 9 or even 10 if you fix the little things like that.",24.5
"if you are into shooters and dont mind future type of games, this is perfect",37.1
"its a grind, a boring repetative grind. but somehow its fun.",6.9
"amazing, extremely fun, i dont think i can put down this game in any way other than why is it free?. if anyone sees how fun this game is and doesnt download it, i will come to their house, slap them, download it and force them to play it.",11.2
"to play for free, you need to grind like a boss.  that. awesome game tho.",13.2
"been playing it since cbt and before it got onto steam. great fun at first but will get grindy near end game. the dev are working on improving the end game contents and adding new stuffs with every update so its worth a shot and they take players feedbacks seriously. gameplay: 7/10 graphics: 9/10 sound: 5/10 replayability: 8/10 community: 5/10 dev support: 10/10",92.9
"this game has a great start waiting to see where it will go in its time this game could last for years that all depend on the team well see .......",861.4
"a fun and creatively made gameplay with multiple ascpects which will please different types o gmaers. however a times it can be a tedious when you have to grind for rrsources and blueprints. overall though it is a fantastic game.",184.0
"incredibly fun, like a mix space, and ninjas. dare i say, space ninjas. you are the tenno, a race of organisms that have been in cryosleep for a long time. when the factions of the grinneer, the corpus, and the infested start to overtake the solar system and its outlying planets the tenno have been awakened by the lotus, the mainframe for tenno communication and status, to stop them in their tracks. for a free to play game, unlike many that have tons of microtransactions, this game has 0% of pay to win. all items in this game can be acquired through effort and playtime, and yes, some grinding. it has a fun playstyle and its playerbase is incredibly helpful and supportive of new players. its environment gets slightly boring in a short time, but you get a small respite in certain planets, like earth. along with void missions, derelict missions, nightmare mode, and invasions/alerts. this game definitely has replayability. if you are a player who loves getting achievements and 100% a game then this game will not be for you unless you have the apt amount of time to give it. it does take a long time to get certain things, and some of the items you get are completely random to the point where you will need other player help, but based on the solo difficulty the game was obviously never meant to be played 100% solo.",203.9
"amazing game, its just so cool, great graphics, smooth gameplay. get this game.",33.4
"the game is very good and i would love to play again after 2 or 3 years of some problem ive encountered every single time with some internal error and i cant play it anymore. ive asked many times for help, but theyve done absolutely nothing after 3 years of requests. thats why i dont recomend this game anymore...",7.8
"fun, but takes a decent amount of grinding to level up weapons and warframes and they want money for a lot of items with no other way to attain them.",158.1
"this game is really fun and addicting. you should all play it.",69.9
"interesting game to play, only bad side in it is that its to repetitive. by that i mean the maps and graphics usual gets repeated into other maps... after a while it really gets booring, seeing all the things all over again. game is fun! but it needs new maps, new graphics and new enemies if possible. ( wink wink )",131.5
"warframe is a f2p game based on a story of a forgotten civilization who awaken,to stop the forces of the enemy that grew. this game is all about playing for fun,unlocking new content, having a clan , socialize with people and more fun. this game is a team-based game , with a co-op feature , a private feature and a solo feature.you begin as a poor tenno,then you will become a master of the old ways. you will find yourself with other people hunting for rare items or even going to kill the bosses that terrorized their army.this game if fun, i recommend it! if you want a help you can contact me in game /w ufcolonel and me and my clan will assist you! :d",419.1
"at first i downloaded this game because katanas in spess, and i thought i would just bust some money on it. so i go to the free2play store, to buy the katana (named nikana in game). but, to my great sadness, the nikana is xp locked. thats a nice free to play. doesnt just allow you to buy all the good stuff. i ended up saving the majority money and got some samurai shoulder pads, and the ash ninja frame. lazor shurikens. great free2play, great gameplay, great co-op, great balancing. i heart it.",61.2
"great game, highly addictive, and still constantly evolving",1220.0
"this game is super! theres nothing like running and gunning with a little ninja action. teamwork is a must, so you have to band together and use your warframes abilities tactically.",22.7
"great game, but would be nice if there was a daily reward of platinum instead of having to buy every time.",6.7
"i love this game so much but i swear to yall i am scared to play by myself. i love the fun with me bow. the most important thing i would have to say is that know your warframes before you play the game. it was kinda difficult when i picked my warframe (hint:i picked volt). it was kinda hard to understand the controls because i have not played a game amazing as this on a pc. i strongly recommend this fun thrill ride of a game.",70.4
"this lady told me to go in a room, where i then proceeded to be hit in the face with a knive by a guy. 10/10 would get hit in the face with a knive by a guy again.",3.3
"this game has no words to explain it...its well made and thought and time into this i highly recommend this game for futureistic sword fighting loving gamers who desire such content",4.3
"for a free game warframe is amazing. i heard its supposed to be really good for consoles. everyone shoud get it",9.1
"a good game for people who likes to grind for resoures in order to get endgame weapons",1075.0
"this game is one of my favorites for two reasons. 1. it always seems to get better and better with each update. 2. it always has a new thing to do at every mission. people will enjoy this game. if you decide to get it, meet you there!",107.4
"grinding in this game is like grinding your  against a frozen lamp post, it provides no pleasure what-so-ever but youll still get stuck to it no matter what you do.",157.8
"i cant get enough of this game. they are always updating and adding content. 2 thumbs up! fight like a space ninja!",497.9
"the porn mods are excellent. but this is not why i am here. this is the best rpg of all time with the exception of final fantasy vii.",80.3
"i think its a pretty good game, it is enjoyable. i played it when it was first released before it was even on steam and well, all the glitches and such i experienced are probably now fixed. so if those are all fixed id imagine it is an enjoyable game for all. the only thing i disliked was well, its halfway impossible to find the items to craft armor or weapons. which gets you annoyed and you end up wanting to spend real money on in-game currency.",16.6
"brilliant game to play with your mates, or in solo! would reccommend this game to anyone who likes futuristic sword and gun games with a hint of puzzle solving! 10/10!",10.8
"warframe is love warframe is lyfe. one at a tyme it takes our lyves",2.2
"addictive, stress-relieving, and only occasionally frustrating. updates occur regularly, and the developers seem to listen to the community. new content and bug-fixes are released frequently, and ninjas play free. some content can only be purchased with platinum, but platinum can now be obtained via trading with other players, so the possiblities are limitless! it is based on dark sector, and the warrame-weilders are the spiritual descendants of hayden tenno (the protagonist of dark sector). if the idea of being a futuristic semi-robotic space ninja led by a mysterious (canadian) female of possible artificially intelligent origins is appealing to you, get ready, tenno!",879.5
"this game offers a fast pace, amazing graphics/effects, unique fighting style, customization, and much more. if you do not mind raiding stages (that can be similar at times) over and over again, then this game will be fun.",58.7
"for a tps, its a blow-up. i stabbed a guy in the balls and shot it until it came off. 11/10",13.7

"in warframe you play as a teno, a space ninja of sorts. the game is all about the fighting and gives you several options, you can use swords and melee, powers and ranged weapons. the selection of the weapons is large and the powers vary depending on which warframe (model) you play as. sadly the game isnt truly free to play. id put in a lot of time to try and get a few warframes and weapons for free (not including time spend getting the components) only to find out that the inventory is capped. that was the farewell for me. still, if you dont mind paying in some hard cash; this is a decent game to play. oh and yes, the plot is inexistant.",45.9
"i certainly not recommend this game, because you will waste some times on there. it is a free game, but the only quickest way to get the best items is to buy them, to able to buy them, you need to cost money. so the only way to earn items is to wait or buy them. i think that you should spend your hard earn money on other stuff rather then spending on this game. this games crafting takes a long time, when it finished, you might not like it, but you waste lots of times just waiting for this to craft. time is very expensive in some way. the game is free, but if you want to enjoy this game, only way is to spend money, so i think this game is not very good for you guys to play.",203.9
"i played this some before and without having a lot of hours onto the game i can say it looks promising i know people who have played this to much for their own good. also i like the fact that unlike most mmorpgs where you do not really become badass untill you played for a long time here you are a flippin ninja from the start! cons: it is still an mmorpg which means it includes grinding which i am not a big fan of it can sometimes be unclear with where you need to go as with all games where you can fly around (not literary fly) you will get stuck. in general though i recommend atleast trying it :d",1.0
"i have only played this game for a few days, but i have to say i am pretty impressed. for a free 2 play game its very well done especially graphically, reminds me a bit of the borderlands loot mechanics, but instead of guns, its about mods. it has its glitches here and there, but again its free, and so far it does appear that the devs work out the kinks. if you liked borderlands / mass effect / crysis, this is a blend of all 3, it is free after all.",131.5
"fastest, most stylish 3rd-person shooter ive seen in a while, love it!",304.6
"look, im not typically one to support f2p games, but if you enjoyed dark sector, this will be right up your alley. it is f2p so there are microtransactions (which can be on the expensive side!) but very few non-cosmetic items are purchase-only. essentially, you can play all of the content of this game without paying a cent. (minus some color choices and various conveniences like extra weapons or warframe inventories) its primarily a pve affair, though there is the ability to go to pvp conclaves. this game is solid, mindless, space ninja fun with a lot of variety on weapons and warframes.",103.7

"great runngun, 3rd person ninja in space action game. like any mmo style game, it does get repetitive, but constant content updates and fixes make the game worth playing. ive clocked nearly 500 hours on this game since i started, and opened up my pocketbook for founders packages and other goodies--and it has all been worth it. nearly every item available for purchase with real money is also available for acquisition within the game itself, making it a truly rare mmo style game.",484.1

"this is a top noch game, made for gamers , made by gamers. so much in this, so much thought and expression is in this. i went into the game disappointed that there wasnt pvp but, after 10 minutes i forgot about pvp and was hooked on how well the co op works , brilliant game, just bloody brilliant. i love it.",230.2

"really a lot of grinding, but a lot of fun. hmu: foob ;-) *smooch*",1018.2
"its pretty, well-designed, enjoyable and has lots of lovely weapons with which you can run around doing murders for kicks. however, it is an mmo and will likely eat your soul. that said, at least it doesnt try too hard to extort money out of you with microtransactions. if you work hard, literally anything (except the founders pack, which is basically just a reskin of the old newb kit and some other, non-gameplay-affecting stuff) the game has to offer is available to you. 9.5/10 would consign life to endless grinding again",208.4

"awesome game! nothing else can resume what this game is, simply awesome. i have played this for 200+ hours already and it is simply awesome. and best of all, its a game where you can trully play free without being hindered in any way. sure, you will not get some things quite as easily, but you can still get them if you try. this game has action, speed, powers, awesome guns, ninjas, swords, axes, daggers, all the awesome things you expect from a tps (third-person shooter) sci-fi game. surely, it can get a bit repetitive if you only play missions, however, now they have installed a brand new pvp system, so, as some would say, pvp matches are never the same. with that in mind, we could say that this game lasts forever!",117.5

"robotic space ninjas with powers, i would think thats enough to say but i need to say more. it is a very addictive game very conveniant that most items you can earn or find in the various levels, bosses are unique and enjoyable, weapons range from unique to just bizarre but all are good in their own way. recommended to play with a friend for more fun and explosive mayhem.",99.8
"this game can be a pain when first starting off but gets greater and greater when some time has been put into it, like if u get put with some people with prime everything they take over and u dont get any kills to level up your weps but u still get xp for letting your friends get the kills. there are also many updates on warframe as well daily 7mb updates and each month a larger one, that can be very painful for people with slower internet speeds like i. when it comes to trading, too many people are willing to sell than buy from others witch can can be frustrating just to sell a single piece or to trade for it. but when u get up to the harder missions u can just find the part that your looking for on a hard planet. in conclusion if u have a spare couple of gbs u should download it for the gameplay.",116.2
"other key elements - create an avatar, characters speak english, have your own ship hub- can go to town hub later on if you wish or leave at you leisure, faction selection later on, class selection - 3 choices from the start, daily log in rewards, make the graphics higher or lower to let lower cpu play game, make new job classes or new weapons with blue prints with ingame money, 360 wired controller compatible, replayable missions and pvp the gameplay its a 3d realistic looking scifi thrid person shooter/mmorpg. the more you party with people, the more chance you have to survive the levels. the game will send legions of enemies at you ment for 4 people. you can solo the game but have a tougher time advancing. you can pay real cash to get items instant or use ingame money to buy blue prints to make them with parts you find in levels. you also have slots on weapons/on self to equiped abilities-lvl up to gain more points to better things. the weapon you kill enemies with gains the most experince points. the bad the only bad thing i could think of is the no skip on story cutscenes when characters start to talk, there no skip button i found to stop the replay if you failed a campaign quest. cannot do anything til characters stop talking storyline. maybe a update will erase this problem. update as i play more of the game",22.1
"this is one of the best third person shooter games iv played in a long time. it featers intense combat, great graphics, alot of variety for every play style and most importantly balance. this game balanced its pay/free aspects perfectly, you can make all weapons and warframes in the game, the only difference is you have to wait. this is really good because pay to win players have no advantages over you and you can both enjoy the game the same way. it has lots of weapons, lots of characters amazing combat and is all around an exeptional game i played it so much im waiting for them to implement more content. and still im alwase coming back for more. for a free game thats incredible, plus you will earn discounts on platnium (pay for currency) and you can get up to 75% off, iv gotten a 30$ pack for 7$ and it is worth every penny. this game is exeptional.",102.2
"this game is awesome! i just looked at the trailer and thought meh, its another shoot em up with a sci-fi look. ill get it i got it at first and started lagging. then the gameplay didnt lag a single bit. cutscenes a bit laggy. then i played the campaign with some strangers playing the game and its awesome! this game is f2p (free-2-play) so you know their will be some in-game currency that you buy with steam money, but thats comepletely optional! sometimes in the maps you have no where you are supposed to go. and, there is the solo play. ah, the solo play. its harder in solo then in online. (obviously) and when i say harder then online, i mean so hard. i cant even explain how hard it is. great story, great graphics, great gameplay, no lag in gameplay, lag in cutscenes, way too hard in solo play, in-game currency, etc. i give this game a 8/10",21.9

"the game itself is great, but it is not a third person shooter. i hope im just not verse with the controls, but by all indications it is the same as a first person shooter, please send the details of what i missed, otherwise i cant play this game but those who love this type of action will love it",0.7

"after many requests, my review for warframe is finally here. disclaimer : bear in mind that warframe is still in beta so some problems might be solved... warframe is a f2p multi/co-op online game, if trhe word f2p made you scared fear not its not as bas as it looks , the limitation of the f2p is the slots aspect (as in additional warframes or guns which you can buy since every new account has a small amount of platinum which is the in game currency) other than that everyone has pretty much the same amount of abilitites meaning you dont have to buy anything. gameplay the game has many modes and many maps , 3 types of enemies, boss battles and all of those are procedural generated. the same map wont be played twice the same, in fact the mission objective might change mid game the rooms might feel similar but they are never in the same configuration. graphics look beautiful. storywise the isnt anything new : you good guy, everyone else enemies go kill. overall this game doesnt feel f2p its professionally made to be fun and has a long replay value since maps are never never the same. i suggest giving it a try and experience yourself being the unstoppable space ninja of the future. verdict: 9/10",282.4

"warframe might seem to some a p2w game, but i havent looked it like that. sure, you can pay to get faster unlocks, instant warframes, more warframe slots, but id say the game makes up for the grinding in the amount of content. there are so many options to choose from, and while it might be boring to some to grind all the way to the best equips, it actually does help you to understand the mechanics of the game and the vast amount of different methods of clearing content. pros: +lots of options to choose from, be it weapons or warframes +customatization: everything is customizable +many, many, many different game modes +co-op play with friends +rather friendly playerbase +tutorials +combat system cons: -time-consuming, it takes a lot of time to get to the best equips available -there are a lot of pve missions, and if you want all the stuff, you gotta clear em first -some frames and weapons are naturally unbalanced -confusing at first all in all, i do recommend this game to the fans of the hack-and-slash genre and also to those who prefer sci-fi environmental fps games with variable difficulty levels.",50.0
"fun and free, what more could you want? there is too much running when playing with others but that seems to be the price for farming some levels.",120.5
"refreshingly brisk action game. be warned - the in-game explanation of the ui and game itself is  awful. you _will_ need to read the wiki pages. there is also a small drawback in that grinding out cash/items for new warframes and weapons can be extremely tedious. however, these two small issues aside, its jolly good fun. it remains to be seen how they retain interest in their playerbase, as the procedurally generated environments can be a bit samey after a while, but so far its interesting. rock paper shotgun have a clan you can join, which i intend to do shortly.",663.5

"while it can get a little grindy at times, this is by far one of the best free to play games ive ever encountered. their business model is fair and affordable should you choose to spend money on the game. take note that spending money is not required to access all game content and the rmt currency (platinum) can be traded amongst players, so even free players have access to the items in the store. the gameplay itself is fast paced, and the freedom of movement is liberating and smooth. warframe specific powers are flashy but very useful, and any warframe class is an asset in fights. i would recommend this game to anyone, even if they do not like shooters. i wasnt too keen when i first started but now im hooked! been playing it for over a year.",1055.1

"game is hard to get into but if you hook onto it you can play it for hours without a break. if you enjoy grinding games this could be a great game for you. and it isnt really pay to win since most items can be farmed up quickly and the only use for platinum would be trading for prime parts or speeding up the crafting process.",155.0

"probably one of the best free to play titles ive ever played, everything that is not a cosmetic item is available through gameplay and the best items are only available through farming. the gameplay is fast, parkour, ninja action; with a variaty of different game modes and characters available to change your style of play. if you like sci-fi, co-op shooters, with space ninjas give warframe a try. it does have a bit of a learning curve, but general chat is pretty friendly and there are enough videos on youtube to fill you in on what you dont know.",645.6

"free2play that is shaping up to be an amazing game, good aspects of the game are. 1. allowing all players to get everything in the store by running alerts wich keeps the player watching out for those run giving more content for players to do..... blizzard.... 2. the cash shop might have some people saying that its pay to win, but in fact this is not true because you are not competeing against anyone, even if the player buys a gun or armor from the shop he has to level it up. so a person bought a weapon that you are still farming for? good because he can take that weapon and help you kill the things you are killing to get the items to farm it while he is trying to level up the weapon. 3. costumization is really great, there are tons of cards that drop that allow you to costumize how the weapon performs. then you have to format the weapons and armor to suit your build, then you have paint and color, pets, ect.",957.6
"i`ve been watching this game progress and grow and it only keeps getting better and better. online connections are smooth and the players are mixed between calm, serious, or quiet, all of which have some degress of skill as well. very enjoyable game, configuration methods to suit your playstyle, easy to pick up on even if you aren`t good at shooters. the ai are challenging and use cover, you have to outsmart them to win, and there`s something satisifying about slicing a foe in half with your melee weapon... personal rating: 9.9 out of 10 - the .1 being your fingers may get tired by how long you play this game!",365.8

"cyborg space ninjas with swords, axes, staves and guns, wall-running and killing cyborg space marines, infected mutants and robots. what more do you need to try a free game? theres a lot of awesome bonuses for joining a clan (being able to build a dojo that offers you exclusive upgrades the guildless dont get) but the game ultimately falls into a realm of subtle repetition. to develop your warframes (which basically act as classes with abilities specific to each one), weapons (which are universal across all warframes, hallelujer) and even the aforementioned dojos take both a lot of time and/or real money, becoming an obvious turn-off pretty quickly. however, since the standard game is pretty god damn fun for a quick pick-up experience i can usually get over the gimped feelings i get for being miserably cheap. warframe is currently being updated pretty frequently and the company behind them seem like good folk, so if youre into games for the community, you might find a good one here.",171.1

"pros: incredibly fun. graphics are amazing. wide variety weapons and battle suits that you can choose from. interesting and well made parkour system that replaces classic stealth game dynamics. still in open beta so lots of potential despite it already being a top notch game. free to play. you can pay some money to speed up certain processes but this game is all about the grind. cons: lacks some endgame content. but by them continuously changing the game on a weekly basis i would definitely expect that to change. thats it in my opinion. just be open minded about it and realise that it is in open beta. meaning they will be fixing minor bugs every now and then.",734.9

"as others put it so very well. ninjas...in space. this exciting fast paced shoot-em up run-and-gun styled, third person squad ( or solo and anywhere inbetween) parkcour simulator will leave you with your wrist stinging from playing several hours longer then you intended. and beileve me, if you get into this you will play it untill you drop. the hours ive spent in-game were well spent. doubley with friends. it can get grindy. espeically for good weapons and warframes ( new playable characters ) but the time spent normally passes quickly ( again with friends ) and the rewards are actually worth it. my reveiw is a doubled handed thumbs up. i found the game to be action packed and intense, albeit a tad glitchy at times. but thats where the funny, funked up magic happens ( fallout players will know what i mean ) but by far, the very best part of the game that i like, is the very thing the game advertises  ninjas play free. all weapons, warframes, mods, and as you play through a year customization options are all avalible for absolutly free. the option s there however to buy it, and get it without trying. but cmon now who has fun pushing the a button to win? so in conculsion. warframe is a ninja game. a free tp play. non-pay-to-win, ninjas flipping in space action packed splosion festivel anygamer can enjoy.",514.5

"well let us start off by saying i am bad at writing reviews. as i was beggining to write this i tried to come up with some cons about warframe, but i could not do so. i gave it about thirty minutes and not even a hint of a con appeared in my mind. i would like to share my opinion on waframe before i list any pros. my opinion being that warframe is a truly amazing game. i did not think i would ever end up where i was in this game. at first i despised the idea of it, but i gave it a try. now everyday is a day of wanting to play warframe, playing warframe, and thinking about playing warframe tomorrow. people will always text me and ask me to hangout but i always say i am working or i am busy. however, i made new friends, perhaps even a family. it feels as if i have another life, a place to escape to. if that does not tell you that i love this game my current 851.3 hours will ( which will certainly be increasing ;d ). well since warframe is nothing but pros i will just settle by spitting out the larger, more positive attributes. some pros being: +great community +amazing graphics +phenomenal customization in both modding and physical appearances +certainly not a pay to win +perfect mechanics +always new stuff and fixes +joyful gameplay there is far too many pros to list, in my opinion. if you give it a real try you will probably become addicted. be ready to abandon your social life.

"*a great free to play game* i played warframe during its first months of release for around 10 hours. at that moment i felt that there was still a lack of content to keep me playing the game so i stopped. then during the 1st year anniversary of the game, there was a free gun for free so play again but i was late to login to receive the free gun :( nevertheless, the gameplay was all of the same which is good. new contents!! actually lots of it!! and neverending fun unless you run out of slots to put your warframe/weapons since you have to pay to increase capacity. so just use the free 50 credits when u start playing ^^ or jsut sell your rank 30 things :] *around 50hours played when this review was written*",64.4
"its a fantastic next-gen free to play game. the micro-transactions arent anybodies cup of tea but premium items dont get in the way of pure skill at the end of the day. its multiplayer only for now but single player looks promising, the co-op aspect of this game is great with a mix between racing too the finish and helping teammates destroy enemies or claim objectives. no pvp yet but a not so popular duel-mode is currently in place. the mission layout is expansive and pretty good to navigate through and the graphics are a treat.",85.9
"my biggest problem in warframe is that i had to grind for hours to get parts of a blueprint and find out later that the weapon just isnt effective. the gameplay is decent, but the game has nothing special to it. i recommend giving the game a try, but waiting until the developers have had more time to expand this game.",40.8

"after many requests, my review for warframe is finally here. disclaimer : bear in mind that warframe is still in beta so some problems might be solved... warframe is a f2p multi/co-op online game, if trhe word f2p made you scared fear not its not as bas as it looks , the limitation of the f2p is the slots aspect (as in additional warframes or guns which you can buy since every new account has a small amount of platinum which is the in game currency) other than that everyone has pretty much the same amount of abilitites meaning you dont have to buy anything. gameplay the game has many modes and many maps , 3 types of enemies, boss battles and all of those are procedural generated. the same map wont be played twice the same, in fact the mission objective might change mid game the rooms might feel similar but they are never in the same configuration. graphics look beautiful. storywise the isnt anything new : you good guy, everyone else enemies go kill. overall this game doesnt feel f2p its professionally made to be fun and has a long replay value since maps are never never the same. i suggest giving it a try and experience yourself being the unstoppable space ninja of the future. verdict: 9/10",282.4

"i heard about this game very seldomly and when i did it was, yeah its alright. my eyes were stupidly focused on other titles with more paid advertizing and a massive legion of fans. the thing was, those titles were either disappointing or there was some level of fun but i got bored really fast. warframe is amazing, astonishing and somehow made me like shooters again. i simply could not believe it. i was waiting for it to get bad at some point and i waited for that moment and prepared to be disapointed. the oh so this is why people dont talk about this game and it isnt a massive hit, or so this is why the critics were average on it, and finally so this is why no major mmo site talks about the game. well that moment never came. its amazing and one of the best games i have ever played. the cash shop is fair, the graphics are beautiful, better than any mmo in history for my money. the developers really care about its players. so between this, marvel heroes, and path of exile. my gaming rotation is completely made up of under rated games, the average gamer doesnt know much about. so you can have your destinys (ill pass on the pc port in march), you can keep your diablos, and indulge in your other aaa shooters and mmos. ill be playing great games like warframe.",4.7

"well, in my opinion this game was great at its start, but then, after update over update it just went.. em.. in a hideously wrong way. the gui is horrifying, and so everything else is way more complicated than it should be. theyve tried to make this game less slack, but it still has a very few gamemodes, and it lacks in maps. its just simply boring.",103.0

"well it is certainly a fun game. it focuses on loose teams of upto four players working together to accomplish a variety of goals; the assortment of weapons and armors is impressive and still growing, and the ability to customize the arributes of your armors and weapons just make it reign supreme when it comes to being allowed to do things your way. you can play it like an assualt shooting game or as a sneaky ninja game, theres even a solo mode for when you just want to have some fun all by yourself quietly. so if you enjoy co-op fps shooting, stabbing, cyber ninja games; this one is probably for you. go get them tenno!",985.7

"the game wows you with cool visuals and super slick space ninja action, but the novelty quickly wears off as the freemium model rears its ugly head. low weapon and warframe slots nearly guarantee youll need to spend money on it, and grinding for worthless weapons as well as ranking them up just to increase your mastery rank is the only thing to do mid to late game. not to mention poorly thought out events and horrible buggy messes of maps.",639.1
"in my mind, this is the best thing you can currently do for free with your gaming time, and shooter fans will love this game. it has its challenges, and its problems, mainly in the way of making new content feel new, but its a great game. so jump yourself out of your proverbial air duct, and give the game a try, you may be surprised with how much time you can lose in a game as great as this one!",1059.8

"warframe is unique. it is unique because all of the weapons and warframes are craftable and easy to obtain. most free-to-play games these days are pretty much pay to win and people who pay have an advantage over the people who dont pay. the game offers hours of fun and the satisfaction of building a new warframe is unbeatable. the enemy ai is alright and does have 1-2 bugs or glitches every so often. the wide range of guns and warframes offer more fun and playstyles to the game, be it charging head first into battle, taking a stealthy approach or using the op paris prime or synapse to decimate your foes. each warframe offers unique abilities such as absorbing damage and being nearly invincible while using the rhino, or using nova to completely kill everything in your path with her antimatter abilities. overall, the game is very fun and players are always willing to help you out, but with the ability of being a bit repetitive and sometimes boring with an op setup. i give this game 8/10. this game deserves a reccomendation.",173.6

"ive been addicted to this game last couple of days, i came back to it more than a year latter, i played in beta but gave up shortly after since there were not that many players back then. since this is my first review here it goes. first things first it free to play, free, you dont have to pay a dollar to enjoy awesomeness of this game. its not pay to win, more like pay to look badass. graphics are really well done and mission design is absolutely beautiful. (i am not a big fan of instances, but i think it works best like that for this game). fast combat, parkour skills, variety of melee and ranged weapons (swords, bows, kunais ect.), a lot of planets, countless missions, many warframes to chose from every having its own unique stile of play. game is updating every few days with bug fixes and balances, things i dislike: - better and more balanced pvp and cephalon (allow more weapons and mods). - some bugs like falling trough elevator, getting stuck in invisible hole and damn i hate when i am climbing small box or a wall and just do backflip 20 metters behind into enemy lines. - it takes decade to craft something and when you find all parts then wait 12h to 3d (its realistic trough). - too addictive. i hope this helps you decide if to download and try game yourself (that you should totally do) or not. :d",96.8
"it was pretty amazing at a time... ive sunk more than 500 hours into it. but, a lot of recent changes are really starting to ruin it. the interface is growing more cluttered and more and more nerfs are being done in the name of balance at the expense of fun. its also going to be bought by perfect world soon. warframe is very much like the titanic. it was once a fun and beautiful, a true work of art, and a marvel for its time, but now its sinking, and its not a good idea to jump onto a sinking ship.",628.3

"i was in this game for beta, so im not sure how the standard player feels about this game, but the steps its taken all the way up were satisfying and interesting every step that i could play in. while the original mod setup was fun, the trading card aspect makes it a more social kind of feel. missions are randomly generated around common tileset, positive or negative, its a feature that it is well suited to. tenno (the players class essentially) are an ancient warrior race in organic-looking powered armor, fighting a crumbling military structure and an intergalactic corporation... its actually an okay overarching theme to the third person shooter market. while the four revives thing sounds terrible, if youre playing online there will be tons of squads. teamwork is vital to solid gameplay, so lone wolves may need to spend a little time slumming it before finding a solid loadout. overall, i like this game, and definitely plan on playing it more. solid combat with simple controls at its core with a visually interesting thematic for the rest of the game. some sets are a little repetitive, but the sheer combinations of setpieces theyre putting together is staggering, and theyre always improving. play it or dont, ive said my piece on it, enjoy.",217.9

"space ninja simulator since 2013, ive been here since update 7, which was when it first hit steam in open beta. i have watched the whole game evolve before my eyes, from new weapons, frames, clans, enemies, to certain guns which used to be purchasable without payed currency or a blueprint such as the burston, a few guns being killed off like the snipetron and boar which can only be obtained by crafting it as a prime or buying a rhino pack, all the way to where we are now. all these events dont really change one thing though, the fact that its still a grind. i still havent completed a single prime anything. ive spent my fair share of money on inventory slots and orokin reactors/catalysts. still a better f2p than league",228.7

"a quick jump-in-and-play level style. unique and interesting looking characters/frames that are far enough removed from modern stereotypes and standards to be interesting and creative. the gameplay is very fun and (almost) supports several types of play. if youre playing in a pug, expect to just rush in and kill everything. but if youre playing alone, or with friends, you can stealth through the mission, sneaking up behind guys and killing them before they see you, or combining certain powers from different frames for maximum effectiveness. you can collect and equip mods which let you use one of four powers for your frames, as well as mod your weapons to have different powers and effects. you collect resources in missions that let you build new weapons that you buy the blueprints from the marketplace for, and defeating bosses or special missions gets you blueprints for frames or special weapons. theyve recently added a codex to the game which allows you to properly make a collection of every enemy type and mod so you can see more information about them and have more to work towards. the only part of this i dont understand is why platinum or buyables are so freaking expensive. it completely turns me off the concept of buying anything instead of working ingame for it because its not at all worth the amount paid. having said that, i have bought platinum, but at high discounts on various sales.",413.4

"roughtly, this game is metroid meets team fortress 2. but actually in a deeper sense, or actually in my disturbed mind, the tennos are the metaphor for the perfect society, the grineers are the metaphor of the communists, the corpus are the metaphor of the capitalists, the infected are the metaphor of the anarchists and the corrupted are probably some revoluting people that join force from everywhere across the world. twisted logic.",263.4

"warframe is game that makes other fps look inferior, its supposedly set in the future, where tenno soldiers fight grineer marines, for absolutely no unkown reason ; possibly the soverignity of the solar system. the game is also supported by microtransactions via steam. dlc from the game is ridiculous, the more you pay, the more stronger and better you are, but unless you actually put in time and effort to get the same results as the p2winners. overall, warframe can be naturally seen as a fps and p2w game, this game actually seemed more new, unlike the other modern-day fps like black ops. although the game can be seen as a p2w, rarely any time and effort needs to be put in to acquire better eqiupment since materials for blueprints are fairly easy to get. i rate this 7/10 or 70%",50.6

"i played this game before dota 2 because i thought it was such a big deal. but i have to say it suffers the same problem as watch dogs. even the story of this game is unbelievebely boring and messed up. well, it doesnt deserve to be compared with paid games but still, this game is a dissapointment.",1.4
"good game ever! weapons warframes are all awesome!",130.1
"one of the most impressive free-to-play games ive ever played. graphically impressive, with uniquely designed weapons, enemies, and characters. its a little light on story, unfortunately. also, unless you want to grind for hours for certain weapons and extra characters, be ready to fork over some real life money for some platinum (warframes premium currency).",18.8
"great gun/blade fps game.. once you get used to it... you will be hooked.",370.7
"a free action mmorpg. what more do you want? 10/10",747.3
"this game really shows off how amazing free-to-play games can really be. i look in my library, and i can just see how sexy,action-packed,and sexy this game is. new users of warframe have so much to search out for with new content being added as each month passes by. the graphical qualities are superior eye candy and the gameplay is purely exciteful. 5000/10=sexy",68.1
"love this game never gets boring awsome graphics and epic gameplay love it and best of all its free. if you like fps games then this is a definite try this game should be one of the greats in mmorpg games its amazing from its intriging gameplay and mod customizations the possibilities are endless in the way you can crush you foes with your primary, seconday and melee weapons is defintly one of the best games ive played so far. this far surpasses other games such as skyrim, final fantasy and many others hope this was helpful to all who wish to play have fun",383.3
"a fun fast pace game with a lot of wepons to try out. the mods that you can put on your warframe and wepons and really change how you play wich leave you with a lot of things to look at when you mod your stuff.",667.8
"great game, though missions start to feel samey at best",13.8
"an amazing game too good to be free to play, this game is too exciting, in a nutshell is more like: aliens - ninjas, sounds weird, but it is a great action game and a great shooter, if you want a unique experience of this kind of games, you have to have it. 10 / 10",4.6

"excellent game, i totally recomend this for players that look for an gmae with lots of action and new combat systems and a lot of diversity within all clases.",47.5
"im enjoying the gameplay so far! only complaint is not being able to easily obtain platinum in-game, but everything else is absolutely amazing! excaliburs balaned set is exactly as the warframes discription says: perfect for beginners. not only that, but im not usually very good at first or third-person shooter games, but i think im doing well in this game! vor was my definition of one bad guy you just do not wanna mess with. hes creepy, ugly, and really gets in the players head as well, to the point where you want to get rid of him once and for all, and are more than happy to do so! lotus and ortis are both very well-made supporting characters, and overall, if i had to rate this, id say 9/10. very good, and very addictive! (i laughed at myself when i kept trying missions to get a morphites, only to find i had the exact number of platinum needed to buy it! xd )",65.9
"think of your first warframe as a pizza. the first one is basic but your second one will be even better.",18.1
"tis is a great game and i love it. i recomend to just about anyone who like te cod serise but is also fine with out first person veiw. there is but one drwabck that i have found and its the fact that this game can get a little repetitive. i wouldnt play it 24/7 if you dont wana get boread. besisdes that this is one of my top faveorite games.",127.8
"this game is amazing. so addicting. movement system is really cool. 10/10",18.0
"i highly recommend this game to those who cant buy battlefield or call of duty games",21.2
"a great combination of ninja and science fiction i love it alot.",1.2
"you play as a space ninja... in space killing everything in your way.this is one of the best f2p games ive ever played since it doesnt require you to throw money at them to have fun.grab 3 friends and you will have a wonderful time.sometimes its hard to find matches alone so id say you need at least another person to really enjoy this game. i give the game 8/10.",152.0
"it wont let me play the thing on my windows 7 pc it says i have wong info i put in the right info it says wrong platform im on window 7 pc you idiots an f---------------------------+- stupid",0.3
"its different from all basic games i like it when u play warframe dont forget the break:))",131.9
"now please, before people start complaining about how much time i have spent on this game, if you have an account, feel free to find me and look at my profile, as i have over 250 hours in game. i only reactivated my account through steam as of the recent sanctuary update, but i realized, that the game is still the same grinding, pay to win  that it was two years ago when it came out of beta, onto steams open market. it was fun, for the first few weeks, when i was leveling all my gear at record speed, but then, i ran out of room to store the frames and weapons i wanted desperately. this is when the cycle begins. i made the absolute mistake of investing in this game, a quite large sum of money, that i am not willing to admit. it just kept happening, over time i sank more time, money, and effort into the game. after about four months, i quit. believe me, this was hard, but once my eyes were opened, it was like being liberated of a burden. being clean of an addiction, like meth, or heroin. to all new users who seek to play this game. dont. i played 48 hours in one week. one. week. be warned, if you are not careful, the endless vortex will suck you in. there is nothing worth it, its shiny, and good looking, but so are drugs. and dont give me that  about how drugs arent bad for you, believe me, this game will destroy you. you have been warned.",59.5
"ive tried to play, but the game keeps freezing in the launcher... ive tried downloading it straight from the website, and it gave an error login failed. check your info. i tried making a new account, deleting the certificates and re-installing them, all the known fixes, but to no avail. i am downloading it now, off steam again, and hopefully it wont freeze at the launcher.",0.3
"the guy on the cover has a hammer for a head. worth trying out.",3.9
"this game is crazy as  and very addictive :d,dont play it if you dont have hours and hours of your life to ,,waste on it :d",16.4
"even though it doesnt have much in terms of story plot compared to other games its still a rather enjoyable game, especially for f2p. only thing id critic it for is how long it takes to progress anything and with money being tight your find yourself grinding hours just to make a warframe you would like to try out maybe.",326.6
"my rocket pistol shoots a random number between ten and twenty rockets per shot in a gigantic star-shaped pattern. i have a living lightning gun. and an arc welder. also a railgun. did i mention my wolverine claws? random parts of my body and weapons inexplicably glow. my founders shirt and headband have still not arrived. i mean all hail our de overlords! 11/10, will continue throwing $140 at every three months.",193.2
"is good to entertain, very long gameplay (really no ending) and after each update it gets better is a on-going ride, a free ride and that is all what matter.",130.5
"after all these hours i guess i could give this game a definete yes to recommend the game. great sci-fi ninja 3rd person shooter. big arsenal of warframes and weapons to choose from. great customization ( stat and cosmetic wise ). undescribable amount of fun. learning curve might seem quite steep at start but its not as bad as it seems once youve played for a bit and taken the time to check out how things work. i can definetly suggest making use of the ingame codex, youll find alot of your questions awnsered by using that. the game itself has alot to it and just keeps expanding with constant small and large updates so if youre wondering if its worth your time, yes it definetly is.",1164.9
"i think that warframe is such a good game but they need it to be able to be played on mac",22.2
