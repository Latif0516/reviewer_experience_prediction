"this game is so so so awesome for me it was lagging as hell for maybe it becoz of playing on a laptop but the graph are so beautiful make me want to be out at space",14.3
"one of the best f2p games here on steam imo. if you like the fancy-looking sci-fi action third person shooters - definitely worth giving it a try.",624.7
"amazing, not well known, but very addictive. completely free if you play enough. you can loot every items you can buy.",180.5
"you start with a few hours and when you realize youve been playing long enough than you intended its usually more than half of the day is gone. was looking for a nice action mmo for months and stumbled on this one - was a lucky(or unlucky maybe) day for me. a nice mixture of melee and ranged combat. gets updated every few hours. cool sceenes and moves. wish i played this earlier. i say stop reading the comments and start playing instead. its f2p nevertheless, definitely worth it if youre into the concept -9/10.",204.2
"just call me fred durst cuz im rollin rollin rollin rollin",29.9
"9/10. this game is truly amazing. though it takes a helluva long time to get every single achievement (which i am not going for), it doesnt take away. from mercury all the way past the kuiper belt, the action and fun never stops. the best part for me is executing captain vor on mercury (im only on venus, thats why!). i reccomend for people who are checking this out.",6.7
"great game and awesome graphics, recommend it to anyone who ever played halo but wanted something better.",40.1
"i always thought that free to play games were always a ruse that would make you buy at least something in order to win. this game renewed my faith in such games. you are never forced to buy anything and its really fun to play. love the drop in and out multiplayer and it looks amazing. host movement is almost always easy and you never really lose connections. replay value is very high. there is always something going on that makes you want to play more and more.",62.0
"its a bit hard to get the grasp of the foundry and modding system at first but its well worth the task once you figure that out its smooth sailing from there it has a good survivability and technically doesnt require you to spend one cent even though its easier.",170.7
"epic ftp that for some reason is still called a beta, not really sure why, its feeling pretty polished to me.",579.0
"cyborg ninjas with guns and powers! enough said! this game offers amazing high detail graphics and well thought out gameplay. this rpg style, third person action game offers high violence and blood for all the gore feinds out there! its free, awesome, and beautiful. get it!!!!",42.7
"very fun game if you have friends to play with, but the random people you encounter can be unpredictable. also trading is very difficult and the way the item system is set up you either have to constantly farm items non-stop so you can build your upgrades, or you have to spend your entire allowance/paycheck to buy what you need.",883.0
"its a free, parkouring, 3rd person shooter (also has katanas). nough said!",28.7
"addictive, stress-relieving, and only occasionally frustrating. updates occur regularly, and the developers seem to listen to the community. new content and bug-fixes are released frequently, and ninjas play free. some content can only be purchased with platinum, but platinum can now be obtained via trading with other players, so the possiblities are limitless! it is based on dark sector, and the warrame-weilders are the spiritual descendants of hayden tenno (the protagonist of dark sector). if the idea of being a futuristic semi-robotic space ninja led by a mysterious (canadian) female of possible artificially intelligent origins is appealing to you, get ready, tenno!",879.5
"game idea is good, but bad thing that as always u need to pay money for ultra mega wtf game cash and with that ultra mega wtf game cash u buy weapons, warframes and other cool stuff.... yes u can craft them (cool stuff i mean) but for that u need to play 24/7 (i mean u need to play this game a lot) and thats what game creators want... and this trick is kinda bad for f2p game like this... so yeah, its not bad but neither its good...",1.4
"warning! do not play, you will grind for hours with no end!",527.5
"ninjas play free - warframe warframe is a fast paced online third person shooter. i would recommend to play online, but the game can be played offline too. there are challenges like bosses, levels, ranks, worlds, and many more to discover. one of the most important features are charecters and customization. the customization in warframe can make the player look advanced or cool in certan ways. the player can mainly customize there helmate, torso, arms, and legs. the player can also customize the swords color. the last feature i would like to go over is guns and bows. the guns are for people that like to go into the fight and have a strong wepon at there side. as for the bow, its way stronger and is better used at long range. but there are also crossbows that can be used at both close and long range. over all, i would rate warframe a 9/10",20.3
"if youre looking for a good free to play game. then look give this a try. the game is fun and fast pace, yeah you do the same thing over and over but doesnt mean its going to be easy like the last. with a tone of warframes to choose from that may fit you best. this game isnt connected to the steam friends list. so you have to find your friends in the game (by asking them what their name is in warframe). i doubt this helped (or is even a review) but i really do think people should at least give this a go. also power levels are bull sh*t.",145.7
"this game will rock anyones socks. may be a little complicated, but if you stick with it, you will be all set.",477.3
"fun for a while, gets repetitive. if you dont mind this kind of repetition then its a great game. i burned out and can only play it now to placate my fascist friends.",529.1
"honestly one of my favorite games ever! everytihing about this game is fun. ive been playing since upadate about 8.5 and the game has come a long way since then. my only issue is that my computer cant run it anymore after upadate 15. :,( i cri ery tim.",66.2
"if you like space ninjas and using samurai swords to forcibly dis-arm enemies, this is the game for you.",11.4
"i started playing warframe a while ago and one thing that i have found is that each update just makes the game more and more fun. even when i feel like taking a break from this game, i always am drawn back in whenever they release an update because the developer team know what theyre doing and have lot of unique ideas that make this game really fun.",547.6
"warframe allows you to select from one of many warframes to fight as, with mods and stances to enhance your weapons, warframe, and sentinels. plus there is a lot of customization available; however, if you want to customize, you will have to use platinum for most things like colors and armor, which means you have to fork over real money. it is free to play if you are happy with just a couple of warframes, but youll be too addicted and have to puchase additional warframe slots and weapon slots and this means real money. i still highly recommend this game. it has a bit of a learning curve, but once you get onto it, it becomes easy to understand. plus the community is a great aspect, there are in-game chat rooms for region (general chat in your geographic region), recruiting (where you can join other games or recruit for your clan), and trading (which allows users to buy, sell, or trade items). and the developers host numerous interactive events like primetime which puts two of the developers in a mission with real life players and other watch the feed on twitch, and the devstream which features several of the developers talking about the game and upcoming changes. both allow users to submit questions and win free platinum.",827.8
"fun free-to-play game that can be more fun with friends. you have to grind a lot for certain things, unless you want to just but them. plus space ninjas that should be enough of a reason to play this game.",571.0
"shoot the  out of some aliens and explode people into cyber bite size bytes and die",155.5
"great game, especially for the ps4. it has great movment and the combat flows perfectly",1.2
"this game is awesome, warning, very time consuming, and very addictive",239.1
"terrible, i couldnt even play 3 minutes without it crashing. screw waiting through that 10 minute intro again...",0.2
"given time ,this game has the potential to be the best,great developers who interact with the players as well as weekly content, time constantly evolves the game making it much better when it first released and in the future,much better than it is now. good game with a briliant future.",811.1
"this game is like a rain drop from heaven! #bestgameever!!!",399.0
"dont like the controls that mutch but the rest is awesome.",247.0
"grind so you can grind so you can grind so you can grind so you can finally use a macro to let the game grind by itself. also saryn isnt real and wont sit on your face.",56.8
"warframe is an amazing game especiall as its free! i have had great fun on this game and will for a long time to come, totally recomend it.",77.9
"great graphics, addictive gameplay, but... the annoying glitches are everywhere which make me fall through the map!! needs a bit more bug fixes rather than constant updates on new weapons and warframes. but overall a great game!",66.1
"fantastic graphics, mechanics, and storyline. fun to play with friends, strangers, or solo.",116.3
"ever played mass effect 3 multiplayer? this is very similar, except it most of the game modes are more akin to dungeon runs than static defense. that being said, shooty stabby space ninja super funtime is quite entertaining. very fast paced gameplay.",588.9
"for the reason i dont know how to write the review",158.4
"it never ever lags, its completely free, it will keep getting better as you play it, there is so much more than just the trailers and pictures. what can i say, get it! its awesome!",234.3
"this is ing awsome!!!!!!!!!!!!!! wait till update 14 and start playing. i demand!",664.1
"horribly repetitive grindfest with most of the interesting gameplay locked away behind grind or paywalls. do not play unless you like to get lost in huge mission environments built from generic pieces, unsure of where to go next. then do it again 5 times. graphics are nice but definitely not enough to redeem it.",5.1
"warfram seems fun, it is packed with action and gameplay mechanics are cool. if i post anything that is not true, then my only expainationion is that i only played the game for 3.1 hours. the graphics are great and the ability to take a stelth approach or a action approach is quite supported by me. being able to fuse mods is becoming useful and the color options for your weapons adds some costumization to the game, although, so far i have not been able to change the color of my charactor and end up meeting color palette swapped players. another compaint is that at the begining, everything is very easy, perhaps making it a little more challanging would increase my intrest in the game. and the ability my charactor has allows him to strike forward with a swing of a holographic sword, whitch to me seems overpowered because of instead doing some complex parkour, i ended up skipping across everything. overall warframe is a good game so far and is gonna have some improvements. so if anything in this review is off, then remember that this game is in beta and ive only played it for 3 hours. so please message me if you want to give me spoilers. see yah",11.0
"this game is really fun. best third person shooter game in my opinion. 10/10",1.4
"this is a great free game ive spent so much time playing this game that my real life problems just seemed to disapear. such as money, women, and activeness. this game is an amazing looking game that when i feel like going outside i just go on the earth map and stare at the sun but for not to long because i dont want to go blind. the relistic feeling about being outside is really amazing that it hurts less that i havent left my house in 3 years. but overall this game is amazing it would be awasome if i had people to play it with but everybody just isnt as cool as me.",550.5
"i enjoy the game in an overall sense, but i think it would be better as an fps instead.",2.5
"really stunning gameplay, although instructions were unclear. i ended up with my  in a blender, help me. other than that, amazing game. 10/10 would play again and again and again",6.5
"i started playing this game for relaxation and rest from other frustrating games. the game is technically improved quite a lot, but as i reached greater experience in the game i realized that one problem still has not changed! the problem is, crashing in the middle of a game. its not a big problem if you are a beginner, but someone who works void survival 70 min + is very annoying and frustrating. regarding of such problems they did nothing, because if you crash after you will gain nothing. which means besides games enemy difficult you have to worry about whether the game will crash again. and generally it is not pleasant after 78 min of your game, you do not get anything. it is sad that this problem after so much time is not resolved! just because this, i do not recomend game because a lot of time your just grind and waiting items to be built!",1207.6
"p.s. i suggest you to try the game first..... game not bad, graph good, game play for  but it is ok, too much glitch but still ok. but this game started to kill as after 5 day playing. 1-3 hour a day every night and all we did, hmmm nothing we did 12 time 1 stage 9 times second, 11 times next then we wanted weapon we go back for farming and all this about is tooo much grinding! you must do one stage over over over over and over again, or you can get premium and you get all. so if you are ready to grind all your life off then go ahead or if you dont have place to put your money in, you are welcome =)",7.7
"it kept glitching out on me, and i would fall through the floor. other than that, it looks great, albeit a bit confusing",87.6
"warframe is a free to play game where you can play co-op up to four players or solo if you wish. really great games and a lot of customization for different play styles and it gets updated constantly which is always a good thing. you play as a space ninja wizard with guns, exploring different planets in the solar system, obtaining minerals, blue prints and mods to create your character build and craft new weapons and make new warframes. after playing for 68 hours im still having fun so thats saying something. i still have not explored all the planets yet. overall, i really enjoy the game and love that the game gets updated with new content so frequently.",104.3
"this game got boring and repetetive very fast. it uses the tactic of just throwing a lot of enemies at you and hope for the best. it is free, so no real loss if you still want to try it, but i don`t think it is worth anyones time.",0.5
"its pretty good for a free game graphics wise and a large variety of missions/quests in which you can travel far distances to other planets in the solar system hopefully they will add even more soon. this game could have a good future ahead of it.",114.3
"what a game! simple coop but intriguing play-and-craft style.",192.3
"its the best free-to-play shooter available-even better than cs, cod or bf4. its a ninja gaiden theme type of game except the setting is in space and planets with beautifully detailed and dynamic environments. the models and weapons are well designed and stylish. you can spring, slide, wall-run, and do some amazing maneuvers just like a ninja would. perhaps its best feature is the four-player cooperative gameplay so you can play with friends. each warframe has different skills/abilities. choose what fits your playstyle.the game is essentially about collecting loot and components, such as weapons, warframes, mods (which make you stronger). it has crafting and trade system.",0.7
"at first glimpse warframe is an amazing fps experience. its fluid and highly customizable. the clan structure and method of pulling drops together motivates team play. one of the best fps games i have played to date.",14.4
"its a really fun free-to-play type game where you can unlock everything for free if you have the time and patience to do so or you can support the game by buying it now. (not a big fan of pay 2 win games but i dont really mind). if you have some time off i recommend this game to play with a friend or three and do some missions and/or some defense missions to level up fast(er). also remember to press g to mark moudels and stuff like that :)",18.3
"pretty decent f2p game and there arent many that dont take sniffs at your wallet. this is one of them and for its base game without spending a cent its a pretty fun game. give it a shot its only 4gb, nothing to lose!",22.3
"warframe is a very unique sci-fi third person action shooter game. you play one of many different warframes each with their own unique abilities and looks. your main weapons consist of a primary weapon (usually a rifle) and a secondary weapon (usually a pistol). but you also have your sword in which has fast paced hack-n-slash action. mix all of these together with equally fast paced gameplay, satisfying loot drops, and deep weapon and skill leveling and you have one hell of a fun sci-fi game. this game is absolutely addicting. its so much fun, i would recommend this to everyone. free to play? cant beat that!",19.3
"this game is a phenominal cooperative experience. i havent had this much co-op fun since perfect dark for the n64 back in the good ol days. this game genuinely surprised me, dont be fooled by the graphics. the game runs absolutely flawless on most computers despite having beautiful realistic visuals. im running the game on full 60fps with 0 lag and 4 bars of connection with only a $400 asus computer with intel i5 and 4 gigs of ram; you dont even need to have a gaming computer to experience this game fully. this game is awesome.",89.9
"an interesting blend of platforming and third person shooting that is constantly evolving, thanks to an active community and a development team that communicates with said community. i look forward to seeing where its going, as well as helping it get there!",784.4
"it is a good game with excellent dynamics with a good addition as of the middle of the battle and the mobility of the characters and do not forget about mods to all weapons and armor that makes the game more exciting",506.5
"amazing game friendly players when online! but you will have to get used to the controls lol.....",7.8
"very good game still need alot updates more  but very fun do and if it wasnt for half the  you need to buy it be better and if also wasnt so laggy sum of time im blame my laptop for it do it be great game need focus on the clan and story line also even if its mmorpg still need focus on the stuff that lacking most of it beening on the weapons and mods need new unique mod and if each warframe can have unquie skill that make stand out the rest of the other warframe it be awesomer",237.9
"i find this game to be a solid alright its a time sink (majorly), it takes around 2-3 days to make a new warframe(new class) after collecting all the pieces. unless you pay for the warframe then you get it automatically, you may like this game if you like leveling up, playing the same maps which may get repetitive, farming. i give this game a 7/10, it is a time sink but it can get highly repetitive.",70.0
"awesome game love that i get a bow to do headshots with!!",325.3
"i played this on xbox one first and i got hooked. even though you cant cross console your account it shouldnt bother you. i enjoyed starting a new character. i got to try out the mag and i must say that im not disappointed. this game is not a pay to win like people will tell you. it does give you a slight advantage because you can just buy your way through. however, nothing is more satisfying then going through the game getting the materials to build what you want. patience is a virtue and this game requires a good bit.",19.1
"warframe is really fun because i really love third person games",1.3
"this is an awesome game that i recommend everybody to download and play, since i just cant get enough of space ninja parkouring and all other stuff you are able to do here, i dont see any reason not to download this game",619.0
"too many times i have approached a game and found that the stress on pvp is over done and there is no way to play with the same feel and not have to worry about long term players or bots. warframe changed all this for me. a shooter game with more than one twist i fell in love almost immediately. the lore is limited (they are building on it as we speak, its in an exciting phase) and it does look pay to win... on the surface. it is not. the crafting is a secondary feature of this game. its a something to do with the parts and the materials you gain. ive lost count of the number of frames ive stumbled over the resources for and the amount of weapons ive crafted because they look like a bit of fun. if you think the focus of the game is to be completionist and own all the things... then youve missed the point. the point is to play, and play you can. warframe runs you through an ever increasing series of different mission types from the need to stealth missions to succeed, to defense, attack and outright destruction. they listen to their fanbase and the game grows through the love from the fans and the developers. winner of mmobombs mmo of the year (2014) something has to be going right here. for those that love the thrill of the fight, to fantasise on their own lore as the game develops and to watch an already fabulous beta blossom into greater things, this is the game for you. grab your rifle and your sword and get to killing things.",567.4
"i think this is going to be a good game like destiny.",2.5
"takes a while to get the hang of it but is very fun",360.8
"games really fun and cool but if you dont want to spend real money on new weapons and warframes, be prepared to play for a looooong time",10.8
"destroy the evil worshippers of jesus with your hindu kush. poem time: evil worshippers of jesus destroy with hindu kush",12.2
"warframe, definitely one of my all-time favourite games. the graphics are awesome, comparable to those of next-gen console games. with almost 200 hours on record and at least spent $100 on in-game currency. of course, one of my biggest problems with this game is that the farming takes soooo long! if you want to get some of the higher end stuff, then youre going to need a lot of time on hand. and i mean a lot!",241.5
"it takes a long time to level up and upgrade, but its amazing either way, good game overall.",2.9
"its a great game. not too easy, but also not too hard. its a simple and not complicated game. you go in missions, kill, loot, upgrade and tune your warframe. if you dont want an over complicated system of tuning, fun with friends and a great shooter with some melee counter-part, warframe is exactly that.",71.4
"ever wondered what it might be like to be a ninja in space? me either, but this game shows that its possible.",100.4
"this game is just amazing. content + space + ninjas + kickass weapons + zombies + aliens + robots = a ing brilliant game = warframe",351.9
"imagine this as halo 3, but with more customization and in 3rd person.",132.7
"this game is a very very very muthain exiting and thrilling game leaving you on the edge of your goddam seat and the graphics/visual effects are equivalent that of in sex. these visuals so good, make you wanna slap yo momma *whack* (samuel l. jackson approves this review)",247.9
"great for people who like: sci-fi environments having alternate characters fast paced action learning advanced mechanics color customization guilds/clans loot grinding for rarer items horde modes not recommeded for people who like: a story driven campaign (i believe this is under fruther development) playing solo (without random other players or friends) a melee-only game (while possible, its not easy) exploring every bit of a map (most groups prefer to run through missions/levels)",164.7
"a fast-paced, action packed sci-fi/alien warfare type game with only 1 mission: eliminate al enemy forces and unlock most planets in various solar systems. the makers have created parkour for your benefit to get around faster. thumbs up",49.1
"it always says i need a account, i tried to make a account but it would never send a verifaction email. i c0ntacted support but they didnt respond. waste of space",0.1
"get this game its ninjas in spaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaace",28.5
"grindy and repetitive. huge content curve from beginner introductory levels to when you get to the planets you actually need to farm for weapons and characters (known as warframes). the 3 intro characters arent that interesting, the most interesting characters will take you hours upon hours to farm materials for and literal days to research and build them in-game (game uses real time for crafting) and the pay2win gate to skip all of this incredibly expensive, unfortunately there is probably a half-decent experience past the ridiculous initial curve but it just wasnt interesting enough on its own to warrant my time. if you enjoy grinding and repetitive shooting or just grinding in general, i would recommend this. otherwise, stay away. (note how all the positive reviews are people with 300+ hours played)",5.6
"free game to pass the time. basically a pve instance shooter with up to 4 people. kind of restricted unless you spend real money, but you still have access to everything with a bit of a grind.",50.9
"warframe is possibly the best free to play game out there. this game offers a monotonous experience for those who love the grind, that will leave you amazed at how replayable it is. i find myself coming back to it month after month as they continue to add more content. its free. what do you have to lose?",338.4
"space ninja`s, katanas, controller support, parkour! dis game is the best! 1,000/1,000 ponies! ~ =d",1.0
"an awesome game, great control, interactive, awesome arsenal, and not to mention the the great level design and graphics. would reccomend this game to everyone who likes hoard like attacks and sci-fi like games.",12.4
"so i slid into a man, i tripped him and he proceeded to fly in the air. 10/10",61.2
"graphics and gameplay are both really good , micro transactions are a little expensive though.",82.2
"fun for a while, then it just gets repetitive. same maps and modes over and over. then there are times you cant beat a mission because theres no one else playing it. no storyline to speak of and no tutorials. this game has a steep learning curve to do anything other than point and shoot. lots of potential but thats about it. weapons and warframes cap at 30 and still feel rediculously weak when all modded out and fighting enemies half your level. game balance needs a lot of work. leveling up just doesnt feel that rewarding. it reminds me of wow in all the wrong ways, but its worth playing for a few days if you are looking for a free to play, i have seen worse. sadly though i dont see any reason to spend money in the game. after getting everything to lvl 30 and getting my but kicked on some difficult missions with enemies half my ldevel i am glad i didnt spend any money. could be a lot more fun if the devs worked on the game itself and not dumbing down the graphics on the level selectiuon screen! i saw a video of what it looked like at the beginning of 2014 and it was way better than it is now. the level selection screen is one of the most basic and boring interfaces i have seen simply due to poor layout. enough bashing it though, thats the worst of the game, it plays well and it only gets repetitive after putting in 20+ hours, so its good fun at first. maybe it will get fun longer to join a guild and play with more people.",126.0
"its darn good for a free to play title, and it does that excellently as well. pick it up!",34.9
"are you a space ninja? do you want te be a space ninja? have you ever had a weird fantasy involving space, ninjas and maybe a couple of digestive biscuits? if so, look no further than halo rea.. i mean warframe. with advanced sliding phisics, over 2 melee weapons and hundreds of bullets at your disposal, this game is really a revolution in dungeon crawling. i would highly recommend this game, to all players of literally any type of game, because if you dont like space ninjas, you probably dont like life.",569.0
"what can i say one of the best free2play games ive come across scince star trek online it has imo aaa graphics which seems to be very well optimized.i will admit i havent played fro long but i would say try it as its free.if you like sci fi and manga style battle suits you will love this.",1.9
"fast paced third person shooter, it is by far a rather interesting and fun game to play, playing basically as a ninja in space is truly something",240.4
"love this game, fun and smooth controls! you can really do some crazy acrobatic moves with enough practice :) you can craft everything in the game, you dont have to pay a single penny! its free! try it out!",187.2
"great pve n ocasion update . one of the best free tps",411.7
"this is probably the best free-to-play game that i have ever played. 999999999999 / 1",870.0
"game play its fun, and updates continue to add to that fun. just be ready to spend a couple of bucks if you dont like to wait for stuff.",703.5
"warframe is a very nice looking game with pretty decent performance compared to the graphics, this game may take some time to get used to but in the end it will become very fun there are lots of items to craft and collect and lots of weapons and warframes to choose from. 8.5/10",86.1
"its got ninjas and their cyborgs n . 8/8 fun when theres no fun on another game.",46.6
"dont trust the critics and the metascore this game is awesome as heck! you will need a decent rig to play it though. most addictive game in a while!",18.6
"though the game is pretty much about futuristic ninjas, theres rarely too much stealth going on when your special skills involve unleashing antimatter bombs, flash-avalanches, tornados, or a whole variety of of other destructive forces. however, this is hardly a drawback since its implied youre a ninja only because you operate in small team of one to four people with amazing parkour skills and adaptive combat abilities. the game offers a giant selection of weapons, both melee and ranged, varying from simple swords to powerful electro-whips, and basic earth guns to alien-forged artifacts. given the wide variety of characters, weapons, and customizable features, its hard not to make this free-to-play game endlessly entertaining inwith friends or even solo.",31.5
"the problem with this game is simple: it never feels like youre progressing, because every step you take just opens more and more meaningless grind opportunities, and every update just piles more and more to it, be a new frame, weapon, mod or resource. that there are mods so essential to your progress locked behind a shit of a rng is one of the most stupid and hostile gameplay designs i have encountered. add to that the gameplay changes they do every now and then, nerfs that make your already  weapons completely useless, changes to damage types and values, new weapons that completely outclass the previous ones, new resources that require more grinding, etc... and it all becomes meaningless and disheartening. and if you want to play solo youre in for a world of hurt with so much grind, rng locked content and 4 player balanced missions, a lot of then required to unlock new planets and with it, resources. its not worth it, so i stopped playing. nothing changed, nothing got better or made the game more fun or less of a chore (quite to the contrary), most of my playtime was spent trying to get the essential mods so that my weapons become useful enough to kill waves and waves of enemies quickly for me to solo through the missions and unlock new planets, where i would repeat the same process, while slowly gathering resources and blueprints to craft a marginally better weapon or frame that would become useless by the next update. rinse and repeat, ad infinitum.",253.4
"would be perfect if it had a single player/campain option",8.8

"warframe is unique, in many good ways and in many bad too. the premise of the game itself is brilliant, space ninja-samurai that fight robot-men and plauge beasts, its radical and filled with flashy effects that youd expect from a third person shooter mixed with a spectacle fighter, with an interesting and in-depth lore to boot its hard to fault warframe for what it offers and the price it offers it for, free. there is however something to note, warframe features a cash shop that allows you buy anything within the game for platinum, your platinum account is charged by real world money and doing so gives you a huge boost within the game, i want to stress though that everything, every single item can be gained in game without the use of platinum. to do so though, makes the game a massive grind. starting solo and venturing into the game for the first time, my personal experience was that this game truly comes close to forcing you to have to pay for some item to break up the norm of running the same mission over and over again in order to gain new weapon upgrades, before spending any money on the game i was on my way to gaining my prime warframe, but purchasing a pack of platinum surpassed all build times, item requirments and even allowed me to double my modification slots. a great, free game that becomes grounded by a borderline questionable payment methods, if you can deal with the occasional grind, its well worth it. and i can totally deal with the grind.",471.9

"i simply love the game ! stunning graphics , great frame roster , lots of ablilities , teamwork means a lot ! a great variety of landscape, hi-tech maps to the ancient remainings of the earth, many kinds of mobs , lots of weapons : from the deadly close range shotgun to the 1-shot-kill sniper , to the ninja weapons : bow , crossbow , hikou (aka shuriken) , kunai ... many kinds of melee weapons : from the basic sword , to the double axe , the scythe , even throw disk (aka glaive). the mods you add to those weapons are simply terrifying! it takes a while to upgrade the weapons and get the mods , but the result is deadly (for the poor enemies that are forced by the ai to attack you... many get so scared that they get stuck just to prolong their short life spam , which is kind of annoying , mostly in survival and defense missions). simply put : marvellous ! i havent even begun to talk about the melee weapon stances - which give you formidable combos ! pack that with a bow , kunai / hikou and sets of mods at each of them and you are the perfect ninja assassin ! this game deserves 10/10 in my opinion , obviously there are many features i havent even mentioned , you should go find them out for yourself ! meet me in game : x3quan8",21.9

(like arena fights for instance) maybe a little vehicle warfare... (space ninjas on hoverbikes would be the bees knees).. the current maps that are playable in the game make for good instances but a more open world approach would help bring more gamers to the scene without question.",943.8

"after many requests, my review for warframe is finally here. disclaimer : bear in mind that warframe is still in beta so some problems might be solved... warframe is a f2p multi/co-op online game, if trhe word f2p made you scared fear not its not as bas as it looks , the limitation of the f2p is the slots aspect (as in additional warframes or guns which you can buy since every new account has a small amount of platinum which is the in game currency) other than that everyone has pretty much the same amount of abilitites meaning you dont have to buy anything. gameplay the game has many modes and many maps , 3 types of enemies, boss battles and all of those are procedural generated. the same map wont be played twice the same, in fact the mission objective might change mid game the rooms might feel similar but they are never in the same configuration. graphics look beautiful. storywise the isnt anything new : you good guy, everyone else enemies go kill. overall this game doesnt feel f2p its professionally made to be fun and has a long replay value since maps are never never the same. i suggest giving it a try and experience yourself being the unstoppable space ninja of the future. verdict: 9/10",282.4

"i really love warframe. it is challenging and easy to use with practice . love the visuals .. usually im alittle slow in these type of war games and get stuck alot. but this one is the best.",41.7
"it is a very fun game but gets boring after a while. also, if you do not have a fast enough processor, it will lag like hell.",4.1
"it looks very hard to play.i think we need some tutorials in game to learn us how to play it. thank you :) btw the game is awesome",3.6

"i own almost 300 games on steam and i play warframe all the time instead. 10/10",668.5
"this game really struck a chord with me. it seems to be just the right blend of mmo and co-op shooter. excellent developer, excellent engine with superb performance even on my old hardware (gtx 660ti). engaging melee combat and gunplay, combined with an insane amount of customization through the ccg-like mods system really makes every battle a fun fight. mmo elements can be too grind-heavy for some, especiialy if youre one of the they will get my money from my cold, dead hand type of free-to-play player. if youre willing to drop some cash though, that whole thing is not a factor. player clan (guild) dojos can also be built, which definitely make you feel like you have staked a small claim in the game universe. its lore, while a bit underwhelming, is excellent when it is there. i could go on for a while with smaller details, but why still read when you can try it for free*! *not free as in path of exile",118.0
"dont get attached. the game is great. its amazing. i love it to pieces and then some. the devs are tight with the community. things are worked on left and right, up down, sideways, constant update practice weekly for bugfixing and reinforcements (weapons and cosmetics). as of july 2nd, 2014, perfect world entertainment has bought outstanding shares from digital extremes the clock is ticking. things are going to be looking very dark from here on out.",847.3
"it is awesome the graphics are sweet and you get to play online or by yourself try this game it is also free.",31.7
"really good game well put together. i found this game to be a lot of fun really well put together for a free to play game not all f2p games are this well thought out. down side if you play with someone who has cash to spend you may be a bit put off at how fast there growing and how slow your growing, but this is to be said for most if not all f2p games. i say play and have fun doing so.",21.7
"almost same map,same enemy,same missions.annoying shiny flash visual effect kills my eyes.class,skill system is not so mach fun cause almost anything is same.you need so many time to get weapons ,money,exp but not worth.and enemy has bunny ears.bunny ears.",530.4

"slow on start up, but once you start to experience middle and late game content, it becomes incredibally addicting. devs are great and listen to the community and they add constant updates to fix small and large problems alike. 9/10",1018.6
"some what repetative game at times when you have played it 1000+ hours but its worth it, its a 1-4 co op game with some pvp features such as duals and so on. it has fun clan features like clan dojo that can be built by clan members. there is a lot of choice between weapons and warframes (classes). but the most interesting thing about this game is that it is not p2w instead event 2 win and the updates come faster with new content than any game out there also this game requires you to work hard for the best items and frames in the game through skill and cooperation with others.",306.8
"its the better version of destiny. all jokes aside, this is one of the best games ive played. what really sets this game apart is the flexability of each warframe (aka class/champion/specialzation) and allows a degree of customization that melts the minds of lesser primates. the beginning can slightly overwelming, as you learn how to master your equipment but the player base is always willing to help. there is not a massive pile of strategy involved; good synergy with teammates is more important and tends to be more fun. theres a lot of spaces to see, lots of enemies to trample underfoot and a whole solar system to lose yourself in. ill see you there.",1113.9
"really awesome game! i wish i found the right people to play with... but overall really awesome! i really enjoy all of the new things they keep bringing in...",234.8
"excellent graphics for free game and is getting content regularly",20.5
"when it comes to discussing warframe, i can say a lot of stuff. i can mention a refined game system, which updates even further over time. i can praise the developers, who obviously love the game they create and are fast to bring us the new stuff. i can say that warframe is the first game that attracted me with its unique style. but the thing that i love the most is the setting lore - well, its scattered parts, which are brought with every new update. the lore is by far the most original thing in the game: how about a well mixed coctail made of space adventures, roman and japanese culture? dont forget the feeling of waking up in a cryocapsule and realising that there are very few left of your nation, if any, and everyone else in the universe hates you.",942.9
"there is no freaking audio, and on top of that it took over 6 hours to install, not to mention that no thanks to this piece of crap game, i have to spend another three hours installing it, just to fix the audio. it is only this game, not the others that i own. fix this and i might write a better review.",1.4
"could only get better if you could wipe out a planet of ethiopians. its okay though they will starve anyway.",8.1
"one of the greatest free to play shooter games grinding is a big part of the game but if it wasnt their would only be maybe 200-275 hours of gameplay and it would be over altho its not as bad as grinding in say planet side 2 where it takes months upon months of playing to get your first new weapon also you can get ever item that has an actual use ingame with just credits earned ingame plus if they didnt make people want to use real money to buy stuff they wouldnt make a profit to advance the game and keep making cool updates and you cant forget ur a freaking space ninja on the brink of extiction doesnt get much better than that",1211.1
"havent played much at all but this game look and feels really cool overall, i like the style of play and would highly reccomend friends to download this game",8.6
"good game for free to play with fun and interesting combat and teamplay but it has several severe flaws which are that it has a bad payment model, things are overpriced and you are required to buy more slots for warframes and weapons i u want more then two. secondly the game becomes very repeatitive and there is not very much metagame. the last thing is that it is very difficult to get interested in this game starting off due to its repeativeness.",314.0
"nice game , graphics and action , extreme pakrour like me haha xd",213.3
"the best way to describe warframe, would be space-gun-fighting-ninjas with over 20+ playable chericters, hundreds of weapons, and countless coustomizatations for both. warframe is a perfect alternative to the standard gungame. not to mentation all the team baised play that takes place in the game.",1001.6
"i played warframe for a little bit. i have to say it really spoke to me and was great fun with my friends, going on missions, fight, explore, and get loot, and whatnot. i liked the playability of the frames, how they moved and how you could do some interesting parcour-like tricks with them. i liked the cards that you could slot in your armor and weapons to modify how your warframe operated, and i especially liked finding new cards so you could upgrade and do all that good build-stuff. after a while though (i say this after some 20+ hours of play), the combat got really boring, repetitive and just didnt feel like there was any point to it. the missions, environments and loot is pretty much always the same, you cant really do anything with your money, dont get me started on the leveling system, and if you want to craft and upgrade, you have to heavily invest your time into it (or bust out the ole credit card). and maybe thats the problem, i just dont have the time or patience to keep grinding missions and doing events. i feel like i would have liked this game when i was 15 to 18 years old, when i had the stamina to just keep doing the same mission after repetitive mission. as it stands, i dont like the game because the challenge to me seems to be a test of how much time youre willing to spend getting minimal rewards and character growth. so its a no from me. i dont recommend this game.",22.4
"its a very very very good game the first few hours are abit  but when you get into the game and start understanding the game [i suggest watching some videos] you will love the game and as far as the free2play part of this game is, in the game you can get all the weapons and warframes everyone has access to all the weapons and warframes the premium currency is plat and if you dont buy plat you can still get the same stuff as other people it requires a blueprint and the items to craft it and theres a crafting time weapons take 12-24hr and warframes take 3days if you buy things with plat you avoid all those steps and the item is just added to your inventory. i see no pay2win in this game theres only a tiny bit with cataylist and reactors but they are alerts for them all the time.",270.3

"really fun. and free. it sucks when playing with randoms who wont revive you so, playing with friends is a must.",71.3
"extremely repetetive grind festival and a money grab as well. game is quite un-enjoyable with at least some basic stuff bought with real cash. after that it is quite playable, untill you are bored of the repetetive gameplay. you end up unlocking all systems in the game (youll be bored before that) and grinding the same, most lucrative missions over and over and over again, to unock best mods and lvl up. and to lvl up you need new weapons and warframes (characters). to do that you need to grind more, or pay more, etc. basically never ends. it all depends on you. wether you dont care if you do same thing all over again like a machine... graphics wise, it looks awesome with physx and settings on max. but it is easier to play with those effects turned off, as particles can cover up whole screen with lighthing effects. depends on you. initially a good game, but the art style is very basic and un-naturall. all characters look like ugly union of a robot and a bug. it all holds up, its just a matter of preference. the random map generator is not worth the mention. you will quickly remember all the areas that are showing up. they just connect in different places (maps consist of series of blocks, which are semi-random).",89.3

"for being in an open beta stage, warframe is an amazing game to play. it is really fun, but sure, it takes some time and effort to get into it, that is if you craft or earn everything. in some aspects, people can view it as a pay-to-win kind of game, but people tend to craft more than buy (besides blueprints). you can craft every single item in the game too, and some of which you can craft, you cannot buy. but anyway, i am not about to go into a full depth description of the game. to make a long story short, warframe is awesome.",369.2

"like all free to play games, there is a catch. you cant get any new warframes without spending money on this game (at least from what i have seen playing it). you also have a limited arsenal, again, unless you pay. that alone is what i do not like about this game and it was enough for me to stop playing nearly instantly after i started.",4.9
"i remember trying this game a while ago and not finding it my type of game. something about it just didnt click (possibly the weird art style). then my friend told me to give it another try, and with this second try i got hooked. at first glance it looks like a simple run n gun game, but it is much more than that. one of my favorite parts of this game is how modding works. many weapons seem average at first but once you know how to mod them correctly, they become unstoppable. and then the fun starts. fully auto shotguns with higher fire rate than most assault rifles, grenades that explode into toxic/electric/fire/younameit aoe, and bows that shoot 2 arrows at a time, explode when they hit and also pin enemies to walls (but not before cutting them in half). you really can get crazy with stuff in this game and i cant wait to see what they come up with next. game is also regularly updated with an amazing and helpful community.",291.8

"this is honestly one of the best games ive ever played. ever. it has a very good play style, upgrades that fit every style of player, and graphics that can make many good gaming computers gasp. it is still in development, which means there will be changes and improvements, but that just makes me more excited since it means the game should only get better! ive put in quite a bit of time with this game, and ive been playing since the beta release. i fully recommend it. it is a ftp that is better than most games ive bought. it supports single players, but is so much fun with a group of friends! the best part is there is no catch with the free part, it really is all free. the only thing in-game you would ever need to spend money on are aesthetics. there is no content that you would ever need that you have to spend money on. the developers are pretty on the spot when it comes to fixing problems and updates come regularly. they also do frequent livestreams to keep players up to date on upcoming fixes and content. if you are even just a little curious about this game, give it a try! i dont think youll regret it!",994.5

"one of the best free games ive played so far. it gives you the choice of 1 of 3 warframes and from there it sends you right into the tutorial, and part of the story, picking up the basics and weapons. after the initial tutorial, it continues to help you understand the other parts like modifications and upgrades, all based around the story. now the combat is purely amazing, from stealthily murdering everything bow and arrow or go in rushing with a rifle to mow everything down, whatever way you want to play, the game lets you. overall 10/10 for what the game is supposed to be.",21.2
"its good fast paced action with a multitude of weapons and characters to play. most stages will keep you on your toes and really test your ability with your reflexes and often your ability to cooperate with other people should you chose to go at it multiplayer. game is fun and really lasts a good time on ya. the only negative about the game to me is the build times on new weapons or warframes that you want to play, apart from that its a great game.",537.3
"most graphicaly detailed mmo ive ever seen. love the game play. having a sword and bow in space is a fun new spin. i found that the mouse sensitivety is more sensetive than a menstrating teenage girl who was just dumped on prom night, even after i turned it down almost to zero. this gives the illision of extreme lag which can piss you off. everything is also shaped weird, as in enemies and such. like there armor is plated over bursting tummours which have serverly deformed them, but this keeps the game interestin and fresh. runs pretty smoothly.",2.6
"warframe, definitely one of my all-time favourite games. the graphics are awesome, comparable to those of next-gen console games. with almost 200 hours on record and at least spent $100 on in-game currency. of course, one of my biggest problems with this game is that the farming takes soooo long! if you want to get some of the higher end stuff, then youre going to need a lot of time on hand. and i mean a lot!",241.5
"as free to play it can get very repetitive and boring trying to collect components to make new guns but the gameplay is very solid and it is a refreshingly new take on mmo shooters. updates are quite promising as well.",34.9
"defintely the best game i have played on pc and is even up in the top 10 for my playstation. the best part is, well there isnt yet because it is in beta. it is going to be one hell of a full release.",5.9
"great game. worth putting the time and effort into. the game gives a different atmosphere of gameplay, something that you will want more and more of. theres alot of stuff to do ingame. you have dojos (clans) which u can customise fully however you like. you also have a handfull of great weapons to choose from and customize at will. theres a great community backing the game too. also the developers at warframe are very good, they are very helpful for whenever you need them e.g. technical issues and wateva else. they bring great content to the game every so month or season like xmas, easter and so on. while on a certain mission, its great just to take your time and look around the map, the way they design the map and have all different secret areas for you to xplore and discover is just awsome. only down side i have had with the game would be just the lagg, some games i join might have cr*ppy internet, so it pretty much makes the mission impossible to do cause, sometimes you will not see the enemies around you or doors will not open for you but for others it will. but those are just minor things. everything else... is just awesome! plus.. you become a space ninja what more could you ask for!? :d",1080.6

"a very well made free to play 3rd person shooter. uses a custom lanucher/updater. gameplay gameplay is quite repetitve in the long run. there are a bunch of planets available to you, each with sectors ( missions ) with different gamemods which you complete for rewards. the game uses tiles to randomly generate levels. some planets have unique tilesets, etc. has a bunch of different weapons and weapon types, each item has to be ranked up with xp. you can then mod your weapon/warframe/etc with a huge amount of mods to tweak each parameter to your liking. has a lore, but theres no campaign as such, just a few story quests. real money basically almost nothing is locked behind a paywall in this game. the only exceptions i found are some cosmetics ( character attachements, color pallettes, animations sets ) and inventory size ( for weapon and characters ). you can trade in-game currency bought for real money to other players at higher levels, which means that you can unlock pretty much everything for free, which enough time put into the game. not only that, but you can get a -75% discount on platinum ( currency bought for real money ) as a daily login reward, and for 5$ you can get enough of it to lift all restrictions on the inventory size and buy some cheap cosmetics. buying weapons/characters for platinum is pointless because you can simply craft, or acquire them otherwise. score if i had to give it a score, id say 7.5/10.",267.9

"loads of fun and replayability for a game with minimal gameplay modes; however, if youre a coward when it comes to grinding loot and gear - you should probably just sit in the dark, alone, and imagine life couldve been like if you were a space ninja. the various frames have diverse enough ability spreads to allow for endless funk. endless. funk.",17.2
"really recommended for all player who wanna play a good f2p games. but kinda repetitive when you have done all warframe. so it gets really boring because the lack of competitive pvp like other action game. r.i.p. acrid",409.2
"extremely fun have it for ps4 and pc gets kinda addicting my advice is to not choose loki some of my favorite warframes is volt, mag, and ember/ember prime. get the game got about 15 hrs in on ps4 it is the most fun if u join a clan. one bad thing is some times with the volt, mag, and ember/ember prime warframes some of the enemys dont drop enough energy for u to use the best part of those warframes the supers.",7.7
"fun game to play with friends! i like to think of it like halo on steroids!",16.7
"started playing this game two days ago, and has been running smoothly so far. the co-op gameplay is really impressive and fun to play. theres always the option to get into a mission by yourself and hope that people are going to join you, but some missions arent well-balanced for solo play. the graphics of the game is okay and most critically, theres no lag or ping display anywhere. theres a good variety of guns to choose from, including really powerful bows that can pin enemies against the wall, i think the swordsman archetype was a little overplayed, the melee combat here is also satisfyingly weighty. charged attacks that can cut enemies clean in half are their own reward. one of warframes significant issues at the moment is its failure to display important information, especially in the mission-select interface, other than that the game was pretty well made and i will recommend this game to all who are looking for some fun in co-op gameplays.",33.3

"to be honest, i think i expected more of this game than i should have. my biggest complaints are that the levels are all pretty much the same 5 things over and over again, and that the microtransactions are really over the top. i typically dont mind microtransactions all that much, but its super obvious from day one that they purposely made it difficult to get resources for items so that you would buy them from the platinum store. want a new armor other than mag? have fun grinding for hundreds of hour just to get one part. however, i love the art in this game, especially on the tenno, and i think that combining parkour with a fast-paced action shooter was a good idea that got butchered by the paying aspects. if they removed all the microtransactions and sold it for 35 bucks, i would buy it again and play it in a heartbeat. tl;dr- if you dont mind being relentlessly nickled and dimed to death or are a fan of p2w games, you should definitely try it.",6.2

"my favourite sci-fi game so far. 10/10 for me. the graphics are beautiful, the choice of weapons, warframes(characters) and mods(to upgrade all these) are just huge. the game is mostly a co-op game, with a maximum of four players per mission. your mission goals vary, the environment varies, everything is perfect. only one thing i dont like: the updates. when a major update comes out(like new mission type, new event, etc.) there are so many bugs and glitches and sometimes a lots of game crashes, that it makes almost impossible to play peacefully for one or two days. they should focus on looking for these problems and repair them a.s.a.p. in brief this is a beautiful game, interesting, always gives you something new to reach. i have 350+ game hours and im still enjoying it.",433.0

"great game at start things start to get boring after 300+(played 200+ house before connecting my warframe account to steam) hours of endless farming to get items that you want but the first 100 hours are amazing. the new contents added every update are really fun and if you are the type who like farming for items, warframe is one of the best games for you. new prime gears and new warframes every major updates or some of the sub updates give an additional 20-50 hours to farm all the items so if you wait patiently for the updates, warframe could be a never ending fun for you. ive quit warframe now but i still enjoyed the hours that ive played in warframe. its a great game to get and i also reccommend buying platinum just for weapon and warframe slots.",134.3

"this game is good looking, fun with friends, but very repetitive... but you can customise your character to the core with dozens of different things to change, upgrade, or mod. new functionalities are fun, special mention to the archwing, totally changing the gameplay in a fun and arcady way. play it with friend, or you wont enjoy it fully.",125.8

"ive often asked myself: how could a free to play game possibly be worth it? i mean it must be free for a reason? planetside 2 for example, kinda sucked and i couldnt get into it at all. but on friends recommendation i downloaded warframe - and i know im only 30 minutes into playing the game and i might get bored of it after a while - but this is just awesome and definantly worth the $0 and 6gig on my computer. starts off with some standard but epic melee combat before introducing you to the third person shooter experience and i straight away grabbed the bow and arrow and just couldnt believe how much enjoyment i was having already. but by far the best part of the game and what sets it apart from other fpss tpss etc, is the movement mechanics. my ogd. does this bring back some oldschool memories speedrunning mario/ banjo kazooie/ crash bandicoot, trying to get extra speed by fluent combinations of different movements. beautiful! these movement mechanics are what makes a 2d scroller like speedrunners fun and is perfectly incorporated into this new style of game, cant wait to see what is in store for the rest of the game but it was worth it already",1.1
"this game is incredibly buggy, but not so bad that it makes you want to stop playing. theres a lot that they can fix, but its still a new game. all in all: highly addicting game that you do not have to pay to play. if anyone else wants to play my username is of course, reikadeniah :)",1090.7

"short review: as the game explains, free to play. what they didnt tell you is that 80% of ingame items are cash shop only. the game controles running character response is all very fluent and to be able to pull off epic movements and techniques with such smoth controles is satifieing. game pacing can be a chore and before you reach to a new area or do some interesting mission, your going to be playing through the same area with slightly diffrent mission over and over for about 10- 20 times over. well thats all i have to say about it.",9.6

"this is a truly unique game. generally, im hesitant about third person games, especially shooters. after playing warframe, i understand why its third person. it has to be third person to give you that parkour feeling. if you thought assassins creed was a good blend of parkour and combat, then you havent seen anything yet. this is what the next generation of shooters should be. fast-paced gameplay with unique combat, warframe is one of those games that you wonder why they were never made on console. i am pleasantly surprised by this game and look forward to playing more of it. if you are skeptical about warframe, give it a shot. its free, so what do you have to lose? you might find out just how fun it is to be a gun-wielding space ninja.",4.4
"excellent graphics for a free game. rpg format 3rd person shooter. most items in-game can be bought with credits earned from missions or the blueprints to create them via farming materials so you really dont need to spend $$ on platinum, unless youre impatient. love the set up. a lot of fun. the missions maps are randomly generated, too. makes it interesting.",39.6

"sorry, but can not recommend. the gameplay is fun and the weapons and levels are interesting, but none of that matters because i have yet to see a game as glitchy as this. ive had everything from objectives not showing up, to doors remaining locked (effectively locking you into a room forever) to timed missions where youre left waiting for that extraction that will never come because the timer has stopped at 1:07 left. if theyve just released some sort of content, youd best believe thats gonna be glitched to hell. even for a f2p title, the amount of bugs is just not acceptable, especially after its been out this long.",603.9

"can be repetetive at times but recently they have kind of mixed it up enough with interesting level designs and difficult enemies. while you can play this by yourself i really recommend getting a couple pals and just having a blast because you get to parkour in space. also i know what youre thinking f2p=p2w but seeing as this is coop you dont have to worry about someone that has bought stuff dominating you. overall prettyfun/10",254.5

"for ages i didnt play this and sadly it looks like im not alone because you get a good quality 3rd person shooter offering both pve and pvp gameplay and a fair amount of depth. this game could do with an influx of players and its free, so give it a go. you have nothing to lose.",6.4

"amazing game, you can almost see it as a mix between daiblo + borderlands + masseffect + ninjas, devs are ambitious and push to evolve the game with every update and works with a very active community when adding new content. speaking of cummenity, very welcoming and helping ; all around, if you wanna lose countless hours deep into high action wall running head shotting invisible eviscarating gameplay, all wrapped around in a sci-fi space ninja universe, this is the game for you. 8.5 /10 must be played",945.4

"ive pumped hundreds of hours into the stand-alone client, hence less hours played via steam. the gameplay is so much fun that it doesnt feel like grinding even though you basically are just grinding for loot and xp after a while. ive never really liked shooters. warframe is the exception, especially for the mobility and rpg elements. its very unique in that regard. also, putting some money into the game to get your warframe and wep slots is totally worth it if youre enjoying the game. the devs are worth supporting, theyre very responsive to the community,",48.4

"basically, you grind for cool weapons and warframes. repetitive but youll find yourself doing it anyway. graphics arent bad, not pay2win(yay), no hackers.. i believe, aand its fun to play with friends! imo, they should change the place in menu where your character is like stuck and has a small room. there should also be free test of weapons so that yennow, you didnt grind for something then youll find out that weapon is not for you. 8/10.",123.8
"one of the only shooters i like, because the rpg elements are reasonably compelling. some menu items are mouse only, but otherwise you can play with a gamepad. just pray to the gods of rng with warframe. it can take a lot of grinding to get what you want, since its typically not a steady stream of predictable rewards, but rather a completely random chance of getting a reward based on the roll of the dice. cash shop isnt too intrusive. you can play without paying easily, though if you dont want to look ugly or have barely any inventory space, youll want to cough up 5 or 10 usd for some color palletes and inventory spaces.",273.1

"despite of all in-game bugs that sometimes trouble me, i think, this game is a very well-made free to play game. i dont really like third person shooter. but this, this game is very challenging. it makes me want to play it again and again. it challenges your brain to really think, which step should you take while you proceed your mission. and i totally recommend this game for any people who likes tps. for a free to play game, this is a magnificent tps game.",140.8
"warframe is really amusing. nice to be a co-op, action game. it presents quite good graphics. sometimes i cant believe it is a f2p. the only bad thing i can find is that sometimes it turns out to be monotonous. but the game is really good.",10.0

"warframe is a sci-fi co-op shooter, centered around our planets and the occasional moon or two. you have the standard currency and platinum. while you start out with a little platinum its diminishes quickly, forcing you to either spend hours getting the standard currency or taking out your wallet and buying platinum. now for the gameplay. its fast fluid and action packed, but dont expect to survive too long without help. the co-op makes the game a lot more fun. you could spend hours traversing the galaxy, but dont brave it alone. there are mods which you can use to give you special abilities equipping them on either yourself or your weapons. now there is a slight issue with the game i want to bring up. its blur. when moving the camera or yourself everything but the center blurs a little bit, which can be annoying at times. all in all i would say this is a great game, but has some flaws. i proudly give it a 9/10.",69.1
"good game, without playing with friends it can only be fun for so long",1.4
"well, this game is kinda out of my expection. not just a simple shooting and cuting game...this game has a very unique weapon and mods system, and you can also craft your own weapon and gear. (that means you dont need to waste your money in the online shop, unless you love showing off...) although it is almost impossible for low level players to solo most of the maps, it is a online game..so....why not make a team with other people.

"thouroughly enjoyable from start to finish (although there isnt really a finish), warframe offers the kind of addicting gameplay where you know what to expect, and are still enthralled by it at the same time. the game is constantly updated with new content and fixes for some of the games glitches and gameplay issues. the staff are very responsive to the wants and needs of the community, and they do a great job with it. overall 8/10",904.4

"one of the most interesting projects of 2013 that flowed into 2014 that ive seen. the game has all what a gamer needs. guns, fancy karate gimmicks, swords. two words: space ninjas. what is actually good that the game even tho is f2p but it does not follow a shadowy p2w path. you might be confused in the beggining, as getting the stuff, crafting, locations and controls. but when you get over it, you might as well like it. another aspect that drives the attention. constant new content updates from very friendly developers. i might add that devs do take in considiration players ideas and implement ideas and throughts into a real thing. almost all the stuff ingame can be aqquired just by playing the game, you just need to get over the beggining. but this game is still in beta. there could be bugs, there could be flaws. currently devs implement tons of content every two months (aprox). in general this is a game that you might totally like or just play for two minutes and uninstall. playing with friends is recomended.",903.8

"this is a game about running around with guns and swords slaughtering everything that moves, and farming to get more cool guns, swords, and suits. its fun, if you like that kind of thing. its free, and you can trade other players to get the real-money currency (platinum), so you can get everything (even the cosmetics) without spending a dime.",383.7

"i have around 700 legtimate hours played on this game with no regrets or remorse because de knew how to make a f2p game /good/. however, this game will not even be worth a second worth of anyones time when perfect world enter-taint-ment will sink its talons into this game. im not going to write a review about mechanics or gameplay since pwe will probably find a way to make it bland, unoriginal, and a cash grab, making any current statements moot.",663.3

"its polished art cant save it from its sluggish controlls and terrible pvp. its basically has everything a michael bay film has to offer. its all about looks. broken pvp and fair pve gameplay. nothing to brag about, and offers nothing new. a true pick up and play a couple days then leave it for months game.",1.4
"this game is awesome. i really like the freedom to choose whether to go all out and rip up the mobs or complete the mission in stealth, nearly undetected. unlike a lot of games, this game has levels for each part of the equipment, and it is upgraded the more you play. moreover, there are a lot of rare items that you basically can loot, however it may be hard to find a specific one. the upgrading system is based on your decisions how to customize your character, and you can always recustomize it the way you like / the way thats most fit to your quest. once again, awesome game, highly recommended!",57.4

"im up and down on this game at the moment, i have not played it since day one however i have played it enough to know what i am talking about. this game is a grind, and a serious one. im currently just about 2000 mastery points from level 7. to be honest, i dont like the mastery point system which is how you go up in level. it requires you to experience the game via (using new weapons, warframes, playing different nodes) in order to unlock more powerful weapons. in which case you are out in nodes playing for hours hoping you get the right items in oder to make your new weapons and warframes to go up in mastery level. the combat system is pretty plain, 3rd person shooter with some mobility perks, + 4 hotkey skills unique to each warframe in its own. when it comes to upgrading, youre hoping you get lucky to find the right upgrade that you need in order to make the right elemental combos or getting enough damage upgrade mods to be able to take on the higher tier enemies. if anything, if you want to play this game and you think it looks cool than by all means play it. if you do and you dont like it than thats how you feel do not let my opinion change your mind. its free, its not pay to win as everything you get in game can be aquired by playing the game. i have 300+ hours, i like it, spent about $100 on it, i enjoy it.",517.2

"a few things that some people wont like from this game: -glorious 24/7 grinding -anticlimatic quests -messed up lore -that one weapon everyone uses (rip synoid) -raids are hard (i blame the squad d:<) - bugs, bugs, bugs -baro ki teer -people who cant use google to search for answers and keeps bugging people even with those downsides, there are actually good things about this game: -shiny weapons -shiny warframes (characters) -shiny liset (the ship tenno uses) -shiny maps (oh god, the bloom) -games quite forgiving, given its decent graphics, it runs on my microwave -region chat shenaningans -communitys isnt that bad.. (well yea, flamers and keyboard warriors are there.. but mostly, its filled with people willing to help. especially in large clans and alliances) -major bugs are fixed considerably fast -devs are open to the community -bricks",886.3

"ive been playing since u7. all i can say is: for an f2p game, its pretty solid. constant updates, devs listening to the community [with devstream that giveaway in-game currency] and overall a generally fun game. the only problem right now is that its pretty much in an eternal beta state, where its not fully complete yet, but its already feeling pretty full. as a long-time veteran, id just say we need more lore. otherwise, its all good. except the fact that its pretty damn grindy. that can be a turn off for people. well, all weapons, mods, and frames can be grabbed for free through crafting and grinding of credits and resources. otherwise, its pretty much a pay to get cool cosmetics, and the latest stuff faster. platinum, the in-game currency that you can buy with real money, can also be grabbed by selling rare mods, prime warframe blueprints, and other special stuff. basically, it means that even if youre a free player, you can literally get everything if you have the time. as for the power creep, there is some, but not really a lot as its more on the skill and time spent by the player that determines how powerful one is. tl;dr: iz preety gud game. try it out doods.",214.0

"i know that you shouldnt do a review on a game before you have even played it but thats not the case here the case here is that when the game says itll take 23 hours to update a 300mb update is rediculous, and my intrernet can download 3gbs and a half an hour. some reviews here are bad and some are good but when the game takes so long to update it will most sertainly turn away new players such as myself and other potetional players.",1.4
"a good game if you enjoy endless grinding. invest twenty or so dollars in unless you want to since 50+ hours grinding for weapons and other items. still an enjoyable game. do not play alone though because it can get un fun very quickly. i would also suggest a decently good computer to run it.",10.5
"it is one of those games that you increace your self and your stuff and the levels get more intense with high overpowerd action with third-person shooter games that you could go on a day playing it and never get bored",21.9

"warframe is a very good f2p tps and has a wonderful community of gamers that are easy to get a long with. the game play is smooth and nice graphics but the only problem is there are a lot of maps that seem like you have seen before, meaning it seems like there are maps that they used before but just put a few new things in it. also you can drop a lot of money in the game if you get into it because of different customization for warframs and sentinels. you can also buy weapons with your plat but for the player that just wants have a fun game with not droping a dime there is goos news for you. almost everything you see in the store you can build in game with no real money charges it just takes longer to obtain that item. so i give warframe 8.5/10 and recommend you give it a try!",7.3

"at first, i really didnt like this game. i played it back in january of 2014 for a couple hours and felt utterly lost and confused on what was going on. fast forward to two days ago when a member of my clan started playing it out of the blue. once again i reinstalled it and started from where i left my mag warframe. again, i was confused, lost and irritated along with my clansmen. so, rather than give up i turned to the almighty tube and found a small 3 part series of videos that broke it all down really easily and quickly. i can honestly say im pretty hooked now. i really like it. for a free to play its very good for almost everything can be bought or better yet, built with patience, the forge and mats. of course, you could buy them. but im proud to say that i have a rhino warframe chassis currently being built and it will be completed early in the morning. (its like having a new toy in the morning waiting) so im excited, i found a new addiction and am enjoying myself. you might too, its free and ill link the very helpful videos below.",16.3
"its fun for the few first hours, but then it just gets repetitive and boring.",90.0

"one of the best co-op game i have ever played. a futuristic awesome game. splendid graphics. having missions all around the solar planet and defeating each boss and taking control of the planet. very nice range of weapons and characters/warframes and sentinels. a third person awesome game.",73.1
"lol this is the game you have to buy its like pure notes.... if you wannna have fun and envy chromas play it!",72.8
"farm frost prime right before they remove it from the game, then sell it for 600 platinums. best f2p game ever 11/10. i only spend a few euros ~5. and those euros came from cs:go cases and skins. but yeah if you want to go deep into the game you may not have to spend real money to buy platinum, but you have to farm hard. yes very hard. and deeper you go, more deeper you will want to get. i started with 1 frame during the beta (excalibur) and when the beta was over ive just stoped playing this game. but a few months a friend of mine just say me hey, you wanna play some warframe with us. and here im with ~250hours(in steam) plus a 50 or more durring the beta. now im with 12,almost 13 frames(1 prime), dozen of guns and only spend ~5. game its not pay 2 win, but farm 2 win. if you are enough patience to spend a few hours a day you will progress fast. but as i said - deeper you go into the game, more deeper you will want to go. and yeah advice from me - if youre going to farm but have some platinum, spend it on slots, because more or less other stuff is kinda useless because you can farm it(and again if you are patience enough)",365.3

"my computer doesnt run this very well as its a huge game to even download alone, but i do play it on ps4 and i could recommend it to most patient players, however i could say its not for impatient people unless youre willing to blow through a bit of cash to get your head start a little quicker than others. cool game about a 7.5/10. (alot of glitches, then again its still beta).",0.4
"this game is both a grind and glitch fest. it takes forever to collect what you need just so you can craft something, and by the time you get everything you need to craft a certain item, its useless because you leveled up so much and upgraded your gear. this game makes me rage a lot that i ran out of complaints on why this is the worst game ive played. the sad thing about all of it is, im addicted to it! play at your own risk!!! 2/10 ps: the wall running, wall climbing, and jumping are complete disasters.",72.9
"this game has you playing as ****ing space ninjas with shotguns. is there anything left to say? i would think not.",60.8
"i cant run this game for some reason it keeps on saying update of directx failed. this sucks",25.5
"very fun online co-op, very difficult for singleplayer. its alot more fun when youre playing with friends as opposed to strangers though. concept-wise/story-wise, its pretty unique and fascinating, as alot of the backstory is left for the player to interpret. gameplay wise, its a very cool third person shooter and thirdperson melee experience, with special abilities for each individual warframe. although it uses microtransactions, these are non-essential, and more or less just allow easier/faster access to items you could get through gameplay otherwise. ive been playing since closed beta, and ive watched the game grow and change but have yet to see a change i cannot stand. they seem to update frequently and patch as needed, and have yet to come up with a solid reason to be disappointed by the game or anything in it.",396.3
"a great game with a lot of weapon and gear its worth playing it.",575.4

"its not a bad game considering its free. the best thing about it is that you can play in 15-30 minute chunks if you wanted. its not impossible to obtain every item in the game for free, but its no cake-walk either. but if you just want to be a wall-running, katana slinging, dual-pistol wielding space ninja, then this is the game for you!",261.9

"this is by far one of the best free2play games i have ever played. my windows computer isnt that great. i have to run almost lowest settings. the good thing is i get no lag! the graphics are amazing and the missions are great. the only bad thing is that platinum(in game curremcy) is a little overprices for how much you could buy. over all i would recommend this game to everyone!",11.8
"fun game and all but im not too keen on have to wait 24 hours to rank up my tenno once. plus making your character counts as part of the that time. everything else is fine. its like a 3rd person objective based moba. im only going to recommend the game because i hope they fix that issue about ranking up only once daily.",27.3
"omg this game is so adddictive :o my friends told me to try it and i was *scare* because i though it would be boring, at the beggining it was...but after few levels, i got hooked up to this game and now i cant stop playing :d",85.5

"ive spent far too much time and money on this game, so i can say that its one of the best free to play games out there. theyve managed to make it free to play without making it pay to win, so props to digital extremes for that. theres a huge variety of ways to play this game, and there is no single best playstyle. whether you like to stay unseen and pick off your enemies from a safe distance or you just want to get in your enemies faces, whether you like to play co-op or solo, you can do all of it, and all of it very well. its gameplay is an absolute blast. space ninjas are ing awesome. its a bit of a work in progress, and de periodically releases huge updates that greatly improve it. i have few complaints about this game, but it does have flaws. the first one is an almost absolute lack of story. it has a good introduction, but then it just kind of throws you out to a solar system filled with seemingly out-of-place boss battles, some of which just seem a too hastily thrown together. it also has numerous logical fallicies, such as how its always snowing on venus. my last complaint is that its pure grind. you spend the whole game farming resources and leveling up your stuff so you can get better stuff. if youre willing to overlook its flaws, and are willing to accept it as a work in progress, you will have a great time with this game.",454.5

"gameplay is awesome, runs smoothly even for my crapshoot of a computer. faced paced and full of action. it is, howerever, impossible to continue if youre just starting out unless you have money, or good friends whove been playing awhile to carry you through the missions and get you stuff. might have been better off just being pay to play, instead of free for inconvenient, but thats just me. if you enjoy spending hours getting very little progress at a time because you cant afford the virtual currency, then have fun.",30.6
"id recommend it assuming you have a party to work with, otherwise itll be tough soloing. platinum is really only worth spending on inventory space, that or on valuable mods youll need for your stuff. however, the market place does allow for trading of platinum, as other players have managed to earn a nice sum of it from just selling valuable stuff. at the same time, bugs abound, but the devs push fixes weekly if not every other day.",510.9

"disappointment id say. see so many great review so i decided to try out. first, great graphic. and gear is well design. the game remind me of halo. i played few mission but i dont really like it. the control is a little bit funny. maybe because of the keyboard. and the characters motion look weird. also ai is kinda dumb. not say this is a bad game. but i wont recommend unless u are a big space type of game lover willing to put up with those stuff. see some real in gaming video before you download this.",1.0
"i have to admit that i am addicted to this game and that i am hardly proficient in the playing of this game. i am trying to learn as i go along as it is impossible to find any step by step on how to play this game. one thing i tried to do do is keep up with the expert players that run really fast and then i realised that they are missing out on what is one of the best things in this game, the scenery, i mean just look around you and take in all the work that makes up the mission, walls, ramps, tunnels, machinery not mention the bad guys. ok, so i dont get there as fast as you guys but i do get to end and have really enjoyed the trip. hopeing to rise in rank. my graitude to the guys that make this wraith of hell",975.0

"this game starts off very promising and fun, but it eventually boils down to nothing more than retracing your steps over and over and over and over and over and over again. the drops are terrible, the combat gets really boring, and the entire game just feels really clunky. for a game that claimns to be centric to space-ninjas, there is nothing resembling ninjas at all, save for a few obsolete frames/weapons. did i mention how horribly slow and sluggish these ninjas are? chris farley could catch them. if you like broken records, stale combat, or just like farming for hours on end, then farmframe is for you.",489.5

"its part fps, part gun collector. when they say its free to play, its not entirely. the restrictions that arise come in the form of weapon and warframe slots, which require some money to expand. the positive side to this, that i think is really great, is that you can get daily rewards that reduce the price of pay currency by 25-50-75%. all together, its a very very fun shooter, with parkour, wall running, melee and tons of guns. the best thing though is de, the company that makes the game. they are top-notch when it comes to updates, and customer care. 9/10 would reccomend to all my friends.",249.2
"this game is awesome. for a free to play game it looks and plays really well. this is a sci-fi ninja style game wihich plays like deadspace. very enjoyable while completely free, and spending a few bucks has some worthwhile content. after about 60 hours can get repetetive, but devleopers release changes and new content frequently.",163.7

"once i started i was hooked, this game has everything a f2p needs and a mile more. i mean 3rd person was already a learning curve for myself but you get used to it, and you can take advantages from the camera angles when aiming. this game has everything smoothly cut and personally the only thing i didnt really like was how the slide (l shift + ctrl) was so close together it made it hard at some points but not really hard to just rebind the key. i am still new while writing this review but expect me to be much better later on. i expect to play this game and even make a purchase from warframe. this game is definately worth money, much better than a 10-20 dollar 3rd person campaign/shooter. the rating is m cause of violence but i think people of ages 12 or older should be fine understanding the concept and play the game themselves. well after writing this review it makes me want to play warframe even more. thanks for reading, off to game.",17.1

"play this if you like running, gunning, swinging a weapon, doing flips, and using special powers warframe might fill the void. while the gamplay is fun it is definitly a freenium, you can work for a $5 dollar item by continously grounding for hours and some times days, then wait for hours to days for the item to be constructed. its only a shame when you done this work for a sub-par machine gun or a frame you arent particulary fond of so i reccomend looking up what thing does what. levels/enivoronments look nice and rooms are randomly generated so youll start to see the same environments after awhile. while the bosses are varied and vary in terms of annoyance, enemy types are few inbetween with gun guys and melee guys and robots. despite some of those issues you can have fun without spending a dime. it is especially fun, and in some casses neccessary to have a friend(s) to tag along on missions depending on what frame you/they are using. i played significantly less on account of the endless grinding and me being satisfied with the weapon/frame i already have but it was fun little distraction that is free to play while it lasted.",89.3

"this is a pretty fun game after you learn the ropes. they have been improving the tutorial system since i first started but the beginning was pretty rough. there is a lot content, systems, and mechanics that dont make immediate sense. i loved the 200+ missions that you can do, the only downside to this is that there is a set amount of missions types so they become repetitive eventually. also when youre done with all the missions youre not left with much to do other than trying to acquire rare weapons or warframes. prepare for a grind. how long you can enjoy that is up to each player, i was fine for a while, but it just gets old. the dev team gives you weekly updates/patches and great support, kudos to them for that. its a f2p game, pick it up, play with some friends. youll have fun.",450.9

"review of warframe by: brogames of youtube this is brogames review about the game the game is good because there is a lot of missions and a lot of fun in warframe you can rank up and you can play with your friends online you can get skins for your character in the game . mods the mods on the game are for you to better skills in fighting like you can go invisible and you can use your sword power to kill everybody in sight. guns there are guns for you to rank up with your mods all you can get better guns with your money to get in the game by completing missions our completing ai missions to get more guns you need to buy the blueprints for your gun you want or if you can not get the blueprint you may need to rank up your level. once you got your gun blueprints you need to go to the planets to farm the materials to get the to build the gun you want. to get blueprints and more to get blueprints you need to go to the boss missions on certain planets like earth you need to play that boss missions over and over again until you get the blueprints for your character skins. once you got the blueprint you need to form off planets to get the materials for your blue print character skins.",55.7

"a lot of fun with friends. good payment system. 160 hours, and i only spent $20 with plat to spare. it can be repetitive, but its fun. its one of the few games where ive enjoyed the grind. it kept me interested and i was happy to work towards new warframes and weapons. once i got all the weapons and warframes i wanted though, i did stop playing. there wasnt anything end game to keep me going. but if you got friends to play with, its a good time.",183.5

"warframe is an amazing f2p game that has one hell of a paywall and that is simply buy and get bored fast. this game offers a high amount of freedom around the map and do all sorts of stunts but this game requires patience to make it a fun experience for everyone. the level of gore is great and the graphics are beautiful and it has a great storyline, sure it has repetitive levels but if you ignore that and look only at the fun factors and have a lot of patience then this is good because i tell you now when it comes to mods, you got to grind so much to get it. if you just want to ignore the beginning tutorial and want the very best equipment from the start then dont come here because it will be a waste of time and real money as you will be bored very quickly. just to tell you guys, due to getting addicted to this game i have trouble when playing other third person games because the level of freedom is completely different and i cant wallrun 9/10",525.5
"tradeing a unused giftcard that i got when i bught a new grafiks card, its on 75 us dollars ( 50 euro ) trading it for ether the game saints row the third or gta episodes from liberty city ( or both if possible. the card have a code on it that you scratch away with a coin or so and is not opend ( scratched away ) if youre intrested take contact with me on steam or instagram whear i can take a picture and show it to you that it is not yet open or used. it also works for the games , neverwinter and marvel heroes.",6.7
"ive played this game for quite a while now and i like it personally although, like anything it has issues. pros - although its a freemium, it is possible to get to the same standard as the premium players if you arent willing to put a lot of money into this game. (it does cost a lot and i havent spent a single penny on it) - very nice graphics - the game has a lot of versatility that makes it very fun to play. no 2 players have the same loadout and mods installed - great crafting system - great clan system - great trade system cons - can be repititive after a while - free playing requires a  ton of grinding, trading and waiting around - takes a long time to get to the good stuff (though the good stuff is really very good fun to use) - often see bugs but they are not very hindering to gameplay i personally recommend this game to people who are looking for a free game that has a lot to offer for an extended period of time and not just for a couple of hours.",300.3

"really liking the plat trading system... now you can actually get any item in game for free even cosmetics. very grindy though",222.5
"great graphics, animations, sound effects, game play (combine shooting and close combat), everything is great except one thing: the whole game is an endless loop. there are lots of missions and you have to complete them to explore the whole map but after that. youll just do some same missions, again and again, kill the same enemies, again and again. you kill the enemies to get the gears you want, to strengthen them, then use those gears to kill the same enemies you already killed thousands time. its so pointless. i still recommend this game because its will be fun for a long time. but know that at some point you will not enjoy it anymore and find the game pointless, like me and my friends. sorry for my bad english, its not my language.",1215.9
"a really good game but the match making systems is sometimes a bit buggy and wont let you join public games",846.2
"i tried to stomach this game. the videos looked good, they really do look fun. i downloaded, jumped into a game with friends and could not stomach close to 1hour. it really is boring. it does nothing... all you do is go from one room to another swinging your sword around, that is it. graphics are decent with smooth flowing but that is all it has going for it. lucky to hell it is free because if this had a price i think i would pull my hair out requesting a refund urgently because it is mind numbingly boring. i suggest leaving it alone, maybe give it ago but then youll see what i mean. it has no story, most things are buy for better stuff but it all seems to do the same effect, the character moves weird and makes me feel sick a little. anyway nope not for me.",0.2
"basically? you run around as an epic wall-running gun-toting space ninja, defeating hoards of enemies and collecting new and awesome gear along the way. it is a good f2p model, where you can get almost anything without paying (with the exception of some cosmetics). definately an overall great game, pick it up.",770.2

"extremely well done for a hack an slash. would be nice if they add a pvp feature or expand on map layouts, but given its beta status, im quite happy with where its at right now. even spent money on it :o thumbs up for sure!",245.1
"finally, a grinding game thats actually fun. oh, and the devs are awesome too.",743.6
"this game is a great oppertunity to burn a few hours and have tons of fun doing it. for a game in beta it is fantasticlly built, they have a great community and is in a very fast paced setting. and its free to play! when the developers release an update they pack so full of fixes and additions to the game youd think that they were adding a mod. (but then again a update is basiclly a mod) i enjoy playing this game for two main reasons: 1. the fact that it is very fast paced and requires lots of thinking in the now, because the ai is very sophisticted and reactes accordingly but could get some improvements. 2. the amount of fun that i have just grinding away to get a cool item. i personally spent 40+ hours grinding away to get two really cool items in the game and i really enjoyed grinding that. when i dont know what to do in the game i go and play with my freind the first few missions. im now going to write about some minor issues in the game :d when i played the tutorial it was preety laggy the first time, so you might want to take that time and change settings ive only chrashed twice for no appernt issues but on review of those logs my pc stopped two important files from working. but i recommend this game greatlly and i cant wait to see where this game goes.",862.4
"awesome. i recomend that they make more out door missions though. and perhaps usable turrets and vihicles for the out door missions",32.9
"great game its half pay to win but all items that cost platnium (exept color palletes) can be crafted (takes ages to get those but who cares its fun while your doing it!) i recommend it and its free!",518.2
"in little over a month, i racked up over 400 hours. i no lifed the  outta this game for a while. gotta say. i love it. while the nessesity of plat( in game currency bought with real money is platnum) is annoying for all customizable options (or waiting days to months to get) or to rush things that can take up to thre days to build, its a good game. people sy you can just get things in game and sell them to others, and while you can, getting enough play to get what you want is very rare, unless you get a few lucky drops. that being said. i enjoy shooters. and not being a fan of pvp shooters, where things like cod are located, and most other shooters leaving a  single player that does nothing for me, this is a good game to fill that void. though not much of a story if there is one, just being able to bust some corpus chops, its pretty nice. no need to angry about spawn camping here. so if your wonder if you should try it, if you like shooters, and pvm, play the game for a while. you get used to things. and if you like it and got the money, its better to buy plat then try to earn it in game or will take you near forever. tl;dr shooty shooty pew pew magic people",737.2

"the pinacle of mmo adapted to fps. third person adds to the overall experiance, custimization is to die for, graphics are next gen. i would advise this game to anyone and find a single person who didnt enjoy.",434.1
"slicing and dicing your way through hordes of enemies never felt more satisfying. i highly recommend this for people who love hack and slash games or people who love strategy and planning, this games got plenty of both. i think one of the only cons are that if you have an average (not for gaming, or average laptop) computer, you might want to go to through the graphics settings and turn off all of the motion blur, flashy lights, and lens flares.",62.8
"great graphics and a fun co-op experience attempt to make up for a terrible ai system and repetetive gameplay and maps. controls work well, yet there isnt many combat options. this game would be definitly recommended for anyone who is broke, has a bunch of friends, and some time to kill. 6.8/10",29.6

"people have their opinions, some enjoy grinding all day. some dont. some are fine with the simple enemy design some arent. but when you make people have to pay to continue progressing... nobody enjoys that. this used to be one of my best go-to games if i just felt like a kill everything in creative ways mood. however with the added inventory system that requires you to buy space with platinum i cant progress. as much as i love this game, you cant call it free to play unless youre fine with about 100 hours of gameplay. the inventory system is a way for the creators to milk as much as they can from the players while still passing off the game as free to play instead of just making an initial fee to download it. i dont know if this was recently added or has been in since first created, all i know is if looking for a game you can pour a lot of hours and really get into this is not your game unless youre willing to pay.",144.9
"need a decent pc for it, gameplay is slid pretty good game overall. lots of grinding though",130.1
"great game i feel that there needs to be more of a storyline (in your face) where i feel like a im playing for a reason i get it but it just dosent feel like a story in a way but besides that fliping awesome ninja aliens! great i deffinetly say you should get this game plus its free",64.4
"this game is probably one of the best mmos out there. its very amazing to play with friends, and just as fun when you solo as well. the gameplay is quite addicting, to the very point that itll constantly draw you back into the mix if this appeals to you in any way. the beginning, like most games, is quite the grind fest, but once you get past that point, it only gets better. while melee is not the best in this game, they offer quite a wide variety of weapons and warframes, which signify the classes. the game can get quite tedious, but try to look past that and youll be addicted just as easily as i am. my only complaint about this game is that there are so many weapons and warframes that i cant have them all because you need platinum to buy slots, which they generously give you 50 to start out with for extra warframe or weapons slots. if you enjoy playing with friends, this is the game to download. teamwork needs to be handled very carefully or you can end up failing a mission that you could have easily won. while the game doesnt have the best soundtrack, it makes up for it with the ambiance. id recommend you to try this game at least once if you are curious about it.",1077.2
"this honestly is a very well made game, at least i think so. it mixes rpg/looting elements commonly found in hack nslash games with a 3rd person shooter game like gears of war for example. the problem is, the lack of variety. throughout the entime game youll be leveling up your gear, grinding for hard to find mods and resources, all to fight the same basic variety of enemies. they have just 3 factions of enemies in the entire game from start to finish. epic bosses? they finally added one with the orokin derelict missions, but other than that, they are all non meaningful and easily forgotten. i played this game for a while until i realized whats the point? whats the point of grinding to find better gear to constantly fight the same enemies on the same levels in a world that never changes at all...",320.3

"interesting concept, stunning visuals, good gameplay. the background music sets a cliche samurai-faceoff mood (not that its bad). the best part has got to be its co-op play and clan support, such as the dojo. the sad thing about the game, is how it forces players to go though micro-transactions to progress in the game, such as the restriction of warframe/weapon slots. even if that is not the case, the level-scaling for the game is broken to a level such that over 90% of the weapons become near-obselete at higher level missions. and for a game based on ninjas, there is surprisingly no proper stealth mechanics set in place for any stealth gameplay. the game is too focused on gun-blazing action and flashy skills. regardless, it is still a great game worth playing.",357.2

"movement and shooting feels smooth and responsive..i really like this game.",38.1
"good action game, that evolves with every update. at the beginning it is a little lame, to have your wallet tortured, becuase you need money, to buy slots for your items. otherwise you would only have space for two weapons, and this is annoying, if you dont want to spend real money so fast... however, the game is good, but lacks of a great story... just the same missions all the time, but the progressing factor makes the game really enjoyable and it is the best game, for a long co-op session with up to three friends. the different powers of your characters makes teamwork be a quite good and fun making experience. however, after 750hours the game made me rethink the concept of the developers. the game is in beta status and instead of developming a release, the guys release a beta to other systems like ps4 and xbox one.... and the only thing that evolves is the money making updates of cosmetics and new weapons, or chars... and this sucks.... instead of developing the game, the creators develop updates with much more new bugs.... with the saying.. hey, we are in a beta... but why do they create new stuff, instead fixing the good old... after update 14 ive stopped playing, since i feel fooled by the developers.",756.2

"this game is seemingly fun, loot driven, has good progression, enjoyable aesthetic and design, but in my limited run with the game thus far i wanted to give a first impression of the initial state of matchmaking. i mean, the game is pretty easy early on and thats to be expected, but with the way matchmaking works the game tends to pair people by latency and not their gear level. when i finally group, i dont need raiden super god robot flame sword explosion guy joining my low level nodes and skullhumping all the challenges into submission before i even face them (sprint mods). that is boring, and i might as well be waxing their plated  to avoid my team mate from dying of friction burns as he speedster hacknslashes to victory. with moments like those, it degenerates to me playing solo and then... whats the point? metal gear rising has better combat and slicker boss designs, so what would be the point of slogging through this game? well, progression. there is a permanency to content being added. there is a satisfaction to unlocking new content, and looking over the wealth of unlockables i as a new player can kick back and say to myself yeah, that looks like itll be awesome when i finally get there. all in all, if youre new like me and looking to start this game - do it with friends, have them be the same gear level as you, and scratch and claw and work your way to cool hi-tech horizons.",47.3
"dis gem was horrible i put in loads of hours for nithon",1.3
"a good time sink with a fair business model. the game has great gunplay and most abilities are very satisfying to use, and since the game revolves around pve, they have an excuse to be quite broken. crafting equipment, weapons and warframes takes a lot of time, but it feels really good when your effort finally pays off and you unlock that sweet new warframe you spent 3 days farming for. the gameplay can get quite repetitive, but the variety of missions and guns helps keep it from getting boring. having stuck around since the beta, i can tell you that the developers do a great job of updating the game regularly. being one of the very few games i have supported since before its release, i have not yet been disappointed. if youre looking for a good sci-fi shooter that you can sink time into every once in a while, or just play regularly, im willing to say that neither will you.",297.8

"yet another hack-and-slash rpg. unoriginal, yet somehow fresh. warframe combines standard shooting with hack-and-slash gameplay for a familiar, yet new experience. the basics are simple: you have your suit, your sword, and your guns. now go kill stuff. mindless yet attention-keeping, while at the same time testing your ability to adapt to a new situation. the game is riddled with environmental hazards and enemies of increasing strength. from the hideous grineer to the scavenger race corpus, you will never have a dull moment. that is... until the fps starts to tank. for some reason, this game has horrible fps issues, to the point that some have nicknamed it warframe-rate-drop. the devs are continuously figuring ways to make the experience less of a pain, however. i would at least pick it up, if you like hack-and-slash games. dont worry about lag, as you dont have to play online. you can go it alone, or go with up to three buddies, or if youre feeling adventurous, three completely-random-people-you-found-in-chat. have fun!",38.6
