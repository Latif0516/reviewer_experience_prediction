"garrys mod is a sandbox game in wich you can create new items, build houses out of random junk, drive cars download weapons, npcs,maps,gamemodes and much more. there are many fun gamemodes in wich you can try out while playing garrys mod such as : zombie survival,cinema, trouble in terrorist town (ttt) sled build, dark rp. as for my opinion i would give this game a rating of 9/10 because you need to (maybe) download some cs:s textures for some of the maps and also some giant error signs pop up if you dont have the right add-ons",320.5
"garrys mod... well what can i say but pure genius! you can litterally do anything you can think of on this sandbox style game. if you want to make an rpg or strategy or fps you can do it. if you just want a simple game of hide n seek or tag go do it! i havent come across anything i cant do on this game. again pure genius!! 5/5 5* a++",12.6
"definetely one of my favourite steam games. garrys mod has endless creativity and there is always something to do. with steam workshop adding various new content and gamemodes in the game only makes the game more fun and endless. not only is gmod fun but it has also helped make careers with various animators. an awesome game that will hopefully become a cold hard classic. 10/10",424.5

"this is a must own for everyone on steam! this game is basically, as i see it, if minecraft ran on the source engine and was 10 times better. build things, kill things, kill your friends, blow stuff up, whatever you want to do. also, with every source game you own, you get more free stuff in the game (like maps, npcs, props, etc.) 11/10",270.1

"ive had a long run with this game thats still going on. great sandbox game with literally millions of possibilities just playing or coding. knowing the scripting language lua would be extremely helpful to make your own weapons, scripts, addons, and much more. g-mod, in my opinion, is the best game on steam so far. (personally though, i liked the old g-mod, just for the gui and it was more simplistic.)",2090.6

"you see how i put a positive review? this is the thing, its a 50/50 negative/positive, you see, the game itself is fun because you can do what you want, however, too many minecraft 6 year olds came on and ed the game up with $500,000,000,000 donates just to be able to spawn something. so theres my review, i say buy the game, but prepare yourself for some  people. (dont even get me started on darkrp these days.)",1120.6
"a great game, worth more than it actually is this game consists of game modes the major gamesmodes that i am aware of are: -trouble in terrorist town -darkrp -prophunt -murder you may have heard all of these game modes(besides darkrp) from youtubers, seananners for example can show you the very basics of these game modes. although, you will need to buy counter strike: source to have all of these games graphics. if you are patient enough you can wait for the garrys mod, counter strike: source steam sale. this game is awesome, i have spent a tonne of time playing this game",430.0
"garrys mod is more than just a game. its an experience. its a place where you meet the best friends youve ever had. its a murder mystery. its a horror game. its a virtual 5 star hotel complete with a youtube television and several entertaining gamemodes. its a racer. its a sandbox building game. its a movie making tool. its whatever you want it to be, and thats why you should buy it. the cs:s content is what is used the most, along with tf2 items, so both are recommended to be installed. ive logged over 1,540 hours into this game and counting, so to say that this purchase was worth it is an understatement.",1641.3
"a very fun game, with all of the gamemodes and such this game has endless pontential and is fully driven by the public! if you have some spare money then pick up this game!",402.5

"a very fun game. there are a lot of gamemodes so there are a lot of different types of games to choose from. i can really recommend it!",58.4
"interesting game. when i purchased the gmae i thought it would be more of a sandbox build game. then when i got on it it was much more. there are loads of minigames to keep you entertained. notible ones or trouble in terrorist town (ttt), darkrp, deathrun, prophunt, murder, and more. i would sugguest this game to any, but younger children, due to the fact that mics are abundant in multiplayer, and there is no sensor. this is one of the most addicting games i own. pros: keeps you entertained in your downtime. lots of stuff to do. new people. fun game cons: swearing, must own cs:source, tf2, hl2 to get all textures. overall i give this game an 8/10",293.6
"now to be honest, most kids and probably adults play... *gulp*... minecraft... but, have you ever seen a game that can give you more creativity by over 9000?! well if youre looking for one, youve found it! (cause, i mean, youre already reading this review, soo...) garrys mod! a game where your imagination is the only thing that can stop you. a game that would give newton a heart attack, (but like not in a bad way) make einstein doubt everything, and a game thats like less than half minecrafts price. so buy this game! cause it is so so so so so sooooooooooooooo worth your $10, (depends if its like on sale or something)",92.1

"a game to play with your friends. it has a great multiplayer aspect you cant get out of another game. hundreds of gamemodes from betraying your friends in trouble in terrorist town to building a sled and beating random people online in sled race. this game has hundreds and hundreds of hours of fun and you wont be disappointed. this is a sandbox game made for everyone and their mother! ten dollars is a steal for this game and it is one of the best game you will ever play.",502.9
"omg! all of thees gamemodes (ok not all)are awesome! dis game is a ceeper",257.1

"i did not like the game. its kinda boring in my opinion.",0.7
"it is a really fun game (better with add-ons). its more for people with a creative mind but also fun to play around in. with many gametypes the possiblities are practically endless (if i had to rate it i`d give it 4.5-5 stars",993.5

"this game is essentially the minecraft of stupidity. and thats perfect. 9.6/10 - not necessarily for everyone. has plenty of user-created content, is reasonable in price, and is overall just a great sandbox to play around in. it takes some skill-learning at first, but once you get a hang of it possibilities are pretty much endless.",22.3

"its a good game over all just alot harder to understand on what to even do and how to make different things. i mostly just spawn medics and helpers and kill enemys the whole time. what i dislike about it is the need for other games just so you can play on other servers or make and use different things in your own world. 7/10",11.5

"i highly recommend this game, due to its great multiplayer, hilarious physics, and decent graphics. it is fun to play singleplayer, but even more fun to play multiplayer. the only downside to multiplayer is the server restrictions. some servers have huge restrictions that make the server boring and no fun to play on, while other servers allow you to do whatever you please. another reason i recommend this game is the mods. mods dont ruin the fun like mods in some other games. but instead, the mods enhance the singleplayer, and multiplayer if the server owner is running them. overall, if i were to give this game a rating, it would be an 8.5/10. the game is really enjoyable.",305.2
