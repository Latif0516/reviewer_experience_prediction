"this is one of those games that, if you have steam, you have to get it. its like a million games at once. cs:s reccomended to get some textures.",80.3
"as someone who plans on getting all the achievements (planning & doing are 2 different things) i cannot recommend this game because of the achievement for playing for 1 year. not owning the game, but having it open for 8760 hours. you can say you could leave it on, but then i cant play my other steam games. leaving a computer on overnight for multiple nights without a break can cause damage to your computer. this achievement screams a certain arrogance from the developer that he thinks his game is worth at least 8760 hours of gameplay, which it isnt, since no game is worth that amount of time to an average person. until the developer fixes this my review stands.",15.2

"this game is so much fun! with the stock stuff you can build anything from a car to a spaceship! then there are thousnads of addons you can add with one click that add so much to the game like a gun that shoots nyan cat or a car that leaves a trail of lols behind you. then there is the online gamemodes like prop hunt that is like hide and seek only you hide as a object like a sofa or soda can. overall, get the game cuz its even more fun w/ friends. probably my favorite game",77.7

"if youre one of those people like me who enjoy a nice sandbox game in between stomping on goomba and saving hyrule, then garrys mod is the game for you. originally a mod of the half-life series, garrys mod combines first person shooting and minecraft. not only can you enjoy a good firefight with your friends, you can even design the map you fight on! with multiple game modes including sandbox, prop hunt, trouble in terrorist town, and death run, garrys mod will never get old. at only fifteen dollars this is a great value and will rack up hours on your steam account. between me and my handful of steam friends we have racked up at least a couple hundred hours on this game. if you are looking for a time waisting sandbox game then garrys mod is the game for you.",20.9
"this game is amazing. it allows you unlimited activity and you can download about all of the freakin mods/addons on the workshop. also you can make your own things and let other people check them out. more reasons to get this game: you can get just about any source engine game and put the content into this game, its fun, sandbox, no goals, hundreds of gamemodes and millions of servers, endless amounts of addons, and just about anything you want! you can make cool screen shots, just check my profile or someone elses because if they have gmod they probily have a lot of screen shots.

"one of the best sandbox games ive played i definately recomend~!",7.5
"brilliant mod, not even a game, that has it strong pros and minor cons. gameplay: its a sandbox. install maps and stuff from the workshop, and watch hours fly by. 10/10 replay: achievements exist for how long youve played. 9.5/10 graphics: half-life 2ish. unless you have cs:s or hl2, the graphics dont work so good on some maps and objects. 8/10 sound: base sound is okay. sound mods from the workshop make it a joy. 8/10 music: non-existant. play the radio in the backround, you gamer. radio mods exist? 2/10 overall, addicting as heck. install a ton of mods and have fun alone or with friends. the games lack of music makes it seem incomplete. not a major factor, but efficiant. 9/10",499.4
"i love garrys mod because it can be anything you want from sandbox to roleplay. i have currently played garrys mod for 585 hours. i certainly recomend this game to any and all people.",633.7

"i reccomed this title its fun what else can i sya?",99.2
"an excellent game by an excellent publisher. garrys mod is a special game and the only steam game that i have played in which there is no goal. the fact you can add stuff from other game (e.g. team fortress 2, counter strike: global offensive) is an awesome feature. pros -workshop -fairly good detail -interesting build -servers -not a stupid price of 39.99 -sandbox cons -often glitches -missing texture -workshop spammed with junk -updates usually introduce more bugs other than that, this game is great. overall i personally would rate this game; 9/10",244.0
"i wish this game had physical copies so i could literally throw them in the garbage.",28.9
"incredible levels of customization (as expected from a mod), joined together with an awesome and creative community, make this game incredibly fun to play and create levels on. the source engine is awesome, and visually its very similar to half-life 2. overall an awesome game that definitely deserve the attention it recieves.",100.1
"garrys mod is an awesome game.and im already mod on a server so this game is the best so far no lag at all",918.4
"10/10 game for little kid raging for rdm. great game overall, lots of addons and gamemodes. lets you test your imagination",321.0
"lots of issues and bugs since gmod 13, i can not recommend it unless you torrent it to see if it glitches on your pc before you get it. if you do try it before you buy it, its a great game.",288.7
"garrys mod is a very entertaining game. i dont know why, it just is. no matter what type of person you are, it will suit your needs. like fighting? spawn some zombies or get trouble in terrorist town! like driving? they have cars already built for you, or you can build your own. like building random stuff? they have an unlimited sandbox for you to play with, and if you dont like the props they give you, you can download more!",12.4
"this one time i crushed my friend with the force of a speeding bathtub launched from a trainstation turnstile. gameofthedecade/10",201.5
"this game is fun because in ttt, someone kills you but then you kill someone and get vote kicked for rdm. wtf, that is so stewpid yo. but other stuff like prop hunt is fun, though i wish i could disguise as a  and hide im your moms room. lol, that is funny. anyways, you should buy this game unless you dont have counter strike source, cause then, your game will be purple and crap, and error will be the only word you know.",77.4
"10/10 will minge again not a single thing wrong with this game. if you think something is wrong, its probably you thats wrong.",904.2

"this is a very good game, recommend it to anyone who likes sandbox games to mess around in, and has diffrent game plays too!",5.9
"i definitly reccomend this game! its one of my most played games on steam and its super cheap. if you have some friends to play gmod with it will be worth every f-ing penny, but if you want to play this by yourself it might turn a bit rage-quity on ttt :p 10/10",210.2
"with the sandbox mode, fun multiplayer modes, and the steam workshop this game is just endless stupid fun",586.4

"endless game. for those of you who cant figure, its a sandbox thats really powered by the community. people upload their mods and addons, and you can download them for free. never gets old 10/10 (p.s. id personally reccommend to get the cs:s/gmod bundle if youre going to try out prop hunt, as most maps and textures can only be used if you own that)",34.3
"if you have a small screen resolution, dont play it. if you have a big one, play it. you must. such a fun game to mess around with. epic game 10/10",5.5
"this is a game for you guys who like to create stuffs and just lol around, in my opinion this game will get a 5 of 5 starts cause of all the mods you can get. it is really funny when you get involved in this game, well this was my ratings, :)",388.8
"if you have ever had the desire to build and script items, weapons, buildings, gamemodes, vehicles, etc. this is the game for you! you have complete freedom to build what you want, how you want, and where you want (some skill required). play with your friends online, building whacky contraptions or you can switch things up and play an alternative gamemode! please note this game is absolutely not fun if you do not own a source game. picking up hl2 would be your best bet since most mods use that source.",231.9
"out of every single game i have ever played and ever will play, i have never seen anything more original than any other game. with its huge online community and near infinite modes, i doubt i could ever get bored with this game. if you could get one game in your whole life, get this one!",72.0

"i know you know that game that is made for playing with friends and ing around. this game is better. like around 70% better. garrys mod or as called gmod is just and anwesome game. it consists more mods than can be counted and more. there is always someone playing it. and there is creativeness andd skill in playing this. if skype is used while playing gmod then the laughter and thrill never stops and when the laughter ever stops is when the thrill rockets. amazing game. 52/10. worth the $10.",85.6
"great game. its a lot of fun to play with friends or even alone. murder and trouble in terrorist town are some of the best games ive ever played. and ive been playing games for a long time.",32.6
"this game shows the fact that creativity is must for all games these days. the pure ability to let your mind run free in this game makes it a 10/10 for me because it is so great. except for trying out a plugin and i need half life 2 or cs:go but it is still a great game",622.8
"if you are ready to see the strangest  you will ever see it is well worth 10 bucks.",1704.8
"garrys mod, where to start? oh yeah, its amazing! playing privatly with friends is as good as playing with randoms in public! only $10s. if you dont want errors and missing textures, counterstrike source will be a good investment! takes them all away 4 an extra $15 more! it has the word, mod in it and surely does it have a lot of them! so many fun mods from twerking to spiderman guns! a must buy and if you must, wait for its sale! $2.50! they must be out of their minds! final verdict: do i recommend this game, yes! anyone who isnt sure if you should spare their time on this, it is very addictive and is the best mod 4 half-life 2. ive invested a 260+ hours on it and you should too!",294.8

"its a very good game. but there is one tiny little problem. if you have a lot of addons, when it starts up, the title screen will freeze judging on how many addons you have (well, for me). but other than that, i would rate it 10/10! :d",869.4

"yes i recommend gmod all fo the players out there its a real run game and i know i have fun on it",756.8
"game is definitely worth. very cheap game, aswell as a very fun game to play by yourself and with friends. not very graphic heavy but can lag at sometimes. too many gamemodes to list and easy to mod and work with (such as creating a gamemode or server). game is worth $10.00 and i would rate this 9.5/10.",2371.5
"if someone plays this game and doesnt fall in love with it, cannot be a fun gamer at all. why? because you can do and be pretty much anything you imagined! cant get a job in real life but want one even on a digital world? go play darkrp. always imagined to do a thrilling and killer hide and seek hiding as normal objects you see everyday? then prop hunt is for you. is your dream to be a guard and prevent prisioners to escape or vice-versa? go have fun on jailbreak. have you ever wanted to be a serial killer and kill everyone with you without being shot? murder is the game for that. and list goes on and on with endless choices! i tell you if you dont have the money right now wait for a sell, where the game becomes really cheap. 10/10 fun and derpyness never end!",88.8

"well,im recommend this cuz,well,everyone like hl2 rigth? how about messing up with hl2 objects and characters?! garrys mod is not really a game,cause its uses things from hl2 and other games that use source engine. but the most coll part is the add-on. no,seriously,everyone can make a add-on for gmod. add-ons arent just mods,they can be buildings,maps,ect & etc.the multiplayer is not thaaaaaaaat good,but its pretty fun when playing with friends in sandbox mode. well,i recommend this game for those player that like to have fun with source(ps:never,never,play a server in a sandbox mode,it has a ton of useless add-on that dosent work.)",111.6

"since the advent of the steam workshop, this game has become a massive bugfest that seems to get worse with each update. i kid you not, every session ive played in the last few months ends with it crashing. workshop subcriptions randomly work and dont work, and multiplayer is no fun at all -- every other player is a child and server requirements from the workshop and other sources is not worth the time and effort to download. this game used to be great and in my experience very stable, peaking around the introduction of toybox, but now it barely functions. also linux support is a joke. requires editing python script just to get your content to mount and the devs seems to express no interest in making it work better.",235.9

"the best sandbox game there is for a rediculous cheap price. you can do almost anything in this game, because there is so much community content that lets you play for many hours. be sure to also get other source games like counter-strike: source, this will give you even more textures and model to play with in garrys mod. you can even play the half-life 2 story in garrys mod with access to all the stuff you downloaded from the garrys mod workshop.",617.2

"so much comic, and violence. it has amazing graphics, and many add-ons. this game is basically life in a pc game. it stars all hl, hl2, cs:s, dod:s, etc. characters. altho, the npcs are not as realistic as the original hl 2 characters, but they do back you up when you need it. 10/10",566.3
"one of the best sandbox games i have ever played! works best if you have css textures :d",1331.5
"garrys mod is a fantastic game, and in my experience (albiet a short one compared to most other people that have it) has been a fantastic one. if you can think it, you can do, build, create it. garrys mod is one of the few games that is only limited by your own imagination, and thats why i love it. in fact calling it a game is an understatement, its a whole world of its own, its what you make of it. i have experienced very few errors in the game, and the ones that i have experienced were so minute that it hardly affected the gameplay in any way. it is a truly remarkable title and i highly recommend it to anyone and everyone.",46.9
"i would suggest this game for those who love to play around with models, build inventions, and even make some workshop items. what i do that is more fun in garrys mod is how theres no actual point to the game its just you the player doing whatever you want. multiplayer is obviously recommended because the more friends in your game the better!",1182.4

"remember how mgs5:gz was only an hour long for $25 but kojima was up front about it? well garry`s mod sells you a game and then after you have spent your money breaks the news that all of the multiplayer games and a  of maps and mods require counter strike source. what if i dont wants cs:s huh! did you ever think that i dont want cs:s! and if you dont have it i hope you like pink and black squares.  this game its well made but the devs will put a banhammer on any texturepacks for cs:s and constantly release un-finished patches which further bug the game! and then after all that they con you out of your money",49.3
"i love this game very much. its like a minecraft, except its not as pixelated as it is. the gamemode is a actually a lot similar to other games except you can add your own things and create however you want it to be set up. by so far, this game is the easiest game and has the most entertaining gamemodes ive ever played.",1488.9
"this is a fantastic sandbox game. with several of its amazing features. from ragdoll posing to making a combine survival. however, the only flaw i genuinely see is that when i have several addons they seem to conflict with my source game material, with a few glitches here and there, its entirely plausible its just my game however, this game will still provide a large amount of enjoyment.",918.8
"its a decent game unless you have no one to play with and the community sucks. most of the time i had more fun playing by myself spawning in the bad guys and watching the npc all die.",30.2
"i would recommend this game to anyone who is bored in garrys mod you can do everything you like: sandbox trouble in terrorist town hide and seek garrys horror prop hunt stop it slender and much more if you are bored this is the game for you (btw you can spawm watermelons <3 )",151.7

"garrys mod was the best sandbox game that i play but you need some games to pay",99.6
"why are you reading this? go play the game. all you need is 10.00$. all your source games are jammed into one world of creation. you can build stuff, make contraptions, make hilarious animations,play the multiplayer modes (which are so much fun with friends) such trouble in terrorist town, dark rp, and prop hunt. you might not play non-stop like skyrim, but this is someone you can get addicted to like tf2. i give garrys mod 9.3/10.",777.0
"overall, this game (garrys mod) is fun and exiting for all ages. one of the best game modes in my opinon is, trouble in terriost town, also known as ttt. there are so many game modes on garrys mod and theyre all uniqe in their own way. for me, the least fun is sandbox but i reccomend ttt.",1367.1

"the perfect game for someone who generally likes to piss about and have a laugh with their friends, and people who like to get down and make something very productive. main problem with gmod? it has to be the prop-pushers and griefers. not many problems with the actual game, endless amount of community addons so the game never gets old. 8/10",180.1

"its a shell of its former self. missing tools, a smaller amount of props that comes with the game, and the terrible mistake that is the steam workshop, its very disappointing what is game has become. garrys mod is not the same game i remember playing a few years ago. oh, and the community around this game is the only thing that has gone down hill faster than the game.",553.0

"played this game as a kid and loved it, i played dark rp, flood, and zombie survival all the time. now, with all the thousands of updates, its like you literally have to dumb yourself down to play this game. i dont mind the kids, the adults are the problem, theyre the most  of them all. the new noclip animation makes you look like your getting pounded in the  mid-air, and i dont even know why they would update the maps. too many employees that need to be paid? anyways, i occasionally like randomly killing people in ttt and being a cop in darkrp. thats about it though.",368.4
"it is difficult to explain, what you can do in this game, because its more like a plattform for player made minigames. based on the engine your beloved games like half life 2, portal and counterstrike source are running, you can do everything, you can imagine with editors. i personally played a game called ttt, where a group of players are spawned into an area with weapons and one unknown person from the group has to eliminate all the others. its a great social experiment and a great game about trust and paranoia. g-mod can provide you with a big load of different mini game types, all made by players. just try it out and find a group activity, you like.",152.8
